Obama: States should require kids stay in school until 18 or graduation
By Valerie Strauss
President Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address that he wants states to change their laws to require that all students be required to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18 years old.
The age at which students can legally leave school varies in the states, though most have set the minimum drop-out age at 16 or 17. There are already about 15 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have set their dropout age at 18. They include Florida and Virginia. Maryland allows students to drop out at 16. “We also know that when students aren’t allowed to walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma,” he said in the State of the Union. “So tonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn eighteen.”
In most countries, the age that students are allowed to leave school is the same as their minimum age for full-time employment.
Obama has set as a goal that by 2020 all adult Americans would have committed to at least one year of higher education or career training and America would have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That isn’t going to happen, given the pace of the increase in high school graduation, according to a 2011 reported called “Building a Grad Nation,” (issued by Civic Enterprises, the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and America’s Promise Alliance).
The report says that the national graduation rate increased from 72 percent in 2002 to 75 percent in 2008. But it also says this:
“The pace is too slow to meet the national goal of a 90 percent high school graduation rate by 2020. We must calibrate our educational system to the greater demands of the 21st century through a Civic Marshall Plan to make more accelerated progress in boosting student achievement, high school graduation rates, and college- and career-readiness for our nation to meet national goals and fulfill the promise of the next generation.”

Capitals need to break their bad habits
By Katie Carrera
Unlike when the Capitals struggled last season, there is a different feeling about this stretch of 10 games as they’ve gone 3-6-1. These losses can’t really be boiled down to bad bounces, unfortunate or uncontrollable circumstances. Many of these defeats have been a product of Washington’s bad habits. While it is November and the Capitals are without Mike Green (strained right groin muscle), they need to find a way to get things on track, or at least a way to not look bewildered in the face of adversity the way they did as Winnipeg surged against them Thursday night.
“Some games we’ve been losing battles and losing games and some games we’ve been winning them and losing games,” Karl Alzner said. “Sometimes you just can’t put it together. It’s five, six minutes, 10 minutes of bad hockey or not-good-enough hockey and teams are beating us. “I don’t know if that’s maybe because we started out the way we did and teams are always really amped up to play us and they always give us one of their best games,” Alzner continued. “I don’t know if that has something to do with it, or if it’s just completely our fault that we’re not doing it. Obviously we got a bit of a reality check here: Three in a row and terrible in the last 10 games. We’ve got to figure it out — soon.”
The negative traits seem a consistent refrain at this stage — turnovers in all three zones, a failure to outwork opponents and win battles for loose pucks and untimely penalties, all coupled with an inability to count on their offense.
After a strong performance Tuesday in Nashville slipped away due to lapses, Dennis Wideman spoke of learning defensive lessons and taking a page from the Predators and New Jersey Devils. But on Thursday in Winnipeg, the Capitals team that lost to the Jets looked nothing like the club that put forth what was largely a strong effort in its own zone only two days earlier.
Asked about some of the commonalities seen in their recent losses, Brooks Laich said the Capitals must turn their focus to defense.
“We’re certainly not playing very well. We have a lot of work to go, a lot of room to improve, but when you’re struggling you’ve got to strip your game down to the basics,” Laich said. “Start with your defensive play, start with strong defensive games. Little things that matter; blocking shots, playing solid in our D zone, working hard and from that everything else will stem.”

Donald Trump’s Newsmax debate — Rick Santorum’s dream
By Alexandra Petri
Me and You, Just We Two. (Santorum, in this photo, is invisible, as usual.) (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)
(Seth Wenig - AP)
This Donald Trump-Newsmax-ION Television debate deal is getting worse all the time. Or looked at from another perspective, Donald Trump is making Rick Santorum’s wildest dreams come true.
The only top-tier candidates currently showing up to the Newsmax-ION Television Trump-moderated debate? Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. This is everything Santorum ever dreamed of, with the possible exception of that horrible nightmare about “man-on-dog.” Consider: a debate between the current frontrunner and Rick Santorum, moderated by a celebrity, in which Santorum will only be relegated to the podium on the end because there are only two podiums available to begin with. A debate where he will have ample time to talk. A debate that people will be watching, even if only in the hope of hearing someone say, “You’re fired.” This is the only way Rick Santorum was even going to meet Donald Trump, let alone leap onto the national stage. Usually, to be heard at a debate, he has to fight his way through several miles of thick underbrush that separate the Outer Rim Podiums from the main debate. By the time he arrives, he is irritable and thirsty and yells at Mitt Romney. Then the camera pans away from him for an instant, everyone forgets that he exists, and he has to start all over. This is Rick Santorum’s big shot. He has gone passionately on the record about how excited he is for the debate: “Many of my opponents jockeyed to be the first to fly up to New York and use Donald Trump for a photo op and no doubt try and secure an endorsement. But when Donald wants to moderate a debate – they refuse to attend. That’s what’s so wrong with politics today – hypocrisy.” The fact that people were seeking Trump’s endorsement in the first place is a separate problem. Santorum continued: “At this critical time in our nation’s history, just weeks before Iowan’s cast this important vote – many of the other candidates want to hide behind TV ads and mail pieces.” (Santorum does not plan to do this because, well, he cannot afford TV ads and mail pieces. His current campaign strategy consists of ringing people’s doorbells and asking politely if they would mind if he fixed himself a sandwich.) “We plan to be there front and center in person to debate Newt directly, and if it’s just the two of us, we’re fine with it.” So fine. Really, really fine! Great! Magnificent, even! Thank you, Santa!
Sure, Newt Gingrich is showing up, because, hey, he’s Newt Gingrich. Herman Cain has passed along the Honey Badger mantle in the debates to him: He don’t care! He’s the great unruffled owl at the center of the discussion, gamely commenting on all sorts of subjects and forcing his staff to stay up late rewriting all his policy positions. But it may well be just the two of them. Rick Perry declined. Give Rick Perry a chance to say no to being involved in a debate, even if the debate is moderated by a man who resembles a heavily medicated woodchuck, and Rick Perry will take it.
Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and even Ron Paul have declined, citing unspecified reasons or coughing into their sleeves and muttering “ION Television? What do you think I am, a Criminal Minds re-run?” This initially made me feel somewhat sanguine. The field may not be a joke after all, I murmured reassuringly to myself. Now that Cain’s out, everyone is putting on a straight face and taking a serious approach to the policy challenges of our time!
Then I saw the most recent Rick Perry ad, the one where he says that Obama has put gays in the military but won’t let our children pray in schools or have Christmas. This is not a joke. Well, it is a joke, but it’s real.
Perhaps reports of the death of the joke campaign were slightly exaggerated. Meanwhile, Gingrich made fun of those who weren’t planning to show up. “If you’re afraid to debate with Donald Trump, people are going to say, ‘so you want me to believe you can debate Barack Obama but you’re afraid to show up with Donald Trump’?” Yes, actually. If you want to be considered ready to debate Barack Obama, the last thing you want is to show up with Donald Trump. It’s embarrassing enough to be seen debating with Rick Perry. But don’t tell Santorum that. He’s much too excited. By	Alexandra Petri

Washington Post Staff Writer

After decades of digging into the Church of Scientology, reporters and editors at the St. Petersburg Times are accustomed to being denounced by its leaders.
But they find it unsettling that three veteran journalists -- a Pulitzer Prize winner, a former "60 Minutes" producer and the former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors -- are taking the church's money to examine the paper's conduct.
Although the journalists have promised an independent review, the Times has refused to cooperate, saying their work will be used to fuel the church's ongoing campaign against the Florida paper.
"I ultimately couldn't take this request very seriously because it's a study bought and paid for by the Church of Scientology," says Executive Editor Neil Brown. "Candidly," he adds, "I was surprised and disappointed that journalists who I understand to have an extensive background in investigative reporting would think it's appropriate to ask me or our news organization to talk about that reporting while a) it's ongoing, and b) while they're being paid to ask these questions by the very subjects of our reporting."
Steve Weinberg, the former IRE executive who has taught at the University of Missouri's journalism school for a quarter-century, says he was paid $5,000 to edit the study and "tried to make sure it's a good piece of journalism criticism, just like I've written a gazillion times. . . .For me it's kind of like editing a Columbia Journalism Review piece."
He says their agreement requires that the church publish the study in full, if it decides to make it public, but that "the contract says the church has the right to do nothing with it except put it in a drawer." That means Scientology leaders have an out if the recently completed study isn't to their liking.
Weinberg acknowledges that the "unusual situation" gave him pause, saying: "It certainly wouldn't be something just any reporter would do. My role was more limited, and I can certainly use the money these days."
Church spokesman Tommy Davis says he recently received the approximately 20-page study and that it will not necessarily be made public. It was commissioned, he says, because "we wanted to get an outside view" of the situation. Davis, who would not disclose how much the reporters were paid, calls the report highly critical of the Times stories on the church.
Asked about Brown's view that the study could not possibly be objective, Davis says: "It's easy for the St. Pete Times to pop off and say that, but oh, please. It's a normal thing. It's done all the time." He likened the effort to CBS hiring an outside panel to investigate Dan Rather's 2004 story on George W. Bush and the National Guard, which the network later retracted. That report was a self-examination, however, and was made public.
The reporters hired for the study are Russell Carollo, who won a 1998 Pulitzer for the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News for a series on medical malpractice in the U.S. military, and Christopher Szechenyi, an Emmy-winning former television producer who has worked for the Boston Globe's Web site.
Asked about taking on the assignment, the two chose to respond in a joint statement Sunday. "We were hesitant," they said. "That's why we insisted on being paid in full before we started our work, total editorial independence and having someone with the reputation of Steve Weinberg involved. Every entity has the right to receive fair treatment in the press."
As for accepting payment from the church, they said: "We were as objective in doing this job as we were in pursuing all the other assignments we've done for news organizations during the past 25 years."
