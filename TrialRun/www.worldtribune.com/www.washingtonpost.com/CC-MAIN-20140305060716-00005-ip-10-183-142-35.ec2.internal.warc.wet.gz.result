John Wall says Wizards will make playoffs next season
By Dan Steinberg
After the Wizards beat the Celtics on Monday night in their home finale, John Wall told reporters that playoffs are the goal in 2012. In his post-game interview with Comcast SportsNet’s Chris Miller, the rookie was a bit more declarative.
“Next year’s gonna be a lot better,” Wall said. “Us maturing, us being healthy, us got guys that want to fight. That’s all we wanted to do is just come out here and get a win on our last home-court game, and just come out next year and have a better season. And we’re gonna be in the playoffs, that’s for sure.”
Then Wall was asked the fans who stuck with the team.
“Thank you so much, man,” he said. “Just keep supporting us. We know it’s a tough time, being injured. I think I would have had a better year without being injured, some of my teammates would have did better. “But we just have to trust each other, and it’s a rebuilding process. And I love my coaching staff, I want them to be here next year. I love our general manager, and Ted Leonsis, the owner. He told me before, it’s gonna take learning experience time. And everybody just stick with us. It’s gonna get better.”

Parking lots an example of Fairfax schools’ economic gap
(Jahi Chikwendiu/ The Washington Post ) - Samuel Hall Sr. directs student drivers out of Langley High School's student parking lot after school is dismissed on Thursday in McLean.
CAPTION
By T. Rees Shapiro, E-mail the writer
The annual fees students pay for parking spaces at Fairfax County’s high schools provide thousands of dollars principals can use to purchase such classroom enhancements as iPads and computers, but school records show that the county’s poorest students are most often shortchanged because their schools make far less in parking money.
County schools take in more than $1 million a year in student parking fees, and some high schools make more than $10,000 annually from the revenue. But other schools in poorer areas of the county make as little as $465, leaving them with far less discretionary cash. More news about educationD.C. charter officials seek to keep Options open

SAT revisions follow years of gains for ACT test
Nick Anderson The SAT college admissions test will face a challenge in attracting students who are choosing the rival exam.
Prince William may add three days to school year Michael Alison Chandler What do you think? What’s the best — or least bad — way to make up for lost time? Read more
“There’s some things I wish we had that I could provide with extra revenue,” said Nardos King, principal of Mount Vernon High School near Alexandria, where more than half of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a measure of poverty. “I just wish it didn’t always come down to those who can afford it and those who can’t. It’s quite clear that my parking lot is empty for a reason.”A parking tag for the school year costs $200, and some students are eligible for subsidies. High school principals keep 15 percent of the fees, or $30 for each space sold. On average, schools earn $7,400 each year from parking revenue, money that typically goes to purchase technology — such as interactive whiteboards — or security upgrades.Schools that make less obviously have less to spend. School board member Pat Hynes (Hunter Mill) said that can create an unfair disadvantage.“It creates a potential equity problem,” Hynes said. “That’s a source of revenue that some schools have and others don’t. . . . It’s a good example of what we’re up against in terms of the disparity in the community and lack of resources across the county.”That disparity is easy to see in the county schools’ parking lots.Wealthier schools, with students whose families can afford cars and the fees, sell out their parking spaces. At some schools, parking spots are in such high demand that dozens of students sign up for waiting lists or park in overflow lots.At James Madison High School in Vienna, students who miss out on a school space can pay to park at a nearby Elks lodge. Administrators at Langley High School in McLean, where about 2 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, said that the school earned $13,890 last year in parking fees.Poorer schools sell virtually no spots, according to data obtained by The Washington Post. Mount Vernon earned $465 in parking revenue last year — less than the cost of one new iPad Air.Joan Daly, president of the Falls Church High School Parent, Teacher, Student Association, said it is unfortunate that schools with a higher ratio of poor students take the biggest hit.At Falls Church, where 57 percent of the students qualify for subsidized meals, the administration sold 68 of 120 parking spaces as of Oct. 15. Because some of the spaces are subsidized, the parking fees brought in about $1,600 to the school.“There are so many examples where things are not equitable,” Daly said, pointing out that other PTSAs in the county are well-funded with donations from wealthy families. “It’s something we can’t compete with.”Mount Vernon senior Kimberly Mertens said she parks in the neighborhood near school so she can avoid paying for a space.“It’s crazy — there’s no need to pay $200,” said Mertens, 17. But where she pays a price is with her time — there is a daily rush to find street parking, Mertens said. “If you’re late, then you’re out of luck.”Mount Vernon senior Maddie Pessel, 17, said that parking in the neighborhood surrounding the school brings the risk of costly parking tickets. Pessel’s parents decided to help her cover the $200 parking fee so she didn’t have to spend more time in the mornings looking for parking.“Having a spot guarantees I don’t have to panic to get to school on time,” said Passel, one of a handful of Mount Vernon students who pay to park there.Fairfax Schools Superintendent Karen Garza said the disparity in parking revenue is a problem that mirrors similar issues throughout the county.“Some of our schools have greater ability to generate additional revenue to support their schools in many areas, not just parking,” Garza said, noting that PTSAs and booster clubs can raise thousands of dollars in their communities, something that often benefits wealthier areas. “That’s a reality everywhere.”Garza said that the school system aims to offset the problem by providing schools with higher populations of poor students, such as Mount Vernon, with other forms of funding.Although the parking fees make up a small fraction of the school system’s $2.5 billion annual budget, the school board faces a nine-figure shortfall next year and is considering additional student fees to help boost revenues. One of the options includes a $100 per-sport fee for students to participate in athletics, which finance officials said could bring in an additional $1.8 million.Student fees from parking, instrument rentals for music classes and tuition for programs added up to about $18.2 million in revenue, according to Fairfax schools budget documents. Last year, county schools collected $1,056,639 in parking revenue.Garza said that “everything is on the table” as the school system seeks to address the projected $140 million shortfall.Raising parking fees is not currently an option, Garza said, but it has been used by previous Fairfax administrations to help offset dwindling revenue.In 1991, the school system began charging $100 to students for parking “to partially offset a decline in revenue from state and local sources,” according to budget documents. In 2002, the fee was increased to $150, and in 2009, it was raised again to $200, which brought an additional $300,000 and was used to add 3.6 positions to the staffing rolls. Susan Quinn, the Fairfax schools chief financial officer, wrote in 2011 that raising the fees to $250 would likely bring in an additional $230,000.In other school districts, principals may keep a bigger portion of the revenue from parking. In Arlington County, the three high schools retain all parking fees. Washington-Lee and Yorktown high schools charge students $50 to park.In Montgomery County, the 25 high schools collected $195,368 in parking fees last year. Each school retains its own revenue to use for athletics expenses, schools officials said. In Loudoun County, the school system charges $200 a year for student parking; schools keep $25 from each permit; the rest, about $500,000 total per year, goes back to the central administration’s operating fund.Garza said that principals are given authority to wield their own budgets as they see fit.Matt Ragone, principal at Langley, said that in the past, he has used the parking money to purchase copy machines and textbooks.He also uses the funds to add staff to keep class sizes manageable, because “I can’t possibly have more kids in classrooms,” Ragone said.He said that he’d reluctantly support a more equitable distribution of the parking fees if it were part of a larger county plan to benefit the neediest schools. But Ragone said he’d prefer that the money raised at Langley stay at Langley.Chip Comstock, an assistant principal at Oakton High School, which expects to earn about $11,000 in parking fees this year, said that larger schools tend to have bigger parking lots and take in more revenue from the extra spaces.Two of the biggest, Robinson Secondary and Westfield High, each net more than $12,000 a year.“Should we pool the money? If I were a small school, I’d say yes,” Comstock said. “Should we keep more of the money? Sure, why not?”

With warmer winters, ticks devastating N.H. moose population
View Photo Gallery — With winters warming, moose are devastated by exploding tick populations: Tick eggs that once perished on snow-covered ground in northern states now survive in great numbers, tormenting moose and causing their populations to plummet. By Darryl Fears, E-mail the writer
It’s only a few weeks until the end of summer, a terrible time to be a moose in the New Hampshire wild.
Tens of millions of winter ticks are preparing to hatch next month from eggs hidden in thick brush. They will wait there to hitch a ride on a moose and suck its blood until the end of May. More health and science newsHave you used the new health insurance exchanges?

Slowing mind’s aging, one exercise at a time
Anna Gorman Program at UCLA helps elderly patients and their caregivers cope with what they have lost.
They can send a moose to its death, with up to 150,000 dining on every calf, cow and bull in certain parts of the Granite State, wildlife biologists estimate.There was a time when eggs laid in this age-old cycle perished on winter snow. But that hasn’t happened lately in New Hampshire, where a warming trend has winters starting later and ending sooner.A single female lays 3,000 eggs the size of salt crystals. With warmer weather, ticks don’t die, they multiply. Winter ticks are one-host parasites that feed on a single animal through their lifetimes. As the number of ticks explodes, moose have disappeared by the thousands in areas where they were most abundant. Many of those still alive are eerily thin, with rib cages visible through ragged skin. They are mere shadows of themselves, zombies with antlers.“It’s pretty depressing,” said Kristine Rines, a wildlife biologist and moose project leader for the state’s Fish and Game Department. “It’s a pretty tough way to go. There’s no question that climate plays a huge part in this. If we had winters that lasted as long as they used to, we might not be having this conversation.”New Hampshire’s struggle with moose is part of a nationwide trend, according to the Wildlife Management Institute, a nonprofit group established by sportsmen and businessmen concerned about wild populations. A rise in moose die-offs has been reported in Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming, other parts of the Rocky Mountains and a sliver of North Dakota. In Montana, Minnesota and North Dakota, it’s not clear that ticks are the entire problem, leaving scientists baffled over why so many moose have fallen. Only Maine, where colder winters and snow still kill ticks, is showing a population increase, with more than 75,000 in the state’s range. Moose are more than oafish creatures that lumber across the wilderness. They are the largest of the deer species, with bulls that top 1,800 pounds and grow antlers six feet wide.The impact of reduced moose populations reverberates through an ecosystem. Moose serve as walking lawn mowers, clearing brush and creating spaces for smaller species, such as rabbits and birds, to hide from predators. Moose also provide hearty meals for coyotes and bears; a single carcass can feed these animals for days. But loaded with ticks, they scratch until their fur falls off. They develop anemia and starve, Rines said. They eventually become so stressed from tens of thousands of tiny bites every minute and every day that they can’t eat even if food is handed to them. “They look terrible. Their body weights are down. They have secondary skin infections from multiple bites,” Rines said, and they lose so much fur that they freeze whenever the weather manages to turn cold.“In the central and White Mountain portion of the state where winters are short, we’ve seen a steady decline over the past five to seven years,” Rines said. The state’s moose population is about 4,500, at least 3,000 fewer than five years ago.New Hampshire Fish and Game’s Wildlife Journal magazine wrote about the moose die-off from tick infestation in 2011 under the headline “Ghost in the Woods.” Moose-watching tours generate $115 million yearly in New Hampshire, but operators say current tours last hours longer than in past years as they seek to spot a single moose. Minnesota’s moose mortality rate is so high that the state canceled its annual hunt in February. The decision followed a 35 percent decline in Minnesota’s moose population in a part of the state where it was strong, from 4,200 animals to 2,700 in a one-year survey that started in 2012. Wildlife officials in Minnesota kept coming across moose carcasses of all ages that haven’t been scavenged. Studies were inconclusive, but indicated that the problem was health-related. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources plunked down $1.2 million to study why the animals continue to die. Previous research showed Minnesota’s mortality rate was far higher than in other states. Over several years in the late 1990s and 2000, 8,000 moose disappeared in the state’s northeast and 4,000 vanished in the northwest. “I don’t think [ticks] are driving our decline,” said Erika Butler, a wildlife veterinarian for DNR who’s leading the study. “Our animals are in extremely poor body condition . . . but reproduction is high,” indicating that animals are strong enough mate and reproduce.So what’s happening between that time and when they drop dead? “A lot of folks suggest to us the brain worm parasite,” Butler said. But it could also be mosquito-related viruses or a fungus.This year, state wildlife officials caught 111 moose and fitted them with collars with gadgets that send text messages when moose keel over and die. The device has an accelerometer that measures movement. Scientists also opened the mouths of the animals and dropped in a transmitter that goes directly to the stomach and measures body temperature and the heartbeat. As soon as the animal’s vital signs indicate it has died, a text message is sent.Of the captured moose, 18 have died. Three deaths were caused by ticks, some moose were eaten by predators, and others are still being studied.“We’re studying every piece of their body [with] field necropsies. Every organ you can name: eyeballs, brain, liver,” Butler said. A “moose fleet” — helicopters, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles — rush to fresh bodies “so we can get the carcasses out whole,” she said.Minnesota’s winters are colder than New Hampshire’s, where the cause of moose mortalities is certain. In New Hampshire, Rines said, when short winters allowed the tick population to thrive, “we had years where almost none of the calves survived and only 25 percent of adults.” New Hampshire recently launched a $695,000 study of its moose population. In 2001, the state first saw problems that led to the first remarkable die-off. “Since then, it’s been an uphill battle against them,” Rines said of the ticks. “Our winters have gotten unfortunately more reliably short.”At 400 pounds, moose calves aren’t lightweights. But “those animals would have to replace their blood volume” while hosting 100,000 ticks in winter when food is scarce, Rines said. Reprints
