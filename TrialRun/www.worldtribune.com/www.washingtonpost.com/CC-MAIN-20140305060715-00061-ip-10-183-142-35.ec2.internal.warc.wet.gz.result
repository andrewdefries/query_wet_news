More Caps bar coming to H Street	By Dan Steinberg	February 5 at 11:31 am More Comments
(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)
David McQuaid and Naveed Ashraf knew they wanted to open a sports-themed bar for their first joint venture. They just weren’t exactly sure what the theme would be.
“We were tossing around different themes, and one overriding interest that just kept coming up was a Caps bar,” McQuaid told me this week. “We knew we wanted to be a sports-themed bar, and outside of Chinatown, there’s just not a big [hockey] presence” in local bars.
And thus, the pending Sin Bin Sports Bar & Restaurant, which is scheduled to open on H Street NE in the District, possibly as early as June. My friend and colleague Neil Greenberg likes to make “Hockeytown!” quips every time anyone discusses a new hockey development in Washington, but this would be an appropriate usage. The idea of opening up a Caps-themed bar in Washington a decade ago would have been a joke; now, at the very least, it’s intriguing.
“Ultimately we’re going to be a Caps bar,” said McQuaid, a mid-30s D.C. native who, like Ashraf, is a Capitals fan. “We’ve had kind of mixed input on whether that’s a smart idea or not. … We did some nominal market research, and we were just thinking that if there’s any area that would support kind of a bottom-up effort for the Caps, it’d be H Street.”
Of course, the business won’t rely solely on Caps or hockey fans. They’re aiming to have a strong English Premier League presence, and will also broadcast all the other American sports you’d expect to find at a sports bar. (There are also plans to broadcast international events like the Cricket World Cup.) There will be three bars, a rooftop deck and around a dozen TVs in the 2,400 square-foot space, which Ashraf owns.
But McQuaid said it will be clear that this is a Caps bar. They’re hoping to bring some players out to the grand opening. They’re getting a custom-designed version of the horse-racing boardwalk game you’ve seen at Rehoboth, complete with Caps players riding the horses. And there will likely be other Caps-themed decorations and memorabilia.
“We’re going to try to make it known,” McQuaid told me. “There will be quite a few things that make it clear it’s a Caps bar.”
(Note: My pal Steve reminds me of Bugsy’s in Old Town, which is indeed a hockey hangout.)

‘Five challenges’ for Romney
By Jennifer Rubin
Mitt Romney announced he will deliver a speech at Ford Field in Detroit on Feb. 24, two day’s after the only February debate and four days before the Michigan and Arizona primaries.
It makes sense on multiple levels. It’s the sort of big event a frontrunner can mount. If his debate performance is weak, he has a chance to change the topic; if it is strong he can build on the momentum. It also signals to Rick Santorum, who reportedly will focus on Michigan, that this is home field advantage for Romney.
So what should he say? (Earlier today I made some suggestions to Rick Santorum, so it’s only fair I do the same for Romney.) By now almost every voter knows his resume. But he needs to answer two fundamental questions: What does he believe and what does he want to do?
As to the first, some biography is helpful if it is new and revealing. His Colorado speech gave us a peak: He believes in upward mobility, personal freedom and capitalism. He needs to explain why he does — because those things transformed his father’s life, his family’s future and the lives of all those people in companies he helped to start. And he, more than any candidate, understands why freedom of religion is vital and why an omnipresent state’s bureaucratic steamroller violates the central premises of our country. He might lift the veil a bit and explain how his faithful community and he specifically helped to mend lives.
Even more vital to his success is to succinctly set forth what he wants to do as president. He’s got tons of proposals but no theme. FDR had his four freedoms; Romney could use some analogous formulation. Maybe he can roll out “five promises” or “five challenges.” First: We must restart that great engine of prosperity, poverty prevention and upward mobility: The free market. That means end crony capitalism and encourage real capitalism. Adopt the Rep. Paul Ryan tax reform plan. Repeal Dodd-Frank and Obamacare. Evaluate every domestic policy by one measure: does it promote growth and employment? That means going after Davis-Bacon, passing right-to-work legislation and rolling back all regulations to December 31, 2008. He should come with a list of projects including the Keystone XL pipeline that will be approved for domestic energy development.
Second: We must limit government to avoid fiscal collapse and ensure future prosperity. He has plans to reform Medicare, spending and Social Security. He can promise to deliver them to Congress in the first 60 days of his term. He should be open to alternative ideas but be firm that no budget will be passed and no government operation past the current fiscal year will continue until Congress passes meaningful debt reduction (he can pick a dollar amount).
Three: America will lead from the front. We need to restore defense cuts, reset “reset” with Russia, make clear that the U.S. — and not Israel — will be responsible for elimination of an Iranian nuclear weapons program by military means if need be, win the war in Afghanistan and make certain that thugs and free people alike know we stand for democracy and human rights (and that there are penalties to be paid for trampling on either).
Fourth: We will respect the rule of law and the Constitution, in specifics and in spirit. That means accommodating free expression of religion, cleaning house at the Justice Department, appointing judges who adhere to the text and meaning of law and ending the campaign of demonization against groups and voices with whom the administration disagrees (in the case of the Obama team that means everyone from Fox News to the Chamber of Commerce). In short, his administration should vow to respect the law, its political opponents and civil society.
Fifth: We need to make opportunity, not equality of results, our focus. That means supporting school choice, requiring job training for unemployment-benefit recipients, promoting English immersion and ending government subsidization of ever more expensive college tuition.
Or, Romney could just say he’s the only candidate from the private sector, he never worked in D.C. and he’s the only one who can beat Obama. Really, it’s up to him to figure out how to win and not merely to guarantee his opponents lose.

Inside the Global Battle for Democracy” by William J. Dobson
By Eliot A. Cohen, William J. Dobson’s exploration of the contest between contemporary dictatorshipsand those who rebel against them is valuable because it offers a sober analysis of both sides.
Dobson traveled nearly 100,000 miles researching this book, which takes a close look at the face of modern authoritarianism in Russia, Venezuela and Egypt, with passing attention toChina and Malaysia. He concludes that dictators have become more selective in the restrictions they impose on their subjects and more cunning in their use of democratic guises to suppress opposition while still resorting to brutal means as needed.

Free admission Get ideas To be sure, an attentive reader of the news will find little new in Dobson’s account of how Vladi­mir Putin’s Russia uses a servile judiciary to squelch dissidents, or how Hugo Chavez has maintained his grip on power through demagogy and ruinously expensive handouts, or how Chinese technocrats stay dominant despite the ludicrous facade of a communist government in a capitalist society. But Dobson skillfully shows how similar themes shoot through these different authoritarian societies. Most interesting is his portrayal of the regimes’ opponents — the activists and young people, professionals and subversives — who have subverted control with varying degrees of success. Dobson pays particular attention to the doctrines of Gene Sharp, a scholar who has made a life’s work of thinking in hard-headed ways about the strategy of nonviolence. Dobson admires the work of the Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies, founded by young Serbs who struggled against the dictatorship of Slobodan Milosevic, which has taught the techniques of anti-authoritarian struggle to activists from around the world.Dobson is cautiously optimistic about what nonviolent struggle can do. In the early phases of the Arab Spring, he marveled at the largely peaceful revolutions that swept Tunisia and Egypt. He recognizes the increasing sophistication of the techniques of repression in countries such as Russia, Venezuela, China and Iran, but suggests that the balance in the long run favors the opposition. This is so not because Twitter and Facebook have some miraculous solvent effect on truncheon-wielding riot police and corrupt judges, but because those who use the new social media are aware of alternatives to the systems in which they find themselves; they are increasingly intolerant of the regimes and savvier about how to undermine them.The problem in the Arab world, however, is what follows the overthrow of Pharoah. The business of constructing free governments is at least as difficult as shunting dictatorship aside.The challenge for Egyptian liberals is how to cope with the dominance of the Muslim Brotherhood, which may practice a form of tyranny that will prove more insidious and effective than the ossified regime of Hosni Mubarak. Nor can it be taken for granted that nonviolence will work. The resistance to Bashar al-Assad in Syria began with an extraordinary commitment to peaceful demonstration, but the rebels had to pick up arms to battle the hideous cruelty of a regime that has placed no limits on the violence it uses against its citizens. From the ensuing civil war it is hard to see how a decent, stable order can be created.The months of escalating violence, which have left tens of thousands dead and many more refugees in Turkey and Jordan, are a stark reminder that for a time, at any rate, snipers, helicopter gunships and torture basements beat social media and peaceful protests. Syria’s descent into a hell of massacre and proxy war — with Iran, Hezbollah, Russia and China siding with the regime and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and assorted jihadists attempting to overthrow it — reminds us that the old rules of civil conflict are, alas, not obsolete. At some point, in the face of violence without limits, rebels will throw away their copies of Sharp’s compelling books and pick up assault rifles and plastic explosives. At that point the gods of war, rather than the better angels of our nature, will have their way. For the United States, two conclusions may be drawn from Dobson’s book. The first is that a commitment to decent government and fundamental freedoms should play a role in the making of American foreign policy. The George W. Bush administration may be criticized for having weighted too heavily the conduct of elections, as opposed to all the underpinnings of decent government — rule of law, religious and civil liberties, freedom of speech and assembly, rights of women. One may even argue that in some ways the Bush administration retreated from its own “freedom agenda” in Egypt, for example, by failing to keep pressure on the Mubarak regime to change.The Obama administration, on the other hand, in its eagerness to distinguish itself from its predecessor, sought to work with authoritarian governments rather than encourage their opponents. How to develop and implement a freedom agenda that is practical and effective, and that does not involve a calamitous sacrifice of other interests, remains a challenge for U.S. foreign policy. The other conclusion is broader. Dobson describes a variety of ways in which the forms of free government can be sustained even as unscrupulous politicians or parties undermine or manipulate them. Nearly two centuries ago, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote that American habits and customs, no less than our institutions, have kept us free. Although Dobson does not write about democracy in America, his book reminds us that laws and institutions alone do not sustain free government, but that self-restraint on the part of those in public office and vigilance by citizens are also necessary. His book may be about the struggle for freedom of other countries’ citizens, but there are lessons in it for the preservation of our own.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Senators outline bipartisan deal reached on gun background checks
Video: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), along side Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), unveiled a bipartisan deal to expand background checks on all commercial sales of guns on Wednesday.
By Ed O’Keefe and Tom Hamburger, E-mail the writers
A pair of pro-gun senators announced a compromise plan Wednesday to expand background checks for many firearm purchases.
The proposal stopped short of the expansive system sought by President Obama and many gun-control advocates. But it won swift bipartisan backing and became the template for what would be the most consequential congressional action on firearm regulations since the 1990s — suddenly upending the polarized politics of gun control. In collaboration with

Philip Rucker First lady takes unusual step of speaking out in support of gun-control legislation going to a vote. Gun control advocates are celebrating. They might want to hold off.
Chris Cillizza and Paul Kane THE FIX | Why gun control advocates should fear the amendment process on the Senate gun bill.
Bloomberg signs off on Manchin-Toomey gun compromise
Aaron Blake The New York mayor and gun-control supporter says he will push hard for the bill.
It won praise from advocates of stiffer restrictions, including Obama and New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), reflecting the eagerness on that side of the debate to score concessions after months of intense opposition from the National Rifle Association.The NRA opposed the plan, which was offered by two lawmakers it had backed for years, Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). But an otherwise critical statement the NRA released after a Toomey-Manchin news conference cited “a positive development” in the move toward a background check system the group viewed as less intrusive than the one being pushed by Bloomberg and the White House.The Toomey-Manchin plan would extend the current background check requirement from covering only sales at licensed dealerships to any sale that takes place at a gun show or that was advertised in print or online. However, checks would not be required for many sales between private individuals — a loophole that many gun-control advocates had hoped would be closed. The proposal also would expand some gun rights. Gun dealers would be able to sell firearms across state lines, for example, and gun owners with state-issued permits to carry concealed weapons would be allowed to take their firearms through states that don’t allow concealed weapons. The senators also called for a national commission to evaluate causes of violence, including the entertainment industry’s role. The NRA has long recommended the gun rights expansions. And gun-control advocates, including the White House, appeared ready to accept such compromises in the name of a broader deal — effectively conceding that their hopes for universal background checks and bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines had proved unrealistic in the months since the Dec. 14 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., jump-started the gun debate.“This is not my bill, and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger,” Obama said in a statement Wednesday. “But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don’t have to agree on everything to know that we’ve got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence.”Toomey and Manchin’s appearance Wednesday followed weeks of negotiations. The Republican stepped into the mix in the final days when conversations with a GOP colleague, Sen. Tom Coburn (Okla.), stalled amid disagreements about whether an expanded check system would collect records about gun owners. Law enforcement officials say records are necessary to track criminal use of firearms, but many gun-rights activists consider them a threat to Second Amendment rights. The new proposal would require that all sales covered under a new system be recorded by licensed dealers.Toomey predicted that the plan would pick up support from conservative Senate and House Republicans. “Candidly, I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control,” he said. “I think it’s common sense.”Manchin said the plan would force both sides to make concessions. “All of them have to look at it and say: Listen, are the gun show loopholes closed? Absolutely,” he said. “Are Internet sales stopped from proliferating to a much larger degree? Absolutely. Did we create new law? No. We expanded on existing law. The things the NRA would love are in this bill.”The men have a delicate sales job ahead. Pro-gun lawmakers and the NRA could seek to block it or offer amendments to undermine the compromise, and some lawmakers were already vowing they would do so as the legislation begins to move later this week.Even if the measure were to pass the Democratic-led Senate, it would face stiff odds in the Republican-led House.The Senate is set to vote Thursday on a “motion to proceed” to consider a gun-control bill that will be offered by Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and eventually include the Toomey-Manchin proposal. Sixty votes are needed to overcome a filibuster threatened by some conservative Republicans, and supporters appear to have secured them.The push by Toomey and Manchin to carefully woo conservatives came into play even in the choreography of Wednesday’s announcement. Toomey asked Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not to appear at the news conference, and he consented, said several aides familiar with the talks. The conservative group Heritage Action criticized the bill and its GOP sponsor, issuing a press release Wednesday stating, “We expect more of Pat Toomey.”Coburn was critical, saying the plan would encourage criminals to find loopholes. “Why wouldn’t you just make an agreement to make the purchase later after the gun show?” Coburn asked.
Behind the scenes, gun industry advocates were divided and uncertain, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Despite the NRA’s opposition, “we are looking closely at this proposal and examining its merits,” said one longtime industry advocate, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Another, Richard Feldman, a former NRA political director and lobbyist for manufacturers, said he is “enthusiastically in support.”Late Wednesday, the NRA’s chief lobbyist wrote to members of the Senate restating opposition to the proposal and other “antigun” measures and vowing to review votes on those proposals and related procedural actions when evaluating a candidate’s suitability for NRA support. At the same time, a group recently formed by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly, promised to campaign against senators who try to block consideration of the legislation.
