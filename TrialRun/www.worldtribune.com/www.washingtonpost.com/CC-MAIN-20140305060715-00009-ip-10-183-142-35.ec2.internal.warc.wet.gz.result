Amid Detroit bankruptcy, residents grapple with poverty and unemployment
View Photo Gallery — Detroit’s half-century of steady decline: Once known as the “Paris of the West” and home to America’s bustling auto industry, Detroit filed for bankruptcy after fighting steady decline for half a century. By Zachary A. Goldfarb, E-mail the writer
DETROIT — Daniel Rice comes to the Michigan Works! job placement office almost every day for four or five hours, searching for a job he has had no luck finding in a city that has seemed in perpetual decline.
On Friday, he found one listing, operating a forklift for $8 to $9 an hour. He’d happily take the work, even though it pays a third less than he made building axles for Chrysler before his factory shuttered two years ago. He hasn’t been employed since.

More business news
“I put all my eggs in one basket,” said Rice, 39. “Just like Detroit put all its eggs on the auto industry.”The bankruptcy of Detroit on Thursday was a raw and discordant moment here, underscoring how dramatically the fortunes of the nation’s auto industry and the city with which it is synonymous have diverged.As automakers have claimed record sales and politicians have boasted about the rescue of Detroit, the real Detroit has suffered. The Big Three — two of them bailed out by taxpayers — employ fewer people and pay them less, leading to a better business model but far less value to the city’s people.Detroit has a 16 percent unemployment rate, and Michigan Works! was able to place only 2,300 workers into positions last year, a tiny fraction of those who walked through its doors seeking help. Many of those people can’t read at an eighth-grade level, the basic threshold for employment in the city.Those who are proficient enough to get a job in the auto capital of the world often struggle with transportation, given that they can’t afford a car and bus service has been cut back with Detroit’s budget problems. As Detroiters from all walks of life — the unemployed, the retired, the working — said in interviews Friday, Detroit’s bankruptcy could offer a fresh start. But, they say, it also raises the devastating possibility of a permanent financial stigma and could undermine one of the few areas of relatively stable employment in this city — government jobs — with pensions and benefits now at risk.Rice’s life in many ways encapsulates Detroit’s decline. While a previous generation of Detroiters could translate their high school degree into a good middle-class job, Rice’s today is worth only a little bit more than the minimum wage.He lives alone in East Detroit, in the house he grew up in, in a neighborhood where the vacant homes far exceed those that are occupied. And he has experienced one of Detroit’s most frightening problems: the extremely long wait times of 40 minutes to an hour for emergency services to respond. A teenager he knew well, he said, was shot through the jaw last year. The police did not come, “and the ambulance isn’t coming without the police. It’s too dangerous,” Rice said. The boy, 17, died.Although Rice is frustrated with his home town, he said he would never want to leave.“I love Detroit, but Detroit deserved to go bankrupt,” Rice said. “It’s like having a son or daughter who can’t achieve something, but you’ve still got to be behind it.”Doug Cotter, who oversees the three Detroit offices of Michigan Works!, said challenges facing the unemployed in the city run far deeper than the bankruptcy. Besides practical issues such as lack of education and transportation, he said, the jobless wrestle with intense hopelessness.“We have a population who lives in poverty, and that cycle is difficult to break,” Cotter said.It’s a problem that could grow worse depending on the outcome of the court negotiations over Detroit’s $19 billion debt: One of the cuts potentially on the table is the pensions of thousands of retired city workers.“If pensions are dramatically reduced, there’s going to be more need for our services,” Cotter said.But there are bright spots, and the auto industry’s rebound has made some impact. Detroit Manufacturing Systems, which makes dashboards for Ford, set up shop in northeast Detroit last year.DMS decided to hire almost all of its workers through Michigan Works! but at far lower wages than many had been earning in their previous jobs.John Lewis, 43, was laid off early last year from a steel plant that served Ford, where he had been earning a high five-figure salary. He went to Michigan Works! for help, and after more than six months, got a job working for DMS earning 75 percent less.“I was taking a huge pay cut,” he said, “but I had to work.”After quick promotions, he now supervises the installation of air ducts and other parts of the Ford Taurus dashboard, and he has moved closer to his old salary.But Allen Stone, a laid-off factory employee who has become a human resource executive at DMS, is not optimistic that the company’s model will be repeated widely in Detroit.“If this is replicated, we could pull together a workforce from the lowest ranks of society,” Stone said. “But I just think that’s just not likely. It costs a lot of money to rebuild factories, and there’s a natural fear factor of companies coming back to Detroit.”

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Fiction: ‘Tumbledown,’ by Robert Boswell
By Carole Burns, E-mail the writers
Robert Boswell’s “Tumbledown” takes its time. In the opening pages, the reader is introduced to James Candler and Lise Ray, who don’t quite know each other, but it’s Page 97 by the time Lise engineers a dance with Candler at a nightclub and then lands, barefoot, in his lap.
This meeting ends up being just one of many happenings in and around the Onyx Springs Rehabilitation and Therapeutic Center, a care facility in California for people with mental disabilities. Both clients and staff take turns at center stage. As their dilemmas become more and more intertwined, the inner lives of the counselors and their often very ill clients begin to reflect each other.

Free admission Get ideas This isn’t a “Catch-22” premise — who’s crazier in this world? It’s a complicated, nuanced look at human experience and the insights into that experience contributed by people of varying kinds of intelligence. Oh, it’s funny, too.Candler is at the hub of this matrix of people. At 33, he’s favored to become the facility’s next and youngest-ever director. Characters radiating from Candler include Mick, one of his clients who has schizophrenia; Karly, a gorgeous client Mick is in love with even though she can’t remember punch lines or how to work her washing machine; and Billy, Candler’s well-meaning childhood friend who ends up running the workshop where the clients take job training. Candler provides the more typical narrative. He’s a smart, upwardly mobile guy with middle-class problems (Which woman will he end up with? Does he actually want to become executive director?), but he also deals with serious issues from his past, particularly a brother who committed suicide. His friend Billy is a more surprising voice. Less intelligent than Candler, less professionally successful (he has worked in a convenience store and a pizza shop), he’s in some ways a middle ground between Candler and the clients. When he takes over the workshop, he treats them as equals, and may be better at his new job than his smarter friend. Yet Billy’s kindness is twinned with a lack of sophistication that leads him into a moral dilemma.What most enlivens “Tumbledown” is the moving inner life that Boswell imagines for his mentally disabled characters. At one point, Karly, abandoned by a trucker who had been taking advantage of her, gets lost walking home from the supermarket: “She must have gone the wrong way because when she followed the arrows she had drawn on her hand it got dark and she wasn’t home yet and she was sweaty and some dogs barking at each other wouldn’t stop. If she had a microwave, she could eat the pot pie. She was hungry and tired and the new boy in the workshop yelled a lot and had a funny name he called himself. She just thought of that for no reason.”Mick, on the other hand, is highly intelligent but resists taking his medication. Boswell evokes this struggle by describing his racing mind when he skips his pills, his body “lethargic from the heavy winter garments the meds insisted he wear.” Boswell also connects Mick’s frustrations to those experienced by all the characters, such as when Mick contemplates the things he can’t do because of his illness: “He had plenty of regrets. Like the beach. He wished to hell he could have gone back to that beach, ripped off his clothes, and strode over the sand like a . . . god. Gods did what they wanted, took whatever and whomever they pleased.” Who among us doesn’t feel similarly frustrated by our inadequacies and desire to overcome them? The novel takes a somewhat abrupt turn in style when Boswell gives it two endings. Yet even this is handled adeptly and allows the possibility that the story is not destined to end in tragedy — another example of the sympathetic, engaging nature of “Tumbledown.” Burns, editor of “Off the Page: Writers Talk About Beginnings, Endings, and Everything in Between,” teaches creative writing at Cardiff Metropolitan University in Wales.

Free admission Get ideas By Katherine Boo (Random House)This is quite simply an astonishing tale of squatters living in a tiny slum in India’s largest city. While dismal, their lives — as garbage pickers and scrap sellers — are almost operatic as they wend their way through corruption and governmental indifference, even ill-will. The ending is no end at all, but at least they have their stories told. — Shashi Tharoor
HOUSE OF STONE: A Memoir of Home, Family, and a Lost Middle East
By Anthony Shadid (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)Shadid wrote this wonderful memoir of the year he devoted to restoring his great-grandfather’s home in southern Lebanon shortly before the author died, at 43, on assignment in Syria. By turns humorous and plangent, he evokes his Bedouin forebears and tries to reclaim his place in this disappeared world. — Philip Caputo
IRON CURTAIN: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956
By Anne Applebaum (Doubleday)How did a religious, mostly agricultural Eastern Europe come to look like Stalin’s industrial, atheist Soviet Union? Cadres of people were trained and then trained others to see a new civilization that meant opportunity. Confusing? Enraging? All that and more in a compelling work of history and journalism. — John Connelly
MARIGOLD: The Lost Chance for Peace in Vietnam
By James G. Hershberg (Stanford/Woodrow Wilson Center)“Marigold” is a staggering exercise in historical scholarship, the definitive study of a subject of intense speculation over the years — proposed U.S.-Hanoi negotiations in 1966. The meetings, like others before and after, never came to pass, the reasons were unexplained, and the war churned on. — Gordon M. Goldstein
WHY NATIONS FAIL: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty
By Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (Crown)This racing, wildly ambitious masterpiece argues that institutions — not geography, not ignorant leaders, not hobbled cultures — make the difference between the well-being of even the poorest American and the truly impoverished of the world. — Warren Bass
FICTION
ARCADIA
By Lauren Groff (Voice)In this poignant and gorgeously written novel, a young man named Bit Stone is raised on a failing commune in New York. As Bit grows up and moves away, he isn’t naive enough to think his parents’ community could have survived, but he can’t shake the hopeful story that spawned him, that edenic sense of harmony. Groff resists any easy cynicism in favor of a profound consideration of the utopian dream. — Ron Charles
BILLY LYNN’S LONG HALFTIME WALK
By Ben Fountain (Ecco)In this darkly comic gut-punch of a novel, the surviving members of Bravo Squad — whose bravery in Iraq has been replayed endlessly on Fox News — are at Texas Stadium to take part in a high-octane halftime performance. The only hearts and minds left to be won are those of ambivalent Americans back home, and the only way to win them is through pageantry, jingoism and self-congratulation. “Catch-22” updated for a new era. — Jeff Turrentine
BRING UP THE BODIES
By Hilary Mantel (Henry Holt)Mantel follows up her Booker-winning “Wolf Hall” with a second Booker winner. This darkly magnificent sequel covers Thomas Cromwell’s brutal efforts to end the failing marriage between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Gruffly compassionate toward villains and victims alike, Mantel reveals their weaknesses and cruelties bundled up in a flawed humanity we share. — Wendy Smith
BROKEN HARBOR
By Tana French (Viking)Set in Dublin after its economic collapse, “Broken Harbor” begins as a police procedural in an old working-class vacation spot that’s now a half-finished housing development. It then evolves into a suspenseful psychological thriller. With formidable intelligence, the story encompasses a family tragedy, the ugly side of police work and finally the sorrows of a generation. — Patrick Anderson
CANADA
By Richard Ford (Ecco)A magnificent work of Montana gothic told by the son of two inept bank robbers. When his parents go to prison, young Dell is whisked across the border to a dark room in Saskatchewan to escape social service agents. But his new guardian is a spoiled, cowardly man dogged by fears of retribution. Ford has polished the plainspoken lines of this wise novel to an arresting sheen. “Canada” confirms his position as one of the finest stylists and most humane storytellers in America. — R.C.

Stretching the rewards of sweet corn
By Barbara Damrosch, E-mail the writers
A little chill in the air is refreshing after a sweaty summer, and the fireworks of autumn foliage make up for the loss of greenery. But it’s hard to romanticize the loss of sweet corn. Unlike vining tomatoes and cucumbers, which bear over months, a cornstalk’s season is a brief moment of ripeness.
This year we turned moments into weeks by planting four varieties that matured in succession. But then only the last one was left, its ears threatening to turn starchy if we didn’t gobble it all up right away. There’s nothing wrong with gorging on corn, because you haven’t had time to get sick of it before it’s gone. But I still freeze some for winter eating.
(iStockphoto/ISTOCKphoto) - Corn in husk
Corn turns mushy if frozen on the cob and takes up too much space in the freezer. Better to remove the kernels now. Like any vegetable, corn must be blanched first by dropping it into boiling water to keep certain enzymes from breaking down the cells too much. But beware the tables that tell you how long to blanch it. Ten minutes, or even five, is way too long for corn, which cooks very quickly. (At its tender peak you can even eat it raw.) Start timing when you drop the ears into the pot — not too many at a time — then remove them with tongs after a minute or two and plunge them into a sink of ice water to prevent further cooking.I recently learned a great trick for cutting off kernels, a job that normally spews them all over the kitchen. You put an angel food cake pan on the counter and hold the corn ear upright with its pointed end poked into the pan’s central cone. The kernels are easily sliced downwards with the stroke of a sharp heavy knife or cleaver, and fall neatly into the pan. Even if you never make angel food cake, it is worth getting the pan for this purpose. Corn goes through several stages of ripeness. The first and most perfect one is when the kernels have just plumped up and exude a milky sap when you poke them with your fingernail. But the plant wants to make a tough, durable seed that will survive the winter in a dry, hardened state. The middle stage in between, when the kernels are starchy and a bit chewy, is fine for dishes like shepherd’s pie and succotash, which are cooked for a long time. (I’ve even dried corn for winter cooking.) When you’re using starchy corn, either for freezing or eating fresh, it’s worth pressing out the inner part of the kernel and leaving the tough outer part on the cob. This is done by slicing down the center of each row, then scraping out the luscious, sweet, creamy, center with a downward thrust of the back side of that heavy knife. This takes much more strength than just cutting off the kernels, and a corn-cutting tool — a flat, metal bar with teeth — will spare you a case of carpal tunnel syndrome if you’re putting up lots of corn. You’ll find it at places that sell old-timey kitchen stuff, when you’re shopping for that angel food cake pan.
