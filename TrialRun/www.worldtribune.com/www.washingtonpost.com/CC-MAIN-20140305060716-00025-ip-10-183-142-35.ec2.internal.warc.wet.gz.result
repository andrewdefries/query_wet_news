Ex-governor Granholm heading to Pew Charitable Trusts job?
By Al Kamen
Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm‘s name has been floated regularly for many cabinet jobs, including secretary of labor or transportation or energy.
Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm greets the audience as she takes the stage during the 2012 Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012 in Charlotte, N.C.
(Jonathan Newton - The Washington Post)
But she’s thinking she may be out of the running.
Granholm, who last year hosted a show called “The War Room” on Current TV — the network Al Gore sold in January to Al Jazeera — said Sunday she’s “probably” going to work at The Pew Charitable Trusts as a spokeswoman on clean energy matters, though it’s not a “done deal.” Quite so. (A source at Pew says it’s not going to happen.)
Granholm, interviewed on “Platts Energy Week,” an all-energy news and talk show, said she’d been watching confirmation hearings in the last few weeks.
“If you think it was hard getting (secretary of defense nominee Chuck) Hagel confirmed,” she said, “imagine somebody who has run a progressive talk show for the past year, probably poking a few Republicans in the eye,” maybe even some who “might be casting a vote” on her nomination.
“I might be a little bit of a tough” challenge to confirm, Granholm said, “but I’m going to do all sorts of stuff serving on the outside, for sure.”
Sounds like a cabinet post is not in her future. On the other hand, there are some good jobs that don't require confirmation.
Check her comments starting at around the seven-minute mark.

Your essential source for the latest news on the intersection of Wall Street and Washington.
Welcome
At some point in the last couple of years--we would place it sometime after Lehman Brothers went down but before the automakers were bailed out--Washington became the financial capital of the world.
Ezra Klein’s Take
"Now that we're all used to pre-nups, it's time to start thinking about divorce insurance: Ever had that sinking feeling that the person your friend is marrying is perfectly awful? Of course not, because you love everyone. But should it happen, you now can give the perfect wedding present: divorce insurance."

Could a federal shutdown shut down Wall Street?
By Ariana Eunjung Cha
If Congress is unable to reach a budget deal on Friday, the federal government would close all non-essential operations at midnight when the current stop-gap funding measure expires. It would be the 18th time the government has endured a full or partial shutdown since 1977.
How could a shutdown affect an already struggling economic recovery? While economists agree that a brief shutdown that lasts only a few days would have a negligible impact on the GDP, there’s significant debate about what a longer closure would mean.
Some estimate that a week-long shutdown would trim the GDP by as much as a 0.8 percentage point during the first quarter, while others say it will be closer to 0.2 percentage point.
Macroeconomic Advisors has created a “shutdown calculator”—it’s really a table—that analyzes the risk to GDP depending on the length and extent of the shutdown.
In what may be the best-case scenario for a one-week shutdown—in which 36 percent of civilian compensation and 100 percent of defense spending on intermediate services are affected--the GDP is reduced by a 0.18 percentage point for the first quarter. In the worst (“highly unrealistic”) calculation for a shutdown that affects everything, GDP for the quarter would be shaved by a 0.58 percentage point. Here’s the Macroeconomic Advisors chart:
What are some of the other risks to the economy and to financial markets?
The Federal Reserve would remain open (it doesn’t rely on Congressional funds), but it’s unclear what will happen to other parts of the government with regulatory functions over business. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission may have to pause antitrust reviews—meaning that some mergers and acquisitions could be frozen. And while the Securities and Exchange Commission has said it would continue some market enforcement and surveillance operations, other operations would be curtailed. As a result, new issues of bonds and stocks and initial public offerings could be delayed.
CNBC’s John Carney argues that “a government shutdown could shut down Wall Street.”
“If Wall Street were unable to perform many of its functions for weeks, it could impact revenues this quarter,” Carney wrote in an analysis.
The ripple effects of a shutdown could dampen confidence in the United States as place for foreign investments, which would be bad news for the dollar. The dollar has already been losing ground this week to rivals (except the yen) as the threat of a shutdown grows.

Apple’s iOS 6: What you should know
View Photo Gallery — Apple: A history of one of the world’s most valuable companies: The tech giant unveiled the third generation of its popular tablet computer, the iPad, in March. Here’s a look back some key moments Apple’s evolution. By Hayley Tsukayama, E-mail the writer
Apple released its new operating system Wednesday, and iOS 6 comes with a lot of changes and added features that are important to know about. Here’s a snapshot of the most notable of more than 200 new options that Apple has advertised for this upgrade.
First, you can update your Apple device to iOS 6 over the air by heading to the “General” menu and choosing “Software Update.”

But before you do, there are a few things you’ll want to consider, such as whether it’s smart to rush to upgrade today.Why? Well, it could take some time. There are a lot of people trying to update their devices right now. For this post, I updated three Apple devices: One took just 20 minutes for a full update, and another just 25 minutes. But when I upgraded my iPhone, it had to be restarted and took nearly an hour. Second, some of your apps will change when you upgrade. The most notable is Maps. Google has powered the iPhone’s maps app for years, but Apple has struck out on its own for this latest version of iOS. Reviews of the app have been mixed so far, as Apple’s map function is much earlier in its development than Google’s. With an upgrade, you lose Google’s Street View. Apple’s Flyovers feature, which is supposed to give you a 3D feel of a city, is very limited. Note that it may not be available for a city near you quite yet, but you can check out the Flyovers for Sydney, London, New York or Boston. The Maps app adds turn-by-turn navigation, which I haven’t had the chance to check properly while at my desk. Unlike its predecessors, Apple’s Maps reads out directions.If you’re wedded to Google Maps, be aware that Google does not have a standalone maps app in the App Store right now. If you want to use that service, you’ll have to call it up on the browser.Among the new perks, is a clock app for the iPad that can work as an alarm clock, stopwatch or timer. On the iPhone and iPod Touch, users will gain access to Passbook — Apple’s ticketing and loyalty card wallet app. Third, if your device already had Siri, she’s new and improved, now able to open apps, make dinner reservations through Open Table, update Facebook and even check sports scores and standings.Sadly, I won’t see Siri — old or new — on my iPad 2 or my 4th-generation iPod Touch, even though they’re both compatible with iOS 6. And I’ll again miss out on Apple’s handy dictation feature, either.Since we’re on the subject of compatibility, users should know that Flyover and turn-by-turn navigation won’t work with the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS or 4th-generation iPod Touch. And for owners of the iPhone 3GS and first-generation iPad, the iOS 6 will not work with their devices. At all.Some additions work region by region. If you’re outside the United States, you should definitely check Apple’s iOS 6 feature availability list.
Apple has also redesigned The App Store and iTunes Store have been redesigned to move away from lists and toward grids. You’ll also be able to set a “Do not Disturb” period that will mute your calls and alerts, either immediately or on a schedule. You’ll also be able to allow certain callers even when you’re in the quieter mode or if you get a repeat call.And now you’re even able to ignore calls, with a preset message or by setting a reminder to call that person back — a nice touch in an increasingly busy world.Related stories:

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The Post’s View
Syria’s al-Qaeda threat
By Editorial Board, ONE OF THE foremost concerns expressed by members of Congress considering President Obama’s request for authorization of a military strike in Syria is that U.S. action will end up empowering actors who are even worse than Bashar al-Assad: in particular, al-Qaeda affiliates who have been prominent in fighting the regime. The worries are legitimate. But if they prompt legislators to oppose American military action, the threat to both Syria and U.S. national interests from the jihadists will grow worse.
As The Post and other news organizations have reported, al-Qaeda groups such as the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have used suicide bombings, beheadings and other brutal tactics to gain control over at least one provincial capital in northeastern Syria, as well as areas adjacent to the Turkish border. They have been prominent in battles between regime and opposition forces in areas across the country. They are determined to create a safe haven for al-Qaeda in Syria — like that which existed in Afghanistan before Sept. 11, 2001 — while imposing a Taliban-style fundamentalist regime.
Washington Post Editorials
Editorials represent the views of The Washington Post as an institution, as determined through debate among members of the editorial board. News reporters and editors never contribute to editorial board discussions, and editorial board members don’t have any role in news coverage.

Latest EditorialsDeclassify the torture report
Editorial Board The Senate report on CIA interrogation methods must see the light of day, soon.
A stand for nothing
Editorial Board An impasse in Richmond over expanded health insurance for the poor is driven by ideology, not facts.
Apply the brakes
Editorial Board The Secret Service needs to avoid so many main road closures.
However, the strength of the al-Qaeda forces has been exaggerated. Foremost among the myth-mongers is Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, a staunch Assad supporter who on Wednesday claimed that “al-Qaeda units are the main military echelon” of the Syrian rebels and that Secretary of State John F. Kerry lied to Congress when he asserted otherwise.In fact, if anyone is willfully distorting the truth it is Mr. Putin. Both U.S. and independent intelligence estimates show that the 11 jihadist groups identified in Syria make up a small minority of the anti-government forces. U.S. officials say they constitute 15 percent to 25 percent of fighters. Elizabeth O’Bagy, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War who has travelled extensively inside Syria, reports that al-Qaeda and mainstream rebel forces are largely separated from each other and control different pieces of territory. She says that the jihadists are less interested in defeating Mr. Assad than in establishing a safe haven.That the extremists are succeeding in holding some ground has more to do with Syria’s state of war than its receptivity to Islamic fundamentalism. For the last century Syria has been a predominately secular society, with numerous religious and ethnic minorities. Many who have joined the al-Qaeda groups did so not because of their ideology, but because they were better funded and supplied. The Islamic State of Iraq depends heavily on foreign fighters. If the civil war ended, most Syrians would resist a fundamentalist regime; Ms. O’Bagy reports that there have already been demonstrations against the jihadists.An attack that weakened regime forces could, of course, help the jihadists gain ground — but only if the United States and its allies failed to simultaneously bolster the mainstream Free Syrian Army. That’s why it is essential that Mr. Obama couple any strikes with a stepped up train-and-equip program for vetted rebel units. The way to counter the threat posed by the jihadists is not to leave the Assad regime in power, but to empower the moderate and secular majority. The U.S. failure to support moderate forces one and two years ago helped to pave the way for al-Qaeda in Syria. A congressional decision not to act now will make the jihadists stronger still.
