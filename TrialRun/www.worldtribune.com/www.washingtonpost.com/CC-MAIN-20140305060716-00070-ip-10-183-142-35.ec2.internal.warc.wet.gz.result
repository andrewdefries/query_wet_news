The dumbing effect of cable news
By Erik Wemple
Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) earlier this month came out with a survey indicating a bifurcation. NPR and the Sunday punditathons inform people; ideologically driven cable tube — chiefly Fox News and MSNBC — disinform people, or, in the words of the study, have a “negative impact on people’s current events knowledge.”
Now for the shockers. Shocker No. 1: NPR has issued a cheery statement on the findings: “It’s great to see – our own research tells us that NPR listeners are engaged, knowledgeable of domestic and world events, and that being well informed is important to them. That’s why people tune to member stations and come to us online and on mobile – they know they’ll get fact-based reporting and analysis from journalists with deep knowledge of their beats.”
Shocker No. 2: Fox News didn’t respond to an inquiry and MSNBC no-commented it.
If the study’s findings sound familiar, it’s becauase they are. Last November, FDU did a smaller version of the same study that was limited to 612 adults in the state of New Jersey. The recent one polled 1,185 “resident adults” across the country. The reaction to the November data helps explain why the FDU people took a bigger bite this year. They got pelted after those findings, that is. “It was mostly people who were fans of Fox News,” says Dan Cassino, an assistant professor of political science at FDU. “They tell you all sorts of things about yourself that you didn’t know,” he says. “Apparently I’m a communist, anti-intellectual and I make stuff up.” Cassino fielded requests from detractors who demanded to see the data — not the data presented in the study, but rather the data “before I had changed it.” Here’s a sample e-mail that Cassino received: I watched Fox News with Chris Wallce this morning, and boy do I feel stupid! That Chris Wallace is a real [expletive] moron, and so are all of his panelists. Do’H!!!
Another: Your “research” shows that someone that watches Fox news knows less than someone that watches ZERO news. Someone that watches news knows less than someone that doesn’t. Please forward your RAW data and your adjusted data. I’d like to review it.
In one of the more bizarre twists, Cassino recalls fielding an attack from someone who alleged that he was serving as a “shill” for Fox News, even though his study said dire things about the cable network’s product. Though ostensibly assaulting the study, these people were affirming its core findings: Folks were interpreting the FDU data however they wanted, in ways that solidified their own convictions. Just like cable news. Hard to blame America’s cable devotees for taking exception to the findings. After all, the FDU people are saying, for instance, that as a whole, viewers of MSNBC register no gain of political knowledge from watching the network’s programming. Fox fares worse. According to the study, “moderates and liberals who watch Fox News do worse” on the survey’s questions than do people who watch no news at all. Conservative Fox viewers come out about even on the deal. Peter Woolley, the director of the poll and a political science professor at FDU, says that a misconception about the study supposes that people would be better off hiding under a rock than watching Fox News. That’s not the lesson. “What we’re really saying is that if you’re just relying on your general education and general conversation through the course of the day, you might be better off” keeping your cable news stifled, says Woolley. Not such a radical notion there. The key is how the cable nets choose stories, says Woolley, noting that this process carries an “opportunity cost.” “If you’re spending all your time bashing President Obama or bashing liberals, if you’re cherry-picking stories that are about the stupidity of the political folks you dislike, then you are not reporting the thousands of things going on in the world that are important. You’re not talking about Greece or the Euro or the uprising in Syria,” says Woolley. Cable news aside, the survey’s killer finding comes in the form of an oval. Precisely zero of the 1,185 people polled, says Cassino, got all of the nine questions correct. Here are those questions:
1. To the best of your knowledge, have the opposition groups protesting in Egypt been successful in removing Hosni Mubarak ?
2. How about the opposition groups in Syria? Have they been successful in removing Bashar al-Assad?
3. Some countries in Europe are deeply in debt, and have had to be bailed out by other countries. To the best of your knowledge, which country has had to spend the most money to bail out European countries?
4. There have been increasing talks about economic sanctions against Iran. What are these sanctions supposed to do?
5. Which party has the most seats in the House of Representatives right now?
6. In December, House Republicans agreed to a short-term extension of a payroll tax cut, but only if President Obama agreed to do what?
7. It took a long time to get the final results of the Iowa caucuses for Republican candidates. In the end, who was declared the winner?
8. How about the New Hampshire Primary? Which Republican won that race?
9. According to official figures, about what percentage of Americans are currently unemployed?

A suicide in Burke. Should we have reported it?
By Tom Jackman
When former NFL star Junior Seau committed suicide, the media reported it. Here, a fan stands outside Seau’s house. But most of the time, the media ignore suicides. Should we?
(Denis Poroy - AP)
One morning last week, a woman walked into a busy Target department store in Burke and shot herself to death near the books section. The Washington Post did not report the death, and a number of you have asked why. In the comments section, I’ll be interested to hear whether you agree with the editors’ decision.
In general, the mainstream media have informally agreed not to report on suicides. There are several reasons for this. One, there are a lot of suicides. Way more than you’d think. In Fairfax County in 2010, there were 14 homicides but 86 suicides. Covering them all would be difficult. Two, the media do not want to encourage suicide. We do not want people to think they can go out in a blaze of glory by killing themselves. There has been extensive research that shows that media coverage of suicides may be linked to an increase in suicides, particularly among teens and in “copycat” cases. Three, the killer does not remain to face charges or answer questions, as in homicides, and there is no subsequent push for justice or accountability. The motivations are complicated, if they are ever known. Mental health or messy domestic situations cloud the picture.
There are exceptions, of course. Suicides by prominent people are covered. Suicides in public places — jumping off a bridge at rush hour, leaping from a downtown skyscraper — are sometimes covered. So that brings us to the suicide inside the Target store, at the intersection of Roberts and New Guinea roads. Fairfax County police said it happened about 11:30 a.m. Officer Don Gotthardt said investigators do not believe it happened in view of anyone. The store was closed for most of the day, and reopened that night with the immediate area of the suicide curtained off.
The police did not issue a press release, but word of the shooting spread. The Post’s Justin Jouvenal called the Fairfax police public information office and obtained the information available at the time, while the woman was still alive and police were just starting to investigate. A blog item was posted. But when the woman subsequently died, and police confirmed it was a suicide, The Post chose not to report any further.
The Washington Examiner did a short report on the episode, as did Patch.com, which followed up with a story about suicide prevention. The Post’s deputy local editor, Mike Semel, said “The incident at the Target store was tragic. While the Target is a public place, the suicide occurred outside anyone’s view. Therefore we determined that it did not meet any of our criteria for reporting on suicides. In addition, we did not think reporting the event would have provided any value to our readers.”
If you were the editor, what would be your call?

Twitter changes censorship policy
By Clinton Yates

(MARK RALSTON - AFP/GETTY IMAGES)
If you missed the Los Angeles Clippers playing the Oklahoma City Thunder last night, I don't know what to tell you. Blake Griffin pulled off the dunk of the year, no questions asked. Lob City, Lob Angeles, whatever — what a team.
Even when the District government gets things right, they seem to do it the wrong way
. Yesterday, Mayor Gray announced that the city has a $240 million surplus on hand, the product of emergency furloughs and higher taxes. One thing, though -- they didn't even know it was coming. Even city CFO Natwar Gandhi, who is notoriously meticulous about D.C. finances (per his job requirement), was flummoxed. The Post's Nikita Stewart reports on the windfall.
It's amazing how much one can learn by just walking around
. And Cultural Tourism DC gets it done on that front. If you've ever seen the signs around town, then you know what I'm talking about. My basic advice is to read every single one you see. You will learn a lot. There's a new one up along H Street and it's all the rage - so much so that even NBC4's Pat Collins showed up for a tour recently. The Post's Emily Wax chronicles how this historical walkway came to be in Northeast.
Newt Gingrich is quite the character
. I love his raspy attitude in debates, not a huge fan of his politics and I don't judge his personal behavior behind closed doors. The Florida primary is today, and Gingrich's camp has a new promotional tool that I'm not sure they wanted. First though, I'll ask you: What's your favorite word that rhymes with Newt? Mine is “chute.”One guy's is “hoot” and he made a song about it. Seriously. This is not a joke.
Twitter is moving into tricky waters
. When they announced last week that they'd be implementing a modified censorship model, they turned a few heads. For a social networking site that proclaims to be the free speech bastion of the Internet, it seemed odd that the site would flirt with anything of the sort. But the changes are really not that big of a deal, as there are easy workarounds to skate the new policy. Slate's Uri Friedman explains why Twitter has botched it with this change.
The history of women's soccer in this country is an interesting one.
The national team has been a major player on the world stage for decades, but professionally, the sport hasn't been nearly as successful. Yesterday, WPS closed up shop for the season, which is sad. Say what you want about the viability of women's pro soccer, the three incarnations of the league since 2000 have undoubtedly leveled the playing field globally. The Post's Steven Goff explains what happened.
Extra Bites
• You're all getting really tired of the “[Expletive] People Say” series, but I'm not. And as a guy that grew up playing on a fair amount of baseball teams, this one really makes me laugh. God, I love baseball.
• Looking for something to do this week, or any week? The Going Out `Gurus are obviously the go-to. The lineup for the next seven days is particularly cool. Nonstop dubstep all night long.
• WaPo is changing a few things on the comment front. Step your game up.

BEFORE THEY’RE GONE
A Family’s Year-Long Quest to Explore America’s Most Endangered National Parks
By Michael LanzaBeacon. 197 pp. $24.95
Michael Lanza begins this account of family camping by sketching the new — but not improved — look that some national parks will take on if global warming is not checked soon. “Yosemite’s famous waterfalls . . . will lose their impressive force and peter out earlier in the year.” “Rising seas will inundate at least one-third of Olympic National Park’s seventy-three-mile-long wilderness coastline.” “Joshua Tree National Park . . . will lose its namesake flora.” Taking along their 8-year-old son, Nate, and their 6-year-old daughter, Alex, Lanza and his wife set out to visit the wilds of 10 national parks, most of them in the West but also including the Everglades in Florida, while the going was good.
In some ways, the kids behaved as you might expect. The profusion of boulders at Joshua Tree inspired them to make the park into a “jungle gym” — not just for themselves but also for their toys. “Using a twenty-foot length of thin utility cord I’ve given them,” Lanza writes, “they lower their stuffed animals down short cliffs.” But fears that Nate and Alex might squawk about being deprived of the comforts of home proved misguided.

Free admission Get ideas “We should come back here for spring break so we can stay for a week,” Alex says at Joshua Tree. “I could almost weep,” her dad writes.By the end of the series of trips, Lanza reports, “Rating our adventures . . . on their own fun meter has become serious business to my kids.” He fears, though, that by the time Nate and Alex tell their own children about this era in their lives, “it may sound like the myth of Atlantis.” — Dennis Drabelle

Ask Amy: Dad’s computer history reveals unsavory sites
By Amy Dickinson, DEAR AMY: I share a home computer with my father. Unfortunately, the computer history shows everything that happens within a week, and it shows that my dad has been looking at pornography.
My parents are divorced, and I realize he might be lonely, but I don’t know how to approach it or if I even should. My dad and I are close, and I don’t want the awkwardness of this to ruin our relationship.

Should I ignore this and live with the awkwardness, or confront him and possibly ruin our relationship? -- AwkwardDEAR AWKWARD: Ignoring a problem or situation is always the easiest thing to do in the short-term but it seldom works long-term because family issues don’t just go away. They lie in wait (under the carpet, where you’ve swept them), ready to come back — usually when you least expect it.Your father has a right to his own habits, however odious, as long as they aren’t illegal or harming him or someone else. (I believe that porn is harmful to all parties, but consenting adults have the right to make depressing choices.)If you don’t want to discuss this outright with your father (and who would?), you can split the difference by simply telling him, “Dad, the history of any previous searches shows up on our computer. If you don’t want me to see what Web sites you’ve visited, you should clear out the history every day.”The awkwardness will subside, but if it doesn’t and if you are concerned about your father (for this or any other reason), you should respectfully and forthrightly share your concerns.DEAR AMY: My son is 31 years old and has had only two serious relationships. He has been seeing a co-worker for several months since meeting at a Christmas party, and she has moved into his home along with her two children (they are ages 3 and 16 months).I am very happy my son has found someone who makes him happy. My question concerns what these children should call me? They call my son by his first name.I am not comfortable having them call me grandmother or any other form thereof, or any cute made-up name.I would rather they call me by my first name, but my son and the children’s mother prefer they call me some reference to grandma. What do you think? -- JaneDEAR JANE: This is a commonly posed question in this space, and while this issue sometimes seems trivial on the surface, it is important because it has to do with identity.It would be one thing if you were insisting on being addressed as “Grandma.” You are not. You are asking that you be called by your name. Why is this unacceptable?The inconsistency about this is confusing. It is okay for the kids to address your son by his first name — they aren’t making the kids call him “Daddy” (a choice I agree with) — but you have to be “Grammie?”This domestic situation seems to have progressed quite rapidly, hence the confusion. Marriage might clarify matters for everyone. This is relevant because if they had taken more time, everyone (including the kids and you) would have had plenty of time to figure out how to be addressed.I agree that the children should call you by your first name.DEAR AMY: “Upset” was a college student who described playing a “truth or dare” game in which the loser (Upset) had to endure the preselected punishment. The student was upset and wanted to sever ties with the group.You said this was hazing! This wasn’t a fraternity or sports team; this was a group of friends playing a game! Amy, sometimes people just need to buck up, take their “punishment” and get over it! -- AngryDEAR ANGRY: “Upset” described this as a “sort of hazing that lasted for several hours.”This sort of organized, group behavior is in fact hazing — and it got out of control. I agreed with “Upset’s” choice to ditch this group.Calling something what it is and standing up to the perpetrators is “bucking up” in my book.

Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Senators meet privately on urging broad debt-reduction plan from supercommittee
By Peter Wallsten, E-mail the writer
More than two dozen senators from both parties met privately this week to revive hopes of a grand debt-cutting bargain — exploring how to push the newly formed debt “supercommittee” to find far more than its assigned goal of $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions.
The senators want at least $3 trillion slashed from the deficit over the next decade. In addition, they plan to press the committee to pass a major tax overhaul to lower rates and close special-interest loopholes, as well as changes to entitlement programs such as Medicare, according to several participants.

The effort comes as the 12-member supercommittee begins what is expected to be a grueling process to map out its plans before a November deadline — and it threatens to undercut the chances for President Obama to win passage for portions of a jobs plan expected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term.“I don’t think I’m speaking out of school that it was a unanimous feeling among a large group of senators from both sides of the aisle,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of the meeting participants. “Most people are far more focused on this supercommittee than any speech the president’s going to give.”Another in the group, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.), said the senators want to “encourage” the supercommittee “to reach for a higher number.” He said the committee should “compromise with one another and do what parts of each party will not like, for the greater good, because that’s really what most of the people in the country want.”Obama, too, is expected to press the committee to exceed its deficit-reduction goal. In his speech Thursday night, he called on Congress to increase the super­committee’s deficit-cutting goals to cover the costs of his jobs plan, and he said that a week from Monday he will announce a more detailed plan “that will not only cover the cost of this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.”Several people familiar with the discussions said the lawmakers felt that, after the pomp and ceremony of Obama’s joint-session speech fades, the center of political and policy gravity on Capitol Hill will be the work of the special committee, chaired by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.).Under last month’s debt-ceiling deal struck by Obama and GOP lawmakers, deep cuts would automatically take effect in national security and other areas if the supercommittee fails to reach agreement or if Congress fails to pass legislation by December.One senior Democratic aide called Obama’s jobs plan largely “dead on arrival” because its expected price tag would roughly cancel out the one year’s worth of savings many lawmakers hope the supercommittee will find.The Senate on Thursday blocked a resolution of disapproval for an additional $500 billion increase in the debt ceiling. The procedure is required by the legislation to raise the borrowing limit in phases by at least $2.1 trillion.A Senate staffer familiar with the senators’ private discussions said the effort was intended to be “complementary” to the work of the supercommittee but also to offer a gentle nudge.The staffer said the senators’ push would “demonstrate there can be some support and safety if they choose to go beyond their charge.”Both aides spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the private deliberations.The private gathering this week, held Wednesday in a Capitol meeting room, included about 25 centrists from both parties. It was organized by Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), two members of the “Gang of Six,” which tried unsuccessfully to engineer a grand deal patterned loosely after the plan laid out by the deficit commission headed by former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former senator Alan Simpson.At least a third of the Senate at one time had indicated some level of support for the broad framework being negotiated by the Gang of Six, according to people familiar with that group’s discussions.More on PostPolitics
