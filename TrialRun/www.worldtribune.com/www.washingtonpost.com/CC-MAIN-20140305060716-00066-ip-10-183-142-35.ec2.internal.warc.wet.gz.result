With speech debate, Congress renews partisan rancor
By Rosalind S. Helderman
So much for hoping Congress might arrive at a newfound sense of comity after watching its approval ratings dip to record lows following the summer’s battle over raising the debt ceiling.
A partisan clash over when President Obama will deliver a speech, of all things, shows just how little Washington has moved on from the in­trac­table fights and bickering that were widely panned before Congress left for its August recess.
Polls all month have shown Congress is as unpopular as it has ever been--a Gallop survey put the body’s approval rating at 14 percent, an AP poll at 12 percent. Speechgate 2012 is unlikely to help.
Republicans complained the White House did not give House Speaker John Boehner sufficient notice before announcing President Obama would address a joint session of Congress on Sept. 7, the same night as a GOP presidential debate.
Democrats complained that Boehner failed to show the president proper deference when he responded by asking Obama to speak Thursday instead--the first time a speaker has ever turned aside a presidential request to address Congress, reported the office of the historian.
Obama’s action was “unfortunate” and “ignored decades of precedent,” a spokesman for Boehner said.
The speaker’s behavior was “disgraceful,” said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY).
Though now resolved--Obama has agreed to speak Sept. 8 instead, as requested by Boehner--the kerfuffle would seem to indicate both sides will return to Washington recharged to renew their partisan battles instead of the chastened to end them.
Indeed, Boehner got attaboys from fellow Republicans for standing up to president.
“Good on you, Mr. Speaker,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who is close to many tea-party freshmen. “There’s no requirement that we bow down and kiss the ring.”
“From one Speaker to another ... nicely done John,” tweeted former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.
The dust up comes as new bipartisan panel charged with reducing the federal deficit prepares to begin work.
The group has been careful to set a tone of unity--with GOP Chairman Rep. Jeb Hensarling (Tex.) and Democratic Chairman Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.) issuing joint statements promising cooperation.
Neither side issued ultimatums or conditions for negotiations following separate strategy sessions held this week by the committee’s Democrats and Republicans.
But the hard feelings over Obama’s address is yet another reminder of the in­trac­table partisan environment that will greet the committee as it holds its first meeting, likely some time next week. “We were hoping to get a fresh start after all the rancor of the debt ceiling debate,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a member of the panel. “This is not a good way to start.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The value of the dollar: Five factors for investors
By Barry Ritholtz, To most investors, the value of the dollar is an abstraction; its fluctuations are mostly ignored. Any currency, the dollar included, must be viewed relative to other currencies. You work in, get paid with and consume goods using dollars. Without a frame of reference to analyze it, the fluctuations have little meaning.
The time people seem to really notice is when they travel overseas and discover that it is not worth nearly as much as they expected. (“Forty dollars for a hamburger in London? Outrageous.”) As an investor, you may not be aware of what this ultimately means — to the economy, your investments and the nation. But it matters more than you realize — and it’s not just about pricey hamburgers.

The dollar, less almighty: Big investors see possible long-term currency weakness
More news from Post Business
To help you wrap your head around the value of a dollar, let’s look at five factors:1 The dollar matters a lot: The value of the greenback determines how competitive U.S. goods and services are on the world market. You can see this in the dollar’s impact on how much we sell overseas and what our imports cost. The U.S. economy exports almost $2 trillion of goods and services a year. Each month, we import more than $200 billion worth of stuff, creating a monthly trade deficit north of $45 billion. Many politicians talk about a strong dollar, but it’s mostly lip service. A weak dollar helps to create jobs by making U.S. products more price-competitive overseas. Indeed, many countries try to accomplish the same thing, creating a “beggar thy neighbor” policy. The global recession led to nearly every country in the world trying to export its way out of a slowdown. Warren Buffett has noted that “in the years since I was born, the dollar has depreciated 94 percent. It’s 16-for-1 in terms of inflation.” But, Buffett went on to point out, you earn 16 times as much as you used to. Costs are relative to your earning power, and to investors, what matters most is the earning power of companies that sell goods and services. 2 Inflation and the dollar: Inflation, Paul Volcker said, is the cruelest tax. The soft dollar has contributed to rising inflation since former Fed chair Alan Greenspan took rates down to 1 percent in the early 2000s. This is the price to be paid for making the dollar weaker to create those jobs. Commodities are priced in greenbacks. Most notably, food and oil are also dollar denominated. As the measuring stick (the dollar) gets smaller, commodity prices rise. When you see gas prices exceed $4 a gallon, and the costs of various foods rising, much of that is related to the dollar’s slide. Rising food prices and higher energy costs are felt most harshly by lower- and middle- income consumers and by retirees living on a fixed income. When the prices of these essential rise, it eats into their discretionary spending. Let’s not forget that metals are also priced in dollars — including gold. It is up 500 percent over the past decade, hitting $1,512 last week. This reflects a double concern: that the dollar is weakening, and that inflation is stirring. 3 From 2001 to 2008, the dollar collapsed 41 percent: While that 94 percent drop in Buffett’s lifetime is substantial, the past decade saw a full-blown collapse. The buying power of the dollar was cut nearly in half from 2002 to 2008. That collapse was triggered by the ultra-low rates by the Federal Reserve, and an (arguably) unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. The rates under Alan Greenspan kicked off a vicious cycle of increased prices, low returns on bond investments and higher inflation. Price spikes in oil, gold, food and housing — everything priced in dollars — followed. 4 The weak dollar policy forces money into riskier assets (and punishes savers): The Fed hasn’t explicitly stated that cash is trash, but it might well have. After Chairman Ben Bernanke’s op-ed in The Washington Post in November, many observers concluded that the Fed was trying to force cash out of hiding into the economy. Just as deflation encourages consumers to hold onto their money and wait for lower prices, inflation encourages consumers to spend their cash and beat the price increase. With rates low and the dollar’s value in decline, some have argued that the Fed is forcing money into more productive uses. In theory, that includes expanding businesses, hiring and making capital investments. What has really happened? While there has been some business hiring, it has been sub-par — typical in a post-credit crisis recovery. But it has led to speculation in commodity and equity markets. Rising stock prices and soaring commodity prices are a function of the Fed blunting the dollar. 5 In the land of the blind . . .
There are four major currency blocs — the dollar, the euro, the yen and the yuan. With so many factors against it, why would anyone want to own U.S. dollars? Because, well, it’s the least ugly currency of the lot. The Europeans are still not only dealing with an ongoing banking crisis. Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain all have solvency problems. Lacking their own currency, these nations cannot simply print their way out of debt. Thus, there is a small but real possibility that the European Union will not hold, and the euro will collapse. Japan is even worse. It was mired in a multi-decade slog, and then the earthquake/ tsunami/nuclear crisis rocked it back on its heels. That leaves China. Despite market reforms, it is still a totalitarian communist regime. Western nations are none too keen about making its currency the reserve of the world. To the dollar then. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Ritholtz is chief executive of FusionIQ, a quantitative research firm. He runs a finance blog, The Big Picture.

Delaney, 31, of Westminster, Md., said he is a lifelong Washington Redskins fan. Wearing a team T-shirt, he joined others who flooded Redskins Park in Ashburn on Saturday for the football team’s annual fan appreciation day. The team estimated the crowd at 24,650.The Redskins marching band and cheerleaders performed in the morning, and shortly before noon, the team itself was out running drills, after which players met with the fans and signed autographs.Next to Delaney, his 31-year-old wife, Liz, sat on a small black throw blanket pocked with Redskins helmet graphics. Delaney’s 2-year-old son, Colin, sported a Redskins cap. They fit right into the sea of burgundy, white and gold.The thick woods around Ashburn give way to a clearing with the multiple football fields in the Redskins complex. Throngs of fans wrapped around all sides as footballs whizzed through the hot air. Many others shopped for jerseys and other gear.Standing in blue jeans and a white athletic shirt, Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) attended the event and reminded fans that his wife, Maureen, was once a Washington Redskins cheerleader.“This is tremendously exciting,” McDonnell said. “I have been a lifelong Redskins fan.”Much of the excitement centered on 22-year-old quarterback Robert Griffin III, the team’s first-round draft pick this year, who fans hope will be a commanding leader and help revive the team’s fortunes through his speed, mobility and passing accuracy.But Delaney said it was important to remember winning would be a team effort.“We gotta keep the line around him,” Delaney said.Larry Mobley, 65, a fan for 35 years, sat on a shaded folding chair on the perimeter of the well-manicured field. He had driven nearly five hours from Portsmouth, Va., with his wife, Linda, to see Griffin and the rest of the team.Last year, the team won five games and lost 11. This year, Mobley and others hope Griffin, or RG3 as he’s known, will turn things around.“Everything I’ve read is that he’s 9-feet-tall and can lift buildings,” Larry Mobley said.The team announced in June that it is planning to move its summer training camp to Richmond in 2013, after exploring options in the District and Prince George’s County. This summer’s training camp in Ashburn is the last.Of the move, McDonnell said: “I can’t tell you how excited people in Richmond are about this. . . . To get the Skins for three to four weeks in their back yard is a big deal.”Delaney said he was glad he could catch the team before it moved farther away from his Westminster home. “We wanted to make sure we made it out this year,” he saidThe team’s first preseason game is Aug. 9 against the Buffalo Bills. The team will open the regular season Sept. 9 against the New Orleans Saints.
