Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Doug Duncan running for Montgomery County executive
By Victor Zapana, E-mail the writers
Douglas M. Duncan, who abruptly dropped his bid for governor six years ago amid a diagnosis of depression, has told supporters that he is running for his former job as Montgomery County’s executive.
The decision, which Duncan has been mulling for months, resurrects the political career of one of the Washington region’s most dynamic public figures, a gregarious and at times tempestuous politician whose forceful leadership led to the revitalization of downtown Silver Spring.
(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) - Former Montgomery County executive Doug Duncan with wife, Barbara, listen to speakers at an Oct. 7 political rally for Maryland 6th District Congressional candidate John Delaney. Duncan has announced he will seek the county executive job again. Maryland politicsMd. General Assembly status report

More news about Md. politics
It also immediately reshapes the 2014 Democratic primary race, in which several high-profile county officials have expressed an interest. County Executive Ike Leggett (D), who succeeded Duncan, has also indicated that he may run again, despite earlier pledges to the contrary.Sometimes called the “Mayor of Montgomery,” Duncan, 57, announced his decision before a crowd of 50 to 100 business leaders at a Gaithersburg hotel Tuesday. There, his pollster Harrison Hickman, who has worked for the Al Gore and John Edwards presidential campaigns, discussed a poll this year that showed Duncan had strong name recognition and favorability ratings.
“Make no mistake,” Duncan, 57, said, according to supporters who attended the meeting. “I am running for county executive.”His entrance into the race marks a dramatic return for Duncan, the ­county’s longest-serving executive, who soon disappeared from public view after dropping out of the 2006 Democratic primary against then-Baltimore Mayor Martin O’Malley.In a hastily arranged news conference to announce his decision not to pursue the governorship, he said it had become clear to him that the depression he was feeling “was more than the usual wear and tear of the campaign trail.”Shortly afterward, he said in a speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Mental Health Association of Montgomery County that “it didn’t take any courage to stand up and say, ‘Here’s my problem.’ The courage it took for me was to admit I have a problem, to admit that I needed help and to seek that help.”At the time, he said he was getting treatment and taking medication. His family has a history of mental health issues, campaign aides said at the time.In an interview last month, Duncan said his mental health is much better: “I’m feeling good.”One of his supporters, who was not authorized to speak publicly about Duncan’s run, said that he’s prepared for the issue to come up in the campaign and that it is “something that he has to address head on, and he’s more than willing to do it.”Duncan did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.As county executive, the 6-foot-4 Duncan left a large impression on the county, masterminding the revitalization of Silver Spring and the $96 million concert hall at Strathmore. He was widely praised for his calming demeanor during the 2002 sniper crisis. He ran on a developer-friendly platform, saying that the county suffered from “paralysis by analysis.”Despite his many successes, he also was at times a controversial figure, upsetting advocates who wanted the county to grow more slowly. And shortly before he dropped out of the governor’s race, The Washington Post reported that in 1999 he had accepted $20,000 in campaign money from businesses linked to convicted former lobbyist Jack Abramoff weeks before he authorized the lease of a shuttered public school to a Jewish organization Abramoff supported. Duncan later returned the money.
During his tenure, the county budget more than doubled, to nearly $4 billion, and the population surged by about 20 percent. He was a constant presence in Annapolis, fighting for state dollars and earning the nickname “Delegate Duncan.”After Duncan ended his gubernatorial bid in 2006, he underwent hip-replacement surgery. He did a few public appearances during his six-month recovery. In a 2009 radio interview, he said it had been hard for him to wade back into public view: “It was very difficult for me to be in public and for me to say things in public without sort of thinking that these people think I’m a fraud and that they’re just laughing at me.”In 2007, he became vice president for administrative affairs for the University of Maryland at College Park. During his tenure, he spearheaded a large development deal to build a town center and expand university facilities on what is known as East Campus, near the College Park Metro station. But he resigned in 2008 after a dispute with O’Malley. Duncan asserted that O’Malley did not want him participating in a forum alongside the governor’s political foe and predecessor, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R).Duncan then co-founded a government advisory firm called CivicUS, which soon dissolved. He later joined a statewide transportation advocacy group and went into consulting on his own. Last year, he was hired by Foulger-Pratt, a major developer in the county, to observe debates over a proposed youth curfew. Duncan quietly sat in on county hearings, listening while reading on his iPad. Duncan also worked with a Gaithersburg software company and recently started work with Lerner Enterprises to get state approval for a hospital on one of the company’s properties in Prince George’s County.As he began consulting, Duncan considered a run for Congress, meeting with key former advisers. But by the time the Montgomery County Council indefinitely postponed the curfew vote in December, he had decided not to run.“In the end I decided I’m an executive, not a legislator,” Duncan said in November. Within weeks, he endorsed businessman John Delaney, recording a campaign radio ad for him and actively campaigning for him. Delaney won the 6th District seat.Whispers of Duncan’s return to politics have been circulating for months. He could be entering a crowded Democratic primary for county executive. Council member Phil Andrews (Gaithersburg-Rockville) has said he is running, and George Leventhal (At Large) has expressed strong interest. Others, including Nancy Floreen (At Large), Valerie Ervin (Eastern County), Marc Elrich (At Large), state Del. Benjamin F. Kramer and the county’s economic development director, Steve Silverman, are also considering it.Leggett, who repeatedly has said he wanted to leave after this term, is weighing another run. In an interview Wednesday, he said he plans to meet with supporters next year to announce his decision.Duncan is making clear to others that he thinks the county is going in the wrong direction. At a breakfast last month with business leaders in Bethesda, he said he thinks state officials in Annapolis are paying less attention to the county than in previous years.He added that he thinks the county is “slipping” against Northern Virginia when it comes to attracting businesses.“I’m concerned that Montgomery County is getting a much bigger reputation that it is being anti-business,” he told the group.In an e-mail to supporters, he wrote: “I am not seeking to return to the County Executive’s office simply because it is winnable. I am returning because I have so much energy for the job and know that Montgomery County is ready to again see real progress.”

Second Boston bombing suspect taken into custody
View Photo Gallery — Police kill one suspect in Boston Marathon bombings: Authorities shot and killed one suspect in Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings, and police were searching for a second suspect who was on the loose in Watertown, Mass., Friday after a chaotic night that left one police officer dead and another critically wounded in the Boston suburbs. By Annie Gowen and David A. Fahrenthold, E-mail the writers
WATERTOWN, Mass.— Police said they had taken the second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings into custody here Friday night, after a day of intense searching that shut down daily life across a large swath of greater Boston.
Shortly after 8 p.m., police surrounded a boat stored behind a home in East Watertown, a short distance away from where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, had been last seen. Authorities said they believed Tsarnaev was inside the boat, which had been covered in a tarp. He was thought to be wounded but alive: television crews reported that they could hear police calling his name, attempting to induce his surrender.

The other suspect in the bombings, Tsarnaev’s 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, was killed early Friday morning after a shootout with police in another section of Watertown.Also Friday, a report from Russian television cited the men’s mother as saying her older son had previously been interviewed by the FBI because of his interest in radical Islamic teachings. The FBI confirmed that agents in Boston had interviewed the elder Tsarnaev in 2011, on behalf of an unspecified foreign government that suspected he had ties to a terrorist organization. But the FBI found nothing warranting further investigation. The standoff with the younger Tsarnaev began just minutes after a press conference in which authorities had conceded that a daylong search for Tsarnaev had come up empty. They had said they did not know where the fugitive was, but would still lift a “shelter in place” order anyway.“You can get back out, as long as you are vigilant,” said Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D). As night fell again here, the Tsarnaevs had become a new lesson in the awful magnifying power of terrorism. Two unremarkable brothers, armed with low-tech bombs and no apparent escape plan, had allegedly killed four people, injured more than 170, and then held one of America’s great cities in terror for a full day. And counting.While law enforcement officers continued to look for Tsarnaev, investigators in Washington and elsewhere began seeking to understand what had turned them to violence. The Tsarnaev brothers are of Chechen heritage. Both were born in the Caucusus region, a cauldron fought over by Chechen separatists, Russian security forces, Islamic extremists and organized crime. They had emigrated legally, and lived for years in the Boston area, where their father, Anzor, was an auto mechanic.In the past, both men had embraced American passions, according to friends and neighbors. Tamerlan, 26, was an accomplished boxer, with a wife and child. Dzhokhar was a wrestler at Cambridge’s public high school, who went on to attend the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. On Thursday evening, authorities released photos of two men spotted carrying backpacks near the Marathon’s finish line. These were apparently the Tsarnaevs, though authorities did not say that at the time--and, perhaps, did not know it at all.Their targets, it turned out, had not fled the city or the country. A few hours later, they began a violent spree just across the Charles River in Cambridge. At about 10:30 p.m., authorities said, the two shot and killed MIT Police officer Sean Collier, 26, as Collier sat in his cruiser. It was unclear what triggered that shooting: authorities said surveillance video appears to show the two approaching Collier and killing him without warning.After that, the men allegedly carjacked a Mercedes sport utility vehicle, and took the driver with them. At least one brother told the carjacked driver that they were the marathon bombers. They forced the driver to stop at several bank machines, and took $800 that he withdrew. After a few minutes, the man was left behind at a gas station, unharmed. It was unclear if he escaped, or was let go.From there, the brothers drove about three miles, throwing explosives out the window at police. In Watertown, they engaged in a shootout with police, in which at least 200 rounds were fired. Authorities said that Tamarlan Tsarnaev left the car at one point, and attempted to throw an explosive at officers. The device, however, went off in his hand. Police then tackled the wounded suspect in the street. Then, authorities said, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--still behind the wheel of a car, swerved at the officers in an effort to hit them.The officers dodged. Tamerlan did not. He was dragged under the car, and later died at a Boston hospital. In the same confrontation, a Boston Transit police officer was also shot and wounded. {{Officials later identified the officer as Richard H. Donahue, 33, who was treated at Mt. Auburn Hospital and released.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped. Police later conceded that there were not enough officers to establish a perimeter. The teenager is believed to have fled on foot: police found a small blood trail, indicating he was injured.Then he vanished.Starting after midnight Friday, an army of police officers and federal investigators began fanning out to look for him. SWAT teams from as far away as Cape Cod and New Hampshire rolled through the streets in armored cars, as police carefully searched house to house in Watertown.While they looked, authorities issued a massive order to stay at home. It covered the entire city of Boston, plus the suburban towns of Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, Waltham and Watertown. “This situation is grave. We are here to protect public safety,” Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said in the morning, as the extraordinary lockdown was put in place. “We believe this to be a terrorist. We believe this to be a man here to kill people.”As the afternoon wore on, authorities closed down the suspects’ street, and searched their home. President Obama was briefed. The Tsarnaev brothers’ relatives appeared one after another on cable TV, with one uncle denouncing the two as “losers.” In Boston, a few people began to defy orders, and come out in the streets. As night fell, the governor said that everyone could do that--but with the frightening knowledge that an alleged killer and bomb-maker was out there, too.“We can return to living our lives,” Patrick said.While authorities looked for Tsarnaev, another phase of the investigation was already underway. In Washington and elsewhere, investigators interviewed family members, and searched for travel records, financial documents and for the brothers’ traces on Internet.For now, the brothers’ alleged motive remains unknown. The Tsarnaevs, like many ethnic Chechens, are Muslim. In the last several months, Tamerlan Tsarnaev had posted videos to YouTube indicating his interest in radical Muslim ideologies. Another question: did the men have help, either from within the U.S. or abroad? While militant Chechen groups have been blamed for terror attacks in the past, their target has usually been Russia, a bitter foe from Caucusus wars. On Friday, U.S. authorities said they had no proof that anybody beyond the two Tsarnaev brothers was involved in the marathon attacks. But they were not done looking.
