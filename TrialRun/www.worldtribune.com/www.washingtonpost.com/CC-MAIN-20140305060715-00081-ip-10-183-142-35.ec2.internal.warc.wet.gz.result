Tracy A. Woodward/The Washington Post - Fish provides not only the amino acids but also the important healthful fats that are the next component of good moods. Buy This Photo
By Casey Seidenberg, E-mail the writer
As the mother of preteen boys, the issue of moods is often on my mind. Though I’m told you can’t truly know the range of human emotions until you’ve had a preteen girl, everyone — boy or girl, toddler, teen or adult — has mood swings.
I’ve noticed that when my children are in pleasant moods, chances are good that I will be, too, and vice versa. This means I am invested in keeping our moods stable. So what is the connection between mood and food?
(The Washington Post)
(TOOGA/Getty Images) - Fish, flaxseed and walnuts provide omega-3s. Eggs are rich in protein. Our brain regulates our moods. In layman’s terms, our brain needs four main chemicals, also known as neurotransmitters, to properly produce steady positive emotions. These chemicals are serotonin, endorphins, catecholamines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The food we eat provides the building blocks of these four important compounds.In “The Mood Cure,” psychotherapist Julia Ross explains that there are certain positive feelings associated with each of the four main mood-enhancing neurotransmitters, and also certain amino acids that ignite or fuel each of these neurotransmitters. We need all four happy chemicals to have balanced emotions. Nobody wants to feel euphoria all the time (although it might be tempting), but feeling relaxed and stress-free is a healthy state of mind.As the days remain short and gray, I imagine we all could use more of these happy chemicals in our bodies. How do we get them naturally? The uncomplicated answer: Eat protein and omega-3 fats. Because these four neurotransmitters are ignited by amino acids, and amino acids are essentially parts of proteins, logic would serve that one key to unwavering moods is eating enough protein. I see many women who skip breakfast and then eat a vegetable-based salad at lunch, therefore getting their protein just once a day, at dinner. This pattern of eating will not support regular mood-enhancing chemical production. This pertains to kids, too. A pancake for breakfast isn’t going to cut it.So what should we eat? Eggs are great sources of these amino acids and such an easy breakfast. Turkey is another good source, as are other lean meats, fish, beans and protein-rich whole grains. Fish provides not only the amino acids but also the important healthful fats that are the next component of good moods. Our bodies use omega-3 fatty acids to build a healthy brain. These fats have also been shown to slow down the enzymes that destroy the mood-boosting neurotransmitters. What foods provide omega-3 fatty acids? Fish is the best source, while flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts are vegetarian sources.On the flip side, there are mood-depressing foods that either leave us depleted and weary or strip us of our mood-boosting compounds. We’ve all heard that sugar and refined carbohydrates give us a quick burst of energy but leave us depleted and collapsed. Caffeine has a similar effect and has been shown to inhibit serotonin production. Aspartame, too, can inhibit serotonin. Chemical additives and food colorings have been studied extensively for their effects on mood and behavior, especially in children. I’d limit all of the above.I am not claiming that food can cure or create any mood. I recognize that it is just one component and that most emotions are based on aspects of life that we can’t control. But I am a big fan of focusing on what we can control: the food we eat. I’m also a fan of a house full of happy people. That certainly boosts my mood. Seidenberg is co-founder of Nourish Schools, a D.C. nutrition education company. Reprints

White men have much to discuss about mass shootings
By Charlotte Childress and Harriet Childress, Charlotte and Harriet Childress are researchers and consultants on social and political issues. They are the co-authors of “Clueless at the Top: While the Rest of Us Turn Elsewhere for Life, Liberty, and Happiness,” on outdated hierarchies in American culture.
Imagine if African American men and boys were committing mass shootings month after month, year after year. Articles and interviews would flood the media, and we’d have political debates demanding that African Americans be “held accountable.” Then, if an atrocity such as the Newtown, Conn., shootings took place and African American male leaders held a news conference to offer solutions, their credibility would be questionable. The public would tell these leaders that they need to focus on problems in their own culture and communities.
But when the criminals and leaders are white men, race and gender become the elephant in the room. Nearly all of the mass shootings in this country in recent years — not just Newtown, Aurora, Fort Hood, Tucson and Columbine — have been committed by white men and boys. Yet when the National Rifle Association (NRA), led by white men, held a news conference after the Newtown massacre to advise Americans on how to reduce gun violence, its leaders’ opinions were widely discussed. Unlike other groups, white men are not used to being singled out. So we expect that many of them will protest it is unfair if we talk about them. But our nation must correctly define their contribution to our problem of gun violence if it is to be solved. When white men try to divert attention from gun control by talking about mental health issues, many people buy into the idea that the United States has a national mental health problem, or flawed systems with which to address those problems, and they think that is what produces mass shootings.But women and girls with mental health issues are not picking up semiautomatic weapons and shooting schoolchildren. Immigrants with mental health issues are not committing mass shootings in malls and movie theaters. Latinos with mental health issues are not continually killing groups of strangers. Each of us is programmed from childhood to believe that the top group of our hierarchies — and in the U.S. culture, that’s white men — represents everyone, so it can feel awkward, even ridiculous, when we try to call attention to those people as a distinct group and hold them accountable. For example, our schools teach American history as the history of everyone in this nation. But the stories we learn are predominantly about white men. To study the history of other groups, people have to take separate classes, such as African American history, women’s history or Native American history. And if we take “Hispanic American History,” we don’t expect to learn “Asian American History,” because a class about anyone but white men is assumed not to be inclusive of anyone else. This societal and cultural programming makes it easy for conservative, white-male-led groups to convince the nation that an organization led by white men, such as the NRA or the tea party movement, can represent the interests of the entire nation when, in fact, they predominately represent only their own experiences and perspectives. If life were equitable, white male gun-rights advocates would face some serious questions to assess their degree of credibility and objectivity. We would expect them to explain: What facets of white male culture create so many mass shootings?Why are so many white men and boys producing and entertaining themselves with violent video games and other media? Why do white men buy, sell and manufacture guns for profit; attend gun shows; and demonstrate for unrestricted gun access disproportionately more than people of other ethnicities or races? Why are white male congressmen leading the fight against gun control? If Americans ask the right questions on gun issues, we will get the right answers. These answers will encourage white men to examine their role in their own culture and to help other white men and boys become healthier and less violent. Read more from PostOpinions:
