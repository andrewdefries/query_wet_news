Obama’s budget shines spotlight on Romney’s low millionaire tax rate
By Greg Sargent
One of the most interesting things in Obama’s speech unveiling his budget just now — in pure political terms, at least — was that he proposed that a form of the Buffett Rule should be central to it. Whether by coincidence or design, this will only draw more attention to the fact that the likely GOP presidential nominee himself benefits handsomely from the unfairness in the tax code that the Buffet Rule would undo.
Jackie Calmes explains the proposal:
President Obama proposed in his new budget blueprint to tax dividends of the wealthiest taxpayers for the first time as ordinary income subject to their top income-tax rate, which was the level that existed until the Bush administration lowered the rates. The proposal, being released on Monday morning with other parts of the budget, would raise about $140 billion over 10 years.
Assuming that the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year, as required by law, dividends for the top 2 percent of income-earners would be taxed at 39.6 percent. Before 2002, the richest taxpayers paid a 35 percent tax on dividends, like on all ordinary income.
Republicans are certain to try to block the change, as they have done to thwart Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign promise to end the Bush-era tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year.
Here again you’re seeing one of the potential perils for the GOP of picking Romney as their standard bearer. This all but ensures that Romney’s one wealth — and, more to the point, his own lower tax rate — will be central to the political conversation for the next few months. As I’ve been noting here, the Buffett Rule will be voted on in Congress in some form or other, whether it’s as a stand-alone bill, part of a larger proposal, or part of Obama’s budget. Virtually all Republicans are expected to vote against it. If the Dem game plan is to turn Romney into the walking embodiment of everything that’s unfair about our economy and tax code, and of all the ways it’s rigged against the middle class and for the rich, this will only help support that narrative.
Indeed, if Dems have their way, Republicans will be voting en masse to protect the wealth of their own presidential candidate, one who is worth as much as $250 million and is benefitting to an untold degree from a tax rate that’s lower than many middle class taxpayers pay. Maybe I’m missing something, but this doesn’t seem like very good optics for Romney or the GOP.

With a natural gas tax, everyone can benefit
By Steven Pearlstein, E-mail the writer
Every once in awhile, one of those economic policy dogfights comes along that involves huge sums of money and pits one powerful industry against another. The K Street lobbying machine goes into overdrive, dueling studies are commissioned, the think tanks start churning out policy briefs and rival committee hearings are scheduled on Capitol Hill. As a journalist, my rule has been to never let such a donnybrook go to waste.
The latest example is the battle over natural gas exports, as reported by Steven Mufson elsewhere on this page. The “fracking” revolution that makes it possible to extract great wealth from the country’s rich veins of shale deposits now holds the promise of turning the United States into the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. The gas gusher has already driven down domestic gas prices to all-time lows, with power companies rushing to convert coal-burning plants to gas while energy-intensive industries lay plans to move production back home from overseas. Proceeds from the sale of drilling rights have already created a new generation of Jed Clampetts, and natural gas boomtowns are springing up from the Appalachians to the Rockies. What once was a politician’s fantasy — “energy independence” — now appears within reach.
Steven Pearlstein is a Pulitzer Prize-winning business and economics columnist at The Washington Post. Archive

Indeed, so much gas is flowing into the U.S. market that a huge gap has developed between the low price here and the high prices being paid in markets such as Europe and Japan. The gap is so large that, even allowing for the considerable cost of liquefying the gas, transporting it in ships and re-gassifying it at the other end, there is still an outsized profit to be made from exporting our cheap and plentiful supply.Unlike other goods, however, exports of natural gas require a permit from the Department of Energy, which by law is required to consider a broad range of national economic, security and environmental interests in deciding whether to issue a permit. The natural gas industry touts a long list of benefits that will flow from exports, among them more jobs, higher incomes, increased investment, additional state and federal revenue and a lower trade deficit.Not so fast say the electric power companies and chemical companies and other big users of natural gas. Permitting a large amount of the nation’s gas supply to be exported will raise the domestic price by as much as 30 percent — and with it the price of products and services — jeopardizing jobs, income, investment, tax revenues and export sales.The question, in other words, isn’t whether there will be a windfall to be earned from the newfound abundance of natural gas. The real question is: Who will get to grab that windfall — the energy industry or its customers?I don’t know about you, but I’m having a hard time deciding which team to root for in this contest. While free trade tends to benefit the whole economy over the long run, increasing the overall size of the economic pie, there are times when it can also have a pronounced effect on how the pie is divided. This would seem to be one of those times.But what if there were a policy that preserved most of the macroeconomic benefits of free trade but distributed the benefits more fairly? As it turns out, there is one — although you are unlikely to hear about it from either the gas industry or its customers.I’m talking about a tax on natural gas, imposed at the wellhead, that would effectively raise the price from current levels to those closer to the world price. The effect on chemical companies and power companies and other end users would be roughly the same as allowing unrestricted exports to drive up the price. But instead of the energy industry capturing all the windfall, much of it could be captured instead by the government.The proceeds from this tax could be rebated to consumers to offset the impact of higher electric prices. Or they could be used to compensate workers in the coal industry for job losses suffered as a result of new air pollution regulations and conversion of coal-burning plants to gas. Or they could be used simply to lower the government’s operating deficit or lessen the need for painful spending cuts or tax increases.Such a tax would have to have some flexibility built into it, moving up or down with gas prices on the U.S. and global markets. And it would have to be modest enough to still provide a healthy profit for natural gas companies to compensate them for the risk involved in investing huge sums to build the infrastructure required for exports. The potential windfall is so large, however, that even after making these allowances, there could be $10 billion or more left over each year for the rest of us.There is nothing particularly radical about this idea. There was once a windfall tax on oil company profits that was roughly structured this way. And almost every big energy exporting country accomplishes the same policy objective, either through royalty schemes or state ownership of energy companies. We could have a long philosophical debate about why oil and gas should be treated differently than software and soybeans, but the reality is that that’s the way it is done everywhere else. It’s also been true here, where special rules and restrictions and incentives have long been applied.So put me down in favor of exporting all the natural gas the rest of the world wants to buy, just as long as the American taxpayers get cut into the deal. Otherwise, we’re better off keeping our God-given bounty for ourselves and reaping the economic benefits that come from cheaper energy.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
New poll has McAuliffe maintaining Va. lead, makes it unlikely Sarvis will be in last debate
By Ben Pershing, E-mail the writer
A new survey of the Virginia governor’s race has good news for Democrat Terry McAuliffe, giving him an eight-point lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II amid strong opposition to the federal government shutdown.
It also has bad news for Libertarian Robert Sarvis, who now looks unlikely to participate in the final debate of the contest on Oct. 24, at Virginia Tech.
Va. General Assembly status report THE ISSUES | A look at where key bills stand in the legislative session scheduled to end March 8.

The Quinnipiac University poll shows McAuliffe at 47 percent, Cuccinelli at 39 percent and Sarvis at 8 percent among likely voters. The survey is at least the 11th public poll in a row to show McAuliffe maintaining a lead of between five and nine points.Under an agreement negotiated by Cuccinelli, McAuliffe and the Virginia Tech debate’s sponsor — WDBJ (Channel 7) in Roanoke — Sarvis needed to be polling at 10 percent or above as of Thursday to be given a spot on stage. His inclusion will “rely heavily” on the average of polls from the past three weeks on the RealClearPolitics Web site. Before the Quinnipiac survey, that average stood at 9.1 percent.The final decision could be announced as early as Thursday. A debate without Sarvis would be a welcome development for Cuccinelli, the state attorney general. Polls have suggested Sarvis is drawing the majority of his support from the Republican candidate, and Cuccinelli’s campaign lobbied behind the scenes to keep the Libertarian off the stage in Blacksburg. (Without Sarvis, Quinnipiac has McAuliffe seven points ahead of Cuccinelli, 49-42.)But the Quinnipiac poll also has unwelcome news for Cuccinelli. It shows that a large majority of likely voters, 71 percent, are opposed to Republicans’ willingness to shut down the federal government in effort to halt the Affordable Care Act. While Democrats are far more likely to oppose the shutdown than Republicans, 70 percent of independent voters also are against it.Although they oppose the shutdown overall, 58 percent of Virginians said they have not been “personally inconvenienced” by it.Overall, McAuliffe gets 40 percent of the independent vote, compared with 38 percent for Cuccinelli and 13 percent for Sarvis.“With less than a month to go until Election Day, McAuliffe is doing better among Democrats than Cuccinelli is among Republicans. McAuliffe and Libertarian Robert Sarvis are denying Cuccinelli the domination among independents he needs for victory,” Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said in a statement accompanying the poll Thursday.“To get back in the race, Cuccinelli must bring back into the fold Republican defectors and pull in more independent voters — a tough task this far into the campaign.” As in other polls, Quinnipiac shows Cuccinelli’s personal ratings in negative territory. He is viewed favorably by 39 percent of likely voters and unfavorably by 49 percent; McAuliffe’s rating is 41 to 40.It shows a continued wide gender gap — McAuliffe leads among women, 53 to 34 — and finds that 46 percent of Virginians believe Cuccinelli is too conservative, while 38 percent say McAuliffe is too liberal. Quinnipiac did not release numbers testing the down-ballot races. But it did find large majorities of likely voters do not know enough about the candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general to have opinions about them.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Letter to the Editor
What ‘Citizens United’ established
E. J. Dionne Jr. [“The court’s catastrophe,” op-ed, Feb. 6] seemed so exercised by what he believes the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case concluded that he ignored what it did and did not do. It did not, for example, have anything to do with the ability of “the brute force of millionaires and billionaires” such as Sheldon Adelson to spend their money to support candidates they favor. That right of all, rooted in the First Amendment, was sustained as far back as the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 in Buckley v. Valeo, which upheld the right of individuals to make independent expenditures in political campaigns as they choose. Does Mr. Dionne not recall the privately funded, if odious, Swift Boat advertisements in 2004 or the vast expenditures of George Soros?
Mr. Dionne bemoaned the supposed impact of Citizens United in facilitating the efforts of those who have sought to disguise a donor’s identity. He should recall that the Supreme Court, in Citizens United, upheld by an 8 to 1 vote the constitutionality of the disclosure requirements adopted by Congress. If more are needed (and I agree that they are), that rests with Congress, not the court.
Floyd Abrams, New York
The writer represented Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) before the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United v. FEC.●
Whatever one may think about the majority opinion in the Citizens United decision, it seems incomprehensible and irresponsible to discuss this Supreme Court case without a single mention of the First Amendment, as E.J. Dionne Jr. did.
Even the lengthy dissent by Justice John Paul Stevens took pains to acknowledge that principles of free speech (and free speech’s restrictions) were at the heart of this case, but there was nary a word on the issue from Mr. Dionne in his attack on aggressive corporations.
Such neglect of the First Amendment is doubly ironic coming from a journalist. Jonathan Auerbach, Cheverly

Mark Sanford’s campaign stumbles as ex-wife’s allegations lead GOP to abandon him
Video: Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford (R) is facing accusations filed by his former wife just as he tries to restart his political career.
By Karen Tumulty and Aaron Blake, E-mail the writers
MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Just two weeks after former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford won the Republican nomination in a special election for a House seat, his bid for a political comeback veered back into weirdness on Wednesday amid revelations that his former wife is taking him to court for trespassing and that the national GOP is washing its hands of his candidacy.
Sanford’s strong victory in the April 2 primary had made him the presumptive favorite in this heavily Republican congressional district. It was also read as a sign that he had begun to find redemption after the 2009 adultery scandal that ended his marriage and put his governorship in jeopardy.

A new round of setbacks began when the Associated Press reported that Sanford and his ex-wife, Jenny Sanford, were due to appear in court on May 9 — just two days after the special election to fill a vacant House seat that Mark Sanford once held. Sanford has been ordered to appear at a hearing on his ex-wife’s complaint that she caught him leaving her house in February, using his cellphone as a flashlight. He said in a statement on Wednesday that he had gone to the house to watch the Super Bowl with his son while his ex-wife was away. Tensions over victory rally
Tensions within the family also flared at Sanford’s victory rally on April 2, when he put two of his four sons onstage with the former mistress who is now his fiancee. For 17-year-old Bolton Sanford, that very public moment was the first time he had ever been in the presence of Maria Belen Chapur, according to Jenny Sanford.“That was indeed Bolton’s first intro and both boys were quite upset and visibly so,” Jenny Sanford said in a text message. A spokesman for Mark Sanford declined to comment.Sanford’s stumbles have significantly brightened the prospects of Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a businesswoman and political newcomer who has been making few public appearances but who has benefited from the reflected celebrity and fundraising help of her brother, comedian Stephen Colbert. In a brief appearance at a diner here on Wednesday, Busch declined to comment on the latest controversy surrounding her opponent, saying she preferred to focus on jobs and the economy. Busch’s best hope of victory in this district, which went 58 percent for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential contest, is to win a significant share of the votes of women — both independents and Republicans, her strategists say. Sanford’s behavior is one reason her team believes she has a chance of doing that.“I’m definitely not a supporter of his, is how I’d put it,” said Alissa DeCarlo, a waitress at the Boulevard Diner, where Busch made a quick round of the tables, making small talk with patrons.
GOP group steers clear
The National Republican Congressional Committee on Wednesday took the unusual step of signaling that it will not spend money on his campaign.“Mark Sanford has proven he knows what it takes to win elections. At this time, the NRCC will not be engaged in this special election,” the NRCC said in a statement, which was first reported by Politico.The committee has spent very little on the race so far, but its public declaration that it would not was a sign of its dismay over its prospects for holding on to a conservative district. The House seat was vacated when then-Rep. Tim Scott was appointed to fill the unexpired Senate term of Jim DeMint, who resigned in December.A Republican familiar with the committee’s decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss strategy, said it would be “foolish” for the party to invest in Sanford’s campaign.“It’s not out of the realm of possibility for him to win — stranger things have happened in special elections,” the Republican said. “But the fact that he wasted precious time and money rehabilitating his image, only to squander that, makes it very foolish for outside groups to commit resources.”The nonpartisan Cook Political Report downgraded Sanford’s chances on Wednesday, labeling the race a tossup after the NRCC decision. At one point, Sanford’s brand of combative conservatism had elevated him to the ranks of those who were frequently talked about as potential presidential contenders.His affair became public after he disappeared for five days in June 2009, saying he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. It turned out the trip was actually an assignation in Argentina with Chapur, whom Sanford then tearfully declared to be his “soul mate.”Yet he also has seemed unable to break his bond with Jenny Sanford, which was a political partnership as well as a marriage. In fact, when he decided to run again for his old congressional seat, Sanford even asked his ex-wife to consider managing his campaign, as she had his early races. Jenny Sanford declined. Trespass complaint
In her court complaint, Jenny Sanford contended that the former governor “entered into a pattern of entering onto plaintiff’s property. Plaintiff has informed defendant on a number of occasions that this behavior is in violation of the court’s order and has demanded that it not occur again.”In a statement, Sanford said he had gone to his wife’s house to watch the second half of the Super Bowl with his 14-year-old son. “Given she was out of town, I tried to reach her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and met her at the back steps under the light of my cellphone when she returned and told her what had happened,” he said. “There is always another side to every story, and while I am particularly curious how records that were sealed to avoid the boys dealing with embarrassment are now somehow exposed less than three weeks before this election, I agree with Jenny that the media is no place to debate what is ultimately a family court matter.”It was not the first legal complaint that Jenny Sanford has lodged regarding her husband’s behavior during their separation and since their divorce in 2010. According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, Jenny Sanford filed a complaint against Mark Sanford in March 2012, alleging that he violated the terms of having their sons on the Sanford family’s Coosaw plantation. Both sides declined to offer any more details.
