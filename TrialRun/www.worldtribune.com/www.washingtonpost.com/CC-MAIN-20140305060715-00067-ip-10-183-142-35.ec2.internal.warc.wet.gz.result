Obama picked wrong school to give speech
By Valerie Strauss
The Philadelphia school chosen for President Obama’s second annual “back to school” speech to students around the country is consistently ranked as a great public college-preparatory institution. That’s why he should have picked a different school to visit. By	Valerie Strauss | 05:00 AM ET, 09/14/2010 | Permalink | Comments (

Going back to college at 59: You can't do it "on a shoestring"
By Valerie Strauss
By Kay Dawson. I went back to school at the age of 59--and I’ve learned a lot more than Spanish. Books are heavier. Combining a caffeinated soft drink and a two-hour class with a 59-year-old bladder is not a great idea. Professors are so young. But what seems to have changed the most from when I was last in school is that it is no longer possible to go to college on a shoestring.

Chief technology officer Aneesh Chopra to step down
By Ed O’Keefe
This is an excerpt from a post by the Post’s Ed O’Keefe, who reports on The Federal Eye that Aneesh Chopra, the nation’s first chief technology officer, will step down:
The nation’s first chief technology officer plans to step down from his White House job, according to administration officials.
Aneesh Chopra, tapped to serve as the first White House chief technology officer, is stepping down in the near future; a formal announcement is expected later Friday.
The news was first reported by FedScoop.
Chopra is part of a trio of D.C. area tech and business heavyweights hired by President Obama at the start of his term to address government management and technological concerns.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Economy shrinks as federal spending cuts trump private sector’s growth
View Photo Gallery — The U.S. economy contracted slightly in the final months of 2012 as defense spending plummeted. See where the U.S. stands in the World Bank’s 2011 list of countries with the strongest economies. By Ylan Q. Mui, E-mail the writer
The American economy shrank at the end of last year for the first time since the recession ended, according to new government data, as deep cuts in federal spending torpedoed what otherwise looked to be a modest recovery.
Consumers did their part, spending more and opening their wallets for bigger-ticket items such as automobiles. Companies invested in new equipment and software. Housing continued to climb.

GDP in the private and government sectors. But those gains were overshadowed by the massive decline in government spending, especially in defense. The result was a 0.1 percent annualized dip in the nation’s gross domestic product. The report highlighted the contrast between what appears to be a slowly healing private sector and a public sector still buffeted by budget cuts. The economy was “being pulled in opposite directions . . . and ending up going nowhere,” said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp.The biggest threat to the recovery now appears to be Washington, with lawmakers gearing up for another round of debates over spending cuts and raising the nation’s debt ceiling. Wednesday’s GDP report served only to harden the battle lines between Republicans who believe significant spending cuts are necessary to balance the federal budget over the next decade and Democrats who argue they will stunt growth. “Do we make progress in a balanced way on our deficits? Or do we, you know, inflict harm on our economy here in Washington at a time when our economy is actually showing very positive signs?” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a daily news briefing Wednesday.But Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, called the idea that economic growth relies on government spending “a Keynesian pipe dream.” The best thing Washington can do for the economy is to rein in the deficit, GOP leaders said. “Only the private sector can lead a robust, sustained recovery,” said William Allison, spokesman for House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). “Government can never take its place.”Fourth-quarter economic activity was far below the 1.1 percent annual growth rate economists had predicted. Exports fell at a rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting the slowdown in Europe. Businesses also drew down their inventories after unusually high stockpiling in the previous period. That reduced economic growth by 1.27 percentage points.But perhaps the biggest surprise was the size of the drop in federal spending: 15 percent at an annual rate during the fourth quarter. Defense spending suffered an even bigger decline, dragging down growth by 1.3 percentage points. Many agencies began adopting contingency plans, instituted hiring freezes and delayed projects in anticipation of widespread budget cuts — all of which depress spending. Still, economists said the decline looks especially dramatic because government spending had jumped more than usual in the previous quarter. That may have been a reflection of government agencies and private contractors shifting spending earlier in the year in anticipation of budget cuts, boosting third-quarter growth at the expense of the fourth. Economists are hopeful that federal and defense spending will return to more normal levels over the next few months, provided Washington can reach a deal on budget cuts and the deficit.“I don’t really read anything into the number,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “I don’t think anything has fundamentally changed in the economy.”The negative numbers mask the broad-based growth in the private sector. Consumer spending picked up to a 2.2 percent annual pace as incomes enjoyed a bump from higher dividend payments. Housing rose at a 15.3 percent rate, and businesses increased investments in equipment and software after curtailing them during the third quarter. For the entire year, GDP grew at a 2.2 percent rate, a faster pace than in 2011. “The good thing about this recovery is that it keeps on keeping on, and the bad thing . . . is that it doesn’t take off,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.The country is entering 2013 on a weaker footing than expected, making it more vulnerable to the whims of Washington. Nathaniel Karp, chief economist for BBVA Compass, said it is impossible to isolate the consequences of continuing cuts in federal spending. Eventually, they will spill over into the rest of the economy.“Hopefully this is happening because you’re adjusting your long-term financial stability,” he said. But, he added, “that is a price you have to pay now.” Federal Reserve officials Wednesday alluded to the downbeat GDP report as they wrapped up their two-day meeting to set monetary policy. The Fed said economic activity “paused” in recent months but cited weather and “other transitory factors” as the main culprits. It maintained its pledge to help stimulate the economy by purchasing $85 billion in long-term securities each month and keeping its target interest rate at a historic low. Stock markets seemed to shrug off the news that the economy contracted but began falling after the Fed released its comments. The major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 0.3 percent.Economists also cautioned that Wednesday’s report was the government’s first crack at measuring economic activity in the fourth quarter and that the data are often revised. An updated report is slated for release Feb. 28, and many economists predicted it will be more upbeat.But Steve Ricchiuto, chief economist at brokerage firm Mizuho Securities, was less optimistic.“The preliminary number is negative,” he said. “ . . . But the recovery is supposedly gaining momentum. Sorry, I don’t see it.” Lori Montgomery and Zachary A. Goldfarb contributed to this report.

By Heloise, Dear Readers: Today, it is hard to find anyone who doesn’t own a cellphone! In the United States alone, people upgrade to a new phone every year or so. This means there are millions of phones waiting to be RECYCLED! Throwing them into the trash is not eco-friendly, since cellphones contain hazardous-waste components.
The best way to recycle is to research which groups or companies are accepting them in your community. Many phone retailers, state or local waste-management companies and charities collect them to refurbish and give to battered-women’s shelters or to those in the military. You can keep up with technology and do the right thing for the environment! -- Heloise
PAMPER YOUR PETDear Readers: We bathe our dogs as needed, but rarely do we clean their collars and leashes! Here are a few hints to help you:For canvas or nylon leashes and collars, brush to remove dirt and other yuck! Take off all metal tags. Use a little detergent in the washing machine, and put the leash and collar into a cotton pillowcase and tie (or safety-pin) it closed. Place in the washing machine on the gentle cycle, and let the items air-dry. Don’t put them in the dryer!For leather items, wipe clean with a damp microfiber cloth and clean periodically with saddle soap, if needed. -- HeloiseSHARING COUPONSDear Heloise: After reading your article in The (Canton, Ohio) Repository about giving coupons to other people, I had to write to you for the first time.I take coupons for diapers and baby food to a laundromat and put them on a table or a bulletin board. My grandson has a girlfriend who’s a real collector of coupons, and I give her all the ones I don’t use. She has used so many that at times she has even gotten cash back. -- Paula D., Canton, OhioNAIL SUBSTITUTEDear Heloise: I am an artist and have to change paintings often. That can leave an ugly nail hole. I just use an old sewing-machine needle. They are strong and sharp, and sewers change them often (recycle!). I nail gently, up to the hilt (like a small nail), with a hammer, to where the needle gets fatter. When I pull it out, it won’t leave a big hole. -- Andy P., via e-mailAndy, have you been peeking at my walls? I’ve done this for years, but please note that this is for lightweight items. I’ve also used several needles for one painting. -- HeloiseSPRAY-BOTTLE SAFETYDear Heloise: I would like to remind anyone who has small children around to make sure they close all their spray bottles. Children love spray bottles, and if sprayed into their eyes, it can be very dangerous. -- Janet T., Mayer, Ariz.Good point, Janet! Spray bottles do come with “on/off” positions. We just have to remember to put them in the “off” position when done. -- Heloise
Send a hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, Tex. 78279-5000, fax it to 210-HELOISE or e-mail it to Heloise@Heloise.com. Please include your city and state.

City street in D.C. reopens after 34 years
Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post - A look at City Center DC, backed by investment from Qatar, on December, 13, 2013 in Washington, D.C.
Buy This Photo
By Aaron C. Davis, E-mail the writer
For 34 years, 10th and I streets NW has been an imaginary place, a point of hallowed political ground under the carpeting — and then rubble — of the old Washington Convention Center.
Six blocks from the White House, it’s the spot where then-candidate Bill Clinton secured the endorsement of the nation’s largest teachers unions on his way to the presidency. It’s where 19,000 swayed to an African protest dance and listened to Nelson Mandela a few months after he was released from prison. And it’s where Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan proclaimed then-D.C. Mayor Marion Barry a “repentant soul” worthy of reelection despite an ongoing trial for possession of crack cocaine.
More news about D.C. politicsWhere they stand: Candidates for D.C. mayor
A look at the Democratic candidates’ views on some of the most pressing issues facing Washington.
The face of new voters in D.C.
Since Vincent Gray won the 2010 Democratic primary by 13,124 votes, more than 80,000 new Democrats have registered in the District. The candidates

It has also been a roadblock in the city’s grid — a place that drivers had to steer around.Last week, for the first time since the old convention center imploded in a cloud of dust nine years ago — and, for that matter, since Ronald Reagan was a new president — 10th and I returned to the grid. With the construction of CityCenterDC, the spot has been rebuilt to form an intersection.If you’re Don Ford, make that a “beautiful” reincarnation of city asphalt.On Friday morning, Ford slowed his slate-gray Nissan Murano to a stop at 10th and G, just south of the new stretch. He glanced at his dashboard and broke into a toothy grin, clocking the couple of minutes the path might shave off a bad morning commute.“Oh, it could definitely get me there faster,” said Ford, 57, stepping on the gas at the next green light to motor on to his IT job in Virginia.Downtown, where every inch of asphalt is increasingly a battleground for commuters, bicyclists and people looking for a place to park, 10th and I has something for everyone: 1,000 feet of new pavement, bike lanes in every direction and about 30 parking spots along the curbs.Although no sign marks the road as the site where an estimated 20 million attended speeches and conventions over the years, the glass-and-steel buildings that flank the spot are a monument to a new era in Washington.The two streets bisect like pizza slices at CityCenterDC, a $1 billion development that is an emblem to the effort by developers to reshape downtown not just into a place for tourists and conventioneers but those willing to pay Manhattan-like rents and mortgages to live in the city.The first handful of renters moved into CityCenter’s nearly 700 apartments last week, where luxury units with rooftop dog parks and decorative moss gardens average $4,400 to $5,200 a month for two bedrooms. The development’s two-bedroom condos, going for $1.2 million to $1.5 million, are 70 percent sold. A half-million square feet of office space and 40 retail shops are slated to begin opening next year.Even the reconstituted intersection isn’t a conventional roadway. The 15 ground-level inches of asphalt and rock base are the roof of a 1,500-space parking garage that extends 50 feet, and four levels, beneath CityCenter.D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray last week called the opening a “momentous occasion.”“With the reopening of 10th and I streets and the completion of the condos and apartments, we are seeing a transformation in the downtown area,” Gray (D) said.For now, what Washingtonians may notice most is the road. For the first time since 1980, commuters can cut south along 10th, uninterrupted between Rhode Island and Constitution avenues. East to west, the new block of I offers a way to cut corners to New York Avenue and H Street.Google and Apple map tools do not recognize the spot, but drivers stuck in traffic around Mount Vernon Square have started to notice it.“I was just sitting there and kept looking for a way out,” said Doug Bachman, a Virginia driver who stumbled upon the new stretch Friday after dropping off his wife for work and then getting stuck in traffic north of CityCenter.After more than three decades of hitting a dead end at New York Avenue, commuters heading south into downtown are conditioned to turn east or west. Bachman looked ahead and saw an empty road.“I never come this way,” he said. “I had no idea. I’m glad it was here today.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
At Democratic convention’s street fest in Charlotte, funnel cake and campaigning
View Photo Gallery — 2012 DNC preparations: Democrats are gearing up for their national convention in Charlotte. By Amy Gardner, E-mail the writer
CHARLOTTE — There were the electric cars, the climbing wall, the sustainable village and all the other things that Democrats like to show off on display at CarolinaFest, the street festival that kicked off the Democratic National Convention here Monday.
And then there was the real purpose of the event, at least for President Obama’s campaign.

“You want a free bumper sticker?” a young Obama worker shouted to people passing the president’s campaign booth, standing three feet above them like a 21st-century carnival barker. “Text 62262 and you can have one. Did you do it? Perfect! Here you go.”In the space of a few hours, organizers had passed out hundreds of bumper stickers, collecting just as many cellphone numbers and — they hope — new recruits who could help replicate the grass-roots force that grew out of the convention in Denver four years ago. Others trolled the crowd, estimated at 30,000, with clipboards looking for would-be voters to register. And volunteers asked for signatures to support women’s initiatives and Obama’s health-care law.“There are a lot of volunteers passing by,” said Samantha Steiner, 27, a Charlotte resident and registered independent who is not sure who she will vote for in November. “I don’t necessarily identify with the Democratic Party, but the festival has allowed me to find ways to participate.”CarolinaFest was meant to be many things for the Democratic Party. It was a classic Labor Day street party, with water-ice stands, funnel cakes and bouncy slides. It was a public-relations parade intended to portray Democrats as inclusive (it was free and open to the public), compassionate (it featured dozens of good-works demonstrations) and fun (who doesn’t like a climbing wall?).The festival was interrupted twice during the day by short-lived but torrential downpours, and it was cut short by the threat of severe weather. James Taylor, the headline performer, was singing when organizers called it a night in the early evening.In some cases, the politics and the party were an odd mix.At one end of the festival, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer was spotted walking down the street in a suit and button-down shirt, taking in the scene.At the other end, organizers with the North Carolina AFL-CIO beckoned passers-by with a provocative offer: “Free hugs from union thugs!”“You ready for a hug?” Lora Banner, a Teamsters member and United Parcel Service worker from nearby Gaston County in a blond up-do, asked one man who had strayed closer to the tent. “Come on over here!” She put her arms around him.Irritated that the Democrats chose to hold their convention in North Carolina, considered a non-union-friendly state, many labor groups scaled back or yanked their financial support for the event. The state AFL-CIO, however, opted to reach out for the folks on the street. By 4 p.m., a team of volunteers including schoolteachers, firefighters and other card-carrying union members estimated they had doled out about 400 hugs — and handed out cards showing how huggees could find a photo of their embrace on the organization’s Web site.“We thought it was a good way to show that union members are not scary people,” said MaryBe McMillan, secretary treasurer of the state group.Even one of the centerpiece debates of the election campaign played out as street festival fare. Gagandeep Mangat, a radiologist from St. Petersburg, Fla., stood beside an RV belonging to Patients Over Politics, an initiative led by physicians in support of the Obama health-care law. “We are a group of physicians who want to make sure that people understand why it is important that we have this law,” he said.As he tried to explain, he was interrupted by a California woman who wanted to know whether he supported adding a “holistic medicine component” to the law. Mangat emphasized the importance of simply preserving the law. “If we have the law then we could add anything to it,” he said. Though the group is officially non-partisan, the doctors, who drove the RV from the Republican convention in Tampa to Charlotte, are also embarked on a voter registration effort they hope will help preserve the law. “This started because as doctors we were so frustrated that our health-care system was not working for the patients,” said one of the group’s founders, Alice Chen, an internist from Los Angeles, “and the only people talking about it were either policy people or politicians.” Even the most lighthearted features of the festival carried a political, or at least cultural, message: A “Peace In, Peace Out” yoga booth. A “Youth Soccer for Social Change” game underway in a parking lot. “Naturals for Obama,” a support group of black women who don’t straighten their hair.Looming over all of that was a message from the Charlotte Diocese — a banner across the exterior wall of St. Peter’s Catholic Church reading: “Protect the Unborn, defend marriage, safeguard religious liberty.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Senators outline bipartisan deal reached on gun background checks
Video: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), along side Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), unveiled a bipartisan deal to expand background checks on all commercial sales of guns on Wednesday.
By Ed O’Keefe and Tom Hamburger, E-mail the writers
A pair of pro-gun senators announced a compromise plan Wednesday to expand background checks for many firearm purchases.
The proposal stopped short of the expansive system sought by President Obama and many gun-control advocates. But it won swift bipartisan backing and became the template for what would be the most consequential congressional action on firearm regulations since the 1990s — suddenly upending the polarized politics of gun control. In collaboration with

Bloomberg signs off on Manchin-Toomey gun compromise
Aaron Blake The New York mayor and gun-control supporter says he will push hard for the bill.
It won praise from advocates of stiffer restrictions, including Obama and New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), reflecting the eagerness on that side of the debate to score concessions after months of intense opposition from the National Rifle Association.The NRA opposed the plan, which was offered by two lawmakers it had backed for years, Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). But an otherwise critical statement the NRA released after a Toomey-Manchin news conference cited “a positive development” in the move toward a background check system the group viewed as less intrusive than the one being pushed by Bloomberg and the White House.The Toomey-Manchin plan would extend the current background check requirement from covering only sales at licensed dealerships to any sale that takes place at a gun show or that was advertised in print or online. However, checks would not be required for many sales between private individuals — a loophole that many gun-control advocates had hoped would be closed. The proposal also would expand some gun rights. Gun dealers would be able to sell firearms across state lines, for example, and gun owners with state-issued permits to carry concealed weapons would be allowed to take their firearms through states that don’t allow concealed weapons. The senators also called for a national commission to evaluate causes of violence, including the entertainment industry’s role. The NRA has long recommended the gun rights expansions. And gun-control advocates, including the White House, appeared ready to accept such compromises in the name of a broader deal — effectively conceding that their hopes for universal background checks and bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines had proved unrealistic in the months since the Dec. 14 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., jump-started the gun debate.“This is not my bill, and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger,” Obama said in a statement Wednesday. “But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don’t have to agree on everything to know that we’ve got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence.”Toomey and Manchin’s appearance Wednesday followed weeks of negotiations. The Republican stepped into the mix in the final days when conversations with a GOP colleague, Sen. Tom Coburn (Okla.), stalled amid disagreements about whether an expanded check system would collect records about gun owners. Law enforcement officials say records are necessary to track criminal use of firearms, but many gun-rights activists consider them a threat to Second Amendment rights. The new proposal would require that all sales covered under a new system be recorded by licensed dealers.Toomey predicted that the plan would pick up support from conservative Senate and House Republicans. “Candidly, I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control,” he said. “I think it’s common sense.”Manchin said the plan would force both sides to make concessions. “All of them have to look at it and say: Listen, are the gun show loopholes closed? Absolutely,” he said. “Are Internet sales stopped from proliferating to a much larger degree? Absolutely. Did we create new law? No. We expanded on existing law. The things the NRA would love are in this bill.”The men have a delicate sales job ahead. Pro-gun lawmakers and the NRA could seek to block it or offer amendments to undermine the compromise, and some lawmakers were already vowing they would do so as the legislation begins to move later this week.Even if the measure were to pass the Democratic-led Senate, it would face stiff odds in the Republican-led House.The Senate is set to vote Thursday on a “motion to proceed” to consider a gun-control bill that will be offered by Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and eventually include the Toomey-Manchin proposal. Sixty votes are needed to overcome a filibuster threatened by some conservative Republicans, and supporters appear to have secured them.The push by Toomey and Manchin to carefully woo conservatives came into play even in the choreography of Wednesday’s announcement. Toomey asked Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not to appear at the news conference, and he consented, said several aides familiar with the talks. The conservative group Heritage Action criticized the bill and its GOP sponsor, issuing a press release Wednesday stating, “We expect more of Pat Toomey.”Coburn was critical, saying the plan would encourage criminals to find loopholes. “Why wouldn’t you just make an agreement to make the purchase later after the gun show?” Coburn asked.
Behind the scenes, gun industry advocates were divided and uncertain, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Despite the NRA’s opposition, “we are looking closely at this proposal and examining its merits,” said one longtime industry advocate, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. Another, Richard Feldman, a former NRA political director and lobbyist for manufacturers, said he is “enthusiastically in support.”Late Wednesday, the NRA’s chief lobbyist wrote to members of the Senate restating opposition to the proposal and other “antigun” measures and vowing to review votes on those proposals and related procedural actions when evaluating a candidate’s suitability for NRA support. At the same time, a group recently formed by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly, promised to campaign against senators who try to block consideration of the legislation.

Danielle Ross was alone in an empty room at the Obama campaign headquarters in Kokomo, Ind., a cellphone in one hand, a voter call list in the other. She was stretched out on the carpeted floor wearing laceless sky-blue Converses, stories from the trail on her mind. It was the day before Indiana's primary, and she had just been chased by dogs while canvassing in a Kokomo suburb. But that was not the worst thing to occur since she postponed her sophomore year at Middle Tennessee State University, in part to hopscotch America stumping for Barack Obama.
This StoryRacist Incidents Give Some Obama Campaigners PauseTranscript: Election 2008: Racist Incidents Rattle Obama Backers
Here's the worst: In Muncie, a factory town in the east-central part of Indiana, Ross and her cohorts were soliciting support for Obama at malls, on street corners and in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and they ran into "a horrible response," as Ross put it, a level of anti-black sentiment that none of them had anticipated.
"The first person I encountered was like, 'I'll never vote for a black person,' " recalled Ross, who is white and just turned 20. "People just weren't receptive."
For all the hope and excitement Obama's candidacy is generating, some of his field workers, phone-bank volunteers and campaign surrogates are encountering a raw racism and hostility that have gone largely unnoticed -- and unreported -- this election season. Doors have been slammed in their faces. They've been called racially derogatory names (including the white volunteers). And they've endured malicious rants and ugly stereotyping from people who can't fathom that the senator from Illinois could become the first African American president.
The contrast between the large, adoring crowds Obama draws at public events and the gritty street-level work to win votes is stark. The candidate is largely insulated from the mean-spiritedness that some of his foot soldiers deal with away from the media spotlight.
Victoria Switzer, a retired social studies teacher, was on phone-bank duty one night during the Pennsylvania primary campaign. One night was all she could take: "It wasn't pretty." She made 60 calls to prospective voters in Susquehanna County, her home county, which is 98 percent white. The responses were dispiriting. One caller, Switzer remembers, said he couldn't possibly vote for Obama and concluded: "Hang that darky from a tree!"
Documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, said she, too, came across "a lot of racism" when campaigning for Obama in Pennsylvania. One Pittsburgh union organizer told her he would not vote for Obama because he is black, and a white voter, she said, offered this frank reason for not backing Obama: "White people look out for white people, and black people look out for black people."
Obama campaign officials say such incidents are isolated, that the experience of most volunteers and staffers has been overwhelmingly positive.
The campaign released this statement in response to questions about encounters with racism: "After campaigning for 15 months in nearly all 50 states, Barack Obama and our entire campaign have been nothing but impressed and encouraged by the core decency, kindness, and generosity of Americans from all walks of life. The last year has only reinforced Senator Obama's view that this country is not as divided as our politics suggest."
Campaign field work can be an exercise in confronting the fears, anxieties and prejudices of voters. Veterans of the civil rights movement know what this feels like, as do those who have been involved in battles over busing, immigration or abortion. But through the Obama campaign, some young people are having their first experience joining a cause and meeting cruel reaction.
On Election Day in Kokomo, a group of black high school students were holding up Obama signs along U.S. 31, a major thoroughfare. As drivers cruised by, a number of them rolled down their windows and yelled out a common racial slur for African Americans, according to Obama campaign staffers.
Frederick Murrell, a black Kokomo High School senior, was not there but heard what happened. He was more disappointed than surprised. During his own canvassing for Obama, Murrell said, he had "a lot of doors slammed" in his face. But taunting teenagers on a busy commercial strip in broad daylight? "I was very shocked at first," Murrell said. "Then again, I wasn't, because we have a lot of racism here."
