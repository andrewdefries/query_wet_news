Renovating a historic house takes great skill and patience
Roger K. Lewis/Roger K. Lewis - Historic homes
By Roger K. Lewis, So you want to acquire and live in a historic house, perhaps a “fixer-upper” in disrepair for sale at a favorable price?
This is an understandable, commendable aspiration in historic metropolitan Washington, where so much of the residential fabric encompasses diversely styled 18th-, 19th- and early 20th-century homes. Anyone committed to owning and restoring a historic home makes an important cultural contribution to preserving the city’s architectural legacy and venerable neighborhoods. But taking on restoration and renovation of an aging structure, while a labor of love, also can feel like the labors of Hercules.Before buying an older house, first hire a professional consultant with expertise in historic preservation and construction technology. The consultant will thoroughly survey and analyze physical conditions of the home’s exterior and interior components, from foundations to roof, from windows and doors to mechanical and electrical systems. You may be surprised by the inventory of problems and deficiencies.Is there insect or animal infestation and damage? Is there asbestos insulation, or for that matter any insulation? Where is water getting in? It always gets in somewhere. How sound are the structural framing and bearing walls, and how much rotting, cracking and settlement have occurred? What kinds of paints were used? Any toxic substances to worry about? Are there prospective building code issues?These are just a few of the questions a rigorous survey must answer. And each answer has significant financial implications, since money eventually must be invested to remedy or eliminate whatever deficiencies exist.Research by the consultant also can ascertain the neighborhood’s and building’s historic “pedigree” describing its original design and authorship, including subsequent changes — for better or worse — to the original design. This research is indispensable for proper building restoration and is required for a building to be historically registered and landmarked. Knowing the home’s history and physical conditions, you can undertake the challenging but stimulating task of deciding how specifically to stabilize, restore and, through appropriate redesign, modify the house for your use. This is when to consider contrasting preservation and renovation tactics about what to save and restore through rebuilding or refinishing; what to demolish; and what new construction to insert or add to create wonderful interior spaces. This is when you will need a good architect, a good contractor and, of course, a good budget and source of funds. Tactical decision-making about preservation and restoration necessitates determining what specific physical elements of a building significantly contribute to its historic architectural form and character. Discarding or radically changing contributing elements clearly changes the architecture. For example, altering the position, size, dimensional proportions and style of windows on a street facade is tantamount to a major facelift. But replacing broken or missing roof shingles, modernizing a bathroom, adding closets, inserting a new structural beam or sanding wood floors is not. Thus, deciding what to do with a historic house exterior worth preserving is relatively easy, typically involving remediation, refinishing and perhaps replication and replacement of existing historic elements, such as windows. Rotting, warped, loose windows and window frames not only look unsightly, but they also offer little resistance to passage of air, water and heat. For this reason, exterior work can become quite costly if old, obsolete windows need replacing. Dealing creatively with interiors can be complex. Sensitive judgment, diligent engineering and fastidious construction are essential. Structural framing must be respected and sometimes reinforced. Upgraded plumbing and electrical wiring are always desirable and often necessary. Parts of the flooring may need replacing. And if kitchens and bathrooms have not been modernized for a half century or more, they may cry for a complete makeover.During construction and in particular interior demolition, encountering conditions not seen during the initial survey is always a risk. Concealed, unforeseen problems — wood rot, mold, termite damage, failing structural connections, broken structural members, toxic substances — can result in project delays, unwanted design changes and additional cost. This is why it’s always advisable to include a generous contingency amount in the budget.In addition to mustering sufficient financial resources for acquiring, restoring and renovating a historic house, you will need to muster non-economic, personal resources: flexibility, understanding, persistence, negotiating skills, endurance — and, above all, great patience. No matter how much time you hope and believe it will take to complete the work, it will take longer. Roger K. Lewis is a practicing architect and a professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland.

Adam Scott, like many golfers, knows now what he didn’t know then
View Photo Gallery — AT&T National: Adam Scott headlines a thin field at Congressional: Australian golfer Adam Scott is one of three of the top 20 players in the world playing in the tournament in Bethesda. By Barry Svrluga, E-mail the writer
When Adam Scott won the Masters in April, he received a torrent of phone calls and text messages, the kind of outpouring that comes with a first major championship victory, particularly after a decade in the conversation with no significant prizes about which to talk. One, though, caught his attention. It was from Justin Rose, as contemporary a contemporary as Scott has, seeing they were born exactly two weeks apart and had in many ways grown up in golf together.
Scott responded to the text with encouragement for Rose: “This is our time,” he wrote. Both men are 32. Both have played professionally for more than a decade. Both have endured travails that could have derailed their careers.

Barry Svrluga Phil Mickelson’s stunning final-round 66 seals his fifth major title — and one he once thought unwinnable.
Phil Mickelson wins British Open golf championship
“Lefty” wins his fifth major title — and first claret jug — by shooting 66 in what he called “the best round arguably of my career.”

Barry Svrluga Despite being in contention for three days at the British Open, Tiger Woods continues his five-year drought without a major championship. Complete coverage
“I truly believed that comment was aimed at him — and probably a few other guys around our age as well,” Scott said Wednesday. “. . . If he didn’t believe it already, I was hoping that he would see it through me winning.”Scott is the marquee name and face at the AT&T National, which begins Thursday at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda. To win, he’ll have to beat a field that includes some of the best young players the PGA Tour has to offer, from 24-year-old Rickie Fowler to Scott’s Australian countryman Jason Day, 25, to Billy Horschel, the 26-year-old who won his first tournament earlier this season and pushed up the leader board at the U.S. Open. The course they’ll play — Congressional’s Blue Course — was mastered by Rory McIlroy just two years ago in the U.S. Open, back when the Northern Irishman was just 22.But for all the attention the kids have drawn, Scott’s message to Rose, and Rose’s subsequent victory at the U.S. Open, shows there might be something to the idea of “too much, too soon,” and that some seasoning is invaluable. Place McIlroy aside for the moment, because he could well be a generational talent, the winner of two major championships already. For others, golf is a game learned over time, and the time might be now for a talented and experienced group of 30-somethings: Scott, Rose, Brandt Snedeker, Matt Kuchar, Luke Donald, Graeme McDowell and others.“If you look at most golfers, prime years are usually in their 30s,” said Tiger Woods, the 37-year-old who will sit out the event he hosts this week because of an elbow injury. “It takes a while to learn how to win at this level and learn how to do it consistently. I think you’ve got to learn what you can and can’t do.”Since Woods won the most recent of his 14 majors, 13 of 21 major champions have been 30 or older. Since the PGA Tour established the season-long FedEx Cup competition in 2007, no winner has been younger than 29 (Bill Haas in 2011), and the average age of the champions has been 34.7. The winner of last week’s PGA Tour event was Ken Duke, a sprightly 44 who said Wednesday that he doesn’t “know anything about that Twitter stuff.” Of the 25 events on tour this year, 18 have been won by players 30 and older.For all their talent, Fowler and Day — two of the biggest stars at Congressional — have but two PGA Tour wins between them. They don’t yet have what could propel them to more victories.“It’s experience,” Scott said. “That’s the one thing you can’t have when you’re young. But you don’t necessarily need that if you get the right information to you as a young player — or . . . you’re just naturally good. But it certainly shapes all your decisions.”Day is quickly accumulating experience in the most nerve-jangling situations. In 2011, he finished tied for second at the Masters and second by himself in the U.S. Open at Congressional, trailing only McIlroy. This year, he held the lead at the Masters when he stood on the 16th tee of the final round, and bogeyed his next two holes to finish third. Two weeks ago, he held a share of the lead in the final round of the Open before finishing tied with Phil Mickelson for second, two shots behind Rose.“It takes time,” Day said Wednesday. “Some guys get there quicker than others, but it all boils down to: How much do you want it?”Fowler draws some of the largest galleries wherever he goes, but his lone win came last year in Charlotte, and he has just one finish in the top five in his past 24 official tour events. Gary Woodland, 29, won his first tour event in 2011 and has an enormous amount of talent, but he has just one top-10 finish in the past two seasons. Ryo Ishikawa, a 21-year-old from Japan, hoped to match his success as a teenager in Asia, but has more missed cuts (six) than finishes inside the top 35 (one) this season. They will all be at Congressional, trying to build the résumés that might allow them to break through again.“You just have to put yourself in that position over and over again,” Duke said. “You’ve got to be patient out here. You can’t make it happen. You’ve got to let it happen.”Scott has let it happen, and it has helped him reshape how to pursue the next step. He is at Congressional because he loves the golf course, and because he needs to build momentum to next month’s British Open. There, he will be confronted with another piece of his history: the four consecutive bogeys he made to close the 2012 Open, losing to Ernie Els by a stroke. That is part of what shaped him, part of what he had to overcome to win the Masters. “You can only go off previous experience,” Scott said. “You shouldn’t ignore it. You’ve got to learn about who you are as a person and a golfer to succeed in golf, I think.”Just as Scott sent his message to Rose, and thereby sent encouragement to all their contemporaries, he well knows what seems like a pattern may end up being passé — this week, at the British Open, for the rest of the summer.“There’s just no normal for golf, is there?” Scott said. “There’s just no set pattern. Anything’s possible, and no one’s career is the same.”
