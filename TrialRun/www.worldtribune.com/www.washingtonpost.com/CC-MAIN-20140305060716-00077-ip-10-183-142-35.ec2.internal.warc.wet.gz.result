Where are the best pupusas in the Washington area?
By Tim Carman
Where are your favorite pupusas in the Washington area?
(James M. Thresher/The Washington Post)
Perhaps I should have predicted this, but the latest installment of The Immigrant’s Table has generated a good amount of discussion on where to find the best pupusas in the DMV.
This is a harder proposition than you might think, for one reason: Pupusas are everywhere. I’ve spent a great deal of time eating them in the District and in the Maryland suburbs, where I live. My experience in Northern Virginia has been far more limited, which is why I called in reinforcements during yesterday’s Free Range chat when someone asked about NoVa pupuserias.
My friend and former Northern Virginia magazine food critic Warren Rojas told me he likes Esmeralda Restaurant in Alexandria for pupusas, while his replacement at the publication, Stefanie Gans, has a soft spot for Cerrito’s Pupuseria in Chantilly. Their picks inspired a number of chatters to suggest other NoVa options; you can read through the reader recommendations in the Free Range transcript. My current faves: the pupusas at La Chiquita in Takoma Park.
(Tim Carman/The Washington Post)
My favorite spots tend to be in Silver Spring and Takoma Park: As I mentioned in my column, I’m fond of the preparations and experimentation at La Casita in Silver Spring, where the pupusas arrive hot, thin and perfectly balanced. But I must confess, my favorite pupusas are currently found at La Chiquita, this family-oriented spot in Takoma Park, where customers wolf down the hot, gooey, satisfying rounds on metal tables and seats in an enclosed porch. It’s like a Salvadoran picnic right on East-West Highway.
But I’ve also enjoyed good pupusas at many other spots, including at Pupuseria El Comalito in Takoma Park, Gloria’s Pupuseria on 14th Street NW and El Aguila in Silver Spring. I’ve also found some good ones at various trucks in Montgomery County. My neglect to single out the pupuserias in Mount Pleasant, however, didn’t set well with at least one reader, so I asked him where to get a good platter of stuffed rounds in the neighborhood. Here’s his response:

Now it’s your turn: Where do you get your pupusas?

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Easy to get lost in lively, crowded ‘Seussical’
Margot Schulman - Horton the elephant (Matthew A. Anderson) protects lazy bird Mayzie’s egg in the musical “Seussical” at Imagination Stage. By Celia Wren, E-mail the writer
Things are getting busy in the Jungle of Nool — and we’re not just talking about the selfless missions of Horton the Elephant, the mischief of the Wickersham monkeys and the meddling antics of the irrepressible Cat in the Hat. Hobnobbing with those and ­other jungle residents these days are Washington area children — ­theatergoers-turned-participants in the crowded, lively “Seussical” at Imagination Stage.
“Seussical,” of course, is the musical that Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty whipped up from the books of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. Imagination Stage has staged the young-audiences-focused version of the show before: in 2005, with Kathryn Chase Bryer directing. This time, Artistic Director Janet Stanford does the honors, aided by a wholly new cast and creative team. There’s also a new gimmick — sorry, I mean vision — involving audience participation. A few ticket-holders now sit onstage during the production. Children are recruited to serve as jurors when Horton (Matthew A. Anderson) is put on trial. A few lucky tykes in balcony seats get to drop ping-pong-size pills — the tail-lengthening medication favored by the bird Gertrude McFuzz (Shayna Blass) — down to performers who catch them. And so on.

Free admission Get ideas Maybe the youngsters are enjoying this shtick — they all looked rather bemused at the performance I attended — but the conceit further clutters a musical that, as written, is already a grab bag of plotlines and personalities. Anderson’s wistful Horton is the heart of the show: Plodding around with a pink clover in his hand, solemnly singing “A person’s a person, no matter how small,” this altruistic pachyderm is truly affecting. And when Anderson’s Horton laboriously clambers up a tree to egg-sit for the irresponsible bird, Mayzie (a perky Kirstin Riegler), and proceeds to look anxious, bored, sleepy and stoical, by turns, he’s hilarious.But Horton’s narrative has to fight for air, what with the other business unspooling pell-mell around the lacy rocks of Tom Donahue’s set. Still, while the overall vibe is hodgepodge, many of the individual characters come across in strong colors. You have to love Blass’s sad, dorky Gertrude, especially when she proudly parades her medically enhanced tail — resembling a mile-long pink feather boa — in front of the oblivious Horton. And the rich, sassy singing of Ayanna Hardy’s Sour Kangaroo is the show’s musical highlight.Jamie Smithson doesn’t bring much pizazz to the Cat in the Hat, a character who keeps turning up like a bad penny — riding a tricycle here, dancing a tango there. More engaging is Simon Diesenhaus, a sixth-grader who infuses JoJo of Whoville with an air of ebullient dreaminess. (Simon shares the role with Svea Johnson, who played Gretl in Olney Theatre Center’s “The Sound of Music”).Designer Frank Labovitz deftly captures the eccentricity of Whoville with the emerald-green, loopy-leprechaun costumes he has devised for the Whos. The Jungle of Nool residents, by contrast, dress like 1950s high-schoolers, with the girls in puffy skirts, and the Wickersham monkeys in letter jackets. The attire dovetails with Karma Camp’s choreography, which often evokes the kind of dance fads you might have spotted at a sock hop.That’s fitting enough: What are the earnest Horton and lovesick Gertrude if not misfit high-schoolers in jungle-critter guise? What are the Wickershams and the Sour Kangaroo but a mean, popular clique? No wonder that, in “Seussical,” as in high school, an individual can get lost in the crowd.

Nominations for the Academy Awards will be announced Thursday, and film critics are asking how Sunday’s Golden Globes could affect voters’ decisions. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Matthew McConaughey best actor in a drama, and “12 Years a Slave” and “American Hustle” won best drama and best comedy. But after a year of virtuoso acting and filmmaking, Academy voters have plenty of options.
Cate Blanchett, named best actress in a drama for her role in Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” on Sunday, is generally expected to win the Oscar for best actress as well. Ronan and Mia Farrow protested strongly when Allen, whom they believe is a pedophile, won the award for lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes, but Academy voters might ignore the controversy.
The best actor category is more competitive. McConaughey won the Golden Globe award over Robert Redford, whose work in “All is Lost” has devoted admirers among critics. Redford was not nominated by the Screen Actors Guild last month, and few are optimistic that the Academy will nominate him for an Oscar either. “Redford may be out because the Sundance Kid refuses to do media or mix with the showbiz crowd. Heck, he didn’t even do a press junket for ‘All Is Lost,’ which hurt the film,” Tom O’Neil told the Los Angeles Times.
Ann Hornaday called Redford’s role his best performance in his long career. “He not only deserves to be nominated, he deserves to win — even in a year crammed with superb lead-actor performances,” she wrote.
Whether “American Hustle” or “Gravity” wins the award for best picture over “12 Years a Slave” could depend on how comfortable the Academy feels with Steve McQueen’s horrifying portrayal of antebellum slavery, according to Mike Hogan:
12 Years a Slave, despite being the most accomplished and important film of the year, has always been a hard sell for Academy voters, who tend to be old, white, and neurotically obsessed with what message their Best Picture selection sends to the rest of the world in terms of America’s reputation. To be clear, I think this is wrongheaded, but I’m telling you what I’ve been led to believe, and that is that the Academy worries that people around the world will hate us more if they wreath 12 Years a Slave, with its unflinching depiction of institutionalized sociopathy, in laurels. They would feel more comfortable rewarding a film like American Hustle or Gravity, so the question is whether they will take the easy way out or decide to do something brave and historic. . . .At the end of the day, though, I think voters will conclude that neither Hustle nor Gravity has the gravitas to overcome 12 Years a Slave.
Vanity Fair
More often than not, members of Hollywood’s foreign press and the Academy disagree about a year’s best films. The film that won the Oscar was named best in its category at the Golden Globes only four times in the past decade, notes Ben Zauzmer.

Sale of D.C. health-care firm in works
By Nikita Stewart and Mike DeBonis, E-mail the writers
D.C. Chartered Health Plan is weighing offers from buyers in an effort to keep $350 million in District government business that officials have said it could lose if the company remains in the hands of owner Jeffrey E. Thompson.
Chartered’s efforts to reorganize with such a sale could be finalized as early as this week, said people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. The transaction would separate the managed-care firm from Thompson, who recently resigned as board chairman after a March raid on his home and offices in a federal probe into alleged campaign-finance violations.
The company’s contract to manage the health care of low-income city residents expires in May 2013, and bids for a new contract must be in by July 31, said Wayne Turnage, director of the District’s Department of Health Care Finance. Should Thompson pursue a sale, the transaction would also have to be approved by city insurance regulators, a process that would take at least a month.D.C. Council member Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) said she was impressed by a potential new ownership scenario that would make Chartered a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based AmeriHealth Mercy, which touts itself on its Web site as “the leading group of Medicaid managed care plans and related businesses in the United States.”Alexander said Maynard G. McAlpin, Chartered’s chief executive, could be the new owner of Chartered. The Washington Post previously confirmed with Chartered that McAlpin was moving to take over as the new owner.Karen Dale, a spokeswoman for Chartered, said it “would be premature, at this time, to discuss any potential transaction” involving the company.Michelle Davidson, AmeriHealth Mercy’s communications director, declined to confirm any negotiations. “While AmeriHealth Mercy Family of Companies always monitors the market and regularly evaluates opportunities to prudently expand our business, we do not comment on rumors or speculation,” she said. “We cannot comment further at this time.”Chartered is still looking at other firms, said one of the people with knowledge of a potential sale.Thompson will have to move quickly to seal a deal before the bidding deadline. The D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking must review any sale to determine “whether the acquiring entity has the financial wherewithal and expertise” to operate as a health insurer, said agency spokeswoman Michelle Phipps-Evans.That process, she said, can happen in as little as 30 days, “but typically there is additional information required . . . and the process takes longer.”Alexander said she met with McAlpin and Anne Morrissey, AmeriHealth’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, about two weeks ago and they unveiled the potential partnership.Morrissey is a District native who received her nursing degree from Washington Hospital Center School of Nursing.Chartered has been a major employer of District residents, and Morrissey emphasized that “it was important to also keep the operation local,” said Alexander, who oversees insurance issues as chairman of the Committee on Public Services and Consumer Affairs.“She grew up in Southeast. She went to school in the area. She is local,” Alexander added. “She is familiar with this area. [AmeriHealth Mercy] is in a lot of different areas of Medicaid.”A bidder for the new contract, among the city’s largest, would have to be able to manage the health care of Chartered’s 110,000 members. The city has aimed to have several strong companies under contract competing to serve residents enrolled in the Medicaid and D.C. Healthcare Alliance plans, but Chartered has developed a near monopoly. Now, with Thompson’s legal troubles and the firm’s recent operating losses, Chartered’s hold on the D.C. contract — its sole source of business — is threatened. Turnage told a D.C. Council committee last month that it was unlikely Chartered would keep the contract if Thompson remained in charge.Council member David A. Catania (I-At Large), chairman of the Health Committee, said AmeriHealth Mercy “has a stellar reputation, from what I know.” But he said he has purposely not met with any potential buyers for Chartered, saying he did not want to be seen as interfering in the impending contract solicitation.Catania, who previously acknowledged that it would be difficult for Chartered to keep its city contract with Thompson as owner, said a sale could represent a fresh start for the company.“If the company’s owned by a reputable health insurance company that can actually build a network of high-quality physicians and actually manage the care of our residents, that’s all that’s of concern to me,” he said, adding, “I want to get away from the notion there’s anything personal.”
