Move over Mustique
By Claire Wrathall
Can a resort’s $100m revamp help St Lucia challenge its more upmarket Caribbean rival?
The Great House, which contains a restaurant and bar, at the Sugar Beach resortWhen the eccentric and irascible British aristocrat Colin Tennant, later Lord Glenconner, arrived in St Lucia in 1982, he had in mind a plan to create a holiday paradise to rival Mustique, the magnet for royals and celebrities he’d forged two decades earlier. It’s fair to say that he failed.
Though tourism has grown over the past 30 years to become the country’s biggest employer, accounting for almost half its gross domestic product, it has tended not to target the top of the market. Even the hotel that Lord Glenconner established on the site of an abandoned sugar plantation, Jalousie, became part of Hilton, which ran it as a rather soulless four-star hotel for nearly 20 years.
But the island’s profile may be poised to change. This summer, for the first time, British Airways put newly designed first-class cabins in the 777s that fly the St Lucia route, a reflection of the fact that there are now several supremely luxurious hotels – Jade Mountain, for instance – charging more than $1,000 a night on the island.
Six Senses’ first Caribbean property is under development on Malgretoute beach (which is due to be renamed Freedom Bay). November will see the opening of Sugar Beach, a $100m-plus redevelopment and rebranding of the hotel Lord Glenconner founded three decades ago, in the sublimely beautiful Val de Pitons. He may not have lived to see it but the signs are that it will soon be the sort of properly glamorous place he had in mind.
MoreIN North American destinations The Rockaways rebornEl Salvador what tourists are missing Isla Holbox, Mexico’s enchanted island Nevis – away from Caribbean glitzFour months before his death in August 2010, I’d been introduced to Lord Glenconner in a chance encounter in the small St Lucian town of Soufrière. Under the impression that I must surely know his daughters, as I was about their age and from London, he invited me to tea. It was an afternoon best described as surreal.
His seaside home, Beau House, sited in the lee of the Gros Piton, just south of what is now Sugar Beach, was majestic but squalid. Bats had colonised its domed ceiling, and there was guano everywhere.
I sat rapt as he told the story of how he’d found the valley, which had so succumbed to jungle it was accessible only by water. He had canoed down from his home in Soufrière, three miles north. Having bought the 480-acre estate, he then acquired two traditional gingerbread cottages elsewhere on the island, which he had restored and relocated. Next he opened a rum shop and restaurant, with exuberant decor based on stage designs by Oliver Messel, architect of the loveliest villas on Mustique. Then came the hotel, but it failed after three seasons, and Hilton took over.
He offered to show me his house, an extraordinary structure inspired by an Indian palace and topped by a Taj Mahal-like cupola, but built so cheaply there wasn’t even glass in its windows. By contrast, his possessions were fabulous. There was his Indian four-poster bed, ornately carved with peacocks and flowers and plated in heavily tarnished silver. The walls of an anteroom were lined in 19th-century mirrors painted with scenes from the Ramayana – a gift from a maharajah in Rajasthan, he told me. Chandeliers hung from every ceiling. “That one’s an Osler, but I expect you knew that,” he’d say airily.
Truly it was a treasure house. No wonder its contents, when they came to be sold at Bonhams in London last year, fetched almost £1.1m. The beneficiary of that sale and of Lord Glenconner’s entire St Lucian estate was his loyal and long-suffering manservant Kent Adonai, who drove me back to my hotel and who, I sensed, was his only real friend on the island. Lord Glenconner told me he had left Mustique because of the sort of people who were buying up the villas (“brokers and bankers”, he called them), and because there was no longer any social life. But things were no better on St Lucia now. Apart from “the Russian pianist” – as he referred to his nearest neighbour, Vladimir Ashkenazy – he’d hardly a good word for anyone. Nobody, he railed, knew how to have fun any more.
Among the few spared his opprobrium, however, was Roger Myers, the new owner of Jalousie, another Briton, whose life, like Lord Glenconner’s, had taken him into the same orbit as the likes of Mick Jagger and David Bowie, both of whom owned villas on Mustique. A chartered accountant by training, Myers forged a career in the early 1970s, “giving tax advice to people in the music business”, he told me over lunch. His first clients were the Rolling Stones, “and once you’d got the Stones, you got everybody else”.
Among them was Tony Visconti, Bowie’s producer, and together they set up a record label and a recording studio, after which his career veered into restaurants and pubs. He founded the Café Rouge restaurant chain and then, with Hugh Osmond (“the cleverest guy I’ve ever met”), Punch Taverns. But eventually retirement beckoned and, in 2005, he moved to St Lucia “to drink rum and do nothing”. He had been there a matter of weeks when he heard Jalousie was for sale. One of the cottages at Sugar Beach“I hadn’t run anything for about three years. I had no office, no secretary,” he says. “But it’s so beautiful, and I knew I was never ever going to find anything else like it, so I bought it.” Little did he realise at that point that it would be seven years in the making and cost more than $100m.
When I stayed there this summer it was still a work in progress, but it promises to be very fine when it opens fully in time for Thanksgiving, rebranded as Sugar Beach.
In addition to 11 handsome, comparatively inexpensive rooms in part of the original sugar factory, there are 59 pricier cottages, with clapboard walls, wrap-around verandas and plunge pools, set on the steep jungle-clad hillside that rises above the glorious beach. So rich in marine life are the waters here that you can snorkel at night, when phosphorescence creates an almost supernatural atmosphere. Among the other new additions are as enchanting a spa as I’ve seen, set within a tract of rainforest on the estate, each treatment room a treehouse. For those for whom proximity to the sea is more important than privacy, there are also eight thatch-and-adobe bungalows set right on the sand. Myers has been a key creative force in the transformation of the hotel. He personally puts together the eclectic playlists for the public areas, where works from his art collection hang. The more formal and ambitious of the two excellent restaurants is decorated with a series of striking mixed-media portraits by the Puerto Rican photographer Carlos Mercado, in striking contrast to the traditional plantation-house architecture of the original 18th-century room.
The casual beach restaurant, which serves superb ceviches as well as local dishes such as jerk chicken and curries with cassava chips, has a wall of paintings by Jonathan Bishop. More of Bishop’s work can be found in the Cane Bar, where the air conditioning is turned up to 11, perhaps to reinforce the message that, with its wall of white curtains and lit-from-within white glass bar, it’s the coolest of the four bars. I preferred the elegant old-school Palm Court, with its marble floors, ceiling fans, antique Chinese jars, cane swing seats and views across the gardens to the sea.
For this is not the sort of place you spend all your time in your cottage, however lovely its pool, seeing no one but room-service staff. Rather it’s a place where people are encouraged to mix, whether they are staying at the hotel or one of the splendid beach houses under construction on the neighbouring bay, due to be named Glenconner Beach.
All of which, I suspect, would have pleased his lordship, for it all seems so true to the spirit of his original plan. “Whatever people say about Colin,” says Myers, “he was quite a visionary. What he created in Mustique made it the most expensive real estate in the world. Had he been younger and had a bit more energy, I think he’d have achieved it here too. If only he’d survived to see the hotel finished, he’d have seen his dream realised.”

Love, freedom and bad hair
By Nigel Andrews
Milk (Gus Van Sant)
Frost/Nixon (Ron Howard)
Valkyrie (Bryan Singer)
Rachel Getting Married (Jonathan Demme)
Better Things (Duane Hopkins)
This is the best bad-hair week in the history of cinema. Playing real-life roles in Milk and Frost/Nixon respectively, Sean Penn (pictured) and Frank Langella take on that boldest of challenges, the fright coiffure. What better bonfire is there for a movie star’s vanity? A dorky 1970s barber’s cut for Penn’s portrayal of the first openly gay American elected to public office; a receding crinkle-cut for Langella’s Richard Nixon, transforming the former matinee-idol Dracula into a hirsute human termite; and lo, we already believe these are men of history – real men – not overpaid, over-beautified histrios. MoreNigel Andrews The Grand Budapest Hotel – film review Wake in Fright – film review300 Rise of an Empire – film review The Invisible War – film reviewThese two political dramas are on every current awards roster. And rightly. Milk is made marvellous by Gus Van Sant’s direction. Here are the dissidence, grace and ambushing moments of pain and humour we know from My Own Private Idaho and Good Will Hunting. Harvey Milk was a San Francisco gay activist who became a national hero – for those who shared his struggle and orientation – by winning election as a city supervisor. Soon afterwards he gained an unsolicited martyrdom, shot dead by a rightwing fellow supervisor, Dan White, played with just the right manic uptightness by Josh (
W.) Brolin. What a story. Only in America could two factions – those championing a simple human freedom (the right to love) and those fighting back with prejudice and piety – meet in so heady a mixture of oratory and warfare. Dustin Lance Black’s screenplay starts gauchely, with Penn’s Milk decanting his memories into a tape recorder (a movie-framing device that should be death-listed). But once the decade-spanning story starts and the characters spring into action, reaction and everyday passion – Penn’s fastidiously-spoken firebrand, James Franco as his long-suffering Adonis, Emile Hirsch as the street hustler who turns into a human pocket battleship for the cause, his big-lensed hippy specs like two gun turrets – each scene is a perfect blend of the combative and the quirkily quotidian.
How Milk and his pals turned San Francisco’s Castro district into a gay-welcoming city-state whose only intolerance was for intolerance; how reason and humanity were weaponised in the fight against bigotry (the fearful Anita Bryant, a spokes-bimbo for an orange juice company who turned homophobic Amazon); and how the mellow motility of Harris Savides’s photography suggests a feature documentary kissed by drama’s paintbrush; all these reveal themselves to the discerning, vigilant viewer. Add Penn’s uncannily three-dimensional performance, his best yet, and Milk is a masterclass on how a political biopic can become rich, humane, encompassing cinema.
Spellbinding: Frank Langella (right) as Richard Nixon, with Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan
In Frost/Nixon Frank Langella, a werewolf at bay against the lunar television lights, is spellbinding as Richard Nixon. “We do not want trial by TV,” dozens of politicians and commentators have said over the decades. But oh, we do, in some cases we do. Especially when its most notable true-life instance, the impaling of Nixon by David Frost in 1977, is recreated by Peter Morgan – adapting his stage play – as a duel of antithetical personalities. Nixon was the hunched, hunted-looking ex-president who would defy or deny anything – truth, history, impeachment – to secure the precarious legacy of his few good works. Before he became a rottweiler, Frost (Michael Sheen, superb) was a media popinjay, propelled largely by other talents in his coursing of fame and as facile and famous a social animal as Nixon was gauche, suspicious, defensive.
Morgan brilliantly opens out his play, proving that The Queen and The Last King of Scotland have skilled him as a master scenarist. As performers it is not just Langella and Sheen who excel, two more-than-mimics, each polishing his portrayal in the mirror of the other’s virtuosity. It is the hangers-on too, the hucksters and ideologues-for-hire, from Toby Jones as agent “Swifty” Lazar, Nixon’s creepy dealmaker, to Sam Rockwell’s researcher for Frost, nearly rending his hair as his stellar attack dog fails to attack in the first interviews. Did the long, emotional midnight phone call between Frost and Nixon on the eve of the climactic Watergate interview really happen? At least as dramatised? It is riveting cinema even if it didn’t: as clever an exercise in character catalysis as Schiller’s imagined rendezvous for Elizabeth and Mary in Mary Stuart. Director Ron Howard, less an artist of film like Van Sant, more a resourceful pro (Apollo 13, Cinderella Man), lays his cloak down for the miraculous script and makes sure everyone can walk with dry feet towards the awards ceremonies. In Valkyrie Tom Cruise, playing the Hitler assassination plotter Claus von Stauffenberg, shows he is no subscriber to bad-hair weeks. With no tress out of place he blows up the Wolf’s Lair summit room, hastens back to Berlin and starts to reseize, with his co-conspirators, the German government. Unfortunately Adolf Hitler is still alive and the putsch is soon dead. But even in front of the firing squad Cruise’s Stauffenberg is gallant, handsome and ready with a last cry of loyalty to Germany.
We cannot cry “Inauthentic!” in response. Stauffenberg did lead a coup and was handsome and dashing, with the neo-Byronic addition of a black eye-patch and damaged arm incurred in an earlier battle of the second world war. Director Bryan Singer, generalling a script by his Usual Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie, keeps the troops in order and bestows flatteringly authoritative camera angles on his star. But an hour in, there starts to seem something two-dimensional about all this to-ing and fro-ing across the floor of history. A bustle of British supporting actors, including some whose comic pedigree prompts an unintended giggle (Eddie Izzard), is compounded with an accent free-for-all encompassing English, mid-Atlantic and for Hitler cod German. (Is his Austrian origin the pretext for this Teutonic singularity?) In a week boasting the multi-layered heroes and antiheroes of Milk and Frost/Nixon, Valkyrie seems more like history by Nintendo: a slickly devised exercise in action drama whose entire research and development budget went into the external details of the plot, leaving none for the inner realism of its participants. Rachel Getting Married is scripted by Jenny Lumet, daughter of director Sidney. You could guess that this headlong tragicomedy, berserk with confessionalism, came from the household that gave us such psyche-spilling works as Dog Day Afternoon and the film of Long Day’s Journey into Night. Here a recuperating alcoholic, played by Anne Hathaway in a 180º turn from her romcom roles (Princess Diaries, Bride Wars), runs amok at her sister’s wedding deep in John Updike country.
Everyone in this New England family is clever, beautiful and rich. Then the wounded soul arrives to poop the party. Lumet and director Jonathan Demme make it seem horrible fun. From the moment Hathaway yelps “That’s so unfair!” when the sister announces her pregnancy, it’s clear this rehab refugee wants the spotlights to shine squarely on her. Those hovering nearby include Bill Irwin’s tear-prone dad and Debra Winger’s glacially convivial estranged mum, whose bonhomie spreads straight from the freezer and returns there after use. Hathaway is good. And few spectacles are more succulent than an American family tearing itself apart. But two hours is a long time to watch this Connecticut carve-up. The film, like the shindig, ends up dissolving in a schmaltzy brew of make-do-and-mend, complete with a sari-clad wedding accompanied by multi-ethnic music, whose PC touchy-feeliness one hopes is a joke but fears is not.
There is more truth and heartache in Better Things, a tranche of British realism that will win few friends for charm or vitality. Stricken teenagers, filmed in close-up or in grey landscapes almost sobbing with featurelessness, deal with the standard crucifixions of youth – sex, drugs – and the less age-particular tribulations of life and chance: agoraphobia, bereavement, loneliness. In some scenes a film aiming at the atonal is merely toneless, at the miserablist merely miserable. But Hopkins has a singularity of style worth watching and the courage not to flinch in putting it on screen. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2014. You may share using our article tools.
