PANNING FOR COMEDIC GOLD IN TV'S EARLY 'HONEYMOORNERS'
By DAVID MARGOLICK
Published: October 13, 1985
Ralph Kramden read, or at least bought, The New York Herald-Tribune. He and his wife, Alice, previously thought to have been childless for their entire 15-year marriage, once adopted a baby girl. Edward L. Norton survived as an ''engineer of subterranean sanitation'' in part because he had no sense of smell, and, though he tried to hide it, his middle name was ''Lillywhite.'' These are not the only startling revelations to emerge from the ''lost'' episodes of ''The Honeymooners,'' which, after languishing for 30 years in Jackie Gleason's personal vault, are now on the air. Long before Ralph became petrified on camera while trying to sell kitchen utensils and playing the ''$99,000 Answer,'' for instance, he had a similar experience pitching Choosy-Chew candy bars. Trixie and Ed eloped. And while the Kramdens' bedroom must remain forever unseen, viewers have at last established conclusively that it contained a double bed. When the 67 ''new'' old ''Honeymooners'' episodes were unearthed earlier this year, the event was compared by aficionados to the discovery of a new Mozart symphony -or a trunkful of them. After all, only 39 episodes of ''The Honeymooners,'' all filmed during the 1955-56 season, were ever pre-pared specifically for syndication, and those are the ones that have been broadcast, again and again and again, ever since. Last month, the much-heralded rediscovered shows began joining them on the small screen, on cable's Showtime; each episode continues to appear three nights a week (Wednesdays at 7, Thursdays at 10, Sundays at 11). This past Monday, WPIX/ Channel 11 presented the first of a pair of two-hour specials - it will be rebroadcast this Saturday night at 11:30; the station plans to show the second one next month. And next year, the individual episodes will be syndicated by Viacom Enterprises on broadcast television. In the meantime, M.P.I. Home Video of Oak Forest, Ill., has begun to release all 52 hours of the lost episodes on video cassettes. The initial two hit the stores this past week; another pair is due next month, in time for the Nov. 16 convention of the Royal Association for the Longevity and Preservation of the Honeymooners, or RALPH, which is expected to attract some 5,000 buffs to the Concert Theater at C. W. Post University in Greenvale, Long Island. A preliminary viewing of about half of the rediscovered segments, which range from eight minutes to an hour in length, reveals all the familiar trappings. The Kramdens and the Nortons live in the same dingy building in Bensonhurst. Ralph and Alice are forever fighting, over visits by in-laws, weddings that conflict with baseball games or Ralph's pleas for money to invest in various can't-miss ven-tures. Only occasionally - when the Kramdens' penny-pinching landlord turns out to be Jack Benny, when Ralph and Ed meet Bud Collyer, the host of ''Beat the Clock,'' or the Dorsey Brothers stop by Chauncey Street to say hello - are there dissonant departures from the world that devotees have come to know so well. Still, if ''Honeymooners'' episodes, like Mozart's opuses, had Kochel numbers, most of the rediscovered programs would have to be given single or double digits. All were recorded prior to the syndicated shows, and they are, by and large, promis-ing but primitive works. Their jokes are coarser, their plots - as well as Ralph Kramden himself - are thinner, and their decibel level is invariably louder than later on. In them, the Kramdens, like comic-book characters, always seem to end their sentences with exclamation points. There are, nonetheless, a few new episodes that rank with the very best of the original 39 (my favorites from the well-worn batch are the episode where Ralph injures his back during a clandestine trip to the bowling alley the night before his physical at the Gotham Bus Company, and another in which he tries to convince one of Alice's former suitors that he runs the firm). Among the funniest new shows is one in which a hypnotist visits the Raccoon Lodge, and one wherein a battle between Kramden and Norton over a television set lands them in night court. But, in a larger sense, any comparison between the old and ''new'' shows is simply unfair. After all, we have not yet seen each of the new-found shows dozens of times. Like the ''new'' Coca-Cola, the lost episodes must compete against a product that has grown more appealing with long, intimate familiarity. Indeed, perhaps no series in the history of television has been scrutinized as closely as the 39 ''original'' programs. In their forthcoming ''Official Honeymooners Treasury,'' for instance, Peter Crescenti and Bob Columbe list such esoterica as the three episodes in which the sliding lock on the Kramdens' front door is missing, the four times Ralph dismissed something as ''a mere bag of shells,'' the eight known fellow sewer workers of Ed Norton and four of Alice Kramden's former boyfriends. At the very least, the new episodes render all of this erudition obsolete. Even the mediocre ones add valuable new information on Ralph's life of perpetual frustration, his enduring ties to Ed Norton and, perhaps most important, his changing, even tragic, relationship with his wife. 1
