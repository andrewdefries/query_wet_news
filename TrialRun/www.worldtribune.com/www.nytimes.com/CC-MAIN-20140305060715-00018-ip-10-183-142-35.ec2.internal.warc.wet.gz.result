Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.

Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
