FORTRESS ISLAND OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
By Henry Kamm; HENRY KAMM is chief of the Rome bureau of The New York Times.
Published: April 3, 1983
Malta has paid the price of being situated at a crossroads of history and civilization. The three-island archipelago at the center of the Mediterranean has been conquered and reconquered by every expansionist power that ever shaped history in this cradle of civilization, from the Phoenicians to the British, with Romans, Arabs, Swabians, Normans, various Italians and Sicilians and the French in between. It has suffered in wars religious and secular, never more than under some of the most concentrated bombing of World War II. But Malta has emerged triumphantly intact. The islands have survived even that great defacer of the works of the centuries -the mass tourism of the jet age, which dumps packaged hordes of searchers after the sun (and the beer of their own northern countries) on distant shores, there to trample unseeingly through the works of nature and man in quest of bargains and beaches. There have been times in recent years, some Maltese say, when there were so many tourists in such large groups that it seemed the British forces were back, with wives, children and parents in tow. It doesn't take many groups to change the character of a sedate island with a population smaller than that of Staten Island. But the economic recession is keeping the number of package tours down, or perhaps fickle fashion has directed the noisy flow to other beaches. Malta resembles itself again, even during the peak months of July and August - although that is still the time to avoid for those who want to see its sights rather than jam its none-tooextensive beaches. This is bad news for the Maltese government and tourist industry but should bring joy to the hearts of those who fancy Mediterranean islands of natural beauty enhanced by extraordinary works of man and bathed in a subtropical climate. A more concentrated collection of pleasures, from neolithic remains to Baroque churches, from beaches to boat rides, is hard to imagine. No place on the three islands -121 square miles all in all - is beyond reach of a day trip beginning after breakfast and getting the traveler back to his hotel in time for a drink before dinner. Within this narrow space, there is also a decided gradation of holiday tempo. If the pace of the main island of Malta, slow as it is, gets to be too much, an hour's bus trip (less by taxi), followed by 20 minutes on a ferry, takes one to the tranquillity of Gozo, the second of the three. And if that leaves the visitor still feeling that the world is too much with him, there is the solitude of Comino, where five resident families live in an unnamed cluster of houses at some distance from the tiny island's only hotel. Comino's charms can prove productive as well as seductive - in the 13th century, a Jewish philosopher from Saragossa, Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia, stayed there for six years and wrote his major cabbalistic work, ''Imrei Shefer.'' The beach, at the foot of Comino's church, is pleasantly sandy, which acounts for regular boat service from the main island. There are splendid buildings scattered throughout the islands, but Malta's crowning glory is its small capital, Valletta, a town of 15,000 inhabitants. Valletta, which dates from the 16th century, is a rarity that modern city planners have failed to achieve - a fully planned city that has flourished into genuine life, unlike such more recent experiments as Brasilia, Islamabad or Chandigarh. And one knows that one is inside Valletta - even though neighboring towns press close upon it - because the capital is ringed by powerful fortifications that have survived the travail of four agitated centuries. Its streets follow a rectangular grid pattern described by eight main streets that run from the City Gate to Fort St. Elmo, on the tip of the spit of rocky land on which the town stands, and eleven shorter cross streets. The Order of St. John of Jerusalem, better known as the Knights of Malta, arrived on the island in 1530, after four centuries of crusading for and defending Christianity in the Eastern Mediterranean. Driven from the Holy Land in 1291, they repaired first to Cyprus and then to Rhodes. The Turks besieged them there and accepted their surrender and departure in 1523. The knights hesitated about six years before accepting the offer of Malta and Tripoli, now in Libya, extended by Charles V. Malta had few resources to offer a military order threatened by superior forces. The small population produced barely enough food for itself, and the island had no fortifications. These had to be built with imported materials and labor, and while they were being raised, the knights had to withstand a number of Turkish attacks and finally, in 1565, the Great Siege of Malta. Their eventual defeat of the invaders, one of the great military feats of European history and often depicted as the saving of the Christian West from the forces of Islam, led to the decision to build a fortified capital named for Jean de la Vallette, Grand Master of the Order. Francesco Laparelli, a military architect of long experience, was commissioned by the knights to design the capital by which they intended to tell the Turks and the rest of the world that the order was in Malta to stay. Only six days after his arrival from Italy Laparelli presented an outline of his city design to the Grand Master, a feat still regarded with awe by historians of architecture. He died of the plague in Crete in 1569, after seeing his basic design staked out on the ground. The architecture of the churches and palaces that are the glory of Valletta was entrusted to Laparelli's chief assistant, Gerolamo Cassar, a Maltese who was fortunately more of an artist than a designer of fortified places. Cassar and the architects that followed him made Valletta a glorious ensemble of rare harmony, unified not only in style, as the classic lines of the Renaissance melted into the lyrical curves of the Baroque, but also in the honeyed glow of Malta's limestone, almost the only building material used. 1

Faith Healer
May 10, 1998
Faith Healer
The protagonist in Gayl Jones's new novel restores life's casualties.
Related Article Author's Tragedy Is Like Events in Her Novels (March 2, 1998)
By VALERIE SAYERS
THE HEALING
By Gayl Jones.
283 pp. Boston: Beacon Press. $23.
t is not possible to read Gayl Jones's new novel without acknowledging the recent headlines flashing her name. In the 1970's, while still in her 20's, Jones published two wrenching novels and a short-story collection that established her as a provocative voice in contemporary fiction. Her stark, disturbing stories explored the sometimes degrading sex between black men and women living in a country consumed with racial identity and power. Jones was a tenured professor at the University of Michigan, but after her husband was arrested for threatening street demonstrators with a shotgun, they left this country and lived in Europe for several years. They returned to the United States in 1988

Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.
View our complete FAQ
Home Delivery Subscriptions
With home delivery of The New York Times newspaper, do I get free digital access?
Yes, only print subscribers get the added benefit of a free full digital access subscription which includes unlimited access to our New York Times website, NYTimes.com, and the NYTimes apps for smartphones (iPhone®, BlackBerry® 10, Windows® Phone and Android™-powered phones) and tablets like the iPad®.
Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
To start using your free digital benefits, you’ll need your New York Times home delivery account number. This will be sent to you in a confirmation email once your order is placed. If you do not receive the email you can call New York Times Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (698-4637) and obtain the number.
What time will The New York Times be delivered to my home?
In most areas, The New York Times will be delivered by 6:30 a.m. on weekdays, and 8:30 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
Can I suspend home delivery while I am on vacation?
Yes, you can choose to receive credit for the period of your suspended delivery or donate your vacation credit to provide The New York Times newspaper to schools.
