History on Trial
CHAPTER ONE
History on Trial
Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past
By GARY B. NASH
Alfred A. Knopf

In the Matter of History
It is true that history cannot satisfy our appetite when we are hungry, nor keep us warm when the cold wind blows. But it is true that if younger generations do not understand the hardships and triumphs of their elders, then we will be a people without a past. As such, we will be like water without a source, a tree without roots.
--Wall inscription, New York
Chinatown History Project
In the predawn hours of October 20, 1994, Gary B. Nash, Charlotte Crabtree, and other Californians helping to develop the National History Standards were rattled out of their slumber. East Coast friends, having scanned their morning copies of the Wall Street Journal, were phoning, the three-hour time difference forgotten in their stunned reaction to Lynne Cheney's editorial page article attacking the standards. The banner headline pronounced "The End of History." The public had not yet read the standards because their release was scheduled for later that month. In one of the nation's most widely read newspapers, Cheney had delivered a preemptive strike against the new guidelines.
"Imagine an outline for the teaching of American history," began the former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, "in which George Washington makes only a fleeting appearance and is never described as our first president. Or in which the founding of the Sierra Club and the National Organization for Women are considered noteworthy events, but the first gathering of the U.S. Congress is not." If those comments were not enough to raise readers' ire, she had more to offer. "The general drift of the document," she warned, "becomes apparent when one realizes that not a single one of the 31 national standards mentions the Constitution." True, she reported, the Constitution was described as "the culmination of the most creative era of constitutionalism in American history." But this description appeared only in what she alleged was "the dependent clause of a sentence that has as its main point . . . the paradox that the Constitution side-tracked the movement to abolish slavery that had taken rise in the revolutionary era." As for the extensive treatment of the Constitution throughout the standards, Cheney allowed only an offhand admission that "true, it [the Constitution] does come up in the 250 pages of supporting materials."
Cheney also charged that the U.S. History Standards presented a "grim and gloomy" portrayal of American history. Why so much attention, she asked, to topics such as the Ku Klux Klan and McCarthyism? Why did this curricular framework save its "unqualified admiration" for "people, places, and events that are politically correct?" By way of evidence, she cited one out of the nearly twelve hundred illustrative classroom activities, included to support the standards on what young Americans should learn. This particular example invited students to conduct a trial of John D. Rockefeller on his business practices. Students taking the roles of prosecutor, defense attorney, judge, and jury would investigate his piratical dealings--of the kind a PBS documentary on him had explored several years before.
Citing other teaching examples rather than the standards themselves, Cheney found six references to Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave who used the Underground Railroad to rescue scores of other slaves. In contrast, such white males as Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee were mentioned only one and zero times, respectively. The standards give no hint, she complained, "of the spell-binding oratory of such congressional giants as Henry Clay and Daniel Webster." And Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Jonas Salk, and the Wright brothers, she claimed, "make no appearance at all."
"What went wrong?" Cheney asked. She found her answer in the disclosures of one member of the National Council for History Standards, the group that oversaw the three-year project to develop the guidelines. In the words of this informant, who asked not to be named, those "pursuing their revisionist agenda no longer bothered to conceal their great hatred of traditional history" once Bill Clinton's election in 1992 had "unleashed the forces of political correctness." Thereafter, the informant told Cheney, "nobody dared to cut the inclusive part" of the standards that "various political groups such as African American organizations and Native American groups" had forced on the council.
Farfetched as this explanation was of the consensus-building process through which the standards had been written, it was no more astonishing than Cheney's assessment of the World History Standards. She had not reviewed these guidelines, so she relied on the assessment of another unnamed informant. In this case, she reported authoritatively, the Ameri-can Historical Association--the century-old historians' equivalent to the American Medical Association--grew "particularly aggressive" after Clinton's victory and "threatened to boycott the proceedings if Western civilization was given any emphasis" and "from that point on, hijacked standards-setting."
Cheney concluded her Journal attack with a call to arms. National certification of these standards, she warned, must at all cost be blocked or "much that is significant in our past will begin to disappear from our schools." She urged that the standards be stopped in their tracks because they were the rubbish produced by an "academic establishment that revels in . . . politicized history."
Four days after Cheney's blast, commentator Rush Limbaugh told his radio audience that the standards were part of the America-bashing multicultural agenda that he had cautioned viewers and listeners about. For many months, he had excoriated historians who had "bullied their way into power positions in academia" in order to indoctrinate students with the message that "our country is inherently evil." He told his listeners that the standards, which had been "worked on in secret," should simply be flushed "down the sewer of multiculturalism" "When you bring [students] into a classroom," he informed TV viewers on October 28, "and you teach them that America is a rotten place, . . . and they don't have a chance here . . . you have a bunch of embittered people growing up, robbing and stealing and turning to crime because they've been told all their young lives that there's no future for them. . . . This country does not deserve the reputation it's getting in multicultural classrooms, and the zenith of this bastardization of American history has been reached with new standards that have been written as part of Goals 2000 to standardize history."
Limbaugh then gave his audience a dramatic demonstration of what Cheney claimed would be the fate of America's traditional heroes if the standards were made official. "If you're a parent of a child anywhere from grade five through twelve, I want to show you what's in store for your kid in history," Limbaugh raged. Presenting the history standards as a textbook from which kids would study rather than a framework that teachers might voluntarily use as a resource, he began tearing pages out of a history book. "Here's Paul Revere. He's gone," exclaimed Limbaugh as a crumpled page hit the TV studio floor. "Here's George Washington as president. Look at all these pages in this book. He's gone. . . . Here's Thomas Edison. He's gone. J. P. Morgan--he's gone. The Wright brothers . . . let's rip them out. They're gone. This is what we're doing to American history with this stupid new book, folks." Limbaugh's conclusion? The standards are "a bunch of PC crap."
Limbaugh catechized the audience on just what historical correctness is and isn't. "History is real simple. You know what history is? It's what happened," he told his audience. "The problem you get into is when guys like this try to skew history by [saying], ï¿½Well, let's interpret what happened because maybe we can't find the truth in the facts, or at least we don't like the truth as it's presented. So let's change the interpretation a little bit so that it will be the way we wished it were.' Well, that's not what history is. History is what happened, and history ought to be nothing more than the quest to find out what happened."
Limbaugh wrestled with questions about how wars occurred, how people were moved by religion or ideas, why one society developed differently from another. "Now, if you want to get into why what happened, that's probably valid too, but why what happened shouldn't have much of anything to do with what happened." He hoped millions of American parents would bear this history lesson in mind and agree that the National History Standards were radioactive enough to damage their children's minds.
In attacking the standards, Cheney and Limbaugh sent new shock troops into a culture war that had raged for a decade. Since the mid-1980s, Americans have been beset by controversies, criticisms, and contretemps over history. Was Columbus not an intrepid explorer but the world's greatest genocidist? Was Cleopatra black, the pride of Africa, rather than a heroine of Western civilization? Should the New York legislature stipulate that every schoolchild study the Irish potato famine of the 1840s? What other famines in history should legislatures mandate? Should one of Virginia's most hallowed Civil War battlefields be obliged to share space with a mega-theme park where American families could learn versions of history produced in Disney's imagineering laboratory? Did the curators of "The West as America" exhibit at the National Museum of American Art in Washington become part of the "embarrassed to be American" crowd when they suggested that the stunning paintings by Bierstadt, Remington, Catlin, and others might be looked at in many ways--as reflections of imperialism and racism as much as Arcadian depictions of the frontier?
Why was Colonial Williamsburg staging an eighteenth-century slave auction, heartrending but allegedly degrading, even if the producer was a talented young black woman who wanted people to understand the brutality of slavery? Were the Smithsonian Institution's curators and consulting historians really "hijacking history," practicing "political correctness," and demonstrating "anti-Americanism," when they planned an exhibit on Enola Gay, the B-52 that dropped the first atom bomb on Japan a half-century ago? Why did San Francisco's Art Commission agree to move an 800-ton monument showing a Spanish friar, with finger pointing to heaven, standing over a supine Indian while a vaquero raised his hand in triumph? All of these--a historical figure, a monument, a site, an event--became lightning rods for sulphurous debates over historical, heritage, and group sensibility.
It is not surprising that the political Right would open a history front in the culture wars. History, like politics, is about national identity. Hence the work of historians frequently comes under attack amid calls for refurbishing or restoring the national identity. "Today's moralists have successfully filled the Great Enemy Vacuum left by the end of the Cold War," writes James A. Morone. This time the enemy was to be found within, with the nation divided between "a righteous ï¿½us' and a malevolent ï¿½them.' " For Pat Buchanan, speaking before the Republican National Convention in 1992, this was "a war for the soul of America." For Irving Kristol, intellectual leader of neoconservatism, "there is no ï¿½after the Cold War' for me. So far from having ended, my Cold War has increased in intensity, as sector after sector has been ruthlessly corrupted by the liberal ethos." Since historians are easily associated with "the liberal ethos," their province was naturally terrain to be attacked and, if possible, captured in the culture wars. "Now that the other ï¿½Cold War' is over," warned Kristol, "the real Cold War has begun. We are far less prepared for this Cold War, far more vulnerable to our enemy, than was the case with our victorious war against a global Communist threat."
Historians have been, by turns, amazed, amused, and aghast at the recent blitzkrieg on the profession's research of the past few decades. They have been drawn into a series of public disputes, often reluctantly but also because their own scholarship has precipitated shrill, bombastic arguments, especially when it has challenged cherished historical narratives. Historians have become personalities on the public stage, applying makeup for the TV cameras, miking up for radio talk shows, and writing op-ed essays for local newspapers.
History is hot. If Cecil B. De Mille was correct in arguing that there is no such thing as bad publicity, then historians ought to welcome the excitement. History is unceasingly controversial because it provides so much of the substance for the way a society defines itself and considers what it wants to be. The culture wars, though unnerving and nasty, offer the public a grand opportunity to talk with historians and history teachers about how history is written, how research has changed in recent decades, and how arguments about the past illustrate a democracy at work. If historians find themselves unorganized and relatively powerless to combat oversimplification and misrepresentation of thei
