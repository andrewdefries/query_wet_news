Credibility
ChasmBy

During
the Vietnam War, the U.S. government�s rosy forecasts of progress

Yet, anyone who has followed

The American people did not elect
a Republican majority to the Senate. In 2000, the voters erased a 55-45
Republican majority, leaving the Senate divided 50-50 with the GOP control
determined by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Dick Cheney.
But Cheney was in that position
