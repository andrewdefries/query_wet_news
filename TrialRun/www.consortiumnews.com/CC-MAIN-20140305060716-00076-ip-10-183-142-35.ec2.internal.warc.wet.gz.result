Irony at Racak
By Don North February 24, 2008 (Originally published Jan. 26, 1999) One grieving villager uncovered the headless corpse of his 65-year-old brother. "Jesus Christ," exclaimed a distressed U.S. diplomat as he picked his way past blood-soaked massacre victims in Racak, a tiny village 18 miles southwest of Kosovo's capital of Pristina.
"At least let's give him the dignity of covering him up," said the diplomat, U.S. Ambassador William Walker. Beyond shock, the bespectacled diplomat, with thinning red hair and a wispy moustache, barely could contain his fury.
"I see bodies like this with their faces blown away at close range in execution fashion and it's obvious people with no value for human life have done this," Walker told journalists. "Unfortunately, I do not have the words to describe my personal revulsion at the site of what can only be described as an unspeakable atrocity."
Walker demanded that the Serb government supply the names of police officers and soldiers involved in the operation. He wanted the killers tracked down and delivered to the international war crimes tribunal at the Hague.
"From what I personally saw, I do not hesitate to describe the crime as a massacre, a crime against humanity," he said. "Nor do I hesitate to accuse the government security forces of responsibility."
Yet, as genuine as Walker's outrage appeared to be, there was a dark irony about his personal role in demanding that Serb authorities be held accountable for civilian massacres. During the 1980s, Walker was a key figure working with U.S.-backed military operations in three countries of Central America: Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.
In all three violence-torn nations, U.S.-backed forces committed well-documented atrocities against unarmed civilians and enemy captives. Yet, the Reagan administration routinely ignored, disputed or minimized those slaughters. Though tens of thousands of civilians died in the three countries at the hands of allied forces, no war crimes tribunal was convened or even seriously contemplated. No one was judged guilty of crimes against humanity: not the perpetrators, not their superior officers and not their political allies in Washington. Only a few -- mostly low-level soldiers -- were punished at all.
To make matters worse, President Reagan and his subordinates often tried to discredit journalists and human rights investigators who uncovered evidence of war crimes.
I had a personal taste of how this worked when I was on a reporting assignment for Newsweek magazine in El Salvador in 1983. I had been traveling with a patrol of leftist guerrillas who were engaged in hit-and-run fighting against the Salvadoran army near the Guazapa Volcano.
The guerrilla unit was in retreat, followed by peasants who feared retaliation from the Salvadoran army that was known for butchering guerrilla sympathizers. As we made our way through the mountainous terrain, the army caught up with some civilian stragglers who had lagged behind, slowed by the presence of children.
From a distance of about two miles, I watched through binoculars. Soldiers of the U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion used guns and machetes to execute two dozen men, women and children near the village of Tenango. A guerrilla who was closer to the scene radioed a detailed account of the massacre as it was underway.
About two weeks later, after the government offensive ended, the guerrillas made their way back to the village and heard reports that the army had killed a total of 68 civilians.
As I later wrote in Newsweek: "Outside Tenango, the signs of the slaughter were everywhere: charred and scattered bits of clothing, shoes and schoolbooks. ... When I saw the bodies of the victims, vultures had already picked their skeletons clean and village dogs had begun to carry away the bones."
The Reagan administration reacted to the Tenango reports as it had toward many other accounts of war crimes in El Salvador: deny and denounce.
Several years later, an American journalist read a U.S. embassy cable about my report. He summarized the cable as stating: "The alleged Tenango massacre described in Newsweek never happened. It is a fabrication. Reporter Don North is lying."
By 1983, deny-and-denounce had become the administration's habitual retort to nearly all reports about the Salvadoran government's "dirty war." To President Reagan, Central America was the front line of the Cold War and extreme actions were justified.
The pattern started just days after Reagan's election with comments by U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Secretary of State Al Haig suggesting that the rape-murder of four American churchwomen in El Salvador could be blamed on the women for their supposedly leftist political views and actions.
Perhaps, the best documented cover-up was the case of El Mozote, a village in northeastern El Salvador where the U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion rounded up and executed about 800 men, women and children in December 1981.
When the massacre was reported in the U.S. press, senior State Department officials, Thomas Enders and Elliott Abrams, went to Capitol Hill and ridiculed the massacre reports. Those denials were disproved a decade later when a United Nations forensic team dug up hundreds of skeletons in El Mozote.
During the 1980s, William Walker was regarded as a professional foreign service officer who saw his job as carrying out administration policy regardless of personal qualms. Friends and associates said Walker tried quietly to moderate Reaganâ€™s support for right-wing elements,
