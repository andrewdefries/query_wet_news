When girl-on-guy was still new
James Francken reviews The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil by George Saunders.
James Francken
12:01AM BST 03 Jun 2006
Comments
Nick Hornby was characteristically self-deprecating when he revealed, in a recent interview, that "like a lot of writers" he couldn't really stand his own prose. "I wish I was better than I am. When you've written a few books, you realise that you do what you do, and then you start reading other people and you think, God, I wish I could do that, but I couldn't in a million years." But who did he have in mind? Hornby was unequivocal: "George Saunders - it's just that he has such a weird imagination. He's really, really different." Saunders's writing can be weird - his previous two short-story collections have included a cow with a plastic window in its flank; a couple who work in a historical theme park where they pretend to be cave people for the benefit of an indifferent public; and a man who works in a strip club but can't bear to expose himself. And in the manner that it explores the madness and zeal of modern-day America, Saunders's work is certainly very different from that of many of his contemporaries. But words such as "weird" and "different" only go so far to explain the satisfactions of his satire, the pleasure to be had in reading his witty, inventive, inspired nonsense. In his more straightforward stories, Saunders is happy to peddle gags like an old-fashioned stand-up. "Nostalgia", for example, a piece that appeared in the New Yorker earlier this year, finds comedy as the narrator realises, while watching sex on TV, that he has "become a prude": "I'm old. I came of age in a simpler sexual time." The joke escalates as the narrator's nostalgia increases: "Back in those ancient, prelapsarian days, 'girl-on-girl' hadn't even been invented yet. At that time, 'girl-on-guy' had only recently been discovered." Often, a joke's silliness and manic exuberance will carry it further still. Humour is notoriously hard to explain: it's said that bad jokes don't need analysis, and that good jokes defy it. Both The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil, Saunders's new novella, and In Persuasion Nation, the book of short stories that is included in the volume, are full of very good jokes. Take "My Amendment", a wonderful story in which Ken Byron writes a letter to his local newspaper, the Leadville Courier-Examiner, in praise of a recent article entitled "Not In This Town, Friend". "Like any sane person", Ken is against "Same-Sex Marriage" and in favour of a constitutional amendment to ban it. But Ken wants to go a step further and propose a supplementary amendment: In the town where I live, I have frequently observed a phenomenon I have come to think of as Samish-Sex Marriage. Take, for example, 'K', a male friend of mine, of slight build, with a ponytail. 'K' is married to 'S', a tall, stocky female with extremely short hair, almost a crew-cut. Often, while watching 'K' play with his own ponytail as 'S' towers over him, I have wondered, Isn't it odd that this somewhat effeminate man should be married to this somewhat masculine woman? Is this truly what God had in mind? There are any number of these wild flights in Saunders's fiction. "I Can Speak!™" is a surreal story in which the "Product Service Representative" of a company called KidLuv Inc writes a letter in response to a customer complaint. KidLuv manufactures a latex mask that can be put over a baby's face and gives the illusion that the baby speaks: the mask comes with "over 100 Discretionary Phrases to more highly personalise" your child. (There is even a German Learning module, so that your baby appears to say: "Guten Morgen, Papa!") The benefits are clear: a mask that allows your six-month-old to talk "makes you love him more." Saunders is certainly going after laughs in these stories. But the laughter is often unsettling. The collection has recurring targets - the wrongdoings of big business, the dangers of commercialism, the incongruities of suburban life - and the questions it asks are pointed: "Couldn't we all, working together, devise a more humane approach? An approach in which no one is humiliated, or hurt, or maimed, an approach in which the sacred things in life are no longer appropriated in the service of selling?" Books

Vodafone prepares for Vietnam push
Mark Kleinman in Hong Kong
12:01AM BST 08 Jul 2007
Comments
Mark Kleinman's blog: Notes from the Far East
Vodafone is preparing to break into Vietnam, one of the world's last remaining untapped markets for international mobile phone operators.
The Sunday Telegraph has learned that the British group has begun scouring the country's state-dominated mobile phone sector for prospective acquisitions that could ultimately cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. Vodafone has opened a representative office in Hanoi in recent weeks ahead of an expected privatisation programme overseen by Vietnam's communist government.
Fresh from its £5.5bn takeover of Hutchison Essar, the Indian mobile network, Vodafone is accelerating its push into Asia, where it also owns a small stake in China Mobile, the state-owned behemoth that operates in a market boasting almost half a billion wireless customers.
People close to Vodafone said this weekend that the company's interest in Vietnam was at an early stage but that it was positioning itself in readiness to secure partnership agreements and, ultimately, significant stakes in at least one of the government-owned companies.
Other international mobile operators are also thought to have set up representative offices in Vietnam in recent weeks. Among the overseas firms that already operate there is Hutchison Telecommunications International, the Hong Kong-based company from which Vodafone acquired its stake in Hutchison Essar.
Warren Finegold, the former UBS investment banker who is now Vodafone's chief executive of global business development, oversaw the opening of the Hanoi office on a recent visit, when he also held talks with government officials and regulators.
Jonathan Kriegel, the managing director of Vodafone's interests in China, is understood to have taken on the additional role of country officer for Vietnam.
Vietnam's economy, which has experienced expansion comparable to China and India, is fuelling a consumption boom that has seen industries including mobile telecoms achieve rapid growth in customers and revenues.
Although Vietnam has a sizeable population of 80m people, only a quarter are mobile phone users. Industry forecasts suggest that take-up is likely to double by 2010.
First in line for the Vietnamese Ministry of Post and Telematics ' privatisation programme are likely to be VinaFone and MobiFone, two of the country's biggest mobile companies.
The Vietnamese government is already engaged in a far-reaching programme of privatising state-owned assets, which include banks and other financial services firms, retailers and utilities. Strategic foreign investors are being encouraged to buy stakes in these companies in an effort to accelerate corporate governance reforms and bring Western operational expertise.
Vodafone declined to comment on any prospective deals in Vietnam.

Hundreds of preteen children treated for eating disorders Almost 600 children below the age of 13 have been treated in hospital for eating disorders in the past three years, new figures have revealed. The figures, from 35 NHS hospitals in England, show more than 2,100 children were treated for eating disorders before they reached their sixteenth birthday.

Comments
The statistics include 197 children between the ages of five and nine - with cases within this age group almost doubling over the period.
Experts blamed the trend on a "pernicious" celebrity culture which glorified size zero figures, leaving increasing numbers of young girls struggling to cope with their growing bodies.
The figures, from 35 NHS hospitals in England, show more than 2,100 children were treated for eating disorders before they reached their sixteenth birthday. They include 98 children aged between five and seven at the time of treatment and 99 aged eight or nine. Almost 400 were between the ages of 10 and 12, while more than 1,500 were aged 13 to 15.
Even these statistics, disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, are likely to be an underestimate. Related Articles

Fashion industry has forced unrealistic image on women, says leading designer
12 Feb 2011
Some NHS hospitals treating such patients refused to provide any data, while among the 35 hospitals, some would only disclose the figures for those children admitted to wards after becoming dangerously emaciated - excluding those undergoing psychiatric therapy as outpatients.
Susan Ringwood, chief executive of eating disorders charity B-eat said the figures reflected alarming trends in society, with young children "internalising" messages from celebrity magazines, which idealised the thinnest figures.
"A number of factors combine to trigger eating disorders; biology and genetics play a large part in their development, but so do cultural pressures, and body image seems to be influencing younger children much more over the past decade," she added.
Research carried out by the charity with the Brownies found that even by the age of seven, girls who looked at outline drawing of women thought the thinner ones were happier and more popular than those with slightly larger outlines.
Mrs Ringwood said young girls felt increasingly frightened by the prospect of gaining weight in puberty. She said: "Children are receiving very pernicious messages. "The ideal figure promoted for women these days is that of a girl, not an adult women. Girls see the pictures in magazines of extremely thin women and think that is how they should be. "That can leave them fearful of puberty, and almost trying to stave it off."
In 2009, Kate Moss, the supermodel, was accused of encouraging girls to become anorexic when she said she lived by the phrase 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' - a mantra of pro-anorexic groups.
While disorders among men are increasing, cases involving boys were often sparked by specific incidents, such as being bullied because of their weight, she said.
Separate research published in the British Journal of Psychiatry earlier this year suggests one in five children diagnosed with an eating disorder have a history of early feeding problems, such as fussy eating. Almost half of those diagnosed with disorders by the age of 12 had a close family member with a mental health problem such as anxiety or depression.
The study by the University College London's Institute of Child Health found more than 80 per cent of cases involved girls, with anorexia – which involves drastically reducing the intake of food and drink – far more common than bulimia – which involves sufferers binge eating and then making themselves sick.
Last year a survey of women suffering from anorexia found almost half said they had a problem with food by the age of 10.
Experts say there is no clear relationship between "fussy eating" and the later development of a disorder.
But Mrs Ringwood said some particular behaviours with food – such as cutting it into tiny pieces, or insisting that foods were eaten separately, could indicate early signs of a more significant problem. Other types of behaviour which had nothing to do with food could provide some clues, she said.
"If children become very rigid in their routines and get upset if changes are made that can be an indicator of the type of anxiety associated with disorders," she said.
Even young children who were trying to restrict their diet could be stealthy about it, she said, hiding food up their sleeves at mealtimes, in order to throw it away.
Georgie Bevan, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, was 11 when signs first appeared of a problem with food. For the boarding school pupil, it began with a class lecture on healthy eating, which appeared to trigger an obsession with cutting out fat from her diet.
When she returned home for the summer holidays, parents Charlotte and Christopher, who run a farm, were shocked to see how thin she had become. Shortly after she was diagnosed, aged 12, she reached a point of refusing all food and drink and had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for several weeks.
At first, she seemed to make a quick recovery.
Mrs Bevan, 46, said: "She went back to school for the autumn term. Ten days later, the school phoned and said she had stopped eating. It was heartbreaking. We didn't know what to do."
Two years on, after undergoing family therapy, and being sent to a day school, Georgie is a healthy weight, and her parents believe she has made a full recovery.
Her mother said: "When something like this happens of course you ask yourself questions – is it something we did? I'm not a perfect mother but I think I did a good job. "From everything we know, the predisposition to eating disorders is genetic but it is the environment that pulls the trigger."

Boris Becker had some epic rallies in his day, but none lasting four years. This is how long his nine-bedroom Balearic home has been for sale. The 64-acre estate has a 25-metre swimming pool, a basketball court and stables, as well as a tennis court. Like many Majorcan properties, the price has dropped. In 2008 it went on the market at more than £12m. Today, it is £10.02m. Comments on this gallery
