In perfect harmony: award-winning pianist Benjamin Grosvenor and his brother Jonathan Benjamin Grosvenor reveals why he chose to dedicate his Classic Brits Critics' Choice award to his Down's syndrome brother Jonathan
'He’s grown to appreciate the nice food and the beer': Jonathan and Benjamin Grosvenor Photo: FIONA HANSON	By Julia Llewellyn Smith

Traditionally, awards-ceremony speeches are gushy, dull and overlong, but on Tuesday night, when Benjamin Grosvenor accepted the coveted Critic’s Choice award at the Classic Brits, the audience was genuinely moved. “I dedicated it to my brother, Jonathan,” says the 20-year-old pianist, whom critics are calling our most important musical talent in decades. “It was for putting up with my incessant practice over the years and coming to so many of my concerts against his will.”
Jonathan, 22, who has Down’s syndrome and is visually impaired, responded by standing up and excitedly displaying his place-card to the audience. Does he think his brother is famous now? “Yes,” he grins. “Well…” Benjamin responds, laughing. “Some people came up to my parents on the red carpet and complained: 'There’s no one famous here!’ But then Jonathan and Charlotte – I think they’re brother and sister from Britain’s Got Talent – arrived. People were shouting 'Jonathan, come and sign my autograph book!’ and Jono thought they were talking to him…”
“But I don’t know how to sign an autograph,” says Jonathan, beside him, at the dining table in the Thirties-style semi in Southend, where the brothers still live with their teacher parents. Related Articles

“You just write your name, Jono,” says Benjamin fondly. This was Benjamin’s second awards-ceremony experience in a week. A few days previously, he won two Gramophone Awards: the instrumental category and Young Artist of the Year. An endearingly unworldly young man, Benjamin’s sudden immersion into popular culture has been unnerving. “Yes, it’s been a bit of a strange experience for me,” he says. “There was an after-party in a club. It was a small room and then all the Military Wives arrived and it was very crowded and noisy, difficult to talk. I’m not really a fan of those things, though Gareth Malone [choirmaster from The Choir] did say he liked my speech. He seems very nice.”
In jeans and a T-shirt, with a shock of mad-professor hair, Benjamin comes across as slightly old-fashioned, with a keen a sense of irony. In person, especially compared to the more extrovert Jonathan, he is stiff-upper-lipped. The emotions express themselves in his piano playing. Probably because Benjamin is the youngest of five boys, there is none of the arrogance occasionally associated with prodigies. In 2004, as a chubby-cheeked 11-year-old, he reached the final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year, his hands still unable to span an octave. At the time, there were snide murmurs about pushy parents and inevitable burnout. But nearly a decade later, Benjamin is vindicated. Last year he became the first British pianist in 60 years to sign with the prestigious Decca label, and the youngest soloist at First Night of the Proms. His Critic’s Choice award for his debut Decca CD, Chopin Liszt Ravel, beat prestigious nominees such as Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic. “Yeah, things are going quite well at the moment.” Benjamin frowns slightly. “I’m just not used to all the attention. “I have no ambitions,” he continues. “When I was very young my ideal was to play at the Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic, but I was lucky enough to do that at 13.”
Benjamin began playing aged five, a pupil of his piano-teacher mother, Rebecca. “All my brothers had learnt instruments and were quite good, but they gave up in their early teens. I persevered.”
Initially, he claims to have been an average student, but at eight, he suddenly took off. “There was a Chopin waltz [Grade-8 standard] that I learnt very quickly apparently and seemed to have an emotional understanding of.”
At 14, he was taken out of grammar school to study for A- levels at home, fitting schoolwork around practising on his second-hand Bösendorfer bought with a £10,000 loan from his grandmother and £17,000 from his own earnings. The instrument may have been distinguished, but the neighbours were distinctly unimpressed. “We moved the piano to the other side of the room and a few years ago we put boxes of my CDS in front of the fireplace, stuffing the empty ones with paper. Amateur soundproofing. We haven’t had complaints since.”
Until last year, when the last of the three elder brothers moved out, he and Jonathan had to share a bedroom. “Jono has a tendency to snore, so I do have more restful nights now,” he says. Jonathan in turn is glad not to be kept up by his brother reading musical theory books. As children, the boys played together all the time. “I don’t think of him as having Down’s syndrome any more. To me, his main disability is his sight.” Jonathan has a cataract that wasn’t treated as a baby. “He finds it infuriating, and I think it’s this that holds him back more than anything else.”
Jonathan has travelled round the world to watch his brother play. “He had no choice, there was no one at home to look after him. I don’t think he enjoys concerts, though there are certain pieces like Gershwin’s I Got Rhythm where he stands and cheers at the end. And he’s grown to appreciate the nice food and more recently the beer he might get in the pub afterwards.”
“I like your concerts,” says Jonathan. “You don’t need to lie so as not to hurt my feelings,” Benjamin says gently. Jonathan recalls one grudge. “I gave up time on my birthday to go to a different country with you.”
“You went up the Empire State Building. Isn’t that a good way to spend a birthday?”
“Usually, I spend time with my friend Paul on my birthday,” Jonathan replies firmly. Jonathan enjoys pop music, especially Westlife. “Those modulations at the end of the songs!” Benjamin says despairingly of his brother’s taste. In contrast, pop has passed Grosvenor by. “Though I did use to love Queen. They did things that were musically interesting”. He has close friends from the Royal Academy of Music, from which he graduated in the summer, but there’s no time for romance (asked about groupies, he quipped that they tended to be over 60). Driving lessons start soon, but for now Mum is his chauffeur, ferrying him and Jonathan all over Europe, to non-stop performances. He’s in no hurry to fly the nest. “One day. But I’ll have to find a place with neighbours who don’t mind practising.”
He admits to being a perfectionist, who is often stressed. In contrast, Jonathan is happy-go-lucky. When Benjamin gets frustrated, he ends up clowning around with Jonathan to let off steam. “When I go away without him, he’s the person I miss the most, because he brings so much joy.”
'The Classic Brits’ will be shown on ITV tonight at 10.20pm. Grosvenor makes his Southbank debut in the International Piano Series on October 31 Music

Chile experts identify Trinidad Moruga Scorpion as world's hottest Experts at New Mexico's State University's Chile Pepper Institute have identified the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion as the hottest pepper on the planet.

Comments
There are super-hot chili varieties. And then there's the sweat-inducing, tear-generating, mouth-on-fire Trinidad Moruga Scorpion.
With a name like that, it's not surprising that months of research by the experts at New Mexico's State University's Chile Pepper Institute have identified the variety as the new hottest pepper on the planet.
The golf ball-sized pepper scored the highest among a handful of chili breeds reputed to be among the hottest in the world. Its mean heat topped more than 1.2 million units on the Scoville heat scale, while fruits from some individual plants reached 2 million heat units.
"You take a bite. It doesn't seem so bad, and then it builds and it builds and it builds. So it is quite nasty," Paul Bosland, a renowned pepper expert and director of the chili institute, said of the pepper's heat.
Researchers were pushed by hot sauce makers, seed producers and others in the spicy foods industry to establish the average heat levels for super-hot varieties in an effort to quash unscientific claims of which peppers are actually the hottest.

How to eat spicy foods?

That's something that hadn't been done before, Bosland said.
"The question was, could the Chile Pepper Institute establish the benchmark for chili heat?" he said. "Chile heat is a complex thing, and the industry doesn't like to base it on just a single fruit that's a record holder. It's too variable." The academic institute is based at the university's agriculture school and is partially funded by federal grants, as well as some industry groups depending on the project.
The team planted about 125 plants of each variety – the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion, the Trinidad Scorpion, the 7-pot, the Chocolate 7-pot and the Bhut Jolokia, which was a previous record-holder identified by the institute and certified by Guinness World Records in 2007.
Randomly selected mature fruits from several plants within each variety were harvested, dried and ground to powder. The compounds that produce heat sensation – the capsaicinoids – were then extracted and examined.
During harvesting, senior research specialist Danise Coon said she and the two students who were picking the peppers went through about four pairs of latex gloves.
"The capsaicin kept penetrating the latex and soaking into the skin on our hands. That has never happened to me before," she said.
Chile peppers of the same variety can vary in heat depending on environmental conditions. More stress on a plant – hotter temperatures or less water, for example – will result in hotter fruit.
The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion's new notoriety is already making waves in the industry and among those who love their hot, spicy foods.
"As with all the previous record holders, there will be a run on seeds and plants," said Jim Duffy, a grower in San Diego who supplied the university with seeds for four of the super-hot varieties. "Like Cabbage Patch dolls right before Christmas or Beanie Babies, it's like the hot item."
Not even Duffy or the researchers would dare to pop a whole Trinidad Moruga Scorpion in their mouths, but there are plenty of videos on social networking sites where heat-loving daredevils have tried.
The blood flow increases and the endorphins start flowing. Their faces turn red, the sweat starts rolling, their eyes and noses water and there's a fiery sensation that spreads across their tongues and down their throats.
"People actually get a crack-like rush," Duffy said. "I know the people who will eat the hottest stuff to get this rush, but they've got to go through the pain."
Pepper experts said there are a handful of people who are crazy enough to subject themselves to the pain, but the rest just want to try out these super-hot peppers on their friends or make killer hot sauce – and it doesn't take a whole pepper to do that.
More bang for the buck is how Bosland describes it. He said a family could buy two of the super-hot peppers to flavour their meals for an entire week.
The beauty of the peppers is they're not only the hottest in the world, but they're also some of the most flavourful peppers, Duffy said.
"You can make a barbecue sauce or a hot sauce at a mild to medium level using small amounts of these peppers and it will be so darn addictive that you won't want to put your spoon down," he said. "You'll want to eat and eat and eat."

Mary Wilson
12:01AM BST 20 Jul 2005
Comments
Bryan Chittenden has lived peacefully in his bungalow in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, for 16 years. But on April 1 this year, planning permission was granted for two four-bedroom houses at the bottom of his garden, writes Mary Wilson
"The bedroom windows in one house will look right over my bungalow," he says. "My other neighbour will be overlooked by both houses." Bryan was unaware of the proposals until it was too late to object. He discovered that a letter about the plans had been sent to him, but the Royal Mail returned it because it did not bear his full address. It wasn't until April 5 that he saw the plans and that a magnificent 60ft copper beech tree at the bottom of his garden - which had been subject to a tree preservation order since 1977 - had been omitted. There were details of how smaller trees on the site would be preserved, and one larger tree felled, but nothing about the copper beech. He pointed out the omission to a planning officer at Wealden District Council. "The foundations of one house will be about 43ft from the centre of the trunk - 6½ft closer than the Subsidence Claims Advisory Bureau recommends," Bryan says. "Also a proportion of the tree will need to be lopped off so that the house can be built. This could destabilise the tree, as could the foundations." Bryan is also concerned that the tree will still be 13ft taller than the house. "It will not be very good for future neighbourly relations. If we had a bad gale, it could be blown down. Or a branch could break off and damage the roof," he says. "These two new houses will, undoubtedly, affect the tree and will definitely affect me. However, the official said that as planning consent had been given, nothing could be done." A spokesman for Wealden District Council comments: "Outline permission was granted in 2000. When approving the development's layout, as part of discussions for detailed permission, planning officers were able to ensure that none of the five existing trees on the site had to be removed. The beech tree protected by a TPO (tree perservation order) will require a limited amount of pruning to accommodate the roof of the garage. We intend to monitor this work closely. Before any work begins, the developer must satisfy the council that the correct fencing is in place to protect the trees."
David Henry, a planning director for Savills (01223 347000), comments: "The granting of planning permission overrides the TPO. However, a TPO is a strong material consideration in determining a planning application, whether at outline stage or later. The decision-makers should give significant weight to protection of the tree when looking at the plans. Even if it was not shown, the council's records should have shown it up. So it is worth checking that this was the case - if not, there may be negligence and thus a case for the Ombudsman. "The outline consent in 2000 merely established the principle of developing the site. Important details such as the layout and design of the properties are not foregone conclusions. The amenity of neighbours is an important factor in this - and not one to be overlooked lightly. "Lack of neighbour notification is administratively lax. Once the letter to Mr Chittenden was returned to them, it was up to the council to figure out why. After all, they must have known the house was there, or else they wouldn't have sent the letter in the first place. This is another possible Ombudsman matter. "Finally, conditions are there to be abided by. Unfortunately, councils have few resources with which to police them. Mr Chittenden is their best watchdog. It may be worth him employing an arboriculturalist to monitor progress. Guidelines are only rules of thumb and the actual site conditions will have a significant effect on the health of the tree."
