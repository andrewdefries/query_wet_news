Eurovision Song Contest 2012 final, BBC One, review
Michael Deacon gives his verdict on Engelbert Humperdinck's romantic waltz and the highlights of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Azerbaijan. By Michael Deacon

A suggestion for UKIP. Put to one side, just for a moment, the demands for an in/out referendum on the European Union. The long-suffering British citizen has a more urgent priority. We need an in/out referendum on the Eurovision Song Contest.
Once again, poor old Royaume-Uni was crushed. This shouldn’t feel embarrassing. Britain produces nearly all the best and most commercially successful pop acts in Europe. We just don’t enter them for Eurovision. Adele, Coldplay and Take That aren’t going to represent us some giddy May evening in Riga, Bucharest or Helsinki. But that’s OK, isn’t it? We don’t care about winning Eurovision. It’s just a bit of silly fun. We only watch it to laugh at the funny foreigners. Oh those funny foreigners! They actually take this nonsense seriously! At least, we assume they do, because only we British get “irony”, right?
But then the big night rolls around and we get drunk on our sofas and no one votes for us and we finish 198 points behind the Faroe Islands and we start shouting WHO WON THE BLOODY WAR ANYWAY and we’re reduced to sulkily reminding ourselves that Britain produces nearly all the best and most commercially successful pop acts in Europe so we could easily win if we wanted to we just don’t ALL RIGHT.
This year’s contest, broadcast as ever on BBC One, was held in Azerbaijan – “the most easterly venue of the Eurovision Song Contest ever!” chirped Graham Norton. Norton is very good at Eurovision. Playful, dry, witty, yet affectionate – much like his long-serving predecessor, Terry Wogan. Both Wogan and Norton, of course, are Irish. You know what this means. Not only are we unable to find a decent British entrant, we’re unable to find a decent British commentator. (We once had an empire that stretched across the globe. Seriously: how did that happen? Did we win it in a raffle?)
Our man, Engelbert “The Hump” Humperdinck, was up first. This fact worried Norton. Singing first, he said, meant that by the time viewers came to vote they might have forgotten our song. Frankly, that sounded like our best hope. Actually The Hump’s song wasn’t too bad, but it was hard to see what genre its writers were aiming at. (“A camp version of Johnny Cash! This is exactly what the world’s been waiting for!”)

Maybe that didn’t matter. It was hard to see what genre most of the other acts were aiming at either. Russia had a gaggle of tone-deaf grannies. Albania had a squawking Bjork-alike who “found my plane on the lightless runway of your soul”. Ireland had Jedward, the disturbingly doll-like X Factor twins. They sang about falling in love with a girl. No viewer expects to escape the Eurovision Song Contest without some degree of psychological scarring but the idea of Jedward as sexual beings will be difficult for all but the hardiest to recover from. Soon you’ll see them sleeping rough, or stumbling into rehab clinics and soup kitchens: people who watched Jedward at Eurovision 2012 and were never able to readjust to normal life.
Iceland had a male-female duo. At last, you thought, something nice and conventional. Then you heard them sing. Probably the aim was harmony, but in practice it sounded as though they were simultaneously singing two very different songs that by some inexplicable coincidence had the same lyrics.
Then came outrage. Germany’s song, Norton informed us, had been co-written by Jamie Cullum. Yes, that Jamie Cullum. The jazz musician. The BRITISH jazz musician. Cullum – regarded until now as a blameless enough sort of chap – stood revealed as a traitor, a quisling, a collaborator, a musical Lord Haw-Haw. And in the year of Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee, too. The treasonous swine deserves to be stripped of his passport or at the very least his piano.
Eventually it was time for each country to reveal how its citizens had voted. The answer was: for everyone except Britain. We ended up with a grand total of 12 – 360 behind Sweden, the winners. Only Norway had the common courtesy to score fewer points than we did and save us from finishing last. Belgium, Latvia, Estonia and Ireland were the sole countries to give us anything.
We British pride ourselves on our tolerance and good grace, but if the Europeans think we’re going to forget about this humiliation they’re in for an unpleasant surprise the next time they come knocking on our door for bail-out money.
“Hello, Brussels! This is London calling! To Italy, we award… £8! To Spain… £10! But the maximum goes to Greece: £12!”

Swine flu killed 457 people and cost £1.24 billion, official figures show
The swine flu pandemic cost the country 457 lives and more than £1.2 billion, the official report into the outbreak has revealed. Link to this video
By Richard Alleyne, Science Correspondent
1:35PM BST 01 Jul 2010
Comments
Dame Deirdre Hine, a former chief medical officer for Wales who carried out the review, said that the death toll could have been much higher but for the swift response and mild nature of the disease. She denied the contingency plans amounted to an overreaction and said that it was important that the relative success did not make us complacent. She concluded that the UK's response to last year's outbreak was "proportionate and effective". "It is imperative that the experience of 2009 doesn't lead to complacency," she said. "It is a bit like childbirth – when it's all over, you forget quite how serious and how difficult it all was. Related Articles

Swine flu pandemic is over, says WHO
10 Aug 2010
"The threat of a flu pandemic remains very high. Both the successes and the lessons from this pandemic should inform policy and planning for the next one because there will be a next one, and the next one might be more severe. "If the UK government had not responded to the unexpected threat. Had it turned out to be more severe then we would have been having a very different press conference today." She highlighted the lack of flexibility in the contracts signed by the Government for vaccines against the H1N1 virus, meaning that Britain was left with many doses it did not need, many of which were donated to the Third World. There were 457 reported and confirmed swine flu-related deaths across the UK between the outbreak in April last year and March this year. Figures in the report show that Britain spent £654 million preparing for a possible flu pandemic, and £587 million responding to the H1N1 outbreak – a total of £1.24 billion. This includes £1.01 billion on drugs, among them antivirals, doses of vaccine and antibiotics. The report said there was a lack of flexibility once the Department of Health (DoH) signed contracts for swine flu vaccine with drug manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Baxter. Baxter agreed to a "break clause" allowing the Government to cancel its order for some of the doses but GSK refused. The report noted that the DoH eventually agreed to take 35 million doses of the vaccine from GSK. "I think we have got to set these figures, which seem enormous, against the potential for saving lives," she said. "It is fairly clear, although we can't actually identify the number, that there probably were lives saved of very young people, young children and so on. "These are extremely valuable lives."

Britain's ten scariest road junctions named
Spaghetti Junction was beaten in to second place By Tom Chivers
12:01AM GMT 12 Dec 2007
Comments
The Hanger Lane gyratory system, near Wembley in west London, has been granted the dubious honour of being named Britain's scariest junction. Have Your Say: What is Britain's scariest junction?
More than a quarter of people chose the meeting between the A40 West Avenue and the North Circular, near Ealing in a poll by the Highway Insurance company.
The news will come as no surprise to London commuters who have battled with the treacherous junction since its development.
Likewise, Midlands drivers will not be shocked to learn that the famous - or perhaps infamous - Spaghetti Junction, in Birmingham, came second in the poll.

Third and fourth places were back in London - at Marble Arch in the West End and Elephant and Castle south of the river respectively. Scotland was also represented, with the M8 junctions through central Glasgow and the Sheriffhall Roundabout, Edinburgh, picking up the eighth and tenth spots.
As well as examining the junctions, the survey also looked at driving habits and gender differences between drivers.
It revealed that female drivers are more likely to be concerned about junctions than male ones. Seventeen per cent of women said that they regularly avoided specific junctions, compared to just nine per cent of men. The full list of scary road junctions

Collymore heads Bradford City clear out
8:38AM GMT 08 Jan 2001
BENITO CARBONE and Dan Petrescu are set to join Stan Collymore on the Bradford City transfer list as new manager Jim Jefferies clears the decks of flair players for the relegation battle ahead. Jefferies has already made it clear that Collymore has no future after less than three months at Valley Parade, leading to negotiations over the weekend with Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart. However, the £500,000 deal has collapsed over personal terms because Collymore currently earns £13,000 per week, plus an extra £7,000 when he plays.
Jefferies will name the other players who are surplus to requirements after tonight's FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough, following a meeting with City chairman Geoffrey Richmond. The need to cut the club's wage bill, plus Jefferies' belief that Bradford's survival depends on determination and desire, rather than flair, seem likely to signal the end for Carbone and Petrescu, the two other high profile signings of his predecessor, Chris Hutchings. Bradford's first away win in the Premiership for more than eight months at Leicester on New Year's Day came with neither Carbone nor Petrescu in the side, and with Collymore only playing for the last five minutes as a sub. Jefferies said: "I'll be having a chat with one or two shortly to let them know if they want to play regularly then they will have to move on. We've got to be solid and get the team working as a unit rather than playing as individuals.'' DUNCAN FERGUSON, the Everton striker, has been lauded by local police after he fought off two burglars at his home during the weekend.
The 29-year-old striker suffered a minor injury in the incident, which took place just after 1am on Sunday morning, but did not require hospital treatment. However, one youth is still in hospital today after the break-in near Ormskirk, Lancs. Althought a Lancashire Police spokesman declined to name the homeowner, club sources confirmed the attempted burglary at the former Scotland international's converted barn in the village of Rufford. Praising his actions, the spokesman said: "He has been interviewed by Lancashire Police and we are satisfied that he acted both bravely and responsibly when encountering these intruders in his home." A second raider fled the scene and police were today continuing to hunt him. Everton

London 2012 Olympics: how are we going to cope with this post-Games hangover? By moaning about football
The email neatly diagnosed the condition. Landing in my inbox yesterday morning, it came from the Oxford United ticket office. “Post Olympics blues? Get your sporting fix with the U’s,” it read.

Poetic as it was, this was a bold claim for the strength of the cure. Overcome the void in your life caused by the sudden removal of 15 hours a day of top quality international competition, of being inspired by astonishing levels of performance by the leading practitioners in their field, of weeping with pride at the brilliance of your countrymen, by going along to watch lower league football? That is a hefty assertion. Still, I booked two tickets for tonight’s game on the spot. Anything to get me through the next few days, anything that might allow me again to be absorbed into a communal sporting event, anything to watch a bit of live action. Even if it was Oxford v Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup. According to the predictions of many before the Games, round about now we were supposed to be picking ourselves up from national humiliation, sweeping away the debris of our shattered reputation. For the naysayers, the Olympics were only going to unleash abject disaster upon our heads. As the flame went out (probably early after the organisers forgot to pay the gas bill) we were expected to be confronted with a catalogue of error: everything was supposed to go wrong. From security, through transport to passport control, nothing would work, grinding the capital to a standstill even as we were exposed as useless fourth-raters to the rest of the world.

That was why it was such a good idea to get out of the country for the two weeks of competition, head to the Dordogne, where you could stay smugly aloof from the misery we had so rashly invited upon our nation. So how did that pan out as an act of clairvoyance? How much braying about how clever they were being are the escapees likely to indulge in on their return? As an audit on the most brilliant two weeks any who did not have the foresight to leave has ever experienced, it is telling that the only thing we have to worry about now the flame is extinguished is this: how to cope with the hangover. Nevertheless, it is a serious problem. How are we going to get by without our fix of Clare Balding enthusing about the esoterics of the dressage, of Nicky Campbell gambolling with the volunteers in the Olympic Park, of Garry Richardson’s morning inquiry of yet another gleaming fresh-faced British victor: “Olympic champion, how does that sound?” Here’s how these Olympics have infected us: seven million of us tuned in to watch Tom Daley dive for bronze on Sunday night. This for a sporting event which is generally played out to an audience of one man and his rather well groomed poodle. So much did this past fortnight affect our critical faculties that at its conclusion on Sunday night we sat through a parade of superannuated (and in several cases dead) pop stars reprising their long-forgotten dirges and wept not with laughter, but at the glory of it all. Despite the evidence that we should, the psychologist Pete Cohen insists we need not fear the next few days. He believes we will be able to continue drawing inspiration from Olympians. We’re not all going to be Olympic champions, he reckons, but we can be winners in our own lives. We’re not all going to be Ben Ainslie or Nicola Adams, but we can all be stronger, fitter and healthier. And doubtless some of us will attempt to fill the aching gap at the centre of our lives by dragging the bike from the shed and then wobbling off down the road, our every creaking advance accompanied by an imagined commentary from Hugh Porter. Some of us will pull a hamstring putting on our trainers before going out on a Mo-inspired jog. And then some of us will head to the football. The perfect place, as it happens, for us to recall all those things we most valued about the past two weeks. Watching the stars of the Premier League we can make disparaging comparisons with those we have come to love during the Games. We can wonder why they can’t be as humble in victory as Jessica Ennis, as dedicated to their craft as Alistair Brownlee, as charmingly irreverent as Usain Bolt. By doing that, we will gradually make our way through the bleakness of the hangover. That is the final triumph of these Games: the way we can use them as a stick to beat our national sport. Olympics

Richie McCaw's All Blacks are a great team, but nowhere near the greatest just yet
Are these All Black the greatest side ever to have played the game? The statisticians might soon be telling you that they are. Many of us think they have got some way to go yet. Just champion: Richie McCaw holds up the inaugural Rugby Championship trophy, which the All Blacks won at the weekend Photo: REUTERS	By Mick Cleary, Rugby Union Correspondent

Hats off, though, where they are due. New Zealand's 54-15 win against Argentina in La Plata on Saturday night saw them claim the inaugural Rugby Championship, a tournament that has turned out to be as ho-hum as its mundane name. New Zealand are far and away the most potent and proficient team in the four-way competition, carrying on from where they left off when they won the Rugby World Cup on home soil almost 12 months ago. They have taken the title at a breeze. The freewheeling victory over an energetic Pumas side, long on heart and soul but still lacking theclass and composure that will come through this enhanced exposure, was their 15th win in succession. By the time the Championship concludes they will probably have racked up win No17 to leave them tied with the Fred Allen-coached All Blacks of the mid-Sixties and Nick Mallett’s Springbok team of the late Nineties as the established sides with the greatest number of consecutive victories. (Minnows Lithuania have 18). The All Blacks will soon be here for the November series of Tests. Related Articles

Will we really be acclaiming them as the finest the sport has known? Comparisons across the eras are tricky, often flawed but always fun. By any criteria, Richie McCaw’s side are an accomplished outfit. By one measurement alone, that of having all-time great players in their ranks, they just about stack up: McCaw himself ranks alongside previous high-grade flankers such as former All Black Michael Jones, or Ireland’s Fergus Slattery or that Gallic blond warrior, Jean-Pierre Rives. Likewise fly-half Dan Carter stands tall in the company of former Wallaby Michael Lynagh or the Welsh masters Barry John and Phil Bennett. T
hrow into that mix Conrad Smith, a clever, hard-edged centre in the mould of a Philippe Sella. Kieran Read at No8? Ticks my box. Full-back Mils Muliaina and prop Tony Woodcock would also stand the test of time. But truly to transcend all others, a team have to be so dominant, so overwhelming that they brook no argument as to their status in history. T
hey have to be a side of beauty and power as well as of mere stats. They must have an aura, set trends, shape styles for future generations. They have to challenge our way of thinking. Take Wales of the Seventies. Or New Zealand of the late Eighties, captained by Buck Shelford, a side who went 23 Tests without defeat, their perfect return spoilt only by a draw against Australia in 1988. Now, they were a great side, full of great players: Jones and Shelford, the Whetton brothers and John Kirwan were the equal of any. Ditto, too, Sean Fitzpatrick’s All Black side who were the kings in the mid-Nineties in every regard bar that one that mattered, that of being world champions. Nelson Mandela’s jig of delight on the Ellis Park podium in 1995 told you what a special moment that was for the whole of South Africa as the hot favourite All Blacks were beaten in extra time. These New Zealanders do not strike fear into the opposition that way that those teams did. Defeat is a possibility, even this weekend in Soweto where England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be an interested observer. South Africa ought to have got across the line recently only to flunk a shedload of kicks at goal. Ireland almost lowered New Zealand’s colours in the summer (then got tanked 60-0 the following week for their effrontery).
Look how close France came to sending a nation over the cliff in the World Cup final, beaten by a point as well as crass refereeing. Wales will fancy their chances this autumn. And England? They are some way short of such expectations. But as Argentina have shown during the Rugby Championship, if you double-tackle, stymie the All Blacks’ off-loading game, you have a chance. It may only be a sniff, though. The manner in which wings Julian Savea and Cory Jane took their tries on Saturday shows that New Zealand remain without equal in finishing chances. The Championship has shown up deep flaws in Australian rugby which need a root and branch fix by next summer or the Lions will barely have to raise a bead of perspiration to succeed, as well as the continuing one-dimensional nature of South Africa. Argentina have been a splendid addition and will grow. As for New Zealand being the greatest of all time – not yet, not by some distance. Brighton could rock as World Cup venue
Organisers are in the last stages of compiling their long list of venues for Rugby World Cup 2015. There is still some wriggling to do to get the required football grounds on board. A personal recce on Saturday of one of the contenders, Brighton’s Amex Stadium, came up trumps. Visually stunning, on-site practicalities without complaint. Organisers will focus too on creating Fan Zones, a great hit in New Zealand. Where should London’s be? Richmond Park? Twickenham Green? Trafalgar Square?
Farrell's Ryder lesson
Owen Farrell proved above anything else in Sunday’s win against Harlequins that he has the head as well as the heart for international rugby. He did not miss a beat in landing all six attempts at goal. As the Ryder Cup has shown, character can take you far.

Wikipedia ban lifted by Internet Watch Foundation
The Internet Watch Foundation has reversed its decision to ban access to a Wikipedia page that includes an image of a naked girl. The cover of the 1976 album Virgin Killer might be illegal By Claudine Beaumont and Nicole Martin

The online watchdog said it had removed the page from its internet blacklist, and had advised internet service providers to restore access to the Wikipedia article in question. The offending image is the 1976 album cover of Virgin Killer by German rock group Scorpions. It shows a naked girl with a crack in the camera lens obscuring her genitals. The Internet Watch Foundation, which filters websites for British internet service providers, had warned last Friday that the cover image might be illegal. The IWF said it consulted the police before adding the page to its list of proscribed sites, which is widely used by internet firms, including AOL, PlusNet, Sky and Talk Talk, to filter out images showing child abuse and other illegal content. But following a protest from Wikipedia users and the online encyclopedia's parent organisation, Wikimedia, the IWF said it would reconsider the ban. It has since ruled that the offending web page can be removed from its internet blacklist, having carefully considered the "contextual issues involved in this specific case" and "the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability". The Foundation also admitted that its move to ban the web page had in fact led to the image in question being more widely disemminated. "IWF's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet, however, on this occasion, our efforts have had the opposite effect," said the Foundation in a statement.

"We regret the unintended consequences for Wikipedia and its users."
Wikipedia users were particularly angry that the IWF banned the text on the offending page, as well as the image. "Blocking text is a whole new thing," said volunteer editor David Gerard. "It's the first time they've done this on such a visible site."
Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, had also been critical of the IWF's decision. "My concern isn't so much about the image," he told Channel 4 News. "It's the ambigious way they [the IWF] are behaving. It's not clear if they are over-reaching their authority."
One of the major bones of contention for Wikipedia users had been the fact that the album cover image was widely available on other websites, such as Amazon in the US, leading to confusion about the role of the Internet Watch Foundation, and the remit of its powers. Technology News
