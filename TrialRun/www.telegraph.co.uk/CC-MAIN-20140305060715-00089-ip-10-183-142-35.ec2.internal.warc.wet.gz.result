Take That announce tour Take That have promised a ''feast for the imagination'' with their first tour as a complete group in 16 years.
Link to this video
10:17AM BST 26 Oct 2010
The band's summer stadium tour around the UK includes four nights at Wembley Stadium after it kicks off next May. Gary Barlow, Robbie Williams, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald confirmed the tour, Progress Live 2011, at a press conference in London. The last time the five-piece performed together was in 1995. This 14-date UK tour will end with six dates in Europe and feature Take That's biggest hits from the last two decades. It will also see Williams, who rejoined his old bandmates earlier this year after they reunited without him in 2005, perform songs from his solo career. Related Articles

Lotus Evora S review Behind the wheel of the new, supercharged, 172mph Lotus Evora S – the car that threatens to take the Porsche 911's spot at the top of the class. Image 1 of 3	Evora S is as at home on the track as it is on the road Image 1 of 3	This supercharged Evora is a rival for Porsche's 911 Image 1 of 3	Handling is superb, which is more than can be said for the ergonomics Photo: ANDY MORGAN	By Chris Knapman 4:09PM GMT 04 Nov 2010
Comments
There's an awful lot going on at Lotus at the moment. So much so, that the plethora of promised new metal – Elan, Elise, Eterne, Elite and Esprit – has completely overshadowed the ongoing development of what is at risk of becoming the forgotten jewel in Hethel's crown: the Evora. First unveiled at the 2008 British Motor Show, the two-seater or two-plus-two coupé seemed to deliver almost perfectly on the promise of being a grown-up Elise. Sure enough,when it was launched a year later the mid-engined car instantly became the benchmark for ride and handling, and the darling of the UK motoring press, scooping a handful of Car of the Year gongs. It wasn't, however, faultless. Build quality was patchy, ergonomics disastrous and the combination of 3.5-litre V6 engine and six-speed manual gearbox from Toyota's Camry saloon simply didn't match the Evora's dynamic high points. The car Lotus built to take on Porsche's Cayman and 911 needed more if it was to topple the Germans. The "more" is the car you see here: the new Evora S. That's S for Supercharged (in this case a Harrop HTV 1320 unit), which takes power of the V6 from 276bhp to 345bhp at 7,000rpm, while torque swells from 258lb ft to 295lb ft at 4,000rpm. Couple this to the fact that at 1,437kg to Evora S remains a relative lightweight, and you've got enough to propel you from a standstill to 60mph in 4.6 seconds and a 172mph maximum. For reference, a basic Porsche 911, with an identical 345bhp manages to sprint to 62mph in 4.9 seconds and maxes out at 180mph. The Porsche costs from £64,256, while the Lotus weighs in with a £57,550 asking price (rising to £58,995 if you specify your Evora as a two-plus-two to match the Porsche's layout). Related Articles

Lotus Elise 1.6 review
19 Apr 2010
Two things to note at this point: firstly, that the S carries a £9,000 premium over a standard, naturally aspirated Evora, and secondly, that Lotus's options list is a far more affordable hunting ground than that offered by Porsche. Fully specified – as our test car was – with heated seats, satnav, reversing camera, and optional 19- and 20in wheels with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres it came in at £67,770. Given the performance on offer that seems not at all unreasonable. Ah yes, the performance. On a spectacular test route that ran around a series of hills in southern Spain, the Evora S soaked up what crumbled tarmac we could find among the perfectly surfaced, glass smooth roads in an impeccable manner. This is despite Lotus carrying out a mild fettling of the Evora's suspension (revised damping, new front upper wishbones to increase castor angle and a rear anti-roll bar boosted in size by 0.5mm) to cope with the extra power, plus fitting those larger wheels. Never does the Evora jar over bumps or throw its occupants around uncomfortably. Rather it glides, sending an uninterrupted stream of detailed feedback through the steering wheel, a result says Lotus of bush stiffness being increased in a lateral and not longitudinal direction. The fitment of a supercharger sees the engine finally realise its potential too. Tractable from barely above tickover, and getting seriously into its stride beyond 2,000rpm, the V6 snarls effortlessly to a 7,200rpm redline, delivering a delicious shove in the back as it does so and making passing slower traffic laughably easy. The brakes (cross-drilled and vented as standard) are beyond criticism, with perfect feel and more than enough power for road and track use. The latter we can vouch for following an afternoon spent lapping the Monteblanco circuit near Seville. The freedom of a track also brought with it the chance to try out the Evora's DPM Dynamic Performance Management traction and stability system. "70 per cent Bosch and the last 30 per cent Lotus" according to Lotus principal vehicle dynamics engineer Alan Clark, DPM debuts on the S but will become standard fitment on all Lotus cars from January. With three settings (on, Sport and off) it works brilliantly, reigning in all understeer and oversteer in the "on" setting, allowing a small degree of slip in Sport mode and disengaging completely (rather than "sleeping" until it thinks it's needed as some systems do) when you want to indulge in some tail-out, tyre smoking hooliganism. So far this is all sounding rather rosy for the Lotus, but it is not without fault. Build quality, while much better than earlier Evoras, is still not perfect. Jumping between cars I encountered two with loose gear knobs and one where the carpet was flailing around in the driver's footwell. The gearchange isn't the best in the business either, not enjoying being rushed during the second to third change, and the ergonomics, from a very tight pedal box to a complete inability to see any switches let alone anything out of the tiny rear window, are no better than before (which is to say woeful). You tend to forgive the Evora S these faults the moment you remember how well it goes, stops, rides and steers though. Very few other modern cars offer their drivers such subtle degrees of information and no other sports car immerses you in the simple pleasures of driving quite this thoroughly. Better than a Porsche then? As a car to drive everyday, no: a Cayman S or basic 911 might not reach the Evora S's dynamic brilliance, but they are really not far off at all and boast many other worthy qualities (dials that you can actually read and a wing mirror switch that adult hands can operate to name but two). As a weekend toy, something to bring out every now and then to clear the cobwebs, however, the Evora S is king. If Lotus can instill this kind of magic in its new model army and at the same time iron out the idiosyncrasies then we could be about to witness something very special indeed. THE FACTS
Tested: Lotus Evora S, 3.5-litre V6, supercharged, petrol Price/on sale: from £57,550/now Power/torque: 345bhp at 7,000rpm/295lb ft @ 4,500rpm Top speed: 172mph Acceleration: 0-60mph in 4.6sec Fuel economy: 19.4mpg (Urban) CO2 emissions: 239g/km VED band: L (£750 first year) Verdict: A few small faults rob the Evora S of its fifth star, but this is nevertheless one of the great driver's cars of our time.

Armour-plated bus used by Thatcher sells for £17,000
An armour-plated bus believed to have been used by ''Iron Lady'' Margaret Thatcher has sold for nearly £17,000, an auctioneer said today. The 28-tonne armour-plated "battle bus" is thought to have been built in the 1980s for the former Prime Minister's Northern Ireland tour Photo: J P Humbert Auctioneers/PA	By Telegraph reporters
7:39AM GMT 22 Feb 2013
Follow The 28-tonne ''battle bus'' is thought to have been built in the 1980s for the former prime minister's Northern Ireland tour. The vehicle went under the hammer last night and beat the estimate of £10,000, selling for a final £16,940 to a vehicle collector, said Jonathan Humbert, of Northamptonshire-based JP Humbert Auctioneers. ''There was immense interest in the bus,'' he said. ''It sold to a spontaneous round of applause in the saleroom.'' The bus, which has just 28,000km (17,398 miles) on the clock, has a blast-proof floor and armour-plated glass throughout, as well as a bomb-proof armour-plated body, Mr Humbert said. Related Articles

It was thought to be chemical, biological and nuclear-proof - once having its own auxiliary generator and air supply. It also boasts a Foden chassis, a body by Glover and Webb and is powered by a 12-litre Rolls-Royce engine. Mr Humbert said the bus, which has room for around 35 passengers, had come from a private vendor who bought it from a research and development company which in turn bought it from the government. ''This isn't a good-looking vehicle by any stretch of the imagination - but it is of social and historical interest,'' said Mr Humbert previously. ''It is an irreplaceable one-off, an iron bus for the Iron Lady.'' How about that?

A powerful typhoon lashed Japan with torrential rain, leaving two dead as it damaged homes and flooded parts of the country's popular tourist destination of Kyoto, where 260,000 people were ordered to evacuate to shelters. Typhoon Man-yi, packing wind speeds of 162 kilometers per hour (100 mph), was centered off the northern coast and heading to the northern main island of Hokkaido, dumping more heavy rain. Despite these conditions the Japanese public still managed to go about their daily business with (or without) their umbrellas.Picture: AP Photo/Koji Sasahara

Quirky properties around the world: would you live in a house like this?
This three-storey building in China may be the world's thinnest. The building in Haikou, Hainan Island was built in 2007 and covers an area of just 20 square metres. The narrowest end of the building is 0.4 metres wide, while the widest is 3 metres. The local government reportedly appropriated most of the land the property is built on from its owner, leaving him with just the 20 square metres, so he built the skinny building on his remaining land as a form of protest.

Stoke manager Tony Pulis wants former players to rule on diving after accusing Norwich City's Robert Snodgrass
Tony Pulis has maintained his increasingly outspoken crusade to prevent players diving by calling for referees’ decisions on simulation to be independently assessed. Animated: Tony Pulis gets hot and bothered on the touchline Photo: PA	By Arindam Rej at Carrow Road

The Stoke City manager was left nursing another perceived grievance on Saturday after Norwich’s Robert Snodgrass collapsed to the turf following a challenge by Andy Wilkinson. Snodgrass duly delivered the free kick that Bradley Johnson headed in for Norwich’s winner. After Pulis had paid a visit to the referee’s room after the match, match official Andre Marriner agreed that he would look at the decision again, although that was scant consolation for Pulis, who has called for former players, rather than referees, to sit on panels and retrospectively judge whether or not a player has dived. “It should be football people – ex-players who know the game,” he said. “You could have a panel of three and rotate every week. There are a lot of people out of work who can be called onto that panel. You would need someone from the Premier League to adjudicate on it. Let them decide on punishments.” Pulis’s criticisms were endorsed by his goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who accused Marriner of indecisiveness and costing them the game. “I think the hesitation in the decision was most disappointing,” said the Bosnia goalkeeper. “He wasn’t going to give it at first, then he changed his mind. We still had to make sure we defended the free kick, but it cost us.” The Stoke camp could easily be accused of hypocrisy for their outbursts because many of their players were tumbling following minimal contact, whereas the Snodgrass incident was an isolated case of a Norwich player being accused.

Charlie Adam was the worst offender and was booked when he threw himself down after brushing against Johnson. Adam was later lucky not to receive a second yellow when he fell after coming in proximity to Steven Whittaker. Norwich City, however, deserved to win and Johnson said: “If we carry on like this, I’m sure we will finish in a similar position to last season or even higher.” Stoke City

The Open 2012: Adam Scott not the first player to choke at a major
Adam Scott wasted a four-shot lead with four holes to play to hand the 141st Open Championship to Ernie Els at Royal Lytham. Here, we look at other famous collapses in major championships over the years.

Jean van de Velde - 1999 Open, Carnoustie
Van de Velde stood on the 18th tee with a three-shot lead but after missing the fairway with his drive, he saw his shot bounce off a grandstand and into heavy rough. From there he chipped into the Barry Burn and considered playing the ball out of the water, removing his shoes and wading in before thinking better of it. After a penalty drop he played his fifth shot into a greenside bunker and bravely got up and down for a seven. That forced a play-off with Paul Lawrie and Justin Leonard, which Lawrie won. Greg Norman - 1996 US Masters, Augusta Norman shot a course-record 63 in the first round and went into the last 18 holes with a six-shot lead over playing partner Nick Faldo. However, it was all downhill from there for the Australian, who carded five bogeys and two double-bogeys on his way to a six-over 78. In contrast, Faldo carded a superb 67 to claim his third Green Jacket after turning his six-shot deficit into a five-shot winning margin. Rory McIlroy - 2011 US Masters, Augusta
McIlroy began with a first round of 65 and went into the final 18 holes with a four-shot lead, but the 21-year-old from Northern Ireland collapsed to a closing round of 80 to finish 10 shots behind eventual champion Charl Schwartzel. Despite early dropped shots McIlroy was still one in front on the 10th tee, but then saw his pulled drive ricochet way left off a tree. That led to a triple-bogey seven and a double-bogey soon followed on the 12th where he four-putted from 20 feet. Arnold Palmer - 1966 US Open, Olympic Club Palmer began the final round three ahead of Billy Casper and had stretched that to a commanding seven shots with just nine holes remaining. However, Palmer ran up double-bogeys at the 15th and 16th. When he also bogeyed the 17th he and Casper were tied and a seven-shot lead had gone in eight holes. The resulting 18-hole play-off saw Palmer take a two-shot lead with eight holes remaining, but he dropped six shots down the closing stretch and Casper's 69 was good enough to win by four. Ed Sneed - 1979 US Masters, Augusta Ed Sneed looked set to lose his "journeyman" tag when he took a five-shot lead into the final round and remained three clear with three to play, but he then left par putts agonisingly short on the 16th and 17th before another bogey on the last. That meant a final round of 76 and left him tied with Tom Watson and Fuzzy Zoeller. The resulting play-off saw Sneed find sand at the 11th and Watson's birdie putt slid by before Zoeller holed from six feet for the winning birdie. The Open

Blood vessel looks like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
A close-up image of a blood vessel in the brain has amazed scientists with its likeness to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
Photo: Newcastle University	10:22AM GMT 22 Dec 2010
Researchers at Newcastle University were studying the inner workings of neurons in the hippocampal region of the brain and when they looked at the image they were stunned by the find.
The picture looks like a reindeer with antlers flying through the starry sky. Even its eye and tail are visible.
The blob for a nose happened by chance when the experts were labelling the image. They then overexposed the image to make it show up red.
Claudia Racca, of the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University, who performed the experiment with colleague David Cox, said: ''Biology can throw up things like this, but it was a nice surprise to find this image.
''We were looking at a section of the tissue and noticed this strange but familiar shape.
''It was intriguing and we noticed the similarity to a reindeer.
''We then took an overexposed picture of it and the red blob for the nose and the white antlers showed up even better.
''We got distracted from the science at that point and had a bit of fun with the pictures of Rudolph instead.
''It may not be very valuable scientifically but it looks nice on the eye.''
