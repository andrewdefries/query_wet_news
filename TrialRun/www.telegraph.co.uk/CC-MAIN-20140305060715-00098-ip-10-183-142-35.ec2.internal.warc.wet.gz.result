Afghanistan's Mujahideen 'building new military unit' Afghanistan's Mujahideen commanders are building a new military unit to protect the country where Nato forces have failed, according to one of the country's most prominent warlords.

Follow Ismail Khan reportedly complained that the commanders who defeated the Russians and later fought the Taliban had been sidelined.
He said that the Nato coalition had sent "girls" to fight and said Hamid Karzai was aware of the plans to build the Mujahideen unit, reported Tolo News, the country's biggest private news network.
His comments came as many Afghans fear that the country may fracture and return to civil war after Nato combat forces pull out at the end of 2014.
The Mujahideen who fought the Soviet-backed government in the 1980s turned on each other during the 1990s and many of the commanders are now remembered more for barbarity than heroism.
Mr Khan, minister for energy and water, was a senior resistance commander against the Russians and then ran the western city of Herat as his own fiefdom until the Taliban swept him from power.

Mr Khan told Tolo that the Mujahideen were again needed to protect Afghanistan from "foreign conspiracies".
"The foreigners sidelined those who had fought for ages," he reportedly said at a gathering for former resistance commanders in Herat.
"They collected all our weapons, our artillery and tanks, and put them on the rubbish heap.
"Instead, they brought Dutch girls, French girls, girls from Holland, they armed American girls, they brought white-skinned Western soldiers, and black-skinned American soldiers, and they thought by doing all this they would bring security here but they failed," he added.
Mr Khan said the Afghan president was fully aware of the plans.
He said: "We have had detailed discussions with President Hamid Karzai. We are planning on this strategy and the registration of people is under way." The international community spent billions first trying to disarm the Mujahideen after 2001 and then building an Afghan army and police force.
Mr Khan's comments are not the first time former Mujahideen commanders have hinted they are rearming and reorganising.
Leaders from the remnants of the Northern Alliance, which fought the Taliban during the 1990s, have warned they were preparing to fight again if a peace deal with the insurgents was imposed on them.

Turkey furious as US seizes its troops in Iraq
By David Wastell, Diplomatic Correspondent
12:01AM BST 06 Jul 2003
In an angry spat between two already tetchy Nato allies, Turkey's prime minister Tayyip Erdogan has protested at "a totally ugly incident" in which American troops seized 11 Turkish special forces soldiers in northern Iraq. The Turks were detained late on Friday, apparently on suspicion of plotting to kill a senior Iraqi Kurdish official in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Last night, a Turkish official said "forceful representations" made to Washington had resulted in the release of "some of the soldiers". Others remained in United States hands. The row threatens to undermine efforts to repair relations between the two Nato allies, badly strained since Turkey refused to allow US troops to invade Iraq from its soil during the war. Mr Erdogan said: "We demanded their immediate release. It's a totally ugly incident - something that shouldn't have happened."

12 Apr 2003
The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said the soldiers were detained after 100 American troops raided their base in Sulaimaniya, northern Iraq, and transferred them to Kirkuk. The newspaper said the soldiers were accused of planning an attack on the Kurdish governor in Kirkuk - a charge dismissed by Abdullah Gul, Turkey's foreign minister, as "nonsense". Yesterday, protesters outside the US embassy in Ankara accused Washington of taking hostages and shouted: "Murderer USA! Get out of the Middle East!" Robert Deutch, the deputy chief of the embassy, said he was "trying to get this resolved as soon as we can". A spokesman for US Central Command refused to give details or say why the troops had been detained. US-backed Kurdish leaders in Iraq have urged Turkey to withdraw all its troops sent to hunt Kurdish guerrillas, who previously waged a violent separatist campaign in south-eastern Turkey. Ankara fears that Kurds still want to create an independent state. USA

Technology Trends Who will win the online wallet war?
The electronic money revolution is coming. Bitcoin is the major player, but its rivals want your digital cash too, says tech trend expert Dan Smith. Paying fair: digital currency such as Bitcoin and Litecoin may signal the end of using credit cards to pay online Photo: (c) Cavan Images	By Dan SmithWired technology writer
5:44PM BST 16 Aug 2013
Read more on the latest tech trends >>
Once you’ve ordered a pint at the Pembury Tavern you have to make a further choice: which currency to pay with? For this pub in Hackney, east London – and its three sister establishments around the UK – accept Bitcoin. The digital currency is finally breaking into the mainstream. No longer is Bitcoin the preference of geeks and libertarians. After four years in circulation, it is now accepted in several bars, cafés and shops. You can use it to buy merchandise on social news site Reddit and pay WordPress to host your website or blog with it. So how does it work? Simply, digital currencies behave like cash. Payments are anonymous and you won’t pay transaction fees, because funds are transferred over a peer-to-peer hosted network. Your “money” can’t be lost, stolen or frozen. And there’s little risk of identity theft. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is independent of any government or bank and transferred over the internet. Users have an online wallet (in the form of an app on their phone or computer) that holds their funds. When they pay in Bitcoins, these funds enter the recipient’s wallet about 10 minutes later. The payment process is simple. In the Pembury Tavern, for example, staff bring up a QR code on the till, which the payee can take a picture of through the Bitcoin app and use to confirm a payment. It sounds too good to be true. But despite boasting a growing fanbase – including internet entrepreneurs the Winklevoss twins, who claim to own 1 per cent of all Bitcoin – it is uncertain whether this early popularity will translate into global dominance. First, along with other alternative currencies, it is not legal tender. But the features that have made Bitcoin successful could also hinder it. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown hacker, or group of anonymous hackers, with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto published an online paper about the currency, launched it, then disappeared. So there is no central body responsible for its management. Today, Bitcoin is operated collectively by the people who exchange it, run the software and produce it. Many see this approach as positive. Yet such unaccountability may make governments and regulators nervous about giving it the status of legal tender. Indeed, success turned sour in April 2013, when the value of a Bitcoin peaked at $266 (£170) before plunging to $105 (£68) the following day. Such activity is bad news if you’re a vendor who accepts the currency and must keep changing prices. Dips can also trigger panic selling. Bitcoin is currently buoyant at $106 (£70), but these fluctuations can strike at any time – and they don’t just stem from market forces. In 2011, Mt Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange (where you can buy or sell the currency), was hacked. This put the website offline, cutting Bitcoin’s value to $0.01 before the system recovered. Another reason value has swung so sharply is that Bitcoin is not determined by any tangible commodity. It is the commodity, drawing its value from demand. Its minting (or “mining”) process comes into play, too. Bitcoin is created on a network of servers, where powerful computers crunch complex mathematical problems. New coins are sent into the market (a bit like the Bank of England adding money to the economy). When someone pays another user, the transaction is recorded and secured by these Bitcoin miners. They track the history of the currency, creating a record. But, despite this, it has no material value, leaving it vulnerable to abandonment if enthusiasm drops off. So Bitcoin isn’t perfect. But there are hundreds of alternatives out there. Ripple is one. Like Bitcoin, it exists only in the digital space and is traded between those with Ripple wallets. But it isn’t produced through mining. Instead, its creator (Silicon Valley company OpenCoin) has made 100 billion Ripples to distribute slowly into the market. So while more Bitcoins will continue to enter the system as they’re mined, Ripple is already at its limit. OpenCoin claims that this approach will create a level playing field, whereas Bitcoin mining requires significant computer processing and is in the hands of the few. Ripple transactions are kept on a digital global ledger. The idea is that, by keeping it centralised, the currency can be better managed and more stable. The value of a Ripple has fluctuated little between £60 and £70 over the past month. But there have been harsh criticisms. It has been alleged that OpenCoin maintains the majority of Ripples itself, so if the currency succeeds, its founders stand to become wealthy. And its software is not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, it can’t be improved by anyone outside. Another option is Litecoin. Its transactions are four times faster (little more than two minutes as opposed to 10), it has four times more “coins” in circulation and can be created using desktop computers. Theoretically, this makes Litecoin better for small, fast payments, where Bitcoin is best for large ones. But as it has become more popular, Bitcoin is being traded faster and in smaller chunks. This has caused problems. On March 1, 2013, the record of every Bitcoin transaction was effectively duplicated. Under the stress of too many bitty transactions, a bug split the system in half. This meant two different versions of the Bitcoin “record” were in operation. Litecoin supporters say it would not happen with their more flexible option. These examples represent just a fraction of the digital currencies out there. In 2011, Ven was the first to be listed on Thomson Reuters. It is used in a social network, allowing Hub Culture users to buy, share and trade. This may seem like Facebook credits or Amazon Coins. But Ven’s value is determined by commodities such as precious metals, other currencies and carbon credits – in theory, making it relatively stable and green. PPCoin, meanwhile, offers superior security, while Freicoin features digital depreciation, encouraging spending, not stockpiling. Whether any of these can topple Bitcoin, or make a serious bid for the mass market, remains to be seen. Digital currencies face serious obstacles: security and user-growth aside, there are vast technical and logistical challenges. But the biggest hurdle may be governments and regulators who could attempt to control or profit from digital currencies. The revolution is coming. Who knows how we’ll pay?

Arsène Wenger happy to see Arsenal win ugly after win over Southampton takes Gunners four points clear
Arsenal manager claims victory proves that his team have developed another asset in pursuit of the Premier League title.

Arsène Wenger had little doubt what victory against a resolute, determined Southampton side meant. “This win shows we are ready for a fight when it doesn’t go as fluently as we wanted,” the Arsenal manager said. “On that front I’m very happy today.” After the defeat against Manchester United this 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium was just what Wenger needed to demonstrate his side’s title credentials. It was, in short, the very definition of the old saw about champions triumphing in scrappy victory. Never mind the quality, feel the win.
It was not that Wenger’s Arsenal side lacked enterprise. In the first 20 minutes, both Jack Wilshire and Aaron Ramsey hit the post with efforts that, if converted, would have been shoo-ins for the goal-of-the-month shortlist. Related Articles

Ramsey’s back-heel flick was evidence of someone playing at the very peak of confidence and form. And as it bounced back off the foot of the post, the crowd was left won­dering if this was to be the sort of frustrating encounter in which even the intervention of something extraordinary was not going to alter the direction.
But then, after the sublime came the ridiculous. As the game looked to be locked in tactical stasis, Artur Boruc, seemingly celebrating the announcement last week of Monty Python’s reunion, handed the home side a gift plucked from the shelves of the Ministry of Silly Goals. With about half an hour in which to clear the ball from a back-pass from Nathaniel Clyne, Boruc attempted what appeared to be an impression of the old Mitchell Johnson: he went to the left, he went to the right and ended up falling over his own feet, allowing Olivier Giroud to step in and score. Even Cristiano Ronaldo might have reckoned that many Cruyff turns a little self-indulgent in the circumstances.
“I do ask my players to play in a certain way and that requires Artur Boruc to play with his feet so he was just doing what he knows how to do,” Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino said in defence of his keeper. “It just so happens that today it did not happen as well as we wanted it to happen.” However it happened, the Emirates Stadium crowd loved it and spent the rest of the match soundtracking the Pole’s every contribution with a delighted sarcastic woo. Only the return of Theo Walcott, coming off the bench for the last fifteen minutes, drew a bigger cheer than that which erupted every time the ball landed at Boruc’s feet. In truth, the home support recognised his was the kind of calamity Arsenal needed to unpick opponents Wenger reckoned to be the most testing of the season so far. . “To stop us from playing, it was the best we have seen,” he said of Pochettino’s pressing policy.
This was, tactically, an astute performance from Southampton. Victor Wanyama in particular worked tirelessly to stifle any space in which Mesut Özil and Santi Cazorla had to work. As a result, the pair had their most disappointing afternoon of the season. Ahead of the Kenyan, the England trio of Ricky Lambert, Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez were an amalgam of inspiration and perspiration. Soon after his own keeper had dropped his Boruc, Rodriguez deftly juggled his way into the Arsenal penalty area, set himself up and volleyed beautifully. It was heading into the bottom corner of the goal before, with an athletic dive, Wojciech Szczesny gave his countryman up the other end a timely demonstration of a goalie’s principal role: keeping the ball out of the net.
Wenger, though, was right. As good as Southampton were, Arsenal had that little bit more. If Pochettino had frustrated their Plan A, Olivier Giroud was around to implement the Gunners’ Plan B: hustle the team to victory. The home centre forward was superb here. He not only benefited from Boruc’s generosity, he scored a late penalty after Jose Fonté had tried to remove Per Mertesacker’s shirt as the pair jostled for a corner. In between he was strong, determined, leading his line with selfless muscularity. It was the kind of display that Wenger defined as that of the classic, English centre forward. And one he reckoned is now a threatened part of our game.
“If you look back to the 1960s and 70s and look at the strikers who were good in the air and English in every single club and tell me now today have you the same number? I’m not even talking about quality, have you the same number who go in for crosses, go in the air? “We teach more play on the ground, we have better training pitches, today we educate more on the ground. Maybe we pay a bit of a price with fewer people who are ready to go for this kind of ball.”
Arsène Wenger bemoaning the fact that English football is getting a little too technical: it was not only Artur Boruc who was subverting expectations at the Emirates Stadium.
