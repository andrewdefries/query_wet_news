Golden Globes 2013: Downton Abbey stars 'thrilled' with nominations
The cast of Downton Abbey say getting three Golden Globe nominations is the "cherry on top" of a successful year both at home and abroad. 11:24AM GMT 14 Dec 2012
Comments
The popular ITV costume drama, which has become a huge hit with American audiences, has been nominated in the best television drama series category along with US shows including Boardwalk Empire, Breaking Bad and Homeland. Two of the programme's stars, Michelle Dockery and Dame Maggie Smith, are nominated for best actress in a television drama series and best supporting actress in a miniseries or motion picture made for TV, respectively. Speaking at a reception in Washington DC, Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Earl of Grantham, said: "It's wonderful because when we're filming in Highclere Castle, which is where we film a lot of the show outside London on a freezing February day in the mud, it's nice to know that sometimes it's worth it!"
The 70th annual Golden Globe Awards ceremony will take place on January 13, 2013. Source: AP

Standard Chartered to pay $340m settlement over Iran investigation
Standard Chartered agreed to pay a $340m (£217m) fine on Tuesday in a humbling settlement with a United States regulator over Iranian money-laundering charges. Shares in Standard Chartered closed up 1.5pc today in London at £13.54. Photo: Bloomberg News	Louise Armitstead and Helia Ebrahimi
10:28PM BST 14 Aug 2012
The British bank was forced to capitulate, also agreeing to a money-laundering monitor, after a week’s stand-off with the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), just hours before it faced a public hearing. Standard Chartered
In the settlement, the bank admitted the value of transactions at fault amounted to “at least $250bn”, not $14m as it had said. Last week the New York financial regulator claimed that the “flagrantly deceptive actions” by the British bank had left the US “vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes”. The charges wiped more than 20pc off the bank’s share price in 24 hours. The agreement is only with the DFS in New York and is not the co-ordinated settlement with all US regulators the bank had hoped for. “We will continue to work with our federal and state partners on this matter,” the DFS said.

Standard Chartered has agreed to an extraordinary level of supervision by the DFS to salvage its Wall Street bank licence and avert a public showdown over its Iranian operations. “The bank shall install a monitor for a term of at least two years who will report directly to the DFS and who will evaluate the money-laundering risk controls in the New York branch and implementation of appropriate corrective measures,” said the DFS in a statement. “In addition, DFS examiners shall be placed on site at the bank.”
The statement added that Standard Chartered “shall permanently install personnel within its New York branch to oversee and audit any offshore money-laundering due diligence and monitoring undertaken by the bank”. Standard Chartered said the deal was a “pragmatic decision in the best interests of shareholders and customers.” It said it would continue to “engage constructively” with all US authorities. Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, hailed the deal as a victory for the newly-established DFS. “This state and nation are still paying the price for a failed regulatory system and that must not happen again.”
Tonight, one of Standard Chartered’s leading investors said: “This fine is $335m more than is justified. But it is a good result as far as market expectations are concerned.”
The fine was less than the $1bn analysts had warned could be imposed. Otherwise the settlement represented a climbdown for the bank, which could still face fines from other US regulators. Last week, the bank said it “strongly rejects” the DFS’s order, which alleged it had “schemed” for 10 years to bypass US sanctions on Iran. It admitted that some of the transactions it completed on behalf of Iranian clients did not comply with US sanctions. But insisted 99.9pc followed the rules, including the so-called “U-turn” laws that exempted some transactions from sanctions. It said the DFS’s interpretation of the “U-turn” rules was “incorrect as a matter of law.” During days of negotiations, Standard Chartered and the regulator were a “gulf apart on the charges”. Peter Sands, chief executive, flew to New York to take charge of the talks. Insiders said the bank’s position had shifted to “damage limitation” – ensuring that a public debate of the charges was avoided. Standard Chartered shares recovered a further 36.5p to £13.70 on Tuesday on the hopes of a settlement, but they are still below the £15.67 they traded at before the DFS published the order. On Wednesday, the shares opened up 4pc at £14.21 in London after rising 6.6pc in Hong Kong. Banks and Finance

TNK-BP official arrested over fraud allegations
A TNK-BP official has been arrested on fraud charges, in an unwelcome distraction for the venture's shareholders as they prepare to sell it to state-controlled Rosneft. TNK-BP said Korneev's detention "is not related to his work in TNK-BP". By Emily Gosden

Both BP and its oligarch partners AAR appear on the verge of selling out of their lucrative Russian joint venture, with BP's board set to vote on Friday afternoon on an offer of more than $25bn (£15.5bn) it received from Rosneft. The Russian interior ministry said that the arrested official headed the government relations department at TNK-BP Holding, the main subsidiary company of TNK-BP itself. He was arrested on suspicion of seeking $6m in bribes to secure government posts, Bloomberg reported. He had been caught taking an advance payment to secure posts in the presidential administration and the office of the presidential envoy to Russia’s Central Administrative District for two businessmen. He had worked in the Irkutsk regional government until June and offered to sell the state jobs in September, according to the statement. While the interior ministry did not name the official, in a statement on Friday morning, TNK-BP said it was "aware of the detention of Igor Korneev by the law enforcement authorities" and that he had only worked for the venture for about three months.

Mr Korneev's detention "is not related to his work in TNK-BP", it said. The official had spent his three months at the company "taking over the business and getting acquainted with the industry which was new to him". It added: "He was not directly involved in TNK-BP activities. He was supposed to take up the analysis and expert evaluation in the area of subsoil use regulatory support as soon as all the necessary procedures are completed and knowledge obtained." Mr Korneev had previously been Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Irkutsk Region, Minister of Economics, having worked in managerial positions in federal and regional government authorities, TNK-BP said.

EasyJet boost as Britons save holidays for after Olympics
Low-cost airline easyJet has revised its profit estimates for the year upward by more than £20m after enjoying a summer boost from the Olympic Games. EasyJet has sold a third of its seats for the year to September 30 2013 Photo: ALAMY	By Matthew Sparkes

But the uptick in passenger numbers did not come from athletes and spectators flying into London, but from Britons taking holidays after the Games had finished, said the company in a trading update this morning. Expected disruption at airports from the Games was also kept to a minimum and the airline said that second half cost increases per seat are likely to be in line with previous estimates of 1.5pc to 2pc. As a result the Board revised its pre-tax profit estimate for the year to September 30 to between £310m and £320m, compared with the previous expectation of £280m to £300m. Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive, said: "easyJet has had a strong summer performance, which has enabled us to deliver another good year of returns and growth for our shareholders. "Strong post Olympics trading and a benign operating environment along with the continued strict allocation of capital and aircraft across our leading network, improvements in revenue management and marketing, and a tight control of costs has meant that easyJet will deliver higher returns and its highest ever pre-tax profit for the financial year ending 30 September 2012, despite absorbing an additional £230m in fuel costs this year."

Pope pleads for 'grim trail of destruction' to end in Syria The Pope made an impassioned appeal on Sunday for an end to the "grim trail of death and destruction" plaguing Syria and the Middle East. By Ruth Sherlock, Beirut
6:17PM BST 16 Sep 2012
His words washed over the congregation of hundreds of thousands that attended an open-air Mass in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, on the last day of his three-day visit. He appealed to the international community, especially Arab Countries, to help find a peaceful outcome to the Syrian civil war.
"Why so much horror? Why so many dead," said Pope Benedict XVI. "Sadly the din of weapons continues to make itself heard, along with the cry of the widow and the orphan."
International efforts to stem the violence in Syria appeared to stall again on Sunday as rebel commanders said the peace mission was "bound to fail" after reportedly speaking with international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
"We are sure Brahimi will fail like the other envoys before him, but we (the rebels) do not want to be the reason of his failure," said Colonel Abdel Jabbar al-Okaidi after speaking with Mr Brahimi.
On the same day of the Holy Mass in Lebanon, Syrian state television said that rebels had detonated a bomb under the highway near the southern town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, killing eight people and wounding 25.

11 Sep 2012
Among the estimated 350,000 strong crowd of worshippers were Syrians whose lives had been devastated by war in the past year. They said that as international efforts failed they took comfort in the prayers of the Holy Father. "I escaped from Syria because we became targets in the war," said Father Manaf Obeid, a priest who fled from a village near Homs. "Pope Benedict gives us hope that we don't need to flee the region. He reminds us that Christians are a part of the Middle East".
Pope Benedict spoke from an altar on a white podium in the form of a giant Cedar tree, Lebanon's symbol. Bishops from more than a dozen churches that make up the country's Christian population fanned to his right and left. The Arab Spring revolutions of the past year and half has left Christians, a minority in the Middle East, fearing that a crusade will be waged against them by rising Islamic fundamentalists. Pilgrims from across the Middle East attended the ceremony to take comfort in his words.
"We love the Pope and we came to pray for him and we hope that he will pray for us," said Valley Georges, 27 from Iraq.
"I came here to feel peace, because we are passing a threatening situation," said Jaqueline, 46, a Coptic Catholic from Egypt. The Pope

Libya conflict: TV presenter waves gun and threatens to become martyr
A presenter on state-run al-Libiyah brandished a gun and declared that the channel's staff are ready to become martyrs in defending the station from a rebel attack. 12:02PM BST 21 Aug 2011
The footage was posted on a social media website and the video cannot be independently verified. Waving a gun at the camera, the presenter said: "With this weapon, I either kill or die today, you will not take al-Libiyah channel. You won't take Jamahiriyah channel, Shababiyah channel, Tripoli and all of Libya. "We are all armed here and even those without a weapon are willing to be a shield in order to protect their colleagues at this channel. We are willing to become martyrs."

Victim's father offers 'love and compassion' to family of gunman
The father of Emilie Parker, a six-year-old girl killed in the Connecticut school massacre, has demonstrated a remarkable display of compassion for the family of the gunman who shot her dead.
By Philip Sherwell, in New York
11:48PM GMT 15 Dec 2012
Robbie Parker, 30, said that he believed Adam Lanza, whom he did not name, was acting with "free agency" granted by God and that he could not be "mad" about his actions.
He paid a glowing tribute to his "beautiful", "loving" and "incredible" daughter in an emotional address outside the family home during which he often struggled to speak.
"As the deep pain begins to settle into our hearts, we find comfort reflecting on the incredible person that Emily was and how many lives she was able to touch in her short time on earth," he said.
But he also offered his "love and support" to the family of Lanza, the 20-year-old loner who shot dead 20 young children and six adults in Friday's massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school.
"I would really like to offer our deepest condolences to all the families that were affected by this shooting," he said on Saturday night.

"It's a horrific tragedy and we want everybody to know that our hearts and our prayers go out to them. This includes the family of the shooter. I can't imagine how hard it this experience must be for you and I want you to know that our love and our support goes out to you as well."
He continued: "The person that chose to act in this way was acting with a God-given right with his own free agency. That free agency is given to all of us to act and choose to do whatever we want and God can't take that away from us. "I know that's something that he was given and that's what he chose to do with it. I'm not mad because I have my agency to make sure that I use this event to do whatever I can."
Emilie was the oldest of three daughters of Mr Parker and his wife Alissa. They only moved to Newtown eight months ago from Utah when he got a new job as a physician's assistant in the newborn emergency care unit at Danbury hospital, where he was working when some victims of the shootings were brought into a different department.
"Emilie was bright creative and very loving," he said. "She was beautiful. She was blond. She was always smiling.
"She was the type of person who just lit up the room. She always had a kind word to say about anybody.
"She's an incredible person and I am blessed to be he dad."
He described how little Emilie was a serial maker of cards and "always carried around her markers and pencils" to make notes for anyone who was looking sad. Asked how the couple would deal with their loss, he said: "I don't know how to get through it. The best thing I can do is to help other people."
"My hope in life is the number one thing that people say is that I was a great dad."
Meanwhile, the family of Nancy Lanza, the first victim of her son Adam's shooting spree, expressed their "heartfelt sorrow" for the "incomprehensible loss" in a statement issued on Saturday on the behalf of her brother James Champion, a New Hampshire policeman.

West Ham's Olympic Stadium move can create a super club in east London
The selection of West Ham as preferred bidders for the Olympic Stadium should trigger bubbles on Green Street and relief in City Hall and Westminster.
Crowd puller: filling the gaps will not take long, with the appeal of the Premier League and the attraction of the Olympic Stadium for away supporters

But there is another constituency who should view the decision not with delight, but deep trepidation. For West Ham’s competitors at either end of the Premier League, the move to what will be the second-largest stadium in the league is bad news. By securing a 60,000-seat stadium West Ham will, at a stroke, move to a new competitive level. The financial benefits of a new ground in the iconic surrounds of the Olympic Park, close to the corporate fortunes of Canary Wharf with excellent transport links, should be vast. Exploited well, the stadium should guarantee West Ham an annual contest for European football. Instead of yo-yoing between the top two divisions they will be ready to outstrip Aston Villa, Newcastle and Everton, position themselves to take on Tottenham and Liverpool on equal terms, and dream of taking on Arsenal. Were the Davids, Gold and Sullivan, willing to sell, things could get even better. As Manchester City found to their benefit, a publicly-funded stadium with manageable rent makes a club hugely attractive to foreign investors. The next time an oligarch or sheikh casts their eye England’s football portfolio in search of a trophy investment West Ham, with a long-lease to a new stadium and a heritage ripe for exploitation, will look very attractive. This is why government is keen to ensure the public share in any profits from a quick sale. Related Articles

West Ham will say with justification that this is not just a good deal for them. Their commitment to the stadium, despite the shambolic process, offers it a viable future, and will give the park the heartbeat it needs. Without the club the stadium might require subsidy and have a less certain future, but that does not mean it is anything other than a great deal for West Ham. No wonder Daniel Levy, looking on from White Hart Lane, is nervous. There are many reasons he challenged the decision to select West Ham over Tottenham in the original bid, not least genuine concerns over the fairness of the process. But he is no fool. His stadium is already dwarfed by the Emirates, and now he faces a new rival with an equally imposing stadium just a few miles east. Money, as Ellis Short and Randy Lerner will testify, does not guarantee you success, but it makes life easier. And for West Ham the stadium should guarantee an increase in income well beyond their grasp at Upton Park. Even confined to a 35,000-seat capacity stadium, the club are among the 20010-11 league’s higher earners. In their last full season in the Premier League, finishing last, West Ham’s turnover was £81 million. It was the ninth highest in the league and just £7 million short of what City earned in the year before the Abu Dhabi takeover. More than half of that income, £46 million, came from broadcast revenue, with Upton Park contributing just £18 million and commercial revenue £11 million. West Ham will expect to transform those last two figures once they move. There may be a challenge initially in filling 60,000 seats, but with an average home gate of 34,449 this season they have a base comparable with Tottenham. Tickets may have to be priced competitively, but the latent appeal of the Premier League will draw in plenty of neutrals to fill the gaps.
Visiting the Olympic Stadium and park will make it a significant attraction for away supporters. The corporate opportunity is also huge, with the stadium likely to have 5,000 hospitality seats. With the financial hub of Canary Wharf a few stops away on the Jubilee Line, there is a huge market for West Ham to call on. West Ham may not challenge the £95 million of match-day revenue generated each year by the Emirates, but they will surely get close to the £43 million Spurs yield from White Hart Lane. All of this may make West Ham feel like a different club in five years. The unique atmosphere of the Boleyn Ground, East End home of England’s World Cup winners, may not survive the move. But West Ham are not just moving to Stratford, they are heading towards the top six, and that might be compensation enough. West Ham

Sebastian Vettel enjoyed the perfect scenario in second practice for the Japanese Grand Prix that if repeated in Sunday's race will see him crowned Formula One world champion for a fourth consecutive time. At a Suzuka circuit where Vettel has been on pole at the last four races, winning three of them, the 26-year-old finished top of the timesheet in his Red Bull. After Lewis Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two in the opening 90-minute session, so Vettel followed suit in the second run as he finished 0.168secs faster than team-mate Mark Webber. With the teams switching to the faster medium-compound Pirelli tyres for a spell in FP2, after exclusively running on the slower, harder rubber in FP1, Vettel posted a time of one minute 33.852secs. With a 77-point lead over his nearest rival in Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, Vettel can make it four championships in a row with a fifth straight win and if the Spaniard is ninth or lower.

In practice, Alonso could only finish 10th quickest, 1,235secs down on Vettel's pace as the German was the only driver to dip below the one minute 34secs mark. Behind Webber was Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, a quarter of a second back, with Kimi Raikkonen fourth in his Lotus, albeit with his session cut short by 35 minutes as he spun into a gravel trap. The Finn was followed by team-mate Romain Grosjean, with Hamilton only sixth and with a time three tenths of a second slower than his best in first practice. Daniel Ricciardo appears solid in his Toro Rosso, the Australian seventh fastest ahead of Felipe Massa in his Ferrari, McLaren's Jenson Button and then Alonso who suffered a high-speed spin on the approach to the second Degner turn, although he managed to recover. Force India's Paul Di Resta, one of many who suffered a minor spin, was 14th, just 0.066secs ahead of team-mate Adrian Sutil. For a driver whose F1 future is in doubt, McLaren's Sergio Perez did himself no favours with a sizeable shunt on entry to one of Suzuka's renowned turns, the Spoon Curve. Clipping the astroturf to his right on the outside apex of the long left-hander, and in hitting the brakes, Perez skewed sideways before slamming the right-hand side of his car into a barrier. That incident came moments after Williams' Pastor Maldonado suffered his second shunt of the day, on this occasion losing his car on entry to the second Degner where he buried the nose in a tyre wall. That made Maldonado the third driver to crash at the same corner as Marussia's Jules Bianchi and Giedo van der Garde did so in FP1. For Bianchi, his car was damaged to such an extent, the team were unable to carry out the necessary repairs in time for FP2, instead concentrating on building up the spare chassis in time for final practice tomorrow. As for Maldonado in first practice, the left-rear wheel of his car became inexplicably detached. Approaching Spoon, Maldonado ran wide, but as he attempted to make his way back on track, the Venezuelan was forced into a spin as the wheel worked loose, it then bouncing into a gravel trap where it was recovered by marshals.

Mako Vunipola - might not bring the same scrummaging skills and strength as Corbisiero, but more than makes up for that in loose. 8/10

Australia
James Slipper - very mobile for a prop, but at times, believes he is an openside flanker. England should try to target that. 6/10 Picture: GETTY IMAGES
