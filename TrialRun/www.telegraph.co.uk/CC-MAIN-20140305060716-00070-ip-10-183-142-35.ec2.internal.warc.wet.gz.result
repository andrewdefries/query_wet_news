Home Retail shares surged this morning after investors were buoyed by brighter prospects at its troubled Argos business.
The FTSE 250-listed household goods group jumped almost 15pc in early trade on news of better-than-expected third quarter sales at Argos. Home Retail, which also owns Homebase, is seeking to transform the business from one focused on catalogues to an online retailer, and revealed its strategy for Argos in October.
Sales at the division over the third quarter were bolstered by demand for consumer electronics goods, with tablet devices in particular proving popular, the company said this morning.
Still, analysts at Oriel Securities sounded a note of caution:
"With a recovery in trading largely priced in, we stick with our 'hold' recommendation for now, and remain concerned that trading at Homebase will remain weak which could act as a laggard on future upgrades," they said.

09 Jan 2013
The wider market experienced rather less dramatic moves, with the FTSE 100 up just 3 points in early deals, and the mid-cap FTSE 250 8 points higher. The blue-chips fell below the key 6,100 level during trading yesterday before recovering some ground and closing at 6,103.98.
"Clients that had been short took some profit yesterday on the dip to around the 6080 but the overall position remains short as they continue to expect a larger move to the downside," said Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads.
On the benchmark index, miner Rio Tinto shares lost 2.7pc on the news chief executive Tom Albanese will step down in the wake of a $14bn charge relating to two of his most high-profile acquisitions.
At the other end of the table, Primark-owner Associated British Foods topped the FTSE 100 with a gain of 5pc.The group said a 25pc jump in sales at the fashion business helped lift overall group revenue by 10pc in the 16 weeks to January 5.
"The rest of the group has performed in-line with expectations, but the focus for investors in our view should be how to value Primark within the ABF group," said analysts at Panmure Gordon, who reckoned the clothing retailer had a £7.78bn valuation.

Adam Ball seals Kent triumph with final-delivery run-out
Edgbaston: Kent (239-8) beat Warwickshire (238) by one run Cool head: Adam Ball gave away only thre runs from his last over Photo: Getty Images	By Paul Bolton, at Edgbaston
11:00PM BST 06 May 2013
Comments
Warwickshire failed to benefit from the presence of England pair Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott and suffered an agonising last-ball defeat against their bogey team in the Yorkshire Bank 40. Adam Ball, Kent’s rookie left-arm seamer, halted a fierce return drive from Jeetan Patel and calmly threw down the stumps at the bowler’s end to run out the New Zealander who was a yard short of the single that would have snatched a tie. Patel single-handedly revived Warwickshire, who needed 55 for victory when their eighth wicket fell, by clobbering two sixes and six fours in his maiden one-day fifty. Thanks to Patel, overlooked by New Zealand for their tour of England, last year’s beaten finalists needed only five from the last over but Ball held his nerve to secure Kent’s third win in two seasons over Warwickshire. At one stage it looked like Kent’s total, based around a one-day best unbeaten 98 from Brendan Nash, would be inadequate. Bell, captaining in the absence of the injured Jim Troughton, was in imperious form as he launched their run chase with a flurry of boundaries, including consecutive on-driven sixes off Mark Davies.

However, having purred to 35 from 23 balls, Bell spluttered to a halt when he tried to clear the longer Pershore Road boundary off Matt Coles and was well taken by Sam Billings. Trott soon followed, caught behind driving at Coles for three having failed to capitalise on being dropped on one at mid-on by Adam Riley, who juggled twice but failed to cling on to the chance off Coles. Despite a third-wicket partnership of 85 between Varun Chopra and William Porterfield, Warwickshire fell behind the rate and their challenge faltered when they lost six wickets for 37. It meant disappointment for the majority of spectators in a sizeable Bank Holiday crowd, lured by the presence of the England players and an even more rare appearance of the sun. Warwickshire, who suffered their first defeat since Dougie Brown took charge as director of cricket, lacked someone to play the anchorman role that Nash performed so well for Kent. The former West Indies left-hander was disappointed not to reach three figures but he worked the ball around intelligently in a 106-ball innings and allowed Coles, who lifted Chris Woakes for consecutive sixes, and Ball to play aggressive cameos.

Ashes 2013: England v Australia, third Test live
Live commentary of the third 2013 Investec Ashes Test between England and Australia at Old Trafford. By Alan Tyers and Rob Smyth
4:45PM BST 05 Aug 2013
• Aussies declare before rain-delayed start, set England 332
• They take three wickets in thrilling morning
• But rain wipes out all but three balls of the afernoon
• Called off at 16.39, match drawn, England retain Ashes
Hawkeye | Scoreboard | LUNCH REPORT: ENG 35/3
Latest 16.45 A shame that today was a damp squib, especially for the Australians. There was something about them this morning, a superb opening spell from Ryan Harris, and England were definitely rattled, as evidenced by Cook's DRS howler. There will be those who will ask if Clarke should have declared earlier yesterday, or whatever, but the weather forecast was so unreliable today that almost any decision could have been the wrong one. England got away with it in this game, but that's not their fault, and they can point to the hammering they gave Australia at Lord's, and a win at Trent Bridge that would have been much more convincing were it not for some freakish lower order batting, to say that they have earned this position. Not all doom and gloom for Australia, though, and they can go into Friday's match at Durham with some heart. On behalf of Jonathan Liew, Rob Smyth and myself, thanks for reading and see you soon. 16.39 You want slightly underwhelming conclusions? We've got slightly underwhelming conclusions. Having just announced that there would be a 5pm inspection, the news from the ground is now that play is abandoned for the day. The match is drawn, and England retain the Ashes. 16.35 So that's... good news? I guess we could still play on for a long while tonight. 7.30pm is the cut-off, as I understand it. 16.30 Sightings of the umpires going into the Aussie dressing room. Does that mean they are going to pronounce the patient dead? No. Apparently we are having a 5pm inspection. Related Articles
Early Ashes Cricket
19 Nov 2013
16.25 Do we blame Manchester for this? Lots, quite rightly, has been said about what a good Test it has been so far, but if you will be holding sporting events in Manchester, then you will be getting wet. 16.15 Is this an unsatisfactory Ashes conclusion? Well, a bit. On the other hand, England have won two matches out of three, so it's not THAT undeserving, is it? Oh look, here's fun. Our Ben Bloom casts his eye over five other underwhelming sporting victories. The explanation for why a rugby triumph was delayed is magnif. 16.05 We just had chocolate brownies, made by the fair hand of our friend and colleague Lucy Kinder. They were well nice. I was planning on taking a photo of them but unfortuantely greed took over and I ate them before they were snapped. Wonder what the players are having/had for tea? The temptation just to carry on troughing must be very high on rain days like this. I mean, really, where does tea end and a rain delay begin? Surely nobody would blame Kevin Pietersen if he had an extra cheese sandwich, or Big Tim Bresnan if he had a second haunch of venison in a bun while they watch the drizzle. 16.00 I'm off to find Victoria's finest afternoon tea. Alan Tyers is here to bring you all the inaction after tea. I'll leave you with this high watermark in broadcasting history. Tim Marsh: "Famous last words but is this the only time a team has retained the Ashes without their batsmen doing a collectively good job in an innings?"
No. In 1993 Australia's scores before they secured the urn were pathetic: 289, 432/5, 632/4, 373, 202/6 and 653/4. Christian Lowis: "You do know Mac Millings isn’t being entirely faithful, don’t you? He’s just had that same XI published by Bull and Ashdown over on the Guardian OBO."
Nobody cheats on me on the internet. That pseudyonymous floozy has typed his last witticism. Twitter: Damien Martyn - I'm sorry folks I feel it's all over here .. Rain set in dark clouds light not great ! #Ashes #shame
Tea: England 37/3 "I know it's over, still I cling. I don't know where else I can go..."
15.37 Apparently tea has been moved back to 15.40. It's raining anyway. As our friends at Cricinfo have pointed out, the hashtag #returntheurn is about to go into hibernation for three months. (Although actually Australia's attempt to win the next Ashes series starts at Durham on Friday, such is the importance of dear old Maurice Mentum and his best mates Form and Confidence, but let's not allow reality to get in the way of a nice line about a hashtag. A nice line about a hashtag! The modern world: discuss.) Mac Millings: "Please allow me to present my all-time Rain XI: Rainy Richardson, Colin Cloudrey, David Shower, Lashin' Tendulkar, Cyril Washout, Lance Hurri-Cairns, Frank Typhoon Tyson, Ray Not looking too Bright, Pourl Allott, Derek Thunderwood, Look out the window, it's P.Siddling down."
Andrew McNeilis: "I watched the KP interview after his century. It was a sublime media performance: self-effacing, team-orientated, nicely modest. Why do people insist on labelling him a prima donna? He is a good man whose stats speak for themselves. This DRS series will go down like the Bodyline series: great win, wrong focus." After the reaction to yesterday's timewasting, on top of the walking and everything else, this should be remembered as the Think of the Children series. Won't somebody? 15.24 It's still raining heavily. I'm going to stick my not inconsiderable neck out and suggest that this is over. 15.18 Daniel Harris has pointed out this VVS picture of Australia giving KP the full "hard luck old chap" this morning. The glee on Ryan Harris's face is particularly special. 15.14 Another video, this time a 42-minute special of possibly the greatest innings ever played. Dan Lucas: "You said the A- word Rob! Please, until the series is officially wrapped up and Alastair Cook's chastity belt locked around the urn, please please please don't mention A*******."
Wasn't that a Smiths song too? Mac Millings: "Sean McManus (14.36) is right, and it's not just the highly successful English set-up whose attitude is an absolute disgrace. Look at Manchester United. Won the title, fired Sir Alex Ferguson. Send them home!"
Roland Howells: "Having listened to, played and umpired cricket for upwards of 55 years, I am all in favour of technology if it works. DRS technology patently obviously does not work. It is spoiling my enjoyment of the game."
I think it will be fine once they find a way for third umpires to use Snickometer. That has become a matter of urgency after Hotspot's Ashes horribilis. 14.59 This is a slightly weird way to retain the Ashes, and the mood feels more 'Meh' than 'Hells yeah!'. But we should not lose sight of that essential fact: England have retained the Ashes*. Imagine if, after the unparalleled trauma of Adelaide 2006, you were told by your future self that England be triumphant in the next three Ashes series, the third with two Tests to spare. And that you would feel slightly underwhelmed by it all. You'd have slapped your future self around the noggin and told him to get his act together! * Obviously we'll amend this bit and pretend it never happened should play resume at 6.59pm with Ryan Harris taking the final seven wickets in a never-to-be-forgotten seven-ball spell.
14.56 Since you didn't ask, the last time England won three consecutive Ashes was was between 1977 and 1981. (They lost 3-0 in Australia in 1979-80 but it was not an official Ashes series.) I know they haven't won the Ashes yet, and that the series could end 2-2, but if I start talking about retaining and regaining the Ashes it all gets far too complicated. Normally I'm of the opinion that pedantry will get you everywhere, but not here. It's far too stressful. You know what I mean: this will be the third consecutive Ashes series that ends with England in possession of the urn, and the last time that happened was in 1981. So. 14.51 Still no sign of a resumption. This song may or may not be playing in the Australian dressing-room right now. Guy Perry: “Two days of non-stop monsoon here in Kerala make me as gloomy as Warner’s psychiatrist. Listening on TMS. Can’t we lock Boycott in the Australian dressing room? After ten minutes, they’ll run off screaming. Then we win the Ashes by default because we won’t be able to find them again.”
14.36 Never mind KP's mild tantrum this morning. This is how you should react to a dodgy umpiring decision. (NB: Telegraph.co.uk does not condone, blah blah blah.) Sean McManus: "Yet again England’s attitude is found wanting. Not at the ground on time not ready to play, wickets lost, tantrum from El Diva. Same attitude that they had in 2007 when the Aussies smashed them. Flower, Cook need to look at themselves. One of the latter needs to look at Trott because he has now had three Tests and been ineffective. The Aussies quietly go about their business and they have still had the worst decisions from DRS and the third ump." Send them home! 14.21 The umpires are wandering out to the middle, albeit with the urgency of men who have anappointment with a sadistic drunken dentist whose wife has just left him for a man who wears white socks. As soon as there is news of a potential restart, you'll hear it here fourth. 14.20 And here's a very unusual umpiring howler: the entirely explicable shocker. 14.19 "That's terrible! What a terrible pitch!" I have no idea how to cut keys, so here's another video to fill some time while you wait. Peter Rowntree: "Quite a few statements of support for young Sam Robson during this Test from fellow OBO punters, but Sam like all other young hopefuls will need to serve his apprenticeship with the Lions, and one good reason for it is the sort of pressure England players are going through right now in this Test. As it is picking a Lions squad this year will be nightmare, there have been so many amazing performances from our young and not so young players the selectors will be looking at: Carberry (capt), Robson, Lees, Denly, Luke Wells, Yardy, Taylor or Ballance (one will go to Australia), Borthwick, Rashid, Mustard, Onions, Stokes, Brooks, Willey, Tredwell, Kerrigan - and I am sure my fellow OBOers can think of some more. So very difficult job for selection, and bound to be some disappointed youngsters around after the Winter Lions selection has taken place."
RAIN STOPS PLAY. OVER 21: ENG 37/3 (Root 13* Bell 4*) It's pretty gloomy at Old Trafford, but the light is playable. Siddle's first ball is a beautiful full-length delivery that seams past Bell's outside edge. As Nasser and Athers have just said on Sky, his length has been so much fuller - and better - since he worked with the former Australian bowling coach Craig McDermott. And how did Bell get away with that?! The third ball popped viciously from a length to take the glove before looping teasingly over the slip cordon. That could easily have broken Bell's thumb - the slow-motion replay showed just how far his thumb was pegged back when the ball hit it - and now he is going to receive treatment. Michael Clarke has a rare old face on and is having a moan at Bell. He's a funky captain now, but not in the usual sense of the word. We don't know if Bell is timewasting or not; in his defence, that was a nasty blow - and David Warner had the physio on after a similar incident yesterday. It doesn't matter either way because it is now pouring down again and the players are going off. Clarke has another go at Bell as the players leave the field; Bell invites him to talk to the thumb. Joe Root smiles. Joe Root always smiles. After yesterday's Doctor Who reveal, it's surely time for Nestle to announce Root as the new Milky Bar kid. Actually, never mind fragile yet moreish white chocolate: he should be used to advertise humanity. Giles Ripley: "Here is the latest rain radar image. Although there are some showers around it is the big band of rain to the south that is the one to keep an eye on, and it is slowly approaching, although some way off! The very light rain (green colour) is not too significant, and sometimes in summer it is on the radar but it can actually evaporate before it hits the ground! In winter you would be getting wet! Anyway, enough of the radar lesson. There is still some nail biting cricket to come!" 13.52 Good news: play will resume at 14.00. You have eight minutes to assume the position behind the sofa. There are a maximum of 73 overs remaining. 13.46 A rain-break treat: Abdul Qadir, the greatest googly bowler of them all. Not so much 'Pick that out!' as 'Pick that. Out.' 13.42 John Inverarity, the Australian chairman of selectors, knows better than most that it is possible to beat the weather and the clock to secure a famous Ashes victory: he was the last man out to Derek Underwood when England won at the Oval in 1968. Australia surely need at least three more hours' play to have a chance of taking those seven wickets. 13.39 There's a shower at Old Trafford, and this time I'm not talking about the England batsmen: the rain is getting heavier at Old Trafford so play will not resume on time. "I so called it!" says Alan Tyers to my right, and he did too - we had 35 minutes of decent weather, while the players were necking Gatorade chasers and consuming macrobiotic goodness. Twitter: Damien Martyn - Just light rain but if it stays windy hopefully will blow over ! Fingers crossed Australia #ashes
Stephen Nelson: "Daft DRS reviews are getting dafter. Watson yesterday, Cook and Pietersen today. I'd put it down to prima donnas and fits of pique, nothing more and nothing less."
I can understand why someone might call KP a prima donna - not that I necessarily agree - but Cook?! That was surely just bad judgement, probably the consequence of captaincy sapping his concentration, the increased confusion surrounding DRS, or both. 13.26 It sounds like England made the oldest mistake in the book this morning: they trusted the weatherman. (Warning: clip contains fruity language.) 13.20 Hello. It is oiccasionally suggested that this England side are a little on the insomnia-busting side of boring. And yet they are the biggest heartstoppers around. In the last decade there have been 10 drawn Tests with the batting side nine wickets down in their second innings; England have been involved in seven of them. That list includes the Graham Onions duology in South Africa and Matt Prior's rescue act in New Zealand.They are the Harlem Coronary Inducers of sport, and they are at it again. They also have an endearing Frank Spencer gene that they demonstrated this morning at Old Trafford, breathing life into a dead game and a dying rubber by putting us through the uniquely hilarious misery that is the England batting collapse. There was a whiff of Headingley 2009 about their muddled batting this morning, as if they left their concentration spans at the hotel. To mix metacliches, they had the eye on the prize when they needed to have their eye on the ball; they felt the heat because they were caught cold. After that match four years ago England said they would never again get ahead of themselves, but perhaps they were guilty of that this morning. They should still get out of this, because the weather forecast is poor. Yet they will not be retaining the Ashes in quite the same blaze of glory they managed in 2010-11. LUNCH: England 35/3 Well, to be totally honest we thought that there would be little or no cricket today. The England players, according to Sir Ian Botham, didn't even get to the ground until 20 minutes before the scheduled start (and when Sir Ian thinks your preparations are a little cavalier...!) But cricket we have had, 90 minutes of it, and it has been fantastic stuff. A brilliant opening spell from Ryan Harris, a terrible use of the DRS by Cook, a Pietersen tantrum after being given out by what Snicko later suggested was a correct ruling, the wicket of Trott and also a dropped catch from Clarke off Root, this has been a hell of a morning. If the weather holds, we could be in for a day to remember. Well bowled Australia: three major English wickets in the bag, seven to go. The England win now looks impossible, so it's all about survival. And the weather. Let's hope the weather holds. And let's turn now to the mighty Rob Smyth to bring you the afternoon session. I think I need a lie-down! Peter Holland: "Alan, for those with a nervous disposition during this all too familiar England batting collapse, could you include a likelyhood of rain report with every over." Mr Say: "Sometimes an umpire will make a bad decision based on the wrong use of DRS, sometimes an umpire will make a bad decision because he did not clean his glasses, what’s the difference. Leave DRS alone, get umpires that will make it look better."
Twitter: Andy Zaltzman - If Australia had caught Root at Lord's and here today, his last five scores would have been 5, 6, 8, 8 and 4. #takeyourchances
OVER 20: ENG 35/3 (Root 13* Bell 2*) Bell drives in the air through cover, quite close to Rogers at silly point but no chance of catching it unless it hits you in the hands. Anyhow, no further bleeding in that over, and even though the weather is playable there, we are stopping for a spot of lunch, what what. OVER 19: ENG 33/3 (Root 12* Bell 1*) The Aussies rattle through a decent over from Siddle and there's just time for one more. Clarke himself is going to bowl it. You'd think in this instance it would be better to delay the lunch for half an hour. It'll probably start tipping down at 1.32pm now. Anyway. OVER 18: ENG 31/3 (Root 11* Bell 0*) Joe Root plays this over very well, solid in defence, then he pulls Lyon for four. Just looking at the KP business again, Snicko would seem to sugges that he has edged that. So, fair play to Tony Hill on this occasion. Twitter: Derek Pringle - No Hotspot, no obvious deflection, just noise on stump mic that used not to be trusted, enough to condemn a man it seems. England 27-3
OVER 17: ENG 27/3 (Root 7* Bell 0*) Anyway, never mind the DRS, here's Ian Ronald Bell. Survives his first four balls. WICKET! Pietersen c Haddin b Siddle 8 Pietersen given out caught behind. Siddle does not appeal. Haddin likes it. And, more to the point, so does Umpire Tony Hill. Kevin looks contemptuous of the decision and asks for the review. There is no mark on the useless Hotspot. There's some sort of noise. There's nothing in terms of deviation. But there's nothing really to say that it should be overturned, I guess. Pietersen looks absolutely livid. FOW 27/3 Nasser Hussain makes the very valid point that, if DRS didn't exist, that would still have been out. IE the decision - the "wrong decision", if you will - was made the old fashioned way, by an old bloke with dodgy mincers on the field of play. Anyhow, England lose their second review and it is GAME ON. OVER 16: ENG 24/2 (Root 4* Pietersen 6*) Another good over from Nathan Lyon, he's doing a job for his side in this match. Hope he gets a run in the team. KP's looking to dominate him. Two off the over. OVER 15: ENG 22/2 (Root 4* Pietersen 6*) A belated, to my mind anyway, introduction for Peter Siddle. I think he is much more likely to take a wicket than Shane Watson. Or maybe it's that he wanted the same end as Ryano. Anyway, he could and should have had the wicket of Joe Root, with the sixth ball of this over. It angles in, quick ball, and seams away to square Joe Root up and take his edge. Flies to Michael Clarke at second slip, nice catchable height but he has dropped it. Ooh, that is an absolute sickener. In Clarke's defence, the ball did so much off the deck that Clarke might have thought it was going to go legside. Twitter: Scyld Berry - After the loss of 2 early wickets, you might not want to know that Pietersen has scored only one 50 in his second innings in last 2 years...
OVER 14: ENG 21/2 (Root 4* Pietersen 5*) As is the modern way, Harris goes off after finishing his spell. What a joke this rule has become. Nathan Lyon is on at the other end, some sharp turn for him to Root. Single to each man, Kevin's a sweep. Not seen many of them in this match. Twitter: Nick Hoult - Eight years on from 2005 will it be an England dressing room wildly celebrating a draw? 19-2
OVER 13: ENG 19/2 (Root 3* Pietersen 4*) Here comes the big man. Pietersen strides to the crease, he looks like he means business. Eager to feel bat on ball as always, he blocks a couple on the walk. Prods and misses at one, though. But fourth ball, as is his wont, he tells Ryan Harris that this short ball stuff isn't going to wash, and pulls an attempted bouncer away with a savage display of thoroughly un-English intent. WICKET! Trott c Haddin b Harris 11 Not exactly what Australia were looking for, no that they will care, because the rock Jonathan Trott has been shattered. A quick ball down the legside, Trott flaps at it and he has feathered a little edge down the legside. Very smart catch from Haddin. FOW 15/2
OVER 12: ENG 13/1 (Root 3* Trott 9*) Another good Watto maiden. Root plays it well, in the main, apart from one little flirt outside off. OVER 11: ENG 13/1 (Root 3* Trott 9*) A vital moment: Trott lbw Harris??? They appeal, it is given not out but Clarke likes it for the review, Brad Haddin is not so sure. Ryan Harris just looks bloody exhausted. Playing across the inswinger, Trott is hit on the pad. No contact with the bat. Trott will be hoping that the "umpire's call" saves him. Aw, man. It is clipping the leg stump. Stays with the umpire's call. Hard lines on Harris, hard lines on Clarke. Close, but no cigar. Maiden. Australia lose a review, and it's certainly one of those where you have sympathy for the argument that "umpire's calls" shouldn't cost you a review. On the other hand, we haven't got all day, have we? OVER 10: ENG 13/1 (Root 3* Trott 9*) Watson into the attack. One, two and fourth slip, gully. It's a typical Watto over: accurate, decent pace, doesn't look especially like taking a wicket. Maiden. Twitter: Nick Hoult - Botham says Eng players turned up 20 mins before the start. And they tell us they never pay attention to weather forecasts
OVER 9: ENG 13/1 (Root 3* Trott 9*) Rooty is off the mark at the 23rd time of asking. A rare bad ball from Harris drifts onto his toes for three. This beehive shows Harris to Root so far this morning, an object lesson in how to test out a right-hander: off stump or just outside, with some well-directed bouncers at the head. Dan Lucas: "Morning Alan. In light of rumours about KP's possibly impending retirement I was wondering how the England Test side might line up in a couple of years time. At best guess something along the lines of Cook (c), Robson, Root, Bell, Taylor, Ballance, Prior (I'll admit to not knowing where we are on the best bet for Prior's long-term replacement. Buttler?), Broad, Kerrigan, Anderson, Finn?"
OVER 8: ENG 10/1 (Root 0* Trott 9*) Better from Starc but he's not really shown the right-hander that he can nip it back, so Trott can leave these deliveries going across his bows with some confidence. England starting to settle? Stephen Nelson: "I'm a steadfast England supporter as you know Alan, but there's still half a chance that Australia could bowl us out today. And that might not be a bad thing: (1) Australia deserve to win this match and (2) that would rattle our cage and boy do we need a good shake-up."
OVER 7: ENG 10/1 (Root 0* Trott 9*) Ryan Harris with another good over. Nothing for Root to leave with any confort here, and a nice sharp bouncer to finish it. I reckon if Ryan had enjoyed more luck with injuries he'd be regarded as one of the best in the world over the last four years. DAmn shame that he's only played 13 Tests and, at 33, hard to see him getting too many more, given his injury record. But one wishes him well. Marc Melander: "I blame Richard Spence's foolhardy showing away for this calamitous beginning. He may as well have typed "Good morning Mr Cat, let me introduce you to the Pigeon family."
OVER 6: ENG 10/1 (Root 0* Trott 9*) Starc with one that keeps a bit low, Trotty gets the bat down on it. Clips the ball away for four - it's all legside for JT so far - via an unconvincing inside edge. But that's about as good as it gets in this Starc over, he's far too wide for the rest of it. Twitter: Paul Hayward - That's where players bring DRS into disrepute. Cook couldn't have been more out, but he threw away a review for what? Dramatic effect?
OVER 5: ENG 5/1 (Root 0* Trott 5*) Clarke takes the gully away and brings him into short leg. Trott clips the ball away not a million miles from that fielder. Two runs. Now he pushes into the covers and takes on David Warner's arm. Single. Ryan Harris playing a blinder, beating Root's nervy push with an 88mph outswinger in a classy over. OVER 4: ENG 2/1 (Root 0* Trott 2*) Trott turns a short ball away for one. Root survives the over, there's the hint of an LBW shout when Starc gets him on the toe of the bat/inside bit of the pad with a good ball that nips back in. Twitter: S Rajesh - England have lost 4 of the 5 times when Cook has got a Test duck, and both times when he's got a 2nd-inngs 0 http://t.co/VZqFF6jQnr
OVER 3: ENG 1/1 (Root 0* Trott 1*) Trott in, can he steady the nerves? He clips a full straight ball off his pads third ball, seems a bit of a risky shot to me but hey. He nails it for one. WICKET! Cook lbw Harris 0 Scenes! Third ball of the over, Harris produces the perfect inswinger, Cook prods half forward and is struck slap bang on the pad. Ooh, that is plumb. But what's this?! Cook has reviewed! That is a terrible review. It has hit him on the shin in front of middle stump,. So, so out. England are 0/1 and it's ON like DONKEY KONG. We've seen some terrible reviews in this series, but that might just top the lot
OVER 2: ENG 0/0 (Cook 0* Root 0*) Mitchell Starc shares the new ball, Clarkie doesn't seem to fancy Peter Siddle, does he? This isn't a brilliant over from young Starcko. Root can leave all six of them without much concern. OVER 1: ENG 0/0 (Cook 0* Root 0*) Three slips and a gully, more of a fifth slip actually, for Ryan Harris to Alastair Cook. Not a great start, to be honest. Wide of off, a few down leg, and that's an easy maiden for Cook. Richard Spence: "Nobody seems to be talking about England winning? By my reckoning 332 over 90 overs (if we get a full day) is only 3.69 an over. Is that totally out of the question? Wouldn't it be great to see a win snatched from the jaws of defeat? And how big a blow would that be to the Aussies after being so far ahead in this game?" Absolutely fair point, Richard. Stranger things, and all that. I personally don't think that England will go for the win, not in a million years, but all results are certainly possible. 11.30 So here comes Ryan Harris to see if he can set in motion a thrilling day's cricket. 11.28 Joe Root and Alastair Cook, as well as their colleagues to come, need to be careful that they're not thinking "Doesn't matter if we lose a few, the weather will save the day." All goes without saying really, but stranger things have happened. 11.26 Well, against the odds, there are cricketers out on the field; and England need to get their game face on. Stephen Nelson writes: "Morning Alan. I understand that Marais Erasmus cited "safety" as the main reason for closing play yesterday. This DRS farce is bad enough, but if "Elf and Bleeding Safety" have poked theirs in as well then the hallowed game as we know it is well and truly dead. Here's hoping we get a good few overs in-between the showers today, provided of course it's not too slippery and dangerous out there."
11.18 Here is Paul Hayward on the fiasco last night which, even if we do get a full day in today, will probably have played its part in securing England a draw and the urn. For a series bedevilled by doubt about the decision review system – and the humans running it – a bizarre dispute over light was an apt way to bring the weekend to a close. In truth it was immaterial. While Australia’s batsmen still fumed about the umpires’ decision to force them off (Michael Clarke, the captain, was understandably desperate to continue), English drizzle scattered the 26,000 crowd and raised the grim probability that this series will be settled by a draw, after just 14 days. 11.14 Here's a view of the Old Trafford press box. Ladies! Calm yourselves. They've all just had a double egg barm for second breakfast and it's repeating something awful. Picture from Lizzy Ammon - aka @legsidelizzy 11.02 Sir Ian is doing the pitch report. This all feels very crickety, doesn't it? We were more or less certain it was going to be a ruined day. But cricket has prevailed! (Unless it starts raining again which, y'know, is quite likely). Twitter: Simon Wilde - If England don't lose today, they'll have retained Ashes in 14 days of play - their best since five-day Tests came in post WWII
10.54 Nice bit from Shane Warne in the Andy Townsend Memorial Tactics Truck thing talking viewers, and Ian Ward, through the technicalities of Nathan Lyon's action. Warnie is full of praise for young Lyono, he likes his action and his approach to the crease, and notes approvingly his high release of the ball. 10.50 Play to start at 11.30am. Australia have declared their innings. England will chase 332 to win. Twitter: BBC TMS - Rumours that if no further rain we might start as early as 1130. But nothing official #ashes
10.40 News of that inspection as soon as I get it. It looks alright there at the moment. 10.36 Yeah, so, a cricket may happen. There go the umpires. Turning our attention to our friends Down Under, the Aussie press are pretty unhappy with the fiasco last night with the "bad" light. We've got a good round-up of the Australian newspapers here. Malcolm Conn of the Daily Telegraph (no relation to this organ) said: "Cricket continues to make a fool of itself. It is difficult to know why, if the captain of the batting side wants to continue, the umpires have to intervene? The bad light law must be better implemented."
Richard Hinds, writing for the same newspaper, said the Australians were given no assistance by the home team in attempting to extend play. "In the latest example of new-fashioned 'English fair play', England first dawdled through its overs and employed a series of stalling tactics, then did its best to cajole the umpires to allow it to leave the field for bad light, having refused to bowl spin at both ends."
10.30 Yes! It's another free advert for our new friend Giles Ripley and his Home And Dry rain app gizmo thing. If only there was a way for websites to make money out of giving space and favourable coverage to commercial products and services. Joking! Everyone knows that you can't make money out of a websites. Durrr. Anyway, in fairness to Mr Ripley, he's providing useful information for us and you, and he even writes a little comment to go with the picture of all the nasty acid looking green rain. So, like, totally get his app. (Advisory to Giles: we like beer and money). Have at it, Home And Dry Weather App. And Giles says: "Here is the latest rain radar image from the Home and Dry app. There is a little bit of hope for some play as there are some dry gaps in the forecast rain radar. However it is a matter of how fast the OT outfield dries, and we understand it takes about 2 hours. But either way, there will be a lot more rain later on, so I think it is game over. Well done England, job done!"
10.20 We are having an inspection at 10.45am. That is something of a surprise, but a very welcome one. I'd love to see the Aussies have a good go at England with the ball here. If we do get to play, there will obviously be loads of cloud cover so who knows, maybe a swing bowler can make a hero of himself. It all feels a bit unlikely though, I have to say. It looks like being a busy day for this little droid. 10.15 There has been a momentary lapse of rain in Manchester but it is still looking pretty awful. Covers are coming off, but the feeling at the ground seems to be that they'll be back on sooner rather than later. 10.10 Good morning. It does not look too clever in Manchester. Let's treat ourselves to a rare tweet from Scyld Berry, who sums things up as succinctly as one could wish. Twitter: Scyld Berry - There seems no prospect of play before lunch so, assuming England can bat two sessions if there is play afterwards, the Ashes are retained!
I'm almost tempted to leave it at that with the blog for the time being. But, you know, I get paid by the word (God - I WISH. I would be so rich that I wouldn't be talking to you chumps esteemed readers. But then I wouldn't be getting paid anymore, would I? It's a paradox of GREED and INDOLENCE). Anyway, let's leave that alone and hear from one of our brave men and true up in Manchester. Derek Pringle has the state of the game up-sum: A draw will be enough for England to retain the Ashes on Monday and history suggests that they are at the right venue to achieve it. Old Trafford has hosted 29 Ashes Tests prior to this one and 14, almost 50 per cent, have ended in deadlock, the highest percentage of all the main Test grounds at home. Add to that today’s forbidding forecast, which is predicting solid rain until lunchtime and then showers in the afternoon, and Michael Clarke and his bowlers could have under two sessions to take the 10 wickets they need to keep the Ashes alive.
