Retiring Britons fall out of love with Spain and France
Financial woes in southern Europe appear to have forced a shift in perceptions of desirable places to retire.
Rural Provence has been a favourite with Britons By Andrew Oxlade, Head of Personal Finance

A third of people want to move abroad when they reitre but the popularity of Spain, France, Portugal and Greece has plummeted in the past year, the results of a study suggest. Of more than 1,500 Britons aged over 40 polled by GlobalVisas.com, a visa application website, 35pc said they would be happier to retire abroad than stay in the UK. The top three destinations were the US, Australia and Canada, if visa application was no issue, but a year ago Spain was the most popular destination. The country, which is struggling with huge government debt and soaring unemployment, is now in fourth spot with only 23pc starting it as their prefered location compared to 33pc a year ago. Thousands of expats have already moved back from the popular Costa resorts amid a crash in Spanish house prices and concerns about tax rises. A weaker pound against the euro has also eaten away at the buying power of British sterling-based savings and pensions on the Continent making it harder to make ends meet. Related Articles

France has also seen a drop in popularity, down to 15pc from 22pc in the poll. Greece dropped out of the top ten. Attempts by the socialist French government to impose a 75pc wealth tax was rejected by the courts while a threat to tax the rental income and pensions of British expats has also created uncertainty although tax office officials said earlier this month that there would not be any double taxation. Summer 2013 poll Country % preference US 31% Australia 27% Canada 24% Spain 23% New Zealand 18% France 15% Turkey 12% Portugal 11% United Arab Emirates 9% Germany 8% Summer 2012 poll
Country % preference Spain 33% Australia 29% Canada 27% France 22% U.S. 19% Portugal 14% Turkey 13% United Arab Emirates 12% Germany 10% Greece 9% Meanwhile, the turmoil in Greece continues. The country received a €110bn bailout by the IMF and EU in May 2010. Another €130bn euro rescue package was granted in February 2012. But GDP collapsed by 17pc between 2009 and 2012 and unemployment rate has spiked above 25pc. The Spanish government recently introduced reporting requirements meaning that anyone who lives in Spain for more than six months (183 days) per tax year and has overseas assets worth more than €50,000 - including bank accounts, property and investments - must declare them. Failures or delays in doing so will result in hefty fines and penalties. The Foreign Office estimates that 800,000 British nationals live all or part of the year in Spain. Estimates on residency vary from 250,000 to 400,000. Anecdotal reports suggest a growing number are preparing to return home. The countries that top the list of most popular locations, such as Canada and Australian, have largely escaped the worst effects of the global financial crisis. America, which is now the number one destination, has seen the prospects for its economy strengthen in the past year. Gary Smith, of GlobalVisas.com, said: "With the British climate notoriously unpredictable and the economic output seemingly as reliable as the weather, some people see living abroad as the better option. "The credit crunch stung a lot of expats living within Europe, which seems to have influenced some people's decisions as the wider world now seems more appealing."

Payday loan furore: let borrowers choose
Lloyds in push to halt false PPI claims
Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, has written to the Justice Secretary demanding the ballooning costs of false payment protection insurance claims are shared by the claims management companies that are often behind them.

Mr Horta-Osorio, a strong critic of the false PPI claims, wrote to Chris Grayling to ask him to look at changing the law on who covers the cost of processing claims. Lloyds pays a handling fee of some £850 for administering a claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service. The letter, sent in mid-November, said that while the bank is happy to continue to pay the £850 for cases that are proven to be valid, claims management companies (CMCs) should cover the costs for those they lodge which are proven to be invalid or bogus. Under the current system, Lloyds and its peers have to pick up the Ombudsman’s costs, whether they are found to have mis-sold or not. A source indicated that the letter “focused on the concept that the CMCs are getting a free ride”. Related Articles

“They can lodge any number of claims, and not have to pay for them,” the source said. The source went on to indicate that while the bank is happy to pay the Ombudsman’s fee for cases where it is found to have mis-sold, it does not think it is fair that the CMCs face no penalty if they file cases inappropriately. In November, Lloyds set aside a further £1bn to cover compensation for customers mis-sold PPI, bringing its bill to date to £5.28bn. The bill for the industry now stands in excess of £12bn, with further provisions expected from the banks in their year-end results, with Barclays first to report on February 12. Last April, Mr Horta-Osorio said a quarter of PPI cases reported to it turn out to be false, and that up to 50pc of those received from CMCs had no merit. “It is fraud and I think we should stop that,” he said. The Lloyds chief wrote to the Ombudsman last autumn to seek to amend the system, but was told that legislation would need to be changed in order for that to happen, hence the letter to Mr Grayling. In October last year, Natalie Ceeney, chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service, publicly disagreed with banks’ accusations of fraud and said claims dismissed often turned out to be justified. In part as a result of Mr Horta-Osorio’s efforts, the Ministry of Justice is now understood to be in talks with the British Bankers Association on the subject of who covers the cost of false claims. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “The Government is stepping up its efforts to tackle the compensation culture, and to ensure effective regulation of claims management companies. “We are looking closely at ways in which we minimise the financial burden on banks, which is created by the poor practice of some claims management companies.”
The spokesman added that Mr Grayling has, in the past few days, formally responded to Mr Horta-Osorio, but did not give details of the reply. Personal Finance

Inside Britain’s grumpiest café
The Temporary Measure in Keswick is the Lake District tea room where grumbles about service have reopened the North-South divide
Eccentric outpost: William Langley inside the Temporary Measure tea room, Keswick

Beyond the sound of cakes hitting crockery and the bronchial wheezings of the coffee machine, a wounded hush prevailed yesterday in the café branded the bolshiest in Britain.
Proprietor Emma Smalley shuffled around her ancient premises, plumping up the cushions, making sure the teddy bears were comfortable, commiserating with her affronted mum and occasionally attending to the customers.
Outside, sheets of greasy rain lashed the Lake District, but there was no refuge here from the awkward question Ms Smalley’s modest establishment had raised: are Northerners grumpy?
It came to the fore last week after visitors to Keswick complained on a travel website about “unwelcoming” service at the Temporary Measure tea shop in the town and declared that, despite its indisputable good points: “we won’t be coming back”.
Ms Smalley, 33, posted a tart rebuttal, pointing out that her business was located in the North: “a place that still maintains a healthy respect for a good old-fashioned surly disposition. We enjoy a good curmudgeon.”

In a further swipe, she wrote: “November is the month when we operate a strict mean-and-surly-to-everyone policy. We have to balance out the karma, what with all the smiling we have to do in the other months.”
The backfire could be heard across the land. Wasn’t such stereotyping supposed to have died out with whippet jokes? Wasn’t the North in enough of a fix without having its hard-won reputation for hospitality questioned? Soon the true culprit emerged in the shape of Emma’s musician brother, John, 24, who helps at the café while pursuing a career as the banjo-playing frontman of an outfit called Sycamore Sykes. “John likes to work on his songs while he’s here,” said Emma, “and if he has to serve someone, it interrupts his creative processes – that’s why he may not look very happy. He doesn’t mean any harm, he’s just not very smiley. He probably shouldn’t work in service, frankly, but we’re a family business and we all do our bit.”
When the café hit the news last week, with headlines such as “Rhubarb Grumble”, John made a hasty departure and hasn’t been seen at his serving post since. In his absence, the controversy moved seamlessly on to Emma’s “humorous” musings about the Northern character.
The North-South divide remains raw, so why say it? “Well, I’m a Northerner, too,” huffs Emma. “I came here from Manchester. It’s like sending yourself up. One of the things I love most about the North is that you don’t get so much false niceness. People tend to be the way they are, and if they’re not all smiling and asking you if you’re having a nice day, it doesn’t mean they aren’t friendly.
“We’re a little business, trying to get by, and we wouldn’t survive long if we made a habit of being rude. Most of our customers say really nice things about us, and the one who complained about John said they loved everything else about us.”
It isn’t hard to see why. The Temporary Measure, occupying a beamed former pub, is by no means the least friendly café in Britain, but it must be one of the crankiest. Most of the space is filled with a jumble of toys, cards, books, balls of wool and artworks. There are seven small tables at which you can slurp “the best coffee in the universe” and eat scones baked by Emma’s mother, Jackie.
This kind of eccentric outpost of Britain’s depressingly homogenous café culture needs a voice, and Emma is really highlighting the programmed politeness that prevails elsewhere.
The big chains drill their staff into a state of robotic servility. Everyone smiles, asks how you are, hopes you are having a nice day. Starbucks demands to know your first name before serving you a coffee, while Pret A Manger has a totalitarian staff code under which employees are not allowed to be “moody or bad-tempered”.
It isn’t like that at Temporary Measures. Emma and her family came to Keswick seven years ago because they loved the town, and, although they can’t really afford the hefty Main Street rent, they struggle by because they like the buzz of being at the heart of things. They are all in it together. “I raised four children, and they are all lovely,” says Jackie, “and not only that, but lovely in their own ways.”
Their seats are squashy, their cakes crumbly, and their manners all their own. And, as they don’t quite say in the North, if it doesn’t suit you, tough.
