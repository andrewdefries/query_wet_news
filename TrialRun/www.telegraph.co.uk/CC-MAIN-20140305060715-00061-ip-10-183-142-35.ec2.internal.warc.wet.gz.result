The week ahead: collect seed and control clematis Helen Yemm's quick tips for the garden this week. Now is the time to remove algae from your pond Photo: ALAMY By Helen Yemm
6:30AM BST 06 Aug 2012
Comments
Prune shrub roses
Cut back the shoots that have done their thing, preserving the new shoots. Mature specimens will need more pruning in winter.
Collect seed Collect ripened seed of sweet cicely, angelica and Smyrnium perfoliatum. Seed of these plants germinates best if sown straight away.
Control clematis

Snip off long wayward extremities of Clematis montana. Shoots produced thereafter should be left alone.
Remove algae Haul out blanket weed from ponds by twisting it around a stick. Throw some watercress in the water, which helps “eat” the algae-causing nutrients.
Trim cosmos
Use a fine afternoon to deadhead cosmos, and thereby ensure a long, long, display of flowers.

Peter Smith
Peter Smith, who has died aged 86, was an architectural historian and author of Houses of the Welsh Countryside, a book which has had a profound influence on the understanding and appreciation of domestic architecture in the Principality since its publication in 1975.
Peter Smith 6:00PM BST 01 Apr 2013
Comments
A member of staff of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, Smith was inspired to write the book while he was carrying out emergency recording of threatened buildings in Wales and came across a tumbledown barn, rotting away in a remote valley in mid-Wales. What he found when he went up closer was a timber frame with a few shreds and patches of wall and roof. He immediately recognised it as an aisled hall of the 1400s, built from the magnificent oaks that then proliferated in the Severn valley — a building which reflected the prestige of the Welsh aristocracy six centuries ago.
The importance and vulnerability of the structure, known as Ty Mawr, started Smith on a project that would see it restored to its former glory and inspire the saving of many other gems of Welsh domestic architecture. From the early medieval house and the longhouse to houses of the Welsh border, through to the cottage and the modern house, Smith’s lavishly illustrated Houses of the Welsh Countryside, published by the Royal Commission, was based on the close examination of thousands of old houses, many of them difficult to access, and informed by a study of documentary sources, particularly probate inventories and church terriers. The book was awarded the Alice Davis Hitchcock Medallion of the Society of Architectural Historians.
Had Smith not brought Ty Mawr to public attention, the building could easily have gone the way of Plas Cadwgan, a magnificent late 14th-century aisled hall that had later belonged to Edward Jones, master of the wardrobe to Elizabeth I, but was dismissed as “strange looking” and demolished in 1967. Instead, with subsequent restoration, Ty Mawr defeated Tate Modern to receive the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ Building of the Year award in 2000.
The son of a schools’ inspector, Peter Smith was born on June 15 1926 at Winlaton-on-Tyne, Co Durham, and educated at King Edward VI School, Southampton, from where he won the Hampshire Open Scholarship to Oxford to read Modern History.
After graduation and a brief period working at the Ministry of Transport, he studied for and passed the Intermediate Examination of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1949 was appointed to the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire (later the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales). There he embarked on a long professional study of Welsh antiquities and was appointed Secretary to the Commission in 1973. In the immediate post-war period the Commission staff (the Secretary and four investigators) all worked on monuments of every period. However, encouraged by Sir Cyril Fox, keeper of archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, Smith developed a particular interest in the interpretation of historic farmhouses and other vernacular structures. He would become an early member of the Vernacular Architecture Group, serving as its president.
This interest was evident early on in his contribution to the Caernarvonshire Inventory and in his investigations of the stone houses of Glamorgan. The opportunity for a broader study of Welsh architecture was presented by the transfer of the National Buildings Record to the Commission in 1963, when he was moved from inventory work to the emergency recording of threatened buildings throughout Wales, including timber-built houses. Smith’s provisional views on the development of vernacular architecture were published in 1967 as a chapter on “Rural Housing in Wales” in The Agrarian History of England and Wales, 1500-1640, and then developed into his Houses of the Welsh Countryside.
After his retirement in 1991, Smith continued to research and write, and in 2010 was behind a Welsh-language television series for S4C about the history of domestic architecture in Wales. Peter Smith is survived by his wife, Joyce, and by their three children.

Beijing Olympics: Queen pays tribute to British medal winners
The Queen has sent a message of congratulations to the British Olympic team which celebrated its 19th gold medal yesterday, won by James DeGale in the middleweight boxing.

Comments
She said she had followed the endeavours of the British and Commonwealth athletes who took part in Beijing "with great interest and admiration". The Queen added: "The golden triumphs of the present British team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the London Games a shining example of Olympic success."
Yesterday's British medal haul saw Tim Brabants win a bronze in the 500m kayak and Sarah Stevenson getting a bronze in the taekwondo. It brought the tally to 19 gold, 13 silver and 15 bronze – a total of 47 which put Britain in fourth place in the medal table. DeGale, 22, defeated the Cuban Emilio Correa Bayeaux, who was penalised for biting the Briton in the opening round. DeGale seemed to take strength from the extraordinary collective confidence that has lifted Team GB ever since Nicole Cook on her road bike braved torrential rain up towards the Great Wall to gain the first British gold on the opening Sunday.

Correa was docked two points for the biting and lost 16-14. Brabants, the paddling doctor from Walton-on-Thames, can add his Kayak bronze to the gold he won over 1,000 metres on Friday. Stevenson had a rollercoaster day which saw her controversially eliminated at the quarter-final stage and then later declared the victor after the British team protested against the judges’ decision. The bronze she went on to take with a 5-1 victory over Egypt’s Noha Abd Rabo, was Britain’s first ever taekwondo Olympic medal. At 25, with three Olympics behind her, Stevenson will have hopes of more success in 2012. So, too, will 31-year-old Brabants, who says the 18 months he will now take to continue his medical career will rest his body, to return even stronger in London. By then, 14-year-old diver Tom Daley, from Plymouth, will be all of 18 and must be a good bet to go closer than the honourable seventh he clocked up in the 10-metre platform final yesterday. British runners suffered a frustrating evening. In the women’s 1,500 metres, Lisa Dobriskey, from Ashford, Kent, narrowly missed bronze. In the 4x400-metre relay, the men’s team came fourth and in the women’s race, the British four came in fifth. Today, Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, was in the Bird’s Nest stadium for the Olympic flag handover. Having lost third place in the medal table to the Russians only yesterday, putting them behind us in 2012 must now be a minimum ambition. Her Majesty’s statement in full
"As the Olympic Games in Beijing draw to a close, I have been particularly impressed by the British and Commonwealth athletes who have taken part in this memorable competition and who have contributed so much to the spirit of these remarkable Games in the various disciplines.
Like so many people around the world, I have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration. To all the participants, and to everyone who has supported them so well, I send my warmest congratulations.
As a nation we now look forward to holding the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The golden triumphs of the present British team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the London Games a shining example of Olympic success."
