The usual suspects
Perhaps courts could follow Judge Richard Seymour's example and accompany all sentences with a well-chosen cinematic reference
Judge Richard Seymour QC, sentencing a cheating gambler to a suspended jail term, quoted Clint Eastwood’s line from Dirty Harry: “Do ya feel lucky? Photo: Rex Features	By Telegraph View

Comments
Judge Richard Seymour QC is evidently a fan of the cinema. Sentencing a cheating gambler to a suspended jail term, he quoted Clint Eastwood’s line from Dirty Harry: “Do ya feel lucky?” though he wisely refrained from adding “Well, do ya punk?” This could be the start of a new trend in the courts where all sentences are accompanied by a well-chosen cinematic reference. In response to the plainly phoney plea for clemency there is always “Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn” from Gone With the Wind; and for the really macho judge, the convict could be sent to jail with the words “Hasta la vista, baby” from The Terminator 2 ringing in his ears. As part of a plea bargain, the judge could make the defendant “an offer he can’t refuse” (The Godfather). Most pertinent of all, however, would be Sylvester Stallone in Judge Dredd: “I am the law.” Related Articles

Stake in Thames Water up for sale A stake in Thames Water has been put up for sale for up to £700m. Although it is not clear exactly what size stake is on offer in Thames Water, observers believe it is likely to be around 8.7pc, which is also known as a "Thames Unit" as it gives the owner a seat on the company's board. By Ben Harrington
10:00PM GMT 24 Mar 2012
Comments
According to City sources, Australian investment group Macquarie has been conducting an auction of a shareholding in Kemble Water, Thames Water's parent company. The stake sale comes after funds managed by Macquarie sold a 9.9pc shareholding in Thames Water to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority last year.
Earlier this year the China Investment Corporation (CIC) also bought an 8.7pc stake in Britain's largest water company from Santander Private Equity, part of Spanish banking group Santander's asset management arm, and Finpro, a Portuguese investment vehicle.
Although it is not clear exactly what size stake is on offer in Thames Water, observers believe it is likely to be around 8.7pc, which is also known as a "Thames Unit" as it gives the owner a seat on the company's board. Analysts have previously speculated that CIC paid between £500m and £700m for its 8.7pc stake in Thames Water. Related Articles

It is, though, not clear who Macquarie is conducting the current auction for. One insider said the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund (MEIF) 2 is definitely not selling its stake in the water company. MEIF 2 owns around 22pc Thames Water. However, bankers thought it likely that Macquarie may be selling a stake for MEIF, the investment group's original European infrastructure fund, as the Australian company is said to be trying to raise a new fund and is keen to show investors it has made decent returns from MEIF's investment in Thames Water. Macquarie declined to comment. Utilities

Mafia boss 'eaten by pigs'
Mafia boss Francesco Raccosta has been 'eaten by pigs' according to Italian police investigating mobster crime
11:40AM GMT 29 Nov 2013
The murder of Francesco Raccosta was allegedly led by Simone Pepe, 24, a rival gangster, who was arrested this week. He described the killing in chilling terms to a friend in a telephone conversation that was intercepted by police. “It was satisfying to hear him scream...Mamma mia, how he squealed, but I couldn’t give a s---. Someone said a few bits of him remained at the end of it all, but I couldn’t see anything, for me nothing remained at all. I said, wow, how a pig can eat!”
Pepe is suspected of having carried out at least three other murders, including that of Vincenzo Raccosta, the father of Francesco Raccosta. The murders were allegedly committed as revenge for the death of mafia boss Domenico Bonarrigo, 45, on March 3 2012. Related Articles

The Congo: Gorillas in the wild

There are countries you have to visit in spite of the difficulties of doing so. The Republic of Congo is one of them. You go not to visit its capital, Brazzaville - a hilly, muddy mass of traffic, mud and cheerily-painted shacks - or to stay in one of its grim city hotels, with their unlockable doors and clientele of thick-necked men in camouflage. You fly, via France or Johannesburg, then on in a small plane into the jungle, because the country has one of the biggest populations of western lowland gorillas in the world, as David Attenborough points out in his illuminating BBC series on Africa, and given the rate at which they are being killed if you don’t see them soon, you might never see them at all. Surprisingly, though, once you have seen them, you realise that, while these intelligent, man-like creatures are extraordinary to see, they are not necessarily the highlight of the trip. Equally impressive are the conservationists dedicated to saving the gorillas. Then there is the environment in which they work. It is while walking and kayaking through the untouched Congo Basin, with parrots squawking, chimpanzees screeching, orchids lighting up the muggy greenery with vibrant pink hues, that you’re reminded of the real treat: of the privilege, in our crowded planet, of exploring such a beautiful, ancient virgin space. In a continent as densely populated as Africa, uninhabited spots are rare. But the Republic of Congo has only 4 million inhabitants - and most of them avoid living in its equatorial forest. During a two-hour flight in a Cessna from Brazzaville to Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the north-west, I saw an occasional road and open-cast mine; otherwise, there was no sign of man. All that lay below was grassland, trees and dark snakes of water cutting through an enormous tract of virgin earth. A village in Brazzaville
A handful of people choose to live here, including the primatologist Dr Magda Bermejo and her husband, German Illera. It doesn’t seem a natural home for a former child psychologist from Madrid. The 5,250 square miles of ancient tropical forest contain only a handful of villages, as well as about 430 species of birds, 100 varieties of mammals, 11 diurnal primates - and (I can verify with pictures, taken in my bedroom) some seriously big spiders.

Trip of a Lifetime: Serengeti's great migration
01 Dec 2012
The rain can be relentless. And the air is often so thick with flying creatures that wearing a netted hat is the only way to keep them out of your ears and eyes. But for Magda, the world’s foremost authority on western lowland gorillas, none of this matters - because the region is primate heaven. About 60,000 lowland gorillas are thought to survive, compared with only about 800 mountain gorillas, but gorilla meat is, disturbingly, still popular among tribes in central Africa - hence the lowland species’ listing as highly endangered. Magda was living in this area during an outbreak of ebola in 2003, when about 200 people died of the disease, alongside 500 great apes. In the past the villagers had revered the apes, celebrating them in dance and myth. But during the ebola outbreak the creatures became associated with the disease (many of those who had died had eaten smoked ape or bat or had come into contact with a contaminated beast or person). It soon became apparent to the primatologists that if the creatures were to be protected in the long term the local people had to benefit from the great apes, rather than see them as a threat. So they set to work. Fifteen years later, they have habituated two groups of gorillas in the forest, and with the aid of a wealthy German philanthropist, Sabine Plattner, and a partnership with the tour operator Wilderness Safaris, have built two extremely comfortable camps so that tourists can see gorillas in the wild, local people have jobs and opportunities to be educated, and proceeds are filtered into the community. The untouched Congo Basin
The gorilla camps are not just the first luxury camps in the area, but in the whole of central Africa. If the project is a success, Magda hopes to roll it out to other countries. “If we are going to save gorillas, we have to act fast,” she says. “So it has to work. People have to come.”
Because of the logistics of running camps so far from civilisation, Wilderness Safaris has devised set six-night itineraries for visitors. Three nights are spent at Lango Camp, beside a saline pan at which forest creatures graze, and three at Ngaga Camp in a private concession outside the park, where the gorillas live. Just landing in a tiny forest clearing at M’boko airstrip was an experience – particularly from turbulent, lightning-lit equatorial skies. Thankfully, waiting on the strip was a Land Cruiser (one of only five cars we would see on Odzala’s roads in an week) and our French guide, the charming 22-year-old Karl Diakite. He told us: “You’re going to love Congo – honestly, there’s a surprise round every corner.”
So there was: just round the corner from the airstrip, in fact, where grazing were three creatures every bit as endangered as gorillas: forest elephants. As we stopped 100ft from a big male, we could clearly spot the difference between him and his more prolific savannah cousin: his smaller body, rounder forehead and ears, and long, thin, almost-straight tusks. That sighting was lucky; in six days, exploring by foot, boat and vehicle, although we saw signs of the endangered elephants several times, we saw the creatures again only once. But then, in forest this ancient and dense, that isn’t surprising. It’s like a fantastical set from The Jungle Book, with 150ft trees the width of double-decker buses; thick lianas; dense undergrowth coloured by wild orchids and pink bell-shaped blooms; weird prickly and armoured fruits; alien-looking fungi; and huge kaleidoscopes of butterflies, some the size of swallows. It was on the edge of this thick forest, beside a grassy saltpan, that Lango Camp was built on raised wooden platforms. The camp managers, Sandra Schönbächler and Fraser Gear, are both genial hosts and real bush-lovers. Sandra ran her own hotel in Madagascar for 12 years and Fraser is one of the continent’s leading guides and ornithologists. With Karl, they helped cut the roads and built the two camps, living in hammocks and sometimes spending days pulling overturned trucks from mud. The three of them also trained the local staff, few of whom had seen a knife or fork, never mind poured a gin-and-tonic. From the warmth of my netted double bed, beneath a down duvet, it seemed inconceivable that this camp had not been there six months before. The six thatch-walled bandas were cosy and comfortable, with flushing WCs, hot showers, a veranda with views, and even a stylish fabric-converted trunk in which to hang clothes. The food, cooked by a charismatic French chef, was delicious, from herby soups and rare fillet to extremely boozy desserts. The staff were shy, French-speaking (and English-learning) and super-sweet. When we ventured out in the morning, though, after a breakfast overlooking the pans, it was into forest that been there for thousands of years: a green, dripping environment rich with scents (sulphur mixed with wild jasmine), noises (chimps in the distance, screeching monkeys above), exotic plants – and lots of mud: black, squelchy stuff that occasionally sucked me down, to my knees. It was very, very wild. Grey parrots in the Congo
But, as the always-positive Karl kept reminding me, a safari into the Congo is not for sissies; it’s about adventure – of which there is plenty there. On our first morning, we walked right up to a herd of red forest buffalo, and were overtaken by a gambolling spotted hyena. We hiked rangers’ forest paths over which chattering colobus, putty-nosed and blue-moustached monkeys swung overhead. We canoed on a fast-flowing tributary of the Congo: drifting silently in wonder as kingfishers dived at lizards, fish-eagles called, and big flocks of grey parrots and green pigeons squawked overhead. And at the end of each day, we swapped adventure-tales round the fire under shooting stars (or lightning) before frogmarching Karl to our rooms to check for spiders. In wilderness such as this, explained the 28-year-old, Swiss-born Etienne Rochat, our guide at the next camp, Ngaga, four hours’ drive away, you cannot worry about things that bite and crawl. After all, when you’ve come all this way to see gorillas in the wild, you shouldn’t let yourself be distracted by 54 insect bites on your legs (yes, I counted). Ngaga Camp is where Magda is based, and it is in these forests that she has habituated two gorilla groups to her presence and, more recently, to the presence of an additional four tourists a day. Because gorillas are constantly hunting for fruit, they can be up to 10 miles away – which can mean a long forest hike. Our muscles, thankfully, were spared. Just an hour after we had set off into the hilly forests, our tracker, Gabin Okele, spotted signs: hand-prints on a path and broken marantaceae (the gorillas’ favourite leafy snack). Putting on surgical masks (to reduce the chances of our transmitting human diseases), we crept behind Okele as he hacked at the undergrowth, and then followed the line of his pointing figure. There, about 30ft ahead, up a tree, were two gorillas. Hidden in the undergrowth, we could see the fur of another two. Farther back, we could hear a loud grunting: the silverback. And hanging from a branch 20ft away was a one-year-old, who couldn’t resist the opportunity to show off, and swing and chest-thump like his parent, to the sounds of clicking cameras. For an hour (the maximum time permitted a day) we silently surveyed these creatures, as they shimmied up tree-trunks, swung from branches and watched us curiously. It is this eye-to-eye contact that makes this wildlife sighting so special. A gorilla doesn’t look at you in the way a lion or elephant does, but rather as a concerned or puzzled person would. Watching them, with their remarkably human-like hands, eyes and facial gestures, was rather like watching furry versions of ourselves – and, unexpectedly, quite an emotional experience. The creatures’ behaviour, and their similarities to humans’, was partly what attracted Magda to study them. Over drinks on our last night, Magda told us a little about her life and research, and by dinner I was convinced that, if anyone could educate and enrich the local community while protecting gorillas, it was this Dian Fossey of the Congo. In fact, although seeing wild gorillas was an unforgettable experience, meeting Magda was the highlight of the trip. Her project, with the backing and foresight of the philanthropist Sabine Plattner, is among the most challenging in Africa – politically, logistically and culturally. To visit a place like this is tough enough; to live in it takes enormous patience, courage and conviction, which Magda clearly has in abundance. She and her partners have certainly created camps and experiences unlike any other. When you come back you can say that you have walked, driven and kayaked the Congo, killed a monster spider, been stared out by a gorilla and talked to an ebola survivor. And I would do it all again. In spite of the hefty price tag - and with better wet-weather gear. My feet are still drying out… Essential details
Aardvark Safaris (01578 760222; aardvarksafaris.co.uk) offers a six-night Congo trip from £4,450 per person sharing, with three days at Lango Camp and three days at Ngaga Camp. The price includes internal flights, meals, drinks, laundry, activities and gorilla trekking. International flights cost extra. In Africa (BBC One, 9pm tonight Wednesday), David Attenborough reaches the halfway point on his journey through the continent and looks at the diverse creatures of the Congo rainforest.

The week in travel: June 25-29, 2012
An enterprising London taxi driver turned his black cab into overnight accommodation, in a bid to cash in on the Olympics. It has been kitted with a “memory foam” mattress, pillow and duvet – complete with official Olympic pillow case and bed spread – a bedside lamp, “curtains” and a Paddington Bear teddy. There is also a solar-powered fridge, a radio and an iPad, while camping chairs and a portable table are available on request. The taxi can be booked through the home rental website Wimdu.co.uk
