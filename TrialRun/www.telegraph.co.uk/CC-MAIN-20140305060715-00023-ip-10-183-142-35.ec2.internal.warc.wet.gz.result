Real Madrid v Manchester United: all of their past meetings have been a history of entertainment
Two of football's grand old clubs will meet in the second leg of their last 16 of the Champions League at Old Trafford on Tuesday night with the tie evenly poised following the 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabéu last month. Here, Telegraph Sport casts its eyes over their previous meetings - when there has rarely been a dull moment.

1957 European Cup semi-final
First leg: April 11, 1957: Real Madrid 3 Manchester United 1
Second leg: April 24, 1957: Manchester United 2 Real Madrid 2 In the second year of the tournament's existence United came up against the reigning champions from Madrid at the semi-final stage. A United side containing the likes of Bobby Charlton and Duncan Edwards could still not match the glory of the Real side of Alfredo di Stefano, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento. The Spaniards went on to retain the title of champions of Europe with victory over Fiorentina in the final, and would win the competition for the first five editions. Related Articles

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1968 European Cup semi-final
First leg: April 24, 1968: Manchester United 1 Real Madrid 0
Second leg: May 15, 1968: Real Madrid 3 Manchester United 3 Just 10 years after the Munich air disaster that robbed United of a generation of youthful talent, the two sides met again once more at the semi-final stage, with United taking a narrow lead to defend in Spain thanks to a goal from George Best. A rampant Madrid soon cancelled that out through Pirri, then took a lead with goals from Gento and Amancio Amaro. A mistake by the Real goalkeeper just before the break saw a long ball over the top find it's way to goal, while Brian Kidd distracted him. David Sadler pulled another back after the break and with nerves settling over the Madrid players and Best on fire Bill Foulkes scored the equaliser on the night that sent United through on goal difference. United went on to win the trophy, beating Benfica in the final at Wembley. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2000 Champions League quarter-final
First leg: April 4, 2000: Real Madrid 0 Manchester United 0
Second leg: April 19, 2000: Manchester United 2 Real Madrid 3 After a creditable draw over in Madrid, holders United, brought the Spaniards to Old Trafford full of confidence. Disaster struck in the first half when Roy Keane put through his own net. It got worse straight after the break. With United pressing, a break launched by Steve McManaman ended with Raul scoring a typically clinical goal to put the visitors 2-0 up. Raul added another soon after, with the help of some outrageous skill from Fernando Redondo to set it up. United didn't lay down, with David Beckham scoring a terrific individual goal and Scholes pulling one back late on from he penalty spot, but it was too little too late and real were well worth the win. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2003 Champions League quarter-final
First leg: April 8, 2003: Real Madrid 3 Manchester United 1
Second leg: April 23, 2003: Manchester United 4 Real Madrid 3 Ronaldo – the original from Brazil – earned a standing ovation from all at Old Trafford when his virtuoso display did for a spirited United in one of the classic Champions League matches. With Real 3-1 up from the first leg, United had no option but to go all out on attack, end-to-end doesn't come close to capturing the pace of the match. Ronaldo and Ruud van Nistelrooy traded first-half goals, before the magical Brazilian scored twice more after the interval. Most teams would have known they were beaten, but United just pushed forward even more in search of a miracle. An Ivan Helguera own goal and two late strikes from substitute Beckham gave United pride and victory on the night but it was Real who progressed at the end of a breathless encounter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2013 Champions League last 16
First leg: Feb 13, 2013: Real Madrid 1 Manchester United 1
With all of the pre-match talk surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo it was, perhaps, inevitable that the Portuguese produced a moment of magic that past Santiago Bernabéu greats such as Alfredo Di Stéfano or Ferenc Puskas would have been proud of.
After going a goal down to the English - against the run of play - after Danny Welbeck had headed the visitors into the lead, the nine-time European Cup winners rallied.
On the half-hour mark Ronaldo appeared to hang in the air before directing Ángel di María's cross goalwards. David De Gea, the former Atlético Madrid goalkeeper, produced his greatest display in a United shirt after blocking shot-after-shot out to keep his side in the evenly poised tie.
