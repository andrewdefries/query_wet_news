Italian lighthouses auctioned off to tackle public debt pile
They stand on imposing headlands with spectacular views of isolated bays and white sandy beaches, some of the most picturesque in the Mediterranean.

Comments
But now, as Italy tries to chip away at its mountainous public debt and assuage the concerns of international markets, more than a dozen lighthouses around the coast of Sardinia are to be leased out as boutique hotels, quirky bed and breakfasts, galleries and museums.
The plan comes as the six-month-old technocrat government of Mario Monti, the prime minister, forges ahead with an unpopular programme of tax hikes, labour and pension reforms and other much-needed measures to tackle the country's €1.9 trillion (£1.5 trillion) public debt, the highest in Europe.
The lighthouses are being put up for lease by Sardinia's autonomous government, which says it can no longer afford the cost of maintaining the historic structures, let alone restoring them. The cost of leasing them is not yet known – the Sardinian authorities say they will be auctioned off at "market rates" in the coming weeks.
The collection of 15 lighthouses and semaphore stations overlook secluded coves in some of Sardinia's most popular tourist spots, including the famed Costa Smeralda, or Emerald Coast, and the Maddalena archipelago of islands in the north-east, which boast turquoise waters and white sand beaches reminiscent of the South Pacific.
One of the lighthouses, on the island of Razzoli, was built in 1845 but has been inactive since 1965 – made redundant, like all the rest, by modern replacements and ships' greater reliance on satellite navigation.

The 40ft-tall structure, which includes a stone keeper's house, can only be reached by boat.
The lighthouse on the nearby island of Santa Maria was built in 1913 and has a colourful history – its lantern used to be kept alight by Benedictine monks from a nearby monastery, which is now in ruins. It too is accessible only by boat.
"Some are in good condition and need just a little investment, while others are in a really bad state and would need a couple of million euros of refurbishment," said Alessio Satta, the executive director of Sardinia's Agency for Coastal Conservation, which is in charge of the scheme.
"They have been inaccessible to the public for ages because they were owned and run by the coast guard or the navy."
Inspiration for the project comes from a lighthouse in southern Sardinia which has been converted into a five-star luxury retreat. It is so far Italy's only lighthouse hotel.
The Capo Spartivento lighthouse, 30 miles from the regional capital of Cagliari, sits on an isolated promontory and is accessible only by a private dirt road.
Built in 1856 by the Italian navy, it is now one of the country's most exclusive resorts, with a suite during the summer season costing €1,000 a night.
It took businessman Alessio Raggio, 42, seven years to negotiate the lease, restore the building and convert it into a hotel.
The conversion of the historic building cost €3m. Mr Raggio has a 38-year lease on the property and pays rent of €3,000 a month to the regional government.
"Rebuilding a light house is not easy – especially one like this. It's on top of a 300ft cliff so it gets hit by a lot of wind, especially in the winter.
"Fortunately it was strongly built, with stones from the local area, and the main building was in good condition. You have to be a little bit crazy to take on a job like this, but it was worth it – we are fully booked this summer," he said.
Many of the lighthouses on the for-lease list offer a similarly challenging prospect for developers.
The lighthouse at Capo d'Orso (Bear Cape), near the town of Palau, is a typical case. Located on the very tip of the cape, it is accessible only by boat, or via a tough scramble up steep slopes overgrown with coastal scrub.
On the west coast of Sardinia, a lighthouse at Capo Mannu overlooks a good surfing beach, but the tower is in poor condition and will need a lot of structural work.
Private developers would be granted leases of at least 30 years in return for restoring the buildings.
While Capo Spartivento's high prices mean it is strictly for the well-heeled, the Sardinian authorities are envisaging the lighthouses under lease being converted into more modestly priced bed and breakfasts and boutique accommodation.
"We want to create places that can be visited by everybody. You'd pay between €100 and €150 a night," said Mr Satta of the coastal conservation agency. "We don't want to create fortresses for the rich."

Hubble Space Telescope: the first 20 years in pictures
The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990. To celebrate its 20th anniversary, NASA have released this image of chaotic activity atop a three-light-year-tall pillar of gas and dust that is being eaten away by the brilliant light from nearby bright stars. The pillar is also being assaulted from within, as infant stars buried inside it fire off jets of gas that can be seen streaming from towering peaks. This turbulent cosmic pinnacle lies within a tempestuous stellar nursery called the Carina Nebula, located 7,500 light-years away in the southern constellation Carina

Glasgow's Ryan Wilson excited about facing Edinburgh in 1872 Cup
Ryan Wilson admits that his two-year sojourn in Scotland has had no obvious effect on his home counties accent, but the No 8 has gone completely native as far as his passion for the 1872 Cup is concerned.

Comments
That much was obvious in his performance in the first leg of the annual inter-city clash at Scotstoun last weekend, as Wilson put in a conspicuously energetic display in Glasgow’s back row as they took a 23-14 lead in the contest.
As a consequence of that result, Edinburgh will have to win by at least 10 points at Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon if they are to reclaim the trophy that has been in Glasgow hands for the past three seasons. They will also have to subdue Wilson, something they clearly failed to do a week ago.
“Last Friday night was fantastic,” beamed the 23-year-old forward. “It was good to get the win, and it will be exactly the same going over to Murrayfield. They'll want to put on a big show over there and we will want to disrupt their party.”
Wilson will take his customary place in a Glasgow back row which has been rearranged to accommodate the return of Josh Strauss from his wedding in South Africa. Strauss has been chosen on the blindside flank, with Rob Harley moved across to do a shift on the openside.
Strauss, signed from the Golden Lions two months ago, might have been expected to make the No.8 position his own, but Wilson has raised his game since the newcomer’s arrival. Competition for places has become a critical part of the Scotland pro team strategy this season, and Wilson believes the policy is paying off.

Wilson said: “You see throughout the squad the strength and depth is fantastic. Having Straussy here is brilliant. He is a great rugby player, so strong, and I'm chuffed that we will be playing together this weekend.
“I've come on as a sub alongside him, but it will be good to start with him. Josh is a good player; he pushes me and I push him, which is a good way to be in a rugby club.”
Wilson was beginning to look like an international prospect towards the end of last season, but a knee injury put paid to that possibility. In that regard, the national trial dimension of the Glasgow - Edinburgh clashes has a particular importance for the former Moseley player.
“I feel like I'm learning more and more and feel I am playing quite well at the moment,” he expkained. “It's nice to get back-to-back games especially in the Edinburgh derbies. It didn't happen for me last year so to be starting both of them this season is a great opportunity for me, especially with selectors watching for Scotland.
“I like the way we're playing. Counter-attack rugby suits my game. I'm quite a lightweight forward and I love the running game. My own game is definitely coming back on, which is nice.”
Wilson’s direct opponent at Murrayfield will be Netani Talei, who missed last weekend’s clash at Scotstoun. At his best, the Fijian is an outstanding and powerful ball carrier, but Wilson, who qualifies for Scotland through his Lanarkshire-born mother, made the mischievous suggestion that those Pacific Island roots might count against Talei this weekend.
Wilson said: “He will be wanting to get into us. But he doesn't have the Scottish side to him, so maybe this game means less to him. I'm not sure.”
Edinburgh have confirmed that Lewis Niven will cover the tighthead prop position from the bench, Willem Nel having failed to recover from the hamstring strain he picked up in the first match.
