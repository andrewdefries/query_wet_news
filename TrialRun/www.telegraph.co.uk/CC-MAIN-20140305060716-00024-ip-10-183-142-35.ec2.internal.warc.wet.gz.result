Lucia di Lammermoor, Opera Holland Park, review

Comments
A cracked slate wall and some interlocking panels of steel-meshed fencing form the austere setting of Olivia Fuchs’ production of Donizetti’s masterly melodrama. But what was it trying to tell us exactly? The costuming is firmly illustrative of the 1880s, but the chorus has been supplied with incongruously modern jiving choreography. Characterisation, meanwhile, is rather bland: there’s a hint that Enrico has unspeakable thoughts about his kid sister, but Lucia herself seems very prim and buttoned-up, and not at all the sort of dreamily sensitive girl pushed to the brink of insanity, who would end up stabbing her horrible husband on their wedding night.
My theory is that Fuchs has been wrongfooted by David Alden’s superb version at English National Opera. Alden’s excavation of the text’s implications and creation of a richly brooding and menacing atmosphere has left her interpretation with nowhere to go. What’s she’s done isn’t bad by any means, but it doesn’t have any obvious point or focus.
Stuart Stratford’s conducting of the City of London Sinfonia is much more purposeful DASH sometimes rumbustious to a fault, but always alive and energized. Every note of the score, as far I could determine, was included, and the “authentic” glass harmonica obbligato (played beautifully by Philipp-Alexander Maguerre) replaced the “traditional” flute in the mad scene.
Russian soprano Elvira Fatykhova made her British debut in the title-role. Bravely soldiering on through outbursts of ambient noise from passing aircraft and the chanting of what sounded like a rally of renegade Girl Guides, she proved herself a useful singer.
The voice is small but firm, her pitching accurate and her technique fluent, if hard and shrill of tone at the very top. Appropriately petite of build, she moves well. I just wish she had projected more of the girl’s vulnerability and had allowed her imagination to play over the music: her performance was admirable, but a tad mechanical and uninvolving.

Her Edgardo was an Australian tenor Aldo di Toro, now based in Italy.
Resonant and robust of voice, with a strong stage presence, he met the challenge of his two big scenes in Act 3 with honour. David Stephenson’s Enrico had a sinister, cadaverous edge that Fuchs’ could have made more of; the remainder of the cast was on the weak side. The net result was a brisk, forthright Lucia short of Scotch mist, Gothic horror and romantic intensity.

After Dry January I’m raising a glass or two to February
Avoiding alcohol as part of the Dry January campaign was ago, but hard lessons have been learnt about drinking too much Peter Oborne, who gave up drinking as part of Alcohol Concern's Dry January campaign, said: 'It was agony’

I knew Dry January would be hard. But I had not realised quite how hard. It was agony! Arriving home in the evening and pouring myself a mineral water. Going to a party where my hostess tries to ply me with alcoholic drink – and demanding orange juice instead. Dropping into the pub and ordering a coke.
Since I first announced my intention to give up drink for a month in these pages, the time has crawled by. I haven’t just counted the hours, I’ve counted the minutes. I’ve never known a month last so long. At times I felt like I was in prison, being tormented by a sadistic jailer. Thank God for February.
I lapsed on four or five occasions, the first in the first week, most recently over Sunday lunch with the parish council chairman. He served perfectly cooked roast beef. Roast beef needs claret. I’d lapsed the previous evening as well, when friends came to dinner.
On that occasion my reasoning was as follows: I must be a warm and generous host. This isn’t easy if I’m drinking mineral water. Jesus Christ understood this, otherwise he wouldn’t have turned water into wine at the wedding at Cana. (If you read the scriptures carefully, and do the sums, he liberated about seven barrels, equal to 20 gallons.) I convinced myself, I was thinking of others – as He was. My drinking became an altruistic act, to make my guests happy.

Dry January – is abstinence from alcohol a health kick or a life sentence?
02 Jan 2013
When I tell people that I’ve lapsed five times they say: “You haven’t given up at all.”
This shows a failure of basic understanding. There are 31 days in January. On approximately 26 of them I did not have a drink. Each of these was a day of hardship, mortification and self-denial.
On the upside Dry January left me feeling far more healthy than I have for years. My complexion improved. I slept through the night. My head felt razor sharp in the morning. Those pains in the lower back went. I also lost a remarkable amount of weight.
Staying sober, I started to grasp how boorish and uninteresting even quite sophisticated people become after they’ve had a few drinks. I used to think of alcohol as an aid to conversation; in fact it stands in its way. This is a point grasped by Stalin, who used to love to get his henchmen drunk at banquets. Those in the know would try to bribe the waiters to fill their vodka glasses with water. Alert to these tricks, the Russian dictator would insist on filling glasses himself, forcing victims to join him in a toast. I also managed to get far more work done. Drinking takes up more time than one imagines. It’s not just the hours you spend drinking, but the recovery period. At the end of it all, I’ve had no choice but to admit that I’m an addict. It’s not that I need a drink to get through an average day. I need several. And this slavish dependency has got to end.
From now on, I will endeavour not to return to my previous way of life, which involved a large scotch followed by half a bottle of red wine every evening. I’m going to cut out drinking on my own. I will drink as much as ever with friends in the pub, or over dinner, or at lunch. But alcohol will no longer be something that’s always there. Every week there are going to be three days when I don’t have a drink. This might be harder than I think. But I have been shocked by how difficult I found it giving up booze. Better to cut down now than have to give up altogether later. That would be terrible.
