Pay head teachers to expand top schools, ministers told
Head teachers of top schools should receive “substantial” bonuses to take on additional pupils amid fears too many children are being rejected from their first-choice comprehensive, according to Government research. The study commissioned by the Department for Education said incentives were needed to get good schools to expand. Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor

Comments
Payments worth tens of thousands of pounds should be made to heads of high-performing schools who oversee a sustained increase in pupil numbers without harming exam results, it was claimed. Researchers said cash bonuses were needed to “incentivise school expansion” and ensure head teachers are rewarded for the extra stress and workload associated with taking more pupils. The recommendation was made as the study concluded that the best schools had failed to expand over the last decade, denying many parents places at their preferred secondary school. This year, almost 75,000 children in England – more than one-in-seven – were rejected from their first-choice secondary. According to researchers, the top-performing schools “have grown barely faster than other schools” in the last 10 years. Related Articles

The incentives for schools to expand were “weak at best”, with fears that some of the best teachers would see their workload soar and headline exam results drop. The study – commissioned by the Department for Education – recommended reforming school funding and head teacher pay “so that schools reap financial rewards from expansion”, including additional cash for buildings and refurbishments. It added: “Head teachers of high-performing schools successfully overseeing a capacity expansion for five years would receive a substantial one-off bonus, centrally paid by the [Education Funding Agency]. “We would want to define ‘successfully’ to mean no substantial decline in performance.”
Researchers from the University of London’s Institute of Education and Bristol University analysed secondary school admissions between 2001 and 2011. The study revealed that schools had been more likely to cut their numbers than increase capacity over the last decade. It found no evidence to suggest that schools which took on more children did so because of decent exam results, insisting that expansion was often driven by changes in the local pupil population. The study failed to identify the size of bonuses needed to tempt head teachers into expanding. But it found that there was already an “association between gross pay and school size”, with heads receiving around £3,000 more per year for every additional 150 pupils admitted. It said this “existing size premium” was unlikely to be enough to provide a proper incentive for heads to grow their school, suggesting a far bigger bonus pot may be needed. Last night, the DfE insisted that school funding was already being overhauled to ensure schools with the largest numbers of pupils receive more money. The Government’s new academy schools also have more freedom to pay head teachers bigger salaries. A National Audit Office report last week found that one-in-10 academy principals were already paid more than the maximum normally allowed for their region – typically £105,000 across England, rising to £112,000 in inner-London. "The reformed school funding system being introduced from 2013-14 will ensure that the vast majority of funding follows pupil numbers, so that schools will be rewarded directly in cash terms for taking extra pupils," the DfE said.

Two-year-old with same IQ as Einstein
Oscar Wrigley, a two-year-old with the same IQ as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has become the youngest boy in Britain to be accepted into Mensa.
By Chris Irvine
8:00AM BST 10 Oct 2009
Follow Assessors at the Gifted Children's Information Centre in Solihull said Oscar, with an IQ of at least 160, is one of the brightest children they have every come across. He has been ranked in the 99.99th percentile of the population and has been ranked off the scale as the Stanford-Binet test cannot measure higher than 160. Oscar's father Joe, 29, an IT specialist from Reading in Berkshire, said: "Oscar was recently telling my wife about the reproductive cycle of penguins. "He is always asking questions. Every parent likes to think their child was special but we knew there was something particularly remarkable about Oscar. "I'm fully expecting the day to come when he turns around and tells me I'm an idiot."

Mother Hannah, 26, told The Daily Mail: "He amazes everyone. We knew at 12 weeks he was extremely bright. He was unusually alert."
Mrs Wrigley, a housewife, added: "His vocabulary is amazing. He's able to construct complex sentences. "The other day he said to me, 'Mummy, sausages are like a party in my mouth'."
Dr Peter Congdon, who assessed Oscar, said he was a "child of very superior intelligence". "His abilities fall well within the range sometimes referred to as intellectually gifted. He demonstrated outstanding ability," he said. John Stevenage, Mensa's Chief Executive confirmed Oscar had been accepted aged two years, five months and 11 days. "Oscar shows great potential. Converting that potential to achievement is the challenge for his parents and we are delighted that they have chosen to join the Mensa network for support", he said. The youngest British child to join Mensa is Elise Tan Roberts, from Edmonton, North London, at two years, four months and 14 days, with an IQ of 156. How about that?

The entire house measures 657 sq ft. That’s roughly the size of a large double garage. Its single bedroom is described as a “mezzanine”, perhaps because the first floor is rather snug. On the other hand, there is off-street parking and a patio garden.

A nervousness crept in for the final 20 minutes, and while some slightly erratic defending may have been punished by a better team they did enough to see the game out, eventually in real style. Milan were disappointing, unable to muster the discipline and steel to defend their handsome first leg lead and unwilling to really go for the game until after the introduction of Robinho and Muntari. Thanks for your company, I'll talk to you again soon. FULL TIME
90+2 min GOAL!! Barcelona 4 Milan 0 (Alba)
A disgusting Milan free kick was entirely to blame for. Milan poured everyone forward for a set piece just past the halfway line. Robinho then senselessly played it short for Muntari, who seemingly wasn't expected it. Barca sieze on it and break to devastating effect, finding Alba bursting up the left flank. He finishes neatly into the bottom corner, and Barca are in the last eight. 90+1 min We're into three minutes of added time. 88 min Milan looking like first-half Barca. But here's Adriano, doing an effective job in the four minutes he's been on, intercepting and starting a Barca break which brings about a corner from a deflected Alves cross. 85 min Barca retreating more and more, Milan suddenly looking very ominous indeed. Flowing move finds Abate on the right, then Milan get it over to Constand on the other side. Adriano eventually clears for a throw. Guy Perry gets us back on the right track during this increasingly tense game: A wave of simmering outrage at bonkers footballing barnets is slowly but surely crossing the continent like a wintry snowstorm of discontent. Snip snip snip. Time for manly short back and sides. Gentlemen footballers, I implore you….
84 min Adriano on for Pedro in what critics are calling Barcelona's definitive last substitution of this football match. 83 min Another huge block for Barcelona, with Alba doing tremendously to stay aware of Robinho and slide in as he's found with a ball from Milan's left. Corner, which Valdes claims. 82 min Crucial tackle by Pique, who stops a galloping Muntari from getting into the box after nice hold-up play by Robinho. It's suddenly on a knife edge. Milan yet to manufacture a clear chance in this half, but there's a sense they'll get one in these last 10 minutes. 80 min The rhythm's gone from the game and that's got to be a worry for Barcelona. Another goal is the only guarantee of a pleasant conclusion to this game for the Nou Camp crowd. 78 min Puyol on for Mascherano on for Mascherano in what must, by anyone's estimations, but Barcelona's second substitution. 77 min Here are Mexes and Abiatti having a sponsored hands-on-hips posing competition in response to their team's current predicament: 75 min Alexis Sanchez coming on for David Villa for Barcelona. Flamini is removed for Milan, with Bojan Krkic taking his place. 74 min Messi does a favour for Robinho and puts it straight into the wall. 73 min Zapata has a little tug of Messi's shirt about 25 yards from goal. That's a Barcelona free kick. The referee agrees. Robinho seemingly pleading with Messi and Xavi as they prepare to take it. 70 min Who says the Champions League doesn't matter? Well, no-one. But still, look how happy David Villa is that he's scored: 68 min A better spell for Milan, with the ball canoning around in the box after more good work from Abate on the right. Flamini with a dangerous flick towards goal but there was a foul in the build-up. A timely reminder that Milan are only a goal away from a winning aggregate score. 66 min Abate beats Alba in a foot race and delivers a promising cross from the left. Unfortunately Mario Balotelli is cup-tied, Zlatan Ibrahimovic plays for PSG now and there's no-one there to get on the end of it. A fair point from your friend and mine Robert Dobson: The more I watch this the more remarkable chelsea's performance from two nil down with ten men looks.
64 min Messi curls a central free kick towards the far post. Busquets stabs it back across goal but Abiatti catches the ball. 62 min Barca free kick wide on the right. Messi takes, Muntari heads back to him, and Messi puts it into the box again. Busquets kicks some air instead of the ball and Milan can clear. Here's Marc Melander, laudably keeping the important discussion of haircuts ticking over: El Shaarawy probably paid 200 Euro for that abomination on his head. Even Jason Lee would have been mortified. Messi's barnet is sponsored by Lego of course. Allegedly. 60 min Milan pick at the scab this match has become for them with a couple of substitutes. Muntari and Robinho coming on. Mexes and Ambrosini off. 57 min Andy Townsend has just tried some unwise ultrabants about a Spanish commentator who "tried to aim a kiss at him" after Barca's third goal. "I'm trying to move away from him," says Townsend. Oh ho, ho ho, homophobia. 55 min GOAL!! Barcelona 3 Milan 0 (Villa)
Mexes misplaces a pass, Mascherano wins it and feeds Iniesta on the edge of the "D". He targets Villa on the right-hand side of the box, Contant, craving an interception, can't quite make it and Villa holds his nerve to curl an impeccable finish into the top left. 54 min Mexes booked for a late challenge on Messi. Milan have resorted to the tried and tested method of fouling Messi to stop him. It's certainly working this half, Barcelona have been less fluent thus far. 52 min Niang pings in a corner from the right-hand side. Boateng tries to volley it in from Scholes range. It's wide, of course. Guy Perry has been in touch on the subject of my third favourite thing in football: haircuts: Thom, glancing at Milan players I notice revolting and unimpressive haircuts all round. For that alone, Barcelona deserve a victory.
50 min Here's Messi celebrating his entirely unfair (apparently) second goal: 48 min Messi, seemingly onside this time, gets on the ball 30 yards out and drifts away from the Milan defence, taking on a shot from the left-hand side of the area. Not a difficult save for Abiatti. 47 min Apparently Lionel Messi's second goal was clearly offside. I'll be honest, I did not notice this. I was too busy orchestrating one of those media love-fests you've heard so much about. And I left my desk for the duration of half time to talk to my grandmother. She's fine, thanks for asking. She doesn't work here. I have a phone. 46 min Here comes a second half, Barcelona get it started with one of their famous intricate short-range two-pass moves. 20.32 It feels like a case of how many for Barca. Milan have had a few chances, mind. El Shaarawy should have done better twice and Niang missed the best opportunity of the game for either side. But Barcelona have been close to their best, and Milan have yet to find a way for stop them for any longer than five minutes at a time. It's extremely watchable, and I'll carry on doing just that in 15 minutes. I'll write some stuff too, if you'd like. HALF TIME
45 min In this evening's other game Galatasaray are 2-1 up against Schalke in Germany, Didier Drogba's second team of the season lead 3-2 on aggregate. 42 min Pedro booked for some delicious afters on Flamini after an over-exuberant tackle. He will now miss the quarter final, SHOULD Barcelona make it. Stop giggling at the back. 40 min GOAL!! Barcelona 2 Milan 0 (Messi)
Gah, Milan punished immediately and Barcelona are on level terms. Ambrosini ridiculously tries to take it past Iniesta in Milan's own half. No chance. He finds Messi just outside the box who works it onto his left foot. He shoots through Mexes' legs and Abiatti can't quite reach it. 39 min AC Milan hit the post! Big punt upfield catches Mascherano unawares, bouncing over him and allowing Niang to run onto it. He's just got Valdes to beat, and does, and is unfortunate to see his shot come back off the woodwork. 38 min Alves again not looking giantically composed with his distribution. Messi played him in on the right, with Pedro clearly in plenty of space on the other flank. Alez looked for him a little too late and got the pass wrong. Barcelona have a corner, which comes to nothing. Andrew Robinson SPITS on the question posed above: Get real, Barcelona are still the team everyone wants to beat, and still the best. 36 min Another disappointing shot from El-Shaarawy after Ambrosini finds him on Milan's left-hand side. He's past Pique with ease but rolls another soft attempt straight at Valdes. 34 min Here's Xavi looking happi after Barcelona's opening goal: 31 min Constant growing into the game a little for Milan. The left back's up against Dani Alves which can't be much fun at all, but after a shaky start he seems to be learning when to close down and when the drop off the Barca nominal right-back. Alves still getting the odd chance to cross, but those are yet to lead to anything too dangerous. 27 min Still nearly unbroken Barcelona possession, but the pressure from Milan is improving, with Mezes, Ambrosini and Flamini taking it in turns to come out to the man on the ball 25 yards out. Here's a .gif of the Messi goal for your perma-looping enjoyment: 25 min Barca have definitely toned down their performance to a simmer now. A couple of loose passes have effected their momentum, and Pedro heads over ineffectively from an Alves cross. Here's Clive Young in response to the question posed above: Have Barcelona peaked? Yes they have. They're like El Shaarawy's barnet; peaked and passe.
23 min This, from Matteo Bonetti, isn't far from the truth: Twitter: Matteo Bonetti - Milan look like a boxer stuck in a corner getting pounded and pounded and pounded.
21 min Milan just can't get going. Montolivo reads a free kick routine well, and intercepts but Niang is muscled off the ball moments later. Another vague shout for a penalty as Pedro goes down in the box. Less convincing this time. 19 min Milan nearly unpicked again with an Iniesta-powered passing move. Another corner, which doesn't create a chance but Barca, as is their wont, hang onto the ball. Here's Lionel Messi scoring their opening goal: 17 min Barcelons looking absolutely terrifying going forward, and varying their approach impressively. Abiatti races off his line to attempt to reach a ball over the tope. He doesn't, but he's got a defender behind him to mop up. Moments later Xavi has a dig from 25 yards and Abiatti turns it round the post for a corner. 16 min Milan corner, not amazingly dealt with by Barca with Zapata close to heading at the goal. In the end Valdes is out to claim it. 13 min Iniesta! Ferocious half-volley from the edge of the box, no-one there to close him down, and Abiatti makes an excellent save! Deflects onto the bar and Messi's there for the rebound but can only head into the side-netting from close range. Barcelona rampant here, Milan's defending needs some serious work. Whither Fabio Capello? Oh yes, that's right: in Russia. 12 min Yells from the Barca supporters for a penalty after Abate bundles over Pedro in the box. Erm... yeah, that's a penalty. Not given, as you may have gathered. 9 min Chance for El-Shaarawy! Made a decent run behind Alves and got on the ball inside the box. It's a weak, uncertain finish, easy for Valdes. 8 min Not only are Barca purring in attack, they're looking reassuringly impatient when off the ball. Mascherano slides in with feeling on Boateng as he receives a pass inside Barca's half. Out for a throw. I think that might have been the first time Milan have had it in Barca's half. 5 min GOAL!! Barcelona 1 Milan 0 (Messi)
Oh, that's wonderful. Busquets plays a diagonal ball into the feet of Messi close to the edge of the box. He and Xavi trade passes that feature such sublime control that it looks like they're somehow cheating, and Messi clips the ball casually into the top corner with Abiatti motionless. Just the 52 goals so far this season for Messi now. 3 min I guess it's folly to read too much into a crowd's mood as a barometer of a game's status, but it'll be interesting to see how long the Nou Camp remains this supportive. Fierce whistles every time Milan have the ball, raucous singing the rest of the time. It's not been difficult to get behing the home side at the moment, they've dominated possession and Milan look incapable of stringing more than two passes together. 1 min Here we go then, Milan get us going with an extremely defensive kick-off. Still, at least they got the early away kick-off under their belt. That could prove so important. 19.41 The teams are filing out. The Nou Camp looks pretty. Give it up for football, folks. 19.36 ITV's three wise(ish) men have got quite the studio position for tonight's game. Something's definitely gone a bit wrong with the camera angle, though: 19.30 Here's Scott Smith tweeting in a manner alarmingly similar to the algorithm that writes news stories in Football Manager: Twitter: Scott Smith - @thomgibbs Barcelona need to keep composed under pressure. Milan will have all the tools to frustrate them. #ChampionsLeague
19.17 The line-ups are with us. Please allow me to share them with you: Barcelona: Victor Valdes; Alves, Piqué, Mascherano, Jordi Alba; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Pedro, Messi, Villa.
Subs: Pinto, Puyol, Adriano, Fabregas, Song, Alexis Sanchez, Tello. Milan: Abbiati; Abate, Mexés, Zapata, Constant; Motolivo, Ambrosini, Flamini; Niang, Boateng, El Shaarawy.
Subs: Amelia, De Scihlio, Bonera, Muntari, Nocerino, Robinho, Bojan Krkic. Referee: Vikto Kassai (hungary) 19.00 Here's an artist's impression from that Twitter of what Barcelona can expect to encounter this evening: 18.35 Only 14 previous meetings between these two very large teams of European football. Barca have the edge, with six wins to Milan's four. There have been four draws too. You do the math. It's not hard. Milan did win the most important previous match, the 1994 European Cup final, highlights of which can be accessed by clicking right here. 18.00 Evening liveblog fans. It's quite the important evening for everyone's favourite virtuosos triangle players from Catalonia. Alright, they're winning La Liga by about a million a points, so their season is not going to be a complete disaster. But Barcelona of late have looked more fallible than any point since 2008. Three recent defeats, two to Real Madrid, the other in the first leg of this tie, have seen them unusually lax and suddenly blunted as an attacking force. There is, of course, the distressing mitigating factor of Tito Vilanova's ongoing illness to consider, so Barcelona face this extremely tough task tonight under the temporary stewardship of Jordi Roura. Milan utterly nullified Barcelona in the first leg and will hope to draw on the inspiration of their stadium-sharing buddies Inter, who defended with all the grim determination you'd expect of a Jose Mourinho team here in 2009 to protect a 3-1 first leg lead. You feel tonight is going to be a turning point. Win (by two goals or more) and Barca are right back on track and a clear favourite for this competition. Draw or lose and their era of dominance could well be coming to an end. Team news and plenty more build-up to follow. Won't you please stay tuned? Barcelona
