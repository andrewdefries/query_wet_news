Footnote
By Alexander Chancellor

OBESITY is an American national obsession. The New York Times, for example, can hardly get through a week without printing an enormous article on the subject. One published yesterday about obesity in children revealed that, in 10 years, the number of overweight children between the ages of six and 11 has almost doubled, and nobody yet has found a reliable way to stop this alarming trend.
Well, obviously eating healthier food is beneficial to children, but even this doesn't seem to help many of the little fatties get thinner. The only measure that holds out any hope of success is forcing them to take more exercise. According to one American expert in the field: "Children are so inactive as to defy belief. In a study of children between 10 and 16, we found that, for about 10 hours of the day, they're basically doing nothing." They used to play outside because being indoors was boring; but now, with television and computers at their fingertips, being inside is exciting. And television makes things even worse by constantly bombarding them with advertisements for food.
I suppose we have always known that too much television is bad for children, but it is now proved. In a seven-month experiment, one group of children who were actively discouraged from watching television gained two pounds less in weight and ended up with waists nearly an inch smaller than another group of children who had been permitted to do as they liked.

Active Child: You Are All I See, CD review
Active Child's You Are All I See sounds like James Blake without the emotional connection.
3
By Bernadette McNulty
4:18PM BST 29 Sep 2011
Follow Comments
Vagrant, £9.99
Like an American version of Londoner James Blake, LA-based vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Pat Grossi marries choirboy singing with synthesisers, harp flourishes and the kind of RnB slow-jam bass booms you hear vibrating from blacked-out cars at traffic lights. It’s all precisely mixed and impressively textured, but lacks Blake’s more raw, emotional connection. The overall effect is to please rather than stir the soul. Download this: Holding On

Punchdrunk announce major new collaboration with the National Theatre
Theatre company Punchdrunk have announced a new show based on the play Woyzeck by Buchner with a free, 'live trailer' in east London. The actor who features in Punchdrunk's trailer for The Drowned Man Photo: Simon Kane	By Daisy Bowie-Sell

Theatre company Punchdrunk, known for transforming huge derelict spaces for their promenade theatre productions, will team up with the National Theatre on their new show. The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable will open in June in a secret location in London and is the company's biggest production since 2007's The Masque of the Red Death, where they took over Battersea Arts Centre in London for a year. Artistic Director Felix Barrett told the Telegraph: "The National Theatre are our dream collaborators and they've provided financial support and all round support. "We've been looking for the right space to stage the show for two years. We found two other buildings in that time but they both fell through." The show will excite the company's many fans, who feverishly anticipate Punchdrunk's every move. Related Articles

As part of the lead up to the opening of the show, a ten minute 'live trailer' is currently being staged in east London, where people can walk off the street and into a performance. The exact location of the trailer is a secret but it is free and will be open in a shop on Kingsland High Road for the next two weeks. Punchdrunk's artistic director, Felix Barrett
Punchdrunk has become synonymous with huge theatre productions staged in unusual spaces since it put on Faust in a warehouse in Wapping in 2006. After that production, they were based at Battersea Arts Centre between 2007 and 2008 for The Masque of the Red Death. The production involved the audience exploring rooms themselves and finding their own way through the building while wearing masks and cloaks. The Drowned Man is based on Buchner's text Woyzeck, which tells the story of a soldier in Germany. Punchdrunk's adaptation will be set in the 1960s in a film studio. Barrett said: "The play is so resonant today, it’s man’s struggle with poverty, madness, social structures. Rather than doing it pure we started unpick the story." The company have only three months to work on the production, a much shorter time than the six months they prepared for The Masque of the Red Death. "The building informs everything we do. So we decided to wait until we got the space and then respond to the building," he said. Nicholas Hytner, artistic director of the National Theatre said: "Punchdrunk have provided some of my most exciting dramatic experiences over the past decade. I can't wait to see their new theatrical adventure." The Drowned Man: A Hollywood Fable opens from June 20 and runs until September 29. Tickets are available from Friday 22 March at midday from the National Theatre. www.nationaltheatre.org.uk (02074523000) Follow Telegraph Theatre on Twitter

Expat rates: Collapse of deal gives savers a warning
Offshore banks are feeling the pressure to cut costs, writes our finance specialist. In most cases Pibs have proved highly rewarding holdings, but the banking crisis has caused some Pibs to suffer - Co-op bondholders are the latest and arguably worst-hit. Photo: BEN STANSALL/AFP/GettyImages	By Charlotte Beugge
10:47AM BST 06 May 2013
Comments
The news that the Co-operative Bank has decided not to buy 631 mainland branches from Lloyds Banking Group may give offshore savers food for thought. Co-operative said the worsening economic climate made it unwilling to go ahead. While the Co-op has said it remains committed to banking, it has a new chief executive Euan Sutherland starting this month. He is expected to undertake a review of its whole banking operation. The regulatory costs of running a bank are high and the Co-operative has two offshore presences. It has a branch of the Co-operative Bank in Guernsey, which is part of the mainland bank. And it also has a subsidiary, Britannia International, based in the Isle of Man, which is run separately. There are absolutely no indications that either could go. But closures in the offshore savings market are nothing new. In the past 12 months AIB International and Clydesdale International have announced they are to shut. And the Alliance & Leicester International name is soon to go, with the Isle of Man based bank changing to a branch of Santander UK. It's unlikely these will be the last to depart. Certainly, there is a lot of pressure on banks with an offshore presence to watch their figures. Closing an offshore subsidiary means cutting regulatory costs. And anything that cuts costs is an attractive option. Related Articles

Santander, the largest bank in the eurozone, has just announced a 25.9pc fall in profits for the first three months of the year to 1.2bn euros (£1bn) down from 1.6bn euros a year earlier. Santander's UK pre-tax profits fell to £232m from £363m a year earlier. Offshore, Santander has a separate subsidiary, Santander Private Banking, as well as the former Alliance & Leicester International Isle of Man branch. Barclays' first quarter profits fell by 25pc to £1.8bn. Offshore, Barclays Wealth & Investment Management is a major provider of bank accounts to expats, although it's seldom one of the top payers on savings accounts. Savers will be hoping that no more banks leave the offshore market, as the lack of competition has a deleterious effect on interest rates. Statisticians at Moneyfacts say that the government's Funding for Lending Scheme has had a noticeable effect on interest rates: since the scheme was launched late last summer, as a way to kick start the mortgage market and lending to small businesses, interest rates paid to savers have fallen from a typical 1.09pc to 0.76pc. Charlotte Nelson of Moneyfacts said: "It seems no savings accounts are left untouched by this recent trend, with many providers no longer needing savers to balance their mortgage book."
Even though the Funding for Lending scheme will benefit UK homebuyers and business people, it affects expat savers, who have seen their interest rates fall by far more than surely would have happened otherwise. Before the Funding for Lending scheme started in September 2012, expats could get 4.3pc fixed for five years on a minimum £10,000 from Lloyds TSB International. Today the best five-year fixed rate you can get is still from Lloyds TSB International – but now it's 2pc on £10,000. Last summer you could get 3.35pc fixed for three years from Clydesdale International. Now the top three-year rate is 2.15pc from Permanent Bank International. Had you fixed for a year late last August you could have got 3.5pc from Permanent Bank International. The top deal is now just 1.87pc from Co-operative Bank. There's a name that might be new to some offshore savers in the tables. Standard Bank has one of the top paying variable-rate notice accounts for those wanting a dollar-denominated deal. The 96-day-notice account is paying 0.4pc – that is actually the second best deal in this dwindling market, topped by Investec Bank (Channel Islands) at 0.75pc. However the Standard Bank deal is on a lower $25,000. You can do better on a no-notice deal – Nationwide International pays 1.4pc on $5,000. Standard Bank's offshore operation is run from the Isle of Man. It is the largest African bank with a 150-year history. It has 1,200 branches in Africa and operates in 30 countries. It has total assets of about Rand 1,549 bn (£110bn). Expat Money

Commuter Spy: travelling in flirt class
Our Man On The Train just wants to read the paper. But a tipsy fortysomething woman has other ideas Photo: Commuter Spy	By Our Man On The Train
5:19PM BST 14 Sep 2012
Comments
The late-night train back from London is always a sketchy affair. Last week I went out for drinks after work, and ended up getting the 23:05 from Waterloo. Due to a combination of circumstances that I will not relate here, I’d only had a couple of beers and was, to all intents and purposes, sober. This was not the case for the woman opposite. As she sat down, our feet collided. “We can play footsie if you want,” she said. “I don’t mind. Really.” I looked at her askance. She was in her early forties, well dressed. She smiled crookedly and swayed in her seat. “Sorry,” she said. “I’ve had rrrather a lot to drrrrink.”
I smiled politely and raised my newspaper; there are moments when the great British tradition of not talking to fellow commuters makes perfect sense. But as the train pulled away from the metropolis, she caught my attention with a wave. “Are you married?” she said. I nodded. “Kids?” I nodded again. She made a disgusted face. “Baaaad idea,” she said. “Kids are a pain in the bum.”

28 Sep 2012
I rustled my newspaper, but it made no difference. “Can I ask you something?” she said. “Do you have a good sex life? You ddddon’t have to answer if you ddddon’t want to. But have you ever had an affair? I have. My husband, you see, he doesn’t give me what I need. This other man – he did the most amaaaazing things to me. It was electric – whenever he was in the room, I’d be tinggggling.”
“I don’t want to be rude,” I said, “but you might regret telling me all this tomorrow.” I glanced around the carriage. People were watching her quite openly now. “I dddon’t care,” she said. “I dddon’t know you, do I?”
“No,” I said. “But I’m getting to know you. Perhaps a bit too intimately.”
Without warning, she reached over the table and grabbed my hand. Then she released it, rested her head on the table, and fell asleep. Email: commuterspy@telegraph.co.uk Twitter: @CommuterSpy

Vicar murder: police seize van where homeless man slept
Police investigating the murder of parish priest John Suddards in his own vicarage have seized a white van where a homeless man had been sleeping rough. The Rev John Suddards outside St Mary’s Church in Thornbury, South Gloucester Photo: SWNS	By Donna Bowater
7:34AM GMT 17 Feb 2012
Follow The white Citroen van was taken hours after a 43-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday night following the discovery of Reverend John Suddards’s body in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire that morning. On Thursday it was also disclosed that a vagrant had been hanging around the town’s Catholic church just 500 yards away from the vicarage where Mr Suddards was found stabbed to death close to his church, St Mary’s. A man in his 40s, known as Robbie, had been sleeping in the van belonging to retired electrician John Dean, 68, who had taken him in a few weeks ago. Mr Dean, who lives in an annexe to a property he rents out, said he gave Robbie a place to stay after being introduced by the Pastor Paul Ferguson at Thornbury Baptist Church about six weeks ago. He offered Robbie a job as a litter picker at a campsite he owns in Truro, Cornwall, and told him he could pitch his tent there for free as well as allowing him to stay with him in the annexe to The Cottages in Knapp Road, Thornbury.

17 Feb 2012
While Mr Dean was away on holiday, Robbie - said to be from Chester originally - slept in his white van. Speaking from Malta, where he is on holiday, Mr Dean, 68, said: “Robbie is a gentle, meek, mild-mannered man. He was homeless but he didn't feel upset or angry about that. "He was happy with his situation and I had offered him a job and a place to pitch his tent in Truro. “I would never expect him to ever be involved in any violence towards anybody.”
Meanwhile, police officers also took the CCTV equipment from the Roman Catholic Christ the King Church in Thornbury. Father Alex McAllister, who was the priest for 12 years, said a man in his 40s had been dropping into the church for the last six months. He said the man did not appear to have a drink or drug problem and was “inoffensive”. “I can imagine that if your line of inquiry is a homeless person, well what places are open? Pubs and churches. Churches are quieter,” he said. “There are only two which are open, St Mary’s and here. We’re very keen to keep both churches open. I think it’s important this day and age that people have a place where they can come and pray.”
Avon and Somerset Police would only confirm a 43-year-old man was in custody. Last night, a cordon remained in place around St Mary’s Church. The Bishop of Gloucester, Michael Perham was due to lead a commemorative service on Friday night Crime

Lockerbie bomber: Trade deal was behind release, says Libyan leader's son
The release of the Lockerbie bomber was linked to trade deals between Britain and Libya, Col Muammar Gaddafi’s son, claimed
last night.

Saif al Islam Gaddafi said that Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi’s return was a “victory” for all Libyans.
He made the claims in a television interview for Libyan television recorded as he accompanied Megrahi on the flight back from Scotland to Libya on Thursday.
The claims were vehemently denied. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “There is no deal. All decisions relating to Megrahi’s case have been exclusively for Scottish ministers, the Crown Office in Scotland and the Scottish judicial authorities.
“No deal has been made between the UK Government and Libya in relation to Megrahi and any commercial interests in the country.”
Earlier David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, rejected any suggestion that ministers wanted Megrahi to be freed for commercial reasons, dismissing it as a “slur”.

Lockerbie bomber: I will prove I am innocent
22 Aug 2009
The claims came as Megrahi told a newspaper he would produce evidence proving his innocence before he dies.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown was facing growing anger over his silence on the decision to free Megrahi after eight years in a Scottish jail.
David Cameron said the Prime Minister must explain his views on the issue.
The decision by Scottish ministers to free the biggest mass murderer in British legal history on compassionate grounds has triggered criticism from President Barack Obama and many of the relatives of the 270 people killed in 1988.
Mr Cameron has denounced the release and yesterday challenged the Prime Minister over his “curious” silence.
In a letter to Mr Brown, the Conservative leader said: “I believe that the public are entitled to know what you think of the decision to release Megrahi, and whether you consider it was right or wrong.”
Downing Street refused to comment, and Mr Miliband would not be drawn, saying it was purely “a matter for the Scottish government”.
Government insiders said it was proper for Mr Brown to stay silent because the devolution settlement meant the Lockerbie decision was entirely for Scottish ministers.
However, his silence is feeding conspiracy theories around the release.
The Libyan leader’s son praised “the British and Scottish governments” yesterday. Mr Gaddafi was later shown on television telling Megrahi: “Your liberation is a victory that we offer to all Libyans.”
Meanwhile, Megrahi told a newspaper he would produce evidence he was innocent. He said: “My message to the British and Scottish communities is that I will put out the evidence and ask them to be the jury.” He refused to elaborate.
In 2007, Tony Blair concluded a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya, which many suspected was intended to facilitate Megrahi’s release.
Megrahi did make an application to be returned under the agreement, but Scottish ministers granted him compassionate release because he has terminal cancer.
His decision to drop his appeal against conviction this week, which ended any chance of a re-examination of the case, was regarded with suspicion by some in Scotland.
Megrahi, 57, arrived home on Thursday night to be greeted by hundreds of Libyans feting him as a hero. The display was an embarrassment for the Prime Minister, who had asked the Libyans to avoid triumphalist displays.

On the property market: homes next to golf courses
JERSEY Four-bedroom period house, £3.5m
LOOKS This large Georgian house in St Peter, built in 1822, would be charming enough with just its carefully manicured, south-facing grounds – but the putting/chipping green in the private front garden makes it irresistible for dedicated golf enthusiasts.
CHARM With a sun-trap courtyard with a built-in bar area, a games room and a heated swimming pool and jacuzzi, you're perfectly equipped for the après–tee, too.
VITAL STATISTICS There are three bedrooms in the main house; the fourth is in an integrated one-bedroom self-contained apartment.

Thierry Henry's Arsenal return imminent as club approach Major League Soccer for star's release
Arsenal are to approach Major League Soccer in the US to seek the release of Thierry Henry so that the striker can join them on a two-month loan deal.

Talks have already taken place this week between Henry and Arsenal and an agreement with the 34 year-old is understood to be in place. However Arsenal still have to gain the consent of Henry’s club, New York Red Bulls, who are unlikely to block the move, and the MLS. “There is nothing concrete but we are talking,” a club source said on Thursday night.
Similar arrangements have been ratified to allow Landon Donovan to rejoin Everton from LA Galaxy – although David Beckham found it more difficult to gain a similar deal at Tottenham Hotspur — so the indications are that Henry should be able to make a remarkable return to the club he quit in 2007 to join Barcelona.
The former captain has been training with Arsenal for the past month while the MLS is in its off season and the loan period would extend until the beginning of March, when he would have to return to America.
Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is set to lose Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh to the Africa Cup of Nations, after the FA Cup third round kicks off next weekend, and wants to provide support for captain Robin van Persie. Arsenal’s only other striker is the summer signing Chu-Young Park, who has struggled.

Wenger has been sufficiently impressed by Henry’s form and fitness in training to make a move.
The Frenchman has returned from a short holiday in Mexico and watched Tuesday’s 1-1 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. If he signs, Henry — who scored a record 226 goals in eight years at Arsenal, winning two league titles — could be eligible for seven Premier League matches plus FA Cup ties and the first leg of Arsenal’s Champions League encounter away to AC Milan.

Dai Greene's 400m hurdles victory at athletics Worlds captivates David Hemery every leap of the way
As Dai Greene hurdled for glory here in Daegu, one of UK athletics' most distinguished gentlemen was mentally jumping every barrier with him back at his home in Marlborough.

"I was on the edge of my seat," 67-year-old David Hemery told Telegraph Sport, utterly delighted that after a 43-year wait another male British one-lap hurdler had finally beaten the world again. It was in October 1968, in the thin air of Mexico City, that Hemery earned immortality by winning Olympic gold in the 'mankiller' event with a world record. Ever since his retirement, while watching terrific hurdlers such as Alan Pascoe and Kriss Akabusi not quite able to emulate him, he has been longing for a tour de force like this. "It's great to see a British hurdler winning a global gold again and to see someone fulfil their potential like this. Dai seems very focused, self-assured and a very positive young man," said Hemery. What stood out for the old champion was just how "assured" the Welshman looked, as if he had won the mental, as well as the physical, battle with his opponents. He believes that ability will push Greene to the ultimate prize next year. "Absolutely, you have to fancy him for London now," said Hemery, the vice-chairman of the British Olympic Association. "He said in his interview that he handled pressure well and I think he clearly did. We had a false start in Mexico but there were two faulty starts here and perhaps some of his rivals just go over the top in his emotions."

One thing that amazed Hemery, though, was that the winning time was still slower than his own altitude-assisted mark of 48.12sec, set in Mexico all those years ago. "Astonishing really, when you consider that Dai beat an absolutely world-class field, with world and Olympic champions and nobody really missing."
Only Greene and Akabusi have ever bettered Hemery's time among Britons but the Welshman will probably have to revise Akabusi's mark of 47.82sec to strike gold next year. If a wise old head like Hemery can do anything to help Greene's progress now, he is happy to do so. "We only met briefly – at the BBC Sports personality awards – and I'd be very happy to meet him and talk about the event," said Hemery. "But he probably won't need me because he's got Malcolm Arnold, an outstanding coach who's been winning golds for four decades!"
Indeed, he laughed, it was Arnold who tapped his brain for a gold-medal blueprint after he had won in Mexico, only to improve it and then pass it on to the great Ugandan, John Akii-Bua, who then took his title in 1972! Next year, it will be part of Hemery's BOA duties to look after its invited overseas dignitaries. "So I do hope there's some who wish to watch the athletics!" Yes, particularly Monday, Aug 6, 2012: the Olympic men's 400m hurdles final. Doubtless, it is in the diary already. Athletics

After the match both players were in the changing rooms when Roddick lost it, after Djokovic “chirped”. He pinned him against the locker and was about to unleash his rage … when he saw the size of the Serbian’s trainer, who was looming over themPicture: GETTY IMAGES

Pope Francis leads his first Easter Mass in St. Peter's Square
Pope Francis celebrates Easter Mass and delivers the Urbi et Orbi blessing in St. Peter's Square.
12:00PM BST 31 Mar 2013
Pope Francis lead his first Easter Sunday celebrations in front of tens of thousands of people in St Peter's Square during a mass marking the holiest day in the Christian calendar. The ceremony was followed by a special "Urbi et Orbi" blessing for Rome and the world that the pope delivered from the same balcony where he made his first public appearance after his election this month. At an Easter Vigil in St Peter's Basilica on Saturday, the first pontiff from outside Europe in nearly 1,300 years of Church history reached out to non-believers and lapsed Catholics, urging them to "step forward" towards God. "He will receive you with open arms," said the 76-year-old Argentine pope, formerly the archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who has called for the Roman Catholic Church to be closer to ordinary people and the needy.
