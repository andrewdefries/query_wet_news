The writer who is having his day David Nicholls tells Nigel Farndale about how his latest rom-com novel became the book of the year. 6:00AM GMT 26 Dec 2010
Comments
Though he doesn’t have Woody Allen’s neurotic manner, nor his weediness of frame, there is something Woody Allen-ish about the British novelist David Nicholls. It’s to do with his low-level angst and self-deprecating humour. Consider this reaction to his having the year’s word-of-mouth best-seller with his novel One Day (as acknowledged at the recent Galaxy National Book Awards, where the public voted it their Book of the Year, beating the likes of Hilary Mantel and Jonathan Franzen). “It’s gratifying, but it also makes me anxious,” he says. “I worry when the backlash is going to come.”
With his black shirt, sideburns and unkempt hair, he looks like you might expect a 44-year-old north London novelist to look (he lives in Highbury with his partner, Hannah, and their two young children). Yet he’s not a stereotypical north Londoner at all, having grown up in rural Hampshire and gone to university at Bristol. Nor does he have a media-savvy swagger. He seems shy, not good at eye contact.
This diffidence might seem odd, given that he hasn’t exactly been starved of success until now. Not only did he write a few episodes of the hit TV comedy drama Cold Feet, but he also had his first novel, Starter for Ten, made into a film starring James McAvoy — it became a best-seller after being chosen for the first Richard and Judy Book Club in 2004. But nothing has come close to the publishing phenomenon that is his third novel, One Day. Since its release in paperback in the spring it has notched up a million sales worldwide, with 33 translation editions, and is the best-selling paperback this Christmas. The novel is being made into a film starring Anne Hathaway, for which, as with his other film, Nicholls wrote the script. “I always expect to get sacked on movies. But it hasn’t happened yet.”
Chances are, if you haven’t already read One Day, a friend has recommended it to you. Although stylistically Nicholls has been compared to Nick Hornby, his bittersweet style of social comedy is his own, as is his structural device of revisiting the two central characters, Emma and Dexter, separately or together every St Swithin’s Day, July 15. That was the day on which they first (almost) became a couple.
To what does the author attribute the appeal of the book? “I think the time was right for another big love story. And the idea of covering 20 years in 20 days worked well, I think. It’s a serious comedy. A lot of things I love are dark comedies.”
What makes One Day a rarity among works of rom-com fiction is its appeal to both men and women. “We put a lot of thought into that when we were designing the cover. A male and female face, close yet separated. Coming up with a love story that men could read without being embarrassed was always in my mind.”
Much of the appeal of the book lies in Emma’s deadpan wit. I ask whether she was an amalgam of women he knows, or a female version of himself. “If anything, I think she is a female archetype of the wise observer. Smarter than everyone else in the room but with a detachment, like Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, or Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. You can also see in her the influence of a certain movie dialogue you get in When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall. The kind of hostility that disguises deep affection. It’s a tradition I’ve always liked. Very little is taken from life.”
That said, he, like his character Emma, did not enjoy the Nineties. “That decade for me was all anxiety, self-pity and staying in. I was an actor, which is another way of saying that I was unemployed.” “But no experience is wasted. I have a little cameo in the film of One Day – I’m a maître d’ in a restaurant – but I imagine it will be cut. I always ruin it by overacting.”
Nicholls’s mother was a secretary for the local council, his father a maintenance engineer in a cake factory. “We weren’t a bookish family. I was the first generation to go to university. It was a fantastic experience for me. I met people from different backgrounds who were quite intimidating. Bristol is quite a snooty university in a way. I had never met anyone from a public school before Bristol.”
Nicholls also worked in a bookshop, running the children’s department in the Notting Hill branch of Waterstone’s. “I was a better bookseller than an actor.”
Nowadays, he spends two days a week writing in either the British Library or the London Library. “There is a community in both places. And it’s reassuring when you see that other writers aren’t working but doing a Sainsbury’s shop online.” The other three days he works from home. “My study is near the front door so it is the noisiest room in the house. The real enemy to concentration, though, is the internet. I have to check my emails every 20 minutes.”
It is time for a photograph. Nicholls reaches for his glasses. They have thick black rims, like those of Woody Allen.
 ‘One Day’ by David Nicholls (Hodder & Stoughton, £7.99) is out now

Graduate jobs: top 10 starting salaries
As Paul Teulon, head of admissions at King’s College London, points out here, half of the graduate jobs available do not demand a particular degree. Having a good degree from a respected institution is the key to landing that dream graduate role. That said, if you think you already know what you want to end up doing, it doesn't hurt to tailor your undergraduate degree subject choice accordingly. We take a look at the 10 best-paid graduate sectors, and suggest some of the degree options that can help get that vital foot in the door. Also, we asked five leading graduate employers what attributes they are looking for from the current crop of university students. Find out what they had to say here.

Man finds buffalo in his swimming pool
A man in the United States had to haul a buffalo from his swimming pool after finding the creature hiding under the cover.
By Myles Burke
11:30AM BST 26 Oct 2010
Chris Nonnemaker of White County, Georgia, discovered the escaped animal when his wife, Alison, noticed holes in the pool cover. He pulled back the cover to find that a buffalo had become stuck in the pool after escaping from a neighbour's herd. The sheriff’s deputies and animal's owner were called to the house and managed to pull the beast from the water by lassoing it around the horns. Related Articles

West Ham test Valon Behrami but are still missing Jack Collison, Mark Noble, Manuel da Costa, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Anthony Edgar and Peter Kurucz. Manager Avram Grant must decide whether to recall Luis Boa Morte, Kieron Dyer and Carlton Cole, all of whom were dropped to the bench for the 3-1 defeat by Manchester City. Last season: Blackburn 0 West Ham 0, West Ham 0 Blackburn 0. Stat of the game: The last three League meetings between these teams have ended in draws. Betting tip: West Ham can take advantage of the turmoil at Ewood. A 1-0 away win is 11-1. Premier League
