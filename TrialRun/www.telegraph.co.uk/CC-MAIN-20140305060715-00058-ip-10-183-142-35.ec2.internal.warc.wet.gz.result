Britain isn't open for business but business here is open to abuse
It was without the slightest hint of irony that Boris Johnson and David Cameron on Monday urged French bankers to leave Paris, and the guillotine of a financial transaction tax, and relocate to libertarian London.
Bob Diamond, Barclays' chief executive, is obviously next in line for the Hester treatment but Cameron will sit by and allow the private sector to be humiliated. By Damian Reece, Head of Business
11:22PM GMT 31 Jan 2012
Comments
But escape from one baying mob of politicians in crisis-hit Europe, and French financiers will simply run into a worse baying mob here.
When overseas executives are urged by senior Tory politicians to come here and invest they really shouldn't listen. Instead they should consider the reality of business in Britain in 2012.
Stephen Hester was hounded into giving up his remuneration while Fred Goodwin's knighthood simply proves that British due process can no longer be trusted. Forget Labour's frothing anti-business rhetoric, simply consider Cameron's recent "crony capitalism" tirade and his belief that FTSE 100 boards are "ripping off" shareholders for proof that business in general is being denigrated by Government.
Royal Bank of Scotland may be 83pc owned by taxpayers but it is a commercial bank operating in commercial markets and should be treated as such by politicians. Their interference, and the market's fear of further interference, cost taxpayers £900m on Monday in lost value in RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Yet this madness goes unheeded.

Coalition's demonisation of UK firms won't help them as they look East
17 Jan 2012
The Tories have allowed Ed Miliband, an otherwise weak and feeble Labour leader, to hijack Parliament and threaten a Commons vote on anything. Bob Diamond, Barclays' chief executive, is obviously next in line for the Hester treatment but Cameron will sit by and allow the private sector to be humiliated by an Opposition that brought the UK to its knees, when in power, through its utter mismanagement of the public sector. RBS was bailed-out by taxpayers but it was Labour's regulations (and knighthood) that allowed Goodwin to embark on his folly. There will be no growth without the private sector, there will be no jobs without the private sector and there will be no recovery until banking has recovered. It's time Cameron has the guts to draw a line and stand up for business. If you're an overseas company, don't believe the rhetoric. We're not open for business, but come here and you'll be open to the threat of political abuse and arbitrary measures of retrospective and empty vindictiveness.

Rates start to rise on fixed five-year mortgages Record-low fixed rates are edging up as lenders prepare for a base rate rise
The best five-year fixed rate is now 2.95pc By Nicole Blackmore
8:11AM GMT 09 Feb 2014

Five-year fixed rate mortgages are edging up to from their record lows as the mortgage market prepares for a base rate rise. Borrowers looking to lock in a long-term fix are being urged to act quickly to secure the best possible rates. [Calcuator: rate rise impact]
Santander, Natwest, Nationwide, Yorkshire Building Society, Clydesdale Bank and Tesco Bank have all increased the rate on their five-year fixed deals or withdrawn products altogether over the last two weeks. The best five-year fixed rate has risen from 2.44pc in July to 2.95pc now. It is available from Natwest and Barclays subsidiary Woolwich, both at 60pc loan to value. Natwest charges a £995 fee and Woolwich charges £999. David Hollingworth, of London and Country, said rates are still competitive, but the “tide is turning” and more lenders are expected to push their prices up. “You tend to see a domino effect once a handful of lenders start changing their pricing. Borrowers looking to fix should not wait until just before a base rate rise. Lenders are proactive and prepare for changes well before they happen. We will inevitably see rates continue to edge up this year as we get closer to a base rate rise.”

Five-year fixed rate mortgages have been cheap for some time, thanks mainly to the record-low 0.5pc base rate and the Government’s Funding for Lending scheme, which allowed lenders to access cheap money. But the Government withdrew Funding for Lending for mortgages this month and swap rates – which lenders use to price their loans – have been edging up, making it more expensive for lenders to access funding. The cost of a £150,000 repayment mortgage over 25 years at various five-year fixed rates:
Rate Monthly repayments Total repayments over five years 2.44pc £668.40 £40,104 2.69pc £687.37 £41,242 2.95pc £707.42 £42,445 Simon Gammon, head of Knight Frank Finance said even though the Bank of England maintains that base rate will not increase in the immediate future, the likelihood of a rise earlier than the forward guidance of 2016 is “building dramatically”. He said this is why swap rates are rising even though base rate was held at 0.5pc this week. He said there is still an opportunity for borrowers to secure cheap fixed borrowing this year, but lenders are expecting to receive an increased number of mortgage applications. “We have already witnessed many lenders over the last few years pick and choose the best borrowers, and mortgage application declines have at times been very high,” he said. “Expect this trend to re-appear more as the number of borrowers wanting to fix their rates increase. The message then is get in early while they is still appetite to lend and many banks have large targets for this year to hit.”

This week Santander increased its range of three and five-year deals by up to 0.15pc. This took its cheapest five-year fix from 2.99pc to 3.09pc. Natwest increased its 2.88pc five-year fix to 2.95pc, while Nationwide increased its three and five-year fixed rates by 0.10pc - taking its lowest five-year fix from 2.99pc to 3.09pc. Yorkshire withdrew its leading 2.69pc five-year fix last month and this week increased its 2.84pc deal to 3.09pc. Tesco Bank withdrew its 2.79pc deal last week and didn’t replace it.

Why women can't resist bad boys
Nice guys don't always finish last, but sometimes the appeal of a bad boy is too hard to resist, explains Caroline Kent.
Serial seducer: Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love By Caroline Kent
7:00AM BST 09 Oct 2013
Follow Comments
I'm often questioned by men who tell me they are "nice guys" but feel ignored by women who, they say, "prefer to be treated like crap". While I don't agree that nice guys always finish last, I do understand that we women do make some damn silly dating decisions.
Most of the men I know are kind, polite and adorable in practically every way, yet, like many women, I have an illogical soft-spot for massive jerks. There is something about bad boys that we find incredibly appealing, even though we often regret the experience afterwards.
I'm so drawn to their powerful/sensitive/artistic (delete as applicable) natures that it allows me to rationalise away their abusive, selfish, sarcastic or psychopathic side, until it's too late. I don't know whether it's chemistry or foolishness on my part, but let me try to explain why we - or at least I - do it.
Bad boys come in all shapes and sizes, often not befitting the James Dean stereotype of smouldering sex appeal. My first was from a chaotic background: brought up in foster care, a school dropout by 14, eyes the colour of caramel latte. But being a bad boy isn't about being from the wrong side of the tracks. My most recent mistake took the form of a middle-class technology software partner who wore J Crew. He didn't have much in common with my first bad boy at all, except for one thing: the way they treated me. And my God, it felt just as painful at 24 as it did at 14.
And just as euphoric. One thing that bad boys are not is boring. We are enraptured by their spontaneity, by the excitement and anticipation of being with them. At least until we get hurt, and that's the one thing that you can count on with a bad boy.

So why do women put up with it? I can only speak for me, but the reason we keep going back, for more belittling digs and more nights waiting for the phone to ring, is not because we like it. It's because many of us feel we don't deserve better.
Perhaps I've become accustomed to disappointment or to people withholding affection. Perhaps I'm addicted to the excitement that comes when the bad boy finally does pick up the phone. Perhaps I am most comfortable in chaotic emotional relationships, and bad boys are some sort of screwed-up safety blanket. Perhaps I am so used to being independent that I've become scared to let someone really be there for me, so I select emotionally unavailable people. Perhaps I invite this type of person into my life by putting on a tough exterior that says, "I don't need love, I don't need you, I don't need anyone."
Or perhaps I just haven't met the right "nice guy" yet? Relationships

The production version of the BMW i3 has been unveiled ahead of its November on-dale date. The electrically powered supermini is the first car to be launched as part of BMW's new "i" sub-brand and, to help ease the fears of potential buyers worried that it won't suit their lifestyle, it will be sold with the option of cheap access to BMW's conventionally powered cars for short periods. Power for the i3 comes from a 168bhp electric motor that provides 184lb ft of torque, and which is mounted between the driven rear wheels. Two versions of the i3 will be offered. Both are powered by the same electric power train, but the Range Extender version also has a 650cc, 34bhp two-cylinder petrol engine that acts as a generator to extend the battery's overall range. The standard model has a range of between 80 and 100 miles, whereas the Range Extender version has a range of between 160 and 186 miles on one tank of fuel. Related Articles

BMW says that a range of innovations have helped to keep the i3's weight to a minimum, and the standard version weighs 1,195kg (about the same as a diesel-powered Ford Fiesta). The most significant of these is a carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) "passenger cell", while the chassis itself if mostly aluminium. Forged aluminium suspension links, hollow driveshafts and the use of aluminium crews and bolts are also aimed at reducing the i3's weight. The car's lithium-ion battery pack weighs 230kg and is mounted beneath the cabin floor. BMW i3 prices start from £25,680 for the standard model and £28,830 for the Range Extender version, including the full £5,000 Government plug-in car grant. Leasing packages start from £369 per month for a 36-month contract and a limit of 24,000 miles. Although BMW suggests the i3 will satisfy buyer's needs for the majority of the time, it is attempting to ease fears over "range anxiety" by offering the car with "BMW Access" - a system that allows them to borrow other BMW or Mini vehicles for a certain number of days each year, for holidays or longer trips. BMW UK hasn't confirmed which of its other models will be available to i3 owners, but the service will be available as part of a "360° Electric" ownership package that can also be used to cover the cost of charging and servicing their car. Four plans will be available - Pulse, Charge, Spark and Energy, with prices ranging form £40 to £80 per month. Four different trim levels will be available – Standard, Loft, Lodge and Suite. Standard equipment includes a satnav system that provides a "dynamic range display" and a view of public charging stations and their availability. All UK i3 models will come with AC Fast Charging as standard, which allows the car's battery to be charged from zero to 80 per cent full in three hours via BMW's I Wallbox. Charging via a domestic socket takes eight to ten hours. Both i3 models are covered by a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty and an eight-year, 100,000-mile battery warranty. The BMW i3 will be available to order from August, but officially goes on sale on November 16. The next car to be added to BMW's i range will be the i8 supercar. It has a plug-in hybrid powertrain and is due on sale in spring 2014. BMW

Torrential rain on the way but still chance of a white Christmas Forecasters predict there is a chance of snow on Christmas Day, following two days of storms that will lash the country and leave some areas at risk of flooding

Follow Stormy weather with torrential downpours and gale force winds is set to subside on Christmas Day with a chance of snow, forecasters say. The run up to Christmas is expected to be wet for most of the country, with torrential rain and gales of up to 80mph forecast, particularly for northern areas. But the weather is set to brighten for Christmas Day and the Met Office said there is a chance of a white Christmas, particularly in the North West and Scotland. Sunday is expected to be wet and breezy, with a storm forecast to hit England on Monday morning, characterised by heavy rain and winds. “By dawn time there will be the start of heavy rain pushing into the South West,” said Calum Maccoll, a forecaster at the Met Office.

“There will be ever increasing wind and stormy weather will push northwards. There will be of heavy rain, torrential rain, particularly in the North East and places like Dartmoor.” Gusts of up to 60mph are expected, but these could increase to 80mph along coastal areas. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for parts of England on Monday. The storms are set to continue throughout Christmas Eve, with rain continuing in the South East. But by Christmas Day the storm is expected to subside, with fewer showers and a chance of snow, particularly in Scotland. Mr Maccoll added: “There will be plenty of better weather on Christmas Day for people to get out and about and walk off all those Christmas dinners.”
Ladbrokes had been offering 12/1 for snow on Christmas Day in London as recently as Friday morning but those odds have been slashed to just 6/1 in little more than 24 hours. Weather
