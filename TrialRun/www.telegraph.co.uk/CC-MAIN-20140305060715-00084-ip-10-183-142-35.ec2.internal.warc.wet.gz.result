Tinder – it's been great, but we need some time apart
Fun and flirty apps like Tinder appeal to the immediacy of my generation, but like many things that are bad for you, it can be really addictive, says Eleanor Doughty Eleanor Doughty: My first response to Tinder was that it appeared as deep as a puddle. Photo: Alamy	By Eleanor Doughty

My iPhone and I are about to have our one-month anniversary. I am now the kind of person who stops to take boring photos in the street – of ‘witty’ coffee shop signs and small dogs. I have downloaded Instagram (four years behind the curve), registered my Wunderlist app and set the brightness to the most comfortable 11pm in-bed viewing. And then I downloaded Tinder. >>Check out the Telegraph Student Life Facebook page
Clueless, and inspired by a friend who met her boyfriend through this virtual flirtation app, I cut my losses and signed up. What did I have to lose? Dignity? Nope – half my university is on it. For those uninitiated, Tinder is an app that markets itself as being ‘a fun way to meet people’. In its own words, it ‘finds out who likes you nearby, and connects you with them if you’re also interested’ using your phone’s GPS settings. Related Articles

Using only a limited profile, you swipe right if you like someone, and left if you don’t. If you ‘yes’ someone and they do the same, you get ‘matched’ and can start a conversation. Contrary to popular (outside the M25) belief, it’s hard to meet people in London. Even as a student, with a union presumably designed for this purpose. There’s just too much choice. Too many pubs, rugby clubs and independent coffee shops; far, far too many girls cooler and less bothered about being an adult than me. Although online dating is ‘a thing’ in London, for the average undergraduate it’s still stigmatised. A lot of people my age think it’s for desperados who can’t pull at 'Propaganda', or for never-before-been-kissed Dr Who fans. With this in mind, and considering my nondescript ability to chat up – cringe phrase – blokes in pubs, I started swiping left and right. Like many things that are bad for you, Tinder is really addictive. At the time of writing I had 165 matches, but I blame the format over anything else. The left, left, left, left, left, RIGHT action is strangely obsessive. Being a girl that sticks to a ‘type’, I found it easy. Not-too-vain-looking rugby player, yes; Essex lad, no. Guy with baby, no; hottie-with-kitten, er yes. If I had a pound for every bloke I observed cuddling a tiger, in black tie, or flexing his six pack, I could give up work. My first response to Tinder was that it appeared as deep as a puddle. But it’s only as shallow as a night out would ever be. And ignorance is bliss; you can’t check out the competition. You also can’t get too hung up with gazing at people on Tinder (unless you screenshot) because the process is momentary. It’s less awkward; no one has to buy Jägerbombs (or pretend to like Jägerbombs) and best of all, you can do it in your pyjamas, really hung-over and no one needs to know. This week the Commons Speaker John Bercow announced his vision for ‘democracy 2.0’: voting over the Internet (presumably from your iPhone.) Why is this brilliant? Because social media has changed our lives. My generation – at the risk of sounding like a fogey – are expert over-sharers; we unleash our emotions on the Internet daily. Fun and flirty apps like Tinder appeal to the immediacy we crave. We are impatient and attention seeking; Tinder is a logical step. Last night I found myself convincing a friend at uni to sign up. Not because they’re looking for a relationship or hook up, but because it’s fun. And though that’s something we all need more of, I think Tinder and I will be having some time apart soon. We’ve grown too close lately; I need some space. It’s nothing to do with you, Tinder; it’s me. Eleanor Doughty is a third-year student at QMUL @brushingboots

FirstGroup chief Sir Moir Lockhead to retire, ex-Tube boss Tim O'Toole to take over
Sir Moir Lockhead is to retire chief executive of FirstGroup after 21 years and put former London Underground boss Tim O'Toole in the driving seat at the bus and train operator.
8:28AM BST 22 Sep 2010
Comments
Mr O'Toole, 54, has been in pole position to replace 65-year-old Sir Moir since being made chief operating officer and deputy chief executive in June. FirstGroup
At the time of the appointment, Sir Moir insisted he had no plans to step down over the short-term. Sir Moir, orginally a mechanical engineer, has been chief executive and deputy chairman since the formation of FirstGroup in 1995. Mr O'Toole, a well-regarded and fast-talking American, joined FirstGroup as a non-executive in May 2009, only three months after quitting London Underground after guiding the network through a rollercoaster six years. Sir Moir said in a statement: "I firmly believe that timing is everything and with FirstGroup in a strong position to continue its successful development the time is right for me to hand over to an outstanding team led by Tim O'Toole."

Nick Clegg: Proposals for cap on EU migrants are 'pointless'
Nick Clegg says NHS will fall over and the City of London will grind to a halt without immigration

10:51PM GMT 21 Dec 2013
Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, has pledged to block any fresh attempts to curb immigration from the European Union, insisting "this is where we draw the line". Mr Clegg dismissed Home Office proposals for a 75,000 cap on EU migrants as "pointless" and claimed without freedom of movement the National Health Service would "fall over". His comments come just days after David Cameron warned he would veto further expansion of the union's borders unless reforms were agreed to crack down on "benefit tourism". A ban on EU migrants claiming out-of-work benefits from the moment they arrive in the UK is also being rushed through Parliament to be in place in time for the January 1 lifting of access restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Migrants from all EU states will have to wait for three months before applying for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) and other out-of-work benefits. Related Articles

Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Clegg said: "Sticking a big no-entry sign on the cliffs of Dover may be politically popular, but at a huge economic cost. What would happen if tonight every European living in the UK boarded a ship or plane and went home? "Are we really that keen to see the back of German lawyers, Dutch accountants or Finnish engineers? Do we want the NHS to fall over and the City of London to grind to a halt?" He said the issue was "the biggest dividing line in politics today" and branded plans for a cap "arbitrary", "pointless" and "distracting". "Britain would be one step closer to the exit, even though walking away from Europe would cripple the economic recovery that's been so hard won," he added. Nick Clegg

Princess Diana 'regretted marrying into German family'
Diana, Princess of Wales regretted marrying into a “German family”, according to Anthony Julius, her divorce lawyer. Princess Diana Photo: PA	8:00AM GMT 31 Jan 2010
Mr Julius said the Princess made the comment to express her empathy with him as a Jew. The claim is made in the lawyer's new book about anti-Semitism. He writes: “She was interested in Jews but had no idea about them, save that Jewish men (she had heard) were more likely than the men of her own class and background to treat women decently. She was happy to take Jews to be hostile to everything to which she herself was hostile. She once said to me that she should never have married into a German family.”
Mr Julius first represented the princess when she sued over surreptitious photographs that had been taken of her exercising at a gym. In extracts from his new book published by The Sunday Times Mr Julius, who was not a divorce specialist but was persuaded by the Princess to represent her again, writes: “Diana lived as if in a vacuum. She was undereducated in the approved style of her class and gender. "She was very receptive to new experiences, which meant that she was sometimes taken by odd fancies. She had a strong desire to please, to leave her interlocutor happy, but often without quite understanding what that person was ‘about’. Related Articles

“She was intuitive, but not always accurate in her assessments of people. Sometimes she went wildly wrong — not just in the big things, but in odd misreadings of moods or sentiments. “I never had the feeling that she set out to impress; perhaps she had surrendered that ambition as a child.”
He adds: “She was interested in everything that was outside her own world; she had a tendency to esteem a thing just because it was not part of her world — even more if it was excluded by her world. She herself was not quite of that world, but did not belong to any other either. “She gave the impression of living in a general condition of alienation, but that did not prevent her from operating successfully in many different milieux.”
Mr Julius’s book, Trials of the Diaspora, examines the history of anti-Semitism in England. The Royal Family

The search is on to find the faker behind Piltdown Man
The earliest known human, discovered in 1912, turned out to be an elaborate hoax. Now scientists believe they can track down the perpetrator, says Karolyn Shindler. A replica of the Piltdown skull By Karolyn Shindler
1:24PM GMT 03 Dec 2012
Comments
One hundred years ago, the world was introduced to Piltdown Man, seemingly one of the most remarkable discoveries of the age – which turned out to be perhaps the most audacious and brilliant fraud in scientific history. The bones and stones found in a gravel pit near Piltdown Common in Sussex, shortly before the First World War, have been exposed as fakes for more than half a century, yet even now we do not know the perpetrator’s identity or motive. Now research is under way that may at last reveal the identity of the forger or forgers, using a barrage of the latest forensic techniques. Today, the assembly of chocolate-brown objects known as “Piltdown Man” – skull and jaw fragments, mammal fossils and flint tools – resides in a safe in the Natural History Museum. But when it was revealed to the world at a meeting of the Geological Society of London on December 18 1912, it caused a sensation: this evidence of the world’s earliest known human, together with the tools he made and the animals he hunted, appeared to be no less than the evolutionary “missing link” between man and ape that Charles Darwin had predicted. The discovery had been made by a Sussex solicitor and amateur antiquarian, Charles Dawson, who brought his finds to his friend Dr Arthur Smith Woodward, the Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum. Although Smith Woodward’s expertise was in fossil fish, he staked his – and the museum’s – reputation on the find, which he named in honour of his friend: the Dawn Man of Dawson, or Eoanthropus dawsoni. When they made their presentation at that crowded meeting at the Geological Society, the atmosphere was intense. By the beginning of the 20th century, scientists had been obsessed by the origins of humanity for 50 years, but fossil finds were scarce. While samples of early man’s remains had been discovered at sites in France, Germany, Belgium and Java – some of great antiquity – nothing comparable had been found in Britain. So when Dawson and Smith Woodward announced their discovery, the excitement was immense: the earliest known human was British! Some of the world’s greatest scientists agreed that the discovery was probably “of equal, if not of greater consequence” than any fossils yet discovered here or abroad. Related Articles

Piltdown Man, with his human-like braincase and very apelike jaw, was exactly what the experts expected our ancestors to look like. In 1914, a large bone implement was found at the site, and it too was unique. Fashioned from the leg bone of an extinct elephant, it had a flat blade at one end, a point at the other. What no one could work out was what it was for. Reginald Smith, an antiquarian at the British Museum, voiced what everyone was probably thinking: he “could not imagine”, he said, “any use for an implement that looked like part of a cricket bat”. Still, taken together these finds created an extraordinary picture. Here was a fossil man, with his tools and contemporary animals, found in gravel that was thought to date from the early Ice Age, between 500,000 and 1 million years ago. Smith Woodward even visualised his everyday life, writing almost affectionately of what he ate, how he cooked, what he wore. “If he could be seen alive, he would be recognised at once as human,” he wrote in 1934, “but his stooping, stumpy, shuffling form would betray his lowly grade.”
Yet even in 1912, there were dissenting voices. Doubts were raised whether that apelike jaw and human skull could be from the same individual – or even the same species. Perhaps jaw and skull had accidentally come together in the gravel pit. The timely discovery of a canine tooth in 1913, which looked almost exactly like Smith Woodward’s predictions, strengthened the case for Piltdown Man. Then, in 1915, with more questions being raised, came another discovery. At a second site, two miles away, Dawson found more skull fragments and a tooth, similar to the original specimens. This was clear evidence of a second Dawn Man – and the doubters were silenced. Forty years later, with dating techniques having improved substantially, Piltdown Man was revealed to be a fraud. The skull was that of a modern human, a few centuries old; the jaw that of an orang-utan. It had been broken to hide identifying features and the teeth filed to resemble those of humans. In fact, almost every specimen in the collection had been stained to match the Piltdown gravels – and everything had been planted at the site. The newspapers splashed on the scandal, and what everyone wanted to know was who had done it – and why? Experts fumed, rightly, that this was far from a harmless hoax: it was a malicious deception that had hijacked our understanding of human origins. Yet its provenance remained obscure. There was no incriminating fingerprint or confessional letter to convict a perpetrator; all the evidence was purely circumstantial. With the centenary of the “discovery” approaching, a group of scientists – known unofficially as the Piltdowners – recently decided that it is time finally to expose the forger. Led by Professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum, the team is re-analysing all the Piltdown material, using a range of sophisticated techniques from DNA and isotope analysis to a high-resolution microscope. With this forensic arsenal, every facet of the forgery will be exposed. It is hoped that an identifying “signature” of the perpetrator will emerge – or, at the very least, that we will learn how many hands were at work and where the various specimens came from. What is already apparent is that the skills of the forger – or forgers – were vastly more sophisticated than had been suspected. For example, all the bones and stones appear to have been doctored to obscure any distinguishing characteristics. And the situation is complicated by the range of possible suspects. There is a long cast of characters associated with Piltdown – most of whom have been accused somewhere in the literature of committing the forgery. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, lived near Piltdown, played at Piltdown Golf Club – where Dawson was secretary – and was known to have visited the site. The Jesuit philosopher, and palaeontologist Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who worked on excavations alongside Dawson and Smith Woodward and discovered the all-important canine, has also been accused. Then again, so has Smith Woodward himself. Of course, the likeliest suspect has always been Charles Dawson himself. It was he who first brought the fossils to Smith Woodward, who found most of the material, and who is the only source for the second Piltdown man. After he died after a short illness in 1916, at the age of 52, nothing more was found at the site – although that did not stop Smith Woodward continuing to excavate the Piltdown gravels until old age and blindness ended his futile labours. For his part, Smith Woodward always described Dawson as an engaging, cheerful colleague. But many of those who knew him in Lewes, where he lived, not only had doubts about his character but also believed him capable of deception. It’s now known he forged many of his other archaeological finds What could his motive have been? Perhaps he wanted recognition, to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (his name was put forward in 1913, but it never happened). Yet all the evidence against him is circumstantial – and there remains the question of whether the solicitor would have had the skills to fool so many scientists for so long. Soon, the Piltdowners will have answers – but the complexities these experts are uncovering demonstrate, a century on, just why the great Piltdown mystery has taken so long to crack.

Ancelotti was widely reported as the front-runner to replace Jose Mourinho, who has returned to manage Ancelotti's former club Chelsea, at the Bernabeu despite being under contract with French champions Paris Saint-Germain. Real have not confirmed the length of contract handed to Ancelotti, or if any compensation has been paid to PSG, but a statement published on the club's website read: "Carlo Ancelotti will coach Real Madrid next season. "The Italian has experienced success in every country where he has managed and arrives in the Spanish capital after being named coach of the season in France."
Meanwhile, Ancelotti's former club confirmed: "Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to announce the appointment of Laurent Blanc as coach for the next two years. "He will take charge of the squad on July 1, 2013, for the start of preseason training."

Blanc managed Bordeaux before taking charge of France for two years until the end of Euro 2012. It was later confirmed that Ancelotti has been handed a three-year contract at the Bernabeu, with the signing to be formalised in the stadium's royal box at 1200 BST tomorrow before he holds his first press conference.
Former France manager Laurent Blanc, meanwhile, replaces the Italian at the Parc des Princes on a two-year deal.
A two-time Champions League winner with AC Milan, Ancelotti has won domestic league titles in three different countries during spells with the Rossoneri, Chelsea and PSG.
His eight-year stint at San Siro, where he had previously enjoyed five successful season as a player, also saw him claim the Serie A title, two UEFA Super Cups, the Club World Cup, two Coppa Italia trophies and the Italian Supercoppa alongside Champions League triumphs in 2003 and 2007.
A move to Chelsea to succeed Guus Hiddink materialised in 2009 and, after lifting the Community Shield in his first competitive game as Blues boss, he guided the Londoners to a league and FA Cup double in 2010. He was, however, sacked in May 2011 after Manchester United reclaimed the Premier League title.
After six months out of the game, ambitious PSG lured Ancelotti to Paris in December 2011 and he clinched the Ligue 1 title at the end of his first full season in charge.
Real's priority remains securing the Champions League trophy for the first time since 2002 and Ancelotti's record in the competition is likely to have helped him edge out his rivals for the position.
The club are also determined to reclaim the Primera Division title from Barcelona after Mourinho's last season in charge saw Real finish a disappointing 15 points shy of the Catalans.
