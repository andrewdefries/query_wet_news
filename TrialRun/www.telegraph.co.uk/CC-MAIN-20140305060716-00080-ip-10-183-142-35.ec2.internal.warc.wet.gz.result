Huge rise in schools offering 'tough' GCSE alternative
The number of schools dropping GCSEs in favour of alternative exams modelled on the old O-level has soared by three-quarters in just 12 months. Record numbers of students took International GCSEs this year. Photo: PA	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor
5:55PM BST 11 Aug 2011
Comments
Figures show that almost 1,500 schools offered the International GCSE this year compared with 855 in 2010. The rise comes after the Coalition lifted Labour’s restrictions on state schools staging the qualification, which is already hugely popular in the private sector. Many schools claim the exams are more rigorous than conventional qualifications because coursework is scrapped and assessment of pupils is based entirely on an end-of-school exam. They have been likened to O-levels, which were replaced by GCSEs in Britain in the 80s. IGCSEs are principally offered by two British exam boards – Edexcel and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). According to figures, the most popular subjects this year are English and mathematics – seen as the backbone to a decent academic education. Related Articles

Edexcel entries in maths have doubled in just 12 months, the data shows. A spokesman said: “The increase in take up of IGCSEs supports our view that it is essential that students are able to choose the qualifications to suit their style of learning.”
In almost all cases, schools offer IGCSEs in certain subjects while offering mainstream GCSEs in others. Ann Puntis, chief executive of CIE, part of Cambridge University, said: “We have seen another large increase in entry numbers this year. It is designed by a world-class university to be a world-class programme.”
Figures show that 945 schools offered the IGCSE through Edexcel this year compared with 505 a year earlier – a rise of 87 per cent. Students sat 56,136 qualifications, an increase of more than a third. According to CIE, 198 state schools offered its IGCSE course this year, compared with around 50 last year. A further 350 private schools offered it – up from 300 in 2010. Education News

Thorntons sees sales fall 3pc as Britons continue to scale back
Britain may be a nation of chocoholics but our love of the sweet stuff has failed to stem a 3pc fall in sales at Thorntons.

The struggling high street retailer, which is closing 180 stores over three years, said Britons were continuing to tighten their purse strings.
Strong sales of Easter eggs provided a small boost to third-quarter trading but this was offset by weaker demand for the chocolatier's regular ranges.
The company also blamed its ongoing programme of store closures for the 2.7pc decrease in sales to £62.4m during the 16 weeks to April 28.
It closed a further 11 branches during the period as it aims to shrink its number of stores by a third.
Without the closure programme, sales would have been "broadly flat", the company said.

Chocolate retailer Thorntons to close 120 stores
28 Jun 2011
Jonathan Hart, chief executive of Thorntons, said sales to supermarkets - which the company describes as its "commercial channel" - were particularly affected by the depressed economic environment.
"We saw a good performance at Easter across all our channels and were pleased by our customers' response to our new spring seasonal line," Mr Hart said.
"However, sales of our all-year-round products in the commercial channel were lower as the difficult consumer environment continues.
"We continue to focus on restoring profitability and we are seeing early signs of progress resulting in an overall satisfactory trading performance."
The chocolatier, which was founded by Joseph William Thornton in 1911, has had a torrid time as shoppers have either traded up to more expensive products or bought cheaper bars.
It was forced to discount heavily over Christmas to encourage customers to part with their cash - a strategy that resulted in it scrapping its half-year dividend in February.

Men 'overconfident' on icy winter roads
Men are overconfident when driving on icy roads and more prone to crashing than women, a new survey reveals today. Sixty-two per cent of motorists have never received instruction in skid control techniques Photo: Getty Images	By Telegraph Reporters
4:39PM GMT 23 Jan 2013
Follow Comments
Male motorists are more likely to claim winter weather prowess at the wheel but they have a higher number of accidents when temperatures plunge.
A poll of 2,000 drivers found that 73 per cent boast that they can control a skid on ice compared to just 60 per cent of women.
But 47 per cent admit they have lost control on frozen roads compared to 41 per cent of women drivers.
And 15 per cent confess to crashing in sub-zero 'ice rink' conditions compared to just 11 per cent of women.
The survey commissioned by online car insurer elephant.co.uk suggests that women are much less likely to venture out in the snow - 70 per cent leave the car at home compared to 48 per cent of men.

Of those women who do get behind the wheel, 91 per cent say they drive more slowly and take greater care - eight per cent more than men.
"It is alarming that a minority of drivers appear to make no attempt to drive more cautiously in icy conditions," said elephant.co.uk's managing director Brian Martin.
"It is also worrying that men have a greater tendency towards overconfidence in their own ability but are more likely than women drivers to lose control of their car and crash.
"Our survey suggests that men, in particular, need to take more care when driving during severe winter weather."
Overall, the survey found that 68 per cent of drivers do not know how to spot black ice - stretches of tarmac which look wet but are really frozen over.
Sixty-two per cent of motorists have never received instruction in skid control techniques and 85 per cent said it should be included in driving lessons.
Mr Martin advised motorists to be prepared and said a winter driving information film presented by former rally driver Andrew McKenna has been posted on his firm's website.
"Accidents can happen to anyone when temperatures drop and roads get icy but you can reduce your chances of a collision," said Martin.
"Taking extra care, finding out how to spot black ice and learning the best way to control your car if you do skid will go a long way to keep you safe if you have to drive." Motoring News

'We're having a baby!' Grandmother-to-be's joy at daughter's pregnancy goes viral
A woman in Canada has become an internet star after her daughter filmed her mother's reaction to the news that she was about to become a grandmother. 2:50PM GMT 25 Jan 2013
Shirley Brown's daughter Jocelyn decided to tell her family in Nova Scotia that she was expecting a child by wrapping up four wooden blocks which, put together, would spell out the word "baby". She gave one each to four of her relatives, and waited for the penny to drop. Once it did, her 60-year-old mother Shirley could not have been more excited. Throwing the block into the air she began crying and screamed: "We're having a baby!"
The video of the grandmother-to-be's reaction has become an internet hit, and has been viewed nearly 200,000 times since it was posted on YouTube. Mrs Brown told the Canadian television network CTV that she did not know that she was being filmed and found her sudden fame rather "embarrassing". Related Articles

William Hague turns pink with embarrassment after his Libyan tour goes wrong
How unfortunate to see a British Foreign Secretary being made to look like ropey travel agent whose ill-conceived arrangements have broken down. William Hague found himself forced to explain why the North African spring break which he had arranged, or at least sanctioned, had to be cancelled after his entire tour group was arrested in the middle of the night while looking for a hotel.
By Andrew Gimson
6:29PM GMT 07 Mar 2011
In fairness to Mr Hague, we fear he was misled by his local agent in Libya, who somehow convinced him that the way to find accommodation in this region is to arrive under cover of darkness by helicopter in an out-of-the-way spot, rather than take the less dramatic option of asking one’s taxi driver if he can recommend somewhere.
But the unwelcome task of taking responsibility for this debacle fell on Mr Hague. The Foreign Secretary attempted, by the use of official language, to downplay the embarrassing circumstances which attended the brief, unhappy visit of his group to Libya: “They were withdrawn yesterday after a serious misunderstanding about their role leading to their temporary detention.”
When Mr Hague reached the words “serious misunderstanding”, derisive laughter broke out on the Labour benches. To cover such official bungling, this official euphemism was inadequate to the point of absurdity.
Douglas Alexander, on the Labour front bench, took full advantage of Mr Hague’s embarrassment, seizing the chance to ask whether, if a new neighbour moved into the Foreign Secretary’s street, “he would introduce himself by ringing the doorbell or instead introduce himself by climbing over the fence in the middle of the night”.
Mr Hague flushed, for the analogy caught all too well the furtive and mistrustful aspect of the mission. The Foreign Secretary had virtually no hair to cover his blushes, and virtually no arguments.

Missing my mojo? Of course not
13 Mar 2011
Sir Menzies Campbell, who was defenestrated by the Liberal Democrats from the leadership of their party for sounding out of touch, said he regretted what he was going to say, but the mission was “ill-conceived, poor planned and embarrassingly executed”. If the Lib Dems ever decide to defenestrate Nick Clegg, perhaps they should bring back Sir Menzies.
The one defect of the Opposition’s attack on Mr Hague was that many of Labour’s attack dogs (though not Mr Alexander himself) looked far happier than they should have done that things had gone so wrong. As Sir Menzies showed, this kind of criticism sounds better when spoken in sorrow.
Mr Hague gained some credit for taking the attack so directly on the chin, without appearing to wriggle out of his responsibility for what had gone wrong. Bernard Jenkin (Con, Harwich and North Essex) came to the Foreign Secretary’s defence by saying that a minister is entitled to “take credit for the operations that go right” as well as blame for those that miscarry: to which Mr Hague replied that having had four years’ experience of leading the Conservative party, “I’ve never heard of this doctrine before”.
Sympathetic laughter broke out, some of it on the Labour benches. A number of Tory backbenchers took the failed mission as a useful warning, in the words of John Baron (C, Basildon and Billericay), that “we should stop meddling in other people’s affairs”. This discussion would have been many times more difficult for Mr Hague if his people were still detained in Benghazi. But the good news is that the members of Mr Hague’s tour party are on their way back to Hereford, with the first part of their journey accomplished aboard HMS Cumberland.
But some people are never happy, and Mr Baron objected that we had rescued our people from a Muslim country on a ship “named after a pork sausage”. Nick Clegg

You don't get many properties more fairytale than this Renaissance château, built on the ruins of a medieval fortress and overlooking the countryside outside Reims. There's a drawbridge, moats (though sadly dry), and even a special ramp to help your horses walk up to the upper terrace. What will they think of next?

Brendan Rodgers: I decide Liverpool signings

Owners Fenway Sports Group had initially wanted the Reds boss to operate under a director of football but those plans were shelved in favour of a committee-style set-up. That group includes Rodgers, head of recruitment Dave Fallows and chief scout Barry Hunter (both recruited from Manchester City in the autumn) as well as head of analysis Michael Edwards. However, Rodgers insists while the job of the panel is to identify targets it is he who makes the final choice, although ultimately FSG's financial backing is the deciding factor. That came to the fore in the summer when the Americans refused to sanction a deal for Fulham's Clint Dempsey as they believed he was over-priced for a then 29-year-old and he moved to Tottenham to leave Liverpool short of options up front. "There is absolutely no way a player will come in here if I don't want him," Rodgers told the Liverpool Echo. Related Articles

"I will always be the first person it comes to. That's not being arrogant, that's how we operate here and how it works in this country. "Abroad it works differently where you have a coach and the club will bring in the players. The coach then works with the players he's given. "A lot has been made of it but the fact is the process that happens here is no different to what happens at other English clubs. "We have a number of people, scouting staff and analysts, who will look for targets who fit the profile of the players that we want. "Then I will sit down with those guys, look at those targets and make a shortlist from that. "All that work that goes on is of great help to me. We identify players, gather all the information we possibly can and then if they're right for what we need it comes down to whether they are affordable and available. "I know the club will go and do the best it can to get the players we want. "But it's very clear that anyone we sign will be because I want him here."
Liverpool are to show appreciation to Everton for their long-standing support of the Hillsborough justice campaign at Sunday's Merseyside derby. Fans in the Kop will hold up 12,390 cards to spell out the word 'Thanks'. "I want to take the opportunity to thank (chairman) Bill Kenwright and Everton fans for their continued support for the families and victims of the Hillsborough disaster," Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre told liverpoolfc.com. "It is the coming together of the families, supporters and the city that has made the huge breakthroughs of the last 12 months possible. "Rivalry on the pitch and banter on the terraces are healthy things and are an important part of being a football supporter in this city. They are an important part of the derby atmosphere. "However, it is the unity of both clubs and both sets of supporters when it's most needed that make our relationship so unique."
Everton paid their own memorable tribute to the justice campaign at Goodison Park last year following the publication of the independent report into the 1989 disaster in which 96 fans died and Kenwright made a moving speech at last month's annual memorial service at Anfield. (edited by Lucy Kinder)

Tiger Woods makes the cut as Justin Rose takes the lead at the AT&T National
Justin Rose moved to the top of the leaderboard at the AT&T National with a stunning second round of 64, while Tiger Woods' level-par 70 was just good enough to make the cut in Pennsylvania.

1:00AM BST 03 Jul 2010
Woods' opening round of 73 had left the world number one seven shots adrift after round one and in danger of not making the cut, but the defending champion's 143 total saw him squeeze into the weekend.
For the second day running, he was left frustrated by his putting.
''I drove the ball on a string the last two days and haven't gotten anything out of it,'' said the 34-year-old.
''When you're not making any putts, what are you going to do? No matter how good I drive it, it doesn't matter; the putts aren't going in. I've just got to putt better.''
Rose, meanwhile, relinquished a three-shot advantage on the final day of the Travelers Championship in Connecticut last week, but put that disappointment aside with a bogey-free six-under-par 18 holes at the Aronimink Golf Club.

The 29-year-old will head into Saturday's third round seven under overall - a shot ahead of South Korea's Charlie Wi and Australia's joint overnight leader Jason Day, who carded 65 and 69 respectively on Friday.
Rose said: ''I think mentally probably it was one of my better rounds of golf. It just felt very patient. Even when I didn't hit a good shot, I accepted it.
''I didn't try to force the issue and get bullied by the golf course. So from that perspective things clicked today.''
Rose remains wary of Woods despite his 10-shot cushion over the American.
''There's definitely a presence,'' he said. ''If he gets charging and he gets near the top of the leaderboard, he still has a presence - no doubt about it.''
American pair Charley Hoffman (67) and Jeff Overton (68) were three strokes off the pace with world number 14 Robert Allenby of Australia one of eight players tied for sixth a further shot back.
Day's fellow first-round leaders Nick Watney (71), Arjun Atwal (72) and Joe Ogilvie (72) slipped down the leaderboard after failing to match their Thursday exploits.
England's Greg Owen, who like compatriot Rose fired 69 on Thursday, missed the cut by one after dropping five shots on his last five holes en route to a five-over-par 75 on Friday.

America's Cup to go ahead despite death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson The organisers of the America's Cup have confirmed the 2013 event will go ahead despite the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson, and have appointed a review committee to look into the tragedy. Tragedy: the Artemis Racing AC-72 catamaran that capsized, killing Andrew Simpson Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Telegraph Sport, and agencies
7:42AM BST 15 May 2013
Follow The 36-year-old sailor died after being trapped under water when his Artemis yacht capsized and broke up last Thursday. An investigation has already been launched into the training accident ahead of the 34th America's Cup, which is set to begin on September 7 in San Francisco Bay. Tom Ehman, the vice-commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club (the America's Cup Trustee), said: "The America's Cup will go ahead this summer. "We will see the world's best sailors racing at the highest level on one of the most iconic race tracks in sport." The race will be between defending champions Oracle and the winner of the challenger series with Sweden-based Artemis, Team New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa. Related Articles

10 May 2013
America's Cup bosses met with representatives from the four teams today to announce they had appointed a panel to look into safety at the race, with San Francisco police investigating the circumstances surrounding Simpson's death. The committee will look into training and racing of the AC72 yachts for the 2013 version of the race. A statement on the official America's Cup website read: "The review committee will make its recommendations following the loss of Artemis Racing crew member Andrew 'Bart' Simpson (GBR) in a training accident on San Francisco Bay on Thursday of last week. "Members of the committee have strong backgrounds in the sport at its highest levels as well as involvement in other reviews where an incident at sea has claimed the life of a competitor." Ehman added: "The committee brings immense experience and expertise to this review. At a meeting in San Francisco this morning (Tuesday), the teams expressed unanimous support for this committee and this process." Australian Iain Murray, the Regatta director, will chair and lead the review committee which will also feature Sally Lindsay Honey (USA, deputy chair), John Craig (USA), Chuck Hawley (USA), Vincent Lauriot-Prevost (France) and Jim Farmer QC (New Zealand). The statement continued: "The US Coast Guard supports this approach and will assist as appropriate. "Lt Jon Lane, with 26 years in the Coast Guard and 10 years experience as a marine casualty investigator, will serve as liaison." Simpson won a gold medal in the Star class at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and took silver at the London Olympics in the summer in the same class. He was also a medal winner in the world and European championships but had decided to switch to the America's Cup to take on a new challenge. (Edited by Nick Pearce)

'I want to find the perfect wife for my father'
Since her mother left home when she was four, Laura Pullman has spent her life trying to ensure her father’s happiness, including tracking down a wife
Matchmaker: Laura Pullman has spent two decades checking lonely hearts ads on behalf of her father Nigel Photo: Clara Molden	By Laura Pullman

Comments
For almost two decades, I’ve scanned lonely heart ads convinced the perfect woman is out there – a kind, cheerful and well-educated Twiggy lookalike. But despite my best efforts, I’ve still not found a wife for my father, Nigel. The search began when I was seven – three years after my mother left us to run off with her boss. Eighteen years later, my wife-hunt has gained urgency, as sooner rather than later I must move out and leave my father to fend for himself. Selfishly, I want someone to take over in keeping Nigel company and keeping him fed. It’s a role I’ve enjoyed for as long as I can remember. For the first few years after Mum left, Dad had no girlfriend and the two of us muddled along happily. Many years later he confided how stressful he found sudden single parenthood, but at the time he didn’t let on. He’d march me to school (I’d run to keep up with his long stride) before rushing to work as a marketing director at the Financial Times. In the evenings, supper alternated between tomato pasta and cheesy pasta. Dad’s homemade spag bol was a special treat every Saturday, which we’d wolf down in front of the television show Blind Date. “Daddy, would you choose woman one, two or three?” I’d quiz. Although I was already curious about what I termed “Daddy’s love life”, my search for a girlfriend for him was only really triggered in 1995, the evening we watched Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic classic in which a young boy calls a radio talk-show to find a new wife for his bereaved and brokenhearted dad, Sam (Tom Hanks). Annie (Meg Ryan) hears the appeal, deserts her dull fiancé to track down Sam and the two fall in love. I watched the film endlessly, fantasising about Meg moving from the Hollywood Hills to our flat in Notting Hill, and settling down with Dad. As an added bonus, I’d also have a glamorous mother to show off at the school gates. Although I never did go on the radio to set up Dad (partly because he wasn’t miserable like Hanks), I was still determined to find him a girlfriend. Related Articles

The search began when Laura, aged eight, top, saw 'Sleepless in Seattle’
Rather than reading the back of cereal boxes over breakfasts, I’d browse the personal ads in The Spectator and Private Eye (Dad’s favourite magazines). Any women who fitted my Meg Ryan mould were circled in red felt tip. Those who described themselves as “blonde”, “glamorous” or “beautiful” were immediately shoved under Dad’s nose. Not unreasonably, he’d ignore my proposals and refuse to get in touch with any of them. However, a few years ago, I found myself glancing at the lonely heart ads once again and spotted a seemingly ideal match. I finally managed to persuade Dad to contact this solitary stranger. I’m not sure who was more disappointed when the “fun-loving sailing fan, 56” didn’t even reply to Dad’s email. “Well, that’s my dignity out the window,” he joked. As I grew up, no girlfriend ever moved into our home, and so I quickly became the woman of the household. A headstrong eight-year-old, I took charge of cooking while Dad was tasked with clearing up. The first supper I attempted alone was spaghetti carbonara (with the sauce straight from a jar). I launched a strand of spaghetti against the wall. It was cooked. So, I poured the sauce into the pan without realising that you first had to put the pasta through a colander. No matter. We just drained the watery, saucy pasta and tucked in. Slowly but surely I improved in the kitchen and soon enough had a small recipe repertoire to rescue us from the weekday pasta rotation. Indeed, with just the two of us, I became a quasi-wife. By 11 years old, I could knock up a lasagne, sew on school name tapes and was well acquainted with the washing machine. More importantly, we lent each other an ear, a shoulder to cry on or a sounding board. On countless nights we’d chew the fat, often well past my bedtime. We were proud of our closeness and our motto was (and remains): “We make a good team.” Dad and I would also chant this ironically when things went pear-shaped. The Sundays we failed to buy food before the shops closed, for example, and after every long holiday when we forgot (yet again) to buy me new school uniform. On the hunt (CLARA MOLDEN)
In 2000, our relationship became even stronger when Dad suddenly had to undergo a quadruple heart bypass. He kept me in the dark about how serious the operation was and I happily stayed with my aunt until Dad left hospital. But when he returned home a carer came to stay with us. Another woman looking after my father made me fiercely territorial and I quickly stepped up my assumed duties. I learnt to iron, nagged about his low-cholesterol diet and badgered him into gentle exercise. While I wanted Dad to have a girlfriend, I wasn’t having a total stranger look after him under my roof. By the time I left home to start boarding at Marlborough College aged 13, Dad had recovered. (Honestly, ladies, he is fit and healthy now.) He’d visit most weekends and whenever I was home I’d fill the freezer with homemade pies, stews and curries. When supplies were low I’d phone to check what Dad had eaten for supper. One memorable response: “There’s not much in the fridge so I had hot cross buns with hummus.”
It wasn’t that Dad couldn’t cook at all, he just thought making a meal for one was an unnecessary palaver. I needed to find him a woman who would make him raise his game. So it was at Marlborough where I first attempted to pair up Dad with my friends’ single mums. My friend Holly and I still laugh about meeting on the first day of school. “Are your parents divorced?” I asked immediately after introducing myself. She quietly confided that her mum and dad were right in the middle of separating. “Great,” I replied, “so I can set up your mum with my dad and then we’ll be sisters.” Twelve years later, my dad is resolutely single while Holly’s Mum got married this August. Although that particular match-make didn’t work, I did have one triumph with this method, which resulted in Dad going out with my classmate Charlie’s mum for a few happy years. (And though they’re not together now, they remain good friends.) Another sort-of success came after leaving school when I persuaded Dad to go on a blind date. Aged 18, I was working as a chalet girl in France when a lovely family arrived as guests – three grown-up children and their divorced mum, Anna. She was friendly, interesting and pretty – just Dad’s type. Rapidly hatching a plan, I gushed about Dad all week. As soon as Anna flew back to England, I called home and talked Dad into taking her out for dinner. I advised what he should wear (blue chinos, crisp white shirt, smart loafers) and where he should take her (a popular but not overly trendy restaurant). To my delight, the date went fine and led to a second before Dad backed out. He gave me two reasons for extricating himself: “We didn’t really click and she only talked about herself.” I should declare here that my father is a man who enjoys talking about himself. “Well that’s enough about you, let’s talk about me,” he often jokes. (Readers, I assure you he’s a good listener, too.) Old habits die hard and I still instinctively look for a wedding ring on every woman I meet (of a certain age, of course) and just last weekend was plotting my latest matchmake with a new friend’s mum. Recalling Dad’s romantic history, he’s had six serious relationships and a (respectable) handful of shorter-term ones over the past 21 years. But, for various reasons including basic incompatibility and geographical location, none of them lasted. I believe a lot of the blame for Dad’s failed romantic endeavours lies at his own door. First, his standards are too high. While I’m searching for a wonderful partner for him, he’s on a quest to find the holy grail. He envisages an attractive woman who’ll enjoy his main interests of sailing and opera while also having the same thrifty outlook on life. Ideally, he wants them to live conveniently close while still allowing him plenty of independence. As he is in his seventh decade and lacks both George Clooney’s looks and money, I believe he should stop seeking dizzying romance, be more realistic and make compatibility his goal. Another problem, paradoxically, is that these lofty standards seemingly disappear the moment a new woman flatters him. Like so many men, if an attractive lady cheerfully listens to all his stories and laughs at his jokes, then he is far more likely to fall into a relationship with them. Pausing to assess their suitability doesn’t come into it. Furthermore, he’s become somewhat stuck in his ways. For example, he bizarrely prefers instant Nescafé to real coffee and quietly grumbles when girlfriends insist on digging out our dusty cafetière. I once accused Dad of not compromising enough with a now ex-girlfriend and he indignantly argued: ''But I even changed my coffee for her!’’
Recently I’ve had to consider that I might have been more hindrance than help in my dad’s love life. I wondered what the man himself made of this hypothesis? “Absolutely, you were a hindrance,” he laughed. “In the early years I was busy enough keeping one girl happy, I couldn’t even fathom having enough time for another. “And later whenever a new girlfriend came on the scene you sent a signal, loud and clear, that the home was your patch and I was yours.”
Indignant about the second point, I recalled how welcoming I’d been to new girlfriends, especially over the past five years. But despite being chatty and polite to these women, I’d apparently made it subliminally clear to Dad if I didn’t approve. “Just like fathers think their daughter’s boyfriends will never be quite good enough, you think there’s no one good enough for me.”
I have to concede that. I do put Dad on a very high pedestal — but rightly so. Among other qualities he is thoughtful, kind, and wise. Within his wide group of friends, Nigel Pullman’s stories are legendary – implausibly long but unfailingly funny. Yes, it’ll be a special woman who I deem worthy of my dad but, 18 years after my search began, I’m still convinced there’s one out there. laura.pullman@gmail.com
