Student leaders impose restrictions on Remembrance service
A row has erupted after the University of London Union banned senior officers from representing fellow students at a major Remembrance Sunday ceremony

Comments
Student leaders sparked controversy today after banning members from attending a Remembrance Sunday service in an official capacity. The University of London Union, which represents students across the capital, was branded disrespectful following a decision to effectively bar senior officers from an annual ceremony. Members of the union’s ruling senate voted in favour of a motion prohibiting officials and staff from the service if they “claim to be representing ULU as an organisation”. Elected representatives will be able to attend the University of London ceremony in a personal capacity but would not be allowed to speak on behalf of fellow students. The move comes just 12 months after a similar snub by a senior ULU member. Related Articles

Student union leader: 'Wreath is against my principles'
14 Nov 2012
In 2012, Daniel Cooper, the vice-president, declined an invitation to lay a Remembrance Sunday wreath due to his "socialist principles". He said at the time that the conflict was a "colonial scramble for possessions, markets and resources amongst the major nations" and "legalised mass slaughter". His response drew criticism from hundreds of students and sparked a "Dan Cooper Must Resign" Facebook page. The ULU is the biggest organisation of its kind in Europe – representing 120,000 students from the various colleges that combine to form the University of London. Michael Chessum, president of ULU, confirmed that he would not be at this year’s event. The ULU motion passed by the senate said that "while of course many of those who participate have different views, official 'Remembrance' ceremonies and the campaign around them glorify and justify Britain's role in world politics and British militarism, as well as ignoring the treatment of British soldiers by the military command". It also said that the ULU has a "proud tradition of opposing war and militarism, a tradition we should continue now". Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Chessum said: "ULU has democratically established a policy on its engagement with official Remembrance which leaves room for officers and students to act freely. "Either attending or not attending official ceremonies is a political act. "Personally, I will commemorate the dead killed in war by fighting for peace and challenging the policies of governments, not by standing next to war criminals like Tony Blair on plinths, pretending that these acts are 'triumphant'." But the move to bar fellow officers in an official capacity provoked a backlash among other students. Louisa Townson, president of the Conservative Society at University College London, criticised the “outright delusional arrogance of this senate clique that wishes to impose this view on 120,000 students and say no one may represent ULU at the service”. “I find it amazing that when convenient they shout from the rooftops about the sheer number they represent, but on a topic like this expediently silence them,” she said. “Students overwhelmingly want their union to pay respect, not just to fallen students in years gone by, but to give thanks to those that lost their lives to protect the rights and liberties we hold dear today.”
Remembrance Sunday – held this year on November 10 – traditionally marks the anniversary of the end of hostilities in the First World War. It is held to commemorate the contribution of servicemen and women in the two World Wars as well as other conflicts. Jay Stoll, general secretary of the London School of Economics Students’ Union, said in a letter to his university’s student newspaper that he owed “everything to those who made the ultimate sacrifice”. “Whilst clearly people are free to not attend such a service, putting a blanket ban on representatives attending in an official capacity is utterly absurd,” he said.

Jude Law protests against Russian piracy charges for Greenpeace activists
The Hollywood star was joined by musician Damon Albarn and fellow thespians Imelda Staunton and Jim Carter outside the Russian Embassy in London to demonstrate against piracy charges faced by Greenpeace activists protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic circle.
12:01PM BST 06 Oct 2013
Rock stars and celebrities joined a worldwide vigil in support of 30 Greenpeace activists whose jailing by Russia after a protest against Arctic oil drilling sparked a new row between Moscow and the West.
Actors Jude Law, Imelda Staunton, Downton Abbey star Jim Carter and musician Damon Albarn, frontman of British band Blur, joined about 1,000 people gathered outside the Russian embassy in London, as other protesters rallied in cities across the world.
Pressure has been mounting on Russia from activists and governments shocked by Moscow's decision to level piracy charges against Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise crew.
Jude Law voiced support for his friend Frank Hewetson, one of the activists.
He called the piracy charges "ludicrous".

But Russia displayed little inclination to show leniency as it hit out at both Greenpeace and the Dutch government under whose flag the environmental lobby group's ship sailed.
"Everything that happened with the Arctic Sunrise is a pure provocation," said Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov.
Russian authorities impounded the 950-tonne icebreaker last month after it approached the world's first oil rig in the pristine Barents Sea - the focus of energy companies from around the world.
A court in Russia's northwestern region of Murmansk has since charged all the crew members - who come from 18 countries including Britain and the United States - with offences that carry jail terms of up to 15 years.
The incident has set off a burgeoning diplomatic effort to secure the activists' release despite Russia's tough stance.
The Netherlands broke more than two weeks of silence about the case on Friday by starting legal action under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea aimed at quickly freeing the crew.
Mr Meshkov fired back Saturday that the Dutch had been repeatedly warned about the dangers of the ship's actions.
"In the past year-and-a-half, Russia has asked the Dutch side on many occasions... to forbid this ship's actions," he told the RIA Novosti news agency.
But several governments now appear ready to add the Greenpeace detentions to their growing log of complaints about Russia's treatment of human rights issues under President Vladimir Putin.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she had expressed concern about her country's crew member during talks with another Russian deputy foreign minister on the sidelines of a regional forum in Bali.
The US State Department also said it was "monitoring the case very closely". Source: AFP, video footage courtesy of Greenpeace

Is six-year-old Oscar Piper the next Tom Daley?
Olympic medallist Tom Daley believes this boy from Cornwall could be the "next big thing" in British diving. 11:00AM GMT 24 Jan 2013
Comments
Oscar Piper is just six years old, but he has been training with Tom Daley at the Plymouth Diving Centre since he was four. Despite only being 3ft 5 ins tall, he is already able to leap from 10m boards, and Daley calls him "the coolest six-year-old I know". Oscar, who is from Torpoint in Cornwall, had hoped to appear as a guest performer on Daley's Saturday night talent show "Splash!" but was told by producers that he was too young. To make up for the disappointment, Tom Daley decided to tweet a video of his protege in action.

ITV said it had been working with the government to reform the set of broadcasting restrictions that prevented him from appearing live. Oscar's mother Ali, 42, revealed that her son had spent weeks preparing for the appearance: "Oscar was absolutely devastated. He was in tears. Appearing on TV with your idol is something you would remember for the rest of your life." To make up for the disappointment, Tom Daley decided to tweet a video of his protege in action.
Oscar is not the only member of his family hoping to become a star in the pool, his older sister Evangeline and brother Ollie are both keen divers and swimmers. Source: SWNS
