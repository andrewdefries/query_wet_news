Michael Gove: I've no idea which of my staff called Tim Loughton a lazy, incompetent narcissist Michael Gove distanced himself from a highly critical briefing against a former ministerial colleague today and denied knowing who had spoken out.
Tim Loughton, the former children's minister 12:20PM GMT 23 Jan 2013
But the Education Secretary repeatedly refused to commit to quizzing special advisers over whether they were involved, and it emerged there might be no internal inquiry.
A vicious spat erupted last week when Tim Loughton - sacked as children's minister in the last reshuffle - was denounced as a "lazy, incompetent narcissist obsessed only with self-promotion".
The briefing to the Spectator magazine by a Department for Education source came in retaliation for the ex-minister savaging the DfE as inefficient and bureaucratic.
In evidence to the education select committee, Mr Loughton likened Mr Gove to Mr Grace, the department store owner in the TV sitcom Are You Being Served?, who barely knew the people who worked for him.
Quizzed about the briefing at his own appearance before the committee, Mr Gove rejected the criticisms of his Tory colleague and condemned the briefing.

"I don't know who made that comment; I don't know who made that briefing," he told them.
"Tim Loughton, far from being lazy, was an active and energetic minister and remains an active and energetic advocate of children's rights.
"Far from being incompetent, he was a talented and effective minister who made a difference.
"And far from being a narcissist, one of the things I found about Tim and find about Tim, is that he has a good sense of humour and a capacity both to laugh at himself and the foibles of the political world."
Mr Gove said hostile briefings were part and parcel of politics and usually had to be faced "with equanimity".
But he added: "On this occasion the person on the receiving end is someone who gave and continues to give distinguished public service, so I think it is wrong."
"I would condemn it, I would say that it was wrong, and I would say to everyone in the department that that sort of behaviour helps no one, takes us all away from the work that we want to do."
Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg has called for a formal Whitehall inquiry to discover if there had been breach of rules against personal attacks by civil servants and political advisers.
Permanent secretary Chris Wormald said he was still considering the "appropriate response" but that it would be, unlike in leak inquiries involving physical information in documents or emails, "extremely difficult to trace" who had delivered a verbal briefing.
Mr Gove was repeatedly pressed by committee chairman, Tory Graham Stuart, to commit to gathering his special advisers and asking each if they had been responsible.
The Cabinet minister declined to say that he would do so, claiming he could be open to libel claims if he suggested one group was more likely than another to be responsible. Mr Gove told the MPs: "If it were possible to establish beyond doubt the circumstances and the origin of this, then of course disciplinary action would be appropriate."
He pointed out that it was not him who sacked Mr Loughton but David Cameron.
Asked if he was consulted over the reshuffle, he added: "Reshuffles are never easy. The job of Prime Minister is never easy.
"I think the Prime Minister's decisions about appointments are always right." Politics
