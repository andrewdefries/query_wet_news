Everything you wanted to know about US hit reality series Duck Dynasty
As ITV buys a controlling stake in US reality TV production company Gurney, we provide a guide to their biggest hit show Duck Dynasty. Duck Dynasty is a reality television series on us TV channel Arts & Entertainment Network (A&E) 11:38AM GMT 22 Dec 2012
Comments
So, what’s it about, ducks?
In part. Duck Dynasty is a reality television series on us TV channel Arts & Entertainment Network (A&E). It charts the lives of the “redneck” Robertson family, who went from poverty to vast wealth because of the sales of their duck calls, with the “Duck Commander” being their most successful product. Despite their wealth, they still live the good ol' boys lifestyle. What on earth is a duck call?
A small whistle-like device that produces a “quack” noise when blown. It is used by hunters to lure ducks out in the open so they can be shot. Related Articles

Tell me, how did the Robertson business start?
According to family legend, patriarch Phil rejected a successful career in American football to spend 25 years in a dilapidated shed making duck calls. He invented the Duck Commander in 1972. Is it popular?
Oh yes. The final show of the second series, which was broadcast a couple of weeks ago, provided A&E with its most watched TV programme of all time, with 6.5m viewers. It even beat viewing figures for Simon Cowell’s X-factor USA. Is it real?
Duck Dynasty is a “scripted reality” show similar to The Only Way Is Essex and Made in Chelsea, which have proved big hits in the UK. Are the Robertson’s benefiting?
Yes. Duck Commander has processed more than 80,000 orders since October for merchandise such as duck calls, hats, “Uncle Si tea glasses”, miniature duck call necklaces, T-shirts and flip flops. Go on then, famous quotes?
“If you’re too busy to duck hunt, you’re too busy.” “If you catch squirrels for your woman she will never cut you off in bed.” “Redneck rule number one, most things can be fixed by duct tape and extension cords.” “I once got handed-down underwear and a paper clip for Christmas – and it was a great gift.” TV and Radio

JRR Tolkien's grumpy holiday letter sells for £1,700
A grumpy letter from the author JRR Tolkien in which he moans about a "disgusting" and "costly" holiday has sold for £1,700 at auction.
Adrian Rathbone, an associate at Richard Winterton's, said the letter had been found unexpectedly by the seller Photo: NTI	11:29AM GMT 30 Jan 2012
The hand-written note - addressed to a couple Tolkien had met on a particularly disastrous holiday with his wife - sold on to an unnamed internet bidder at Richard Winterton auctioneers, in Lichfield, Staffs. But as the seller's family had no apparent links to the Lord of the Rings author, mystery surrounds the origins of the revealing letter.
It describes a holiday Tolkien and his wife took in 1963, although not a happy one he talks about his delight at meeting the couple, who he addresses "My Dear People".
Tolkien goes on describe his and his wife's health, a 'disastrous holiday' and to thank the recipients for their 'company and kindness'. Accompanying the letter is a Christmas card with photograph of Tolkien flanked by his holiday companions, Wilfrid and Nora.
"I meant to send this letter to welcome you home," writes the Hobbit author. "But both of us have been feeling ill. Related Articles

"I am feeling better now, but I am afraid Edith is not - a v nasty cold.
"Rather a disgusting and costly holiday, but for us it was at any rate made memorable by your company and kindness. "We thought of you yesterday, and hoped your journey home would be less unpleasant than our icy winds and snow have foreboded."
Adrian Rathbone, an associate at Richard Winterton's, said the letter had been found unexpectedly by the seller.
"It dropped out of a book they had," he said. "It wasn't even a Tolkien book, we've brought in several experts who say it is real.
"The former owners brought it in to a valuation day that we held having found it at home. Letters like this do sell, but I have to say I thought the maximum it would fetch was GBP300-400, not GBP1,700. "It's a complete mystery how it turned up, the letter was addressed to a couple Tolkien had met on holiday, but it wasn't the seller's family."

Nativity scene watched by CCTV after thefts
CCTV cameras have been installed to watch over a nativity scene after models of a sheep and king were stolen.
A police notice warns that a camera is monitoring the 6ft high nativity scene Photo: ARCHANT	7:30AM GMT 10 Dec 2009
A police notice warns that a camera is monitoring the 6ft high scene in Snettisham, Norfolk, after thieves walked off with the models.
The illuminated figures have formed part of the village market square's festive display for several years.
But creators John and Valerie Bailey say they are fed up with thefts and vandalism.
''We've done this in consultation with the local police,'' said Mrs Bailey.
''Figures disappear overnight and are then found around the village. Last year we had sheep smashed.''
She added: ''We hope this will be a deterrent and stop the problem.''
Village events committee secretary Eric Langford added: ''It is a very sad thing but possibly a sign of the times. You expect to see a star over the stable - not CCTV.''

Duchess of Cambridge pregnant: William and Kate on starting a family
In an interview given just after they announced their engagement in November 2010, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were looking forward to starting a family. 8:38PM GMT 03 Dec 2012
In an official interview to mark their engagement in 2010, Kate said that her family had been very supportive: "I hope we will be able to have a happy family ourselves because they have been great over the years, helping me with difficult times and we see a lot of each other and they are very, very dear to me." A spokesman for St James's Palace has confirmed the news that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their first child. "Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a baby. The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry and members of both families are delighted with the news." The Duchess, formerly Kate Middleton, is understood to have found out last month that she was pregnant, had not intended to make the news public until she had passed the 12-week stage. But after being admitted to hospital with a bout of acute morning sickness, the royal couple decided to make the announcement early to avoid speculation about her condition. Related Articles

Ant's Nest Limpopo Province, South Africa
On the Waterberg Plateau in the malaria-free Limpopo Province, this private bush home offers excellent family safaris. Owned and run by Ant and Tessa Baber, whose forebears settled here in 1886, this converted ranch house is a home-from-home, with six en-suite bedrooms, which are available by the room or for exclusive use, so it works well for families with children of all ages. There’s an extensive garden to roam in, a heated swimming-pool, a sandpit, a trampoline, badminton and a thatched area with big sofas. Each experience is tailor-made, planned between the guide and guests. Riding safaris are popular, and there are horses to suit everyone – even under-fours can be led on ponies around the grounds of the lodge. There are also, of course, game drives and guided walks. For the ‘big five’ (elephant, rhinoceros, Cape buffalo, lion and leopard), game drives into nearby reserves can be arranged. Bushbaby Travel offers five nights’ exclusive use of Ant’s Nest from £8,200 for a family of four (including two children under 11) sharing a deluxe room, including all flights and transfers (0845-124 4455; bushbaby.travel).
