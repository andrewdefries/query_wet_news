1 • HERE COMES THE SUN
It is almost impossible not to sing along to Here Comes the Sun, written by George Harrison for The Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road. One of the simplest and sweetest openings in popular music. 'Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo),
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right.' 2 • ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET
This 1930 song, composed by Jimmy McHugh with lyrics by Dorothy Fields, was originally for a Broadway musical and has become a jazz standard. Louis Armstrong does a great version, Louis Prima does a fun version and Cyndi Lauper and McFly have also wrapped their vocal chords around the memorable opening lyrics: Related Articles

The perfect summer song
12 Aug 2010
'Grab your coat and get your hat,
Leave your worries on the doorstep,
Life can be so sweet, On the sunny side of the street.'
3 • SUMMERTIME
Summertime, composed by George Gershwin for the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess, is one of the most covered songs in music. It is hard to beat Billie Holiday's 1936 version but it has been sung superbly by Ella Fitzgerald, Sam Cooke, Al Green and, in 1968, by Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, on the album Cheap Thrills. Janis Joplin;Big Brother & The Holding Company - Summertime on MUZU.TV.
4 • HOT STUFF
For the fitting names of the singer and song alone, disco queen Donna Summer (above), belting out Hot Stuff, her No1 from 1979, merits inclusion. 5 • WALKING ON SUNSHINE
An insanely upbeat song that was a hit for Katrina And The Waves and also sometimes sung by American group KC and the Sunshine Band in the Seventies. If you want the ultimately smiley version, with sizzling violins, then try Dolly Parton's take on it. 'I'm walkin' on sunshine ... and it's time to feel good."
6 • I DON'T CARE IF THE SUN DON'T SHINE
Recorded at Sun Studios for the Sun Sessions in the mid-Fifties, this Mack Davis song was one of the earliest hits for Elvis Presley (below). "I don't care if the sun don't shine, I get going when the sun goes down," sang The King, a reminder that summer evenings can be the sweetest thing during a heatwave. 7 • SUNNY AFTERNOON
The Ray Davies song Sunny Afternoon was a No1 hit for The Kinks in the glorious July of 1966, when England won the World Cup. The band, who also sang Waterloo Sunset, did one promotional video singing the song in snowy weather. 'The tax man's taken all my dough,
And left me in my stately home,
Lazing on a sunny afternoon. And I can't sail my yacht,
He's taken everything I've got,
All I've got is this sunny afternoon.' The Kinks - Sunny Afternoon on MUZU.TV.
8 • IN THE SUMMERTIME
The Seventies song In The Summertime is cheesy and catchy and was a massive hit for British band Mungo Jerry. The song was written by frontman Ray Dorset. The irresponsible lyrics "have a drink, have a drive, go out and see what you can find," were later used in an anti-drink driving campaign. 9 • THE SUMMERTIME BLUES
Summer rockabilly at its best, with Eddie Cochran's 1958 hit. 10 • ALWAYS THE SUN
If the sun is making you a bit moody, then try the 1990 hit for The Stranglers, Always The Sun. "How many times have woken up and prayed for the rain?"
11 • SUN IS SHINING
How could this not conjure summer? Lovely Bob Marley reggae into the bargain. 12 • YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE
This 1939 song by Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell has been covered by Ike and Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Cash and Brian Wilson, among others, and is the perfect singalong. It was even turned into a football song by Manchester United fans who used to sing 'You are my Solskjær', in tribute to European Cup winner Ole Gunnar Solskjær. What is your favourite sunshine song?
13 • SUNSHINE SUPERMAN
Donovan wrote Sunshine Superman for his future wife Linda Lawrence, and he also wrote the mellow Sunny Goodge Street. 14 • SUMMERTIME IN ENGLAND
You'll have time to make a cooling drink and get a refill while Van Morrison completes his epic 15-minute love song to England, featuring references to William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Lake District. The saxophone playing of Pee Wee Ellis is gorgeous as Van the Man sings: Would you meet me in the country,
In the summertime in England
Would you meet me? 15 • SURFIN' USA
The Beach Boys (above) have to be in on their name alone, but besides the breezy Surfin' USA, take your pick from All Summer Long, Summer Days (And Summer Nights), Sunflower, Summer in Paradise etc, etc. The Beach Boys - Surfin USA on MUZU.TV.
16 • THAT LUCKY OLD SUN
"That lucky old sun has nothing to do but roll around heaven all day," sings Ray Charles in a beautifully languid spiritual that is cheerier than Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying. 17 • SUMMER IN THE CITY
A 1966 No1 in America, Summer in the City Lovin' Spoonful song includes the sound of car horns, beginning with a Volkswagen Beetle horn. 18 • WAITIN' ON A SUNNY DAY
Bruce Springsteen's song of hope, from the album The Rising, has him chasing the clouds away. Bruce Springsteen - Waitin' On A Sunny Day on MUZU.TV.
19 • AIN'T NO SUNSHINE
Bill Withers wrote this song when he was 31 and working at a factory making toilet seats for 747s. It was produced by Book T Jones and features Donald 'Duck' Dunn on bass guitar. The perfect sad song – but let's hope tears can't dehydrate you. 20 • BRING ME SUNSHINE
Bring Me Sunshine was written in 1966 by the composer Arthur Kent, with lyrics by Sylvia Dee (who wrote songs for Elvis Presley). Willie Nelson had a hit in 1968 with a version produced by Chet Atkins. A year later the song was adopted by comedians Morecambe & Wise as their signature tune in their second series for the BBC. Need a smile in the hot weather? Just think of Eric and Ernie dancing as they sing 'Bring me fun, bring me sunshine . . . bring me love'. And who can argue with that?

Sir Philip Green calls for overhaul of business rates
Sir Philip Green has demanded a fundamental overhaul of Britain’s business rates system to support struggling high streets.
The tax burden for Britain's leading retailers has increased 65pc since 2005 according to PricewaterhouseCoopers Photo: Bloomberg News	By Kamal Ahmed, and Graham Ruddick

He said the Treasury had the ability to fix the system so that the Government always receives the same tax take from retailers whatever the state of the economy, and this must change. In a strongly worded attack on the present system, the proprietor of Topshop owner Arcadia said that the Government deliberately inflated rates despite the fact that rents were falling because of the poor state of the economy. He called for a rates freeze and a “rates holiday” for small shop owners. Sir Philip said that the Government’s decision to delay a rates revaluation until 2017 did not take account of the fact that “the world has changed” since the last review in 2008. “There was due to be a revaluation in 2015 and they are now trying to push it to 2017,” Sir Philip said. “In the meantime what they [the Government} are able to use is a mechanism [called the] ‘uniform business rate’ [and] if there is a devaluation or the rent moves downwards they have this mechanism where they can inflate, they can create a value of their own.

“They can inflate the uniform business rate above the RPI (retail price index), so keeping their tax revenues in line. [They] fix it so they don’t lose any revenue.”
Sir Philip said that the situation was so serious for smaller shops the Government should consider giving them a rates holiday or allowing small shop owners who pay annual rates of between £20,000 and £50,000 to pay a nominal sum. “Small shops cannot afford to trade,” Sir Philip said. “They need a bit of help.”
Sir Philip’s demand for reform of the rates system is supported by many high street retailers, including John Lewis, Boots, Tesco and Sainsbury’s. During evidence to the Business Select Committee in the House of Commons yesterday the retailers said it was time to “rebalance” the system so that businesses with a lot of physical stores were not unfairly penalised. Sir Philip called for a “level playing field” with online retailers. Sir Philip gave an example of one of Arcadia’s stores where the rent came down from £500,000 to £125,000 over a five year period. The rates payable, though, remained at £227,000 even though Arcadia believes under a reformed system the amount should have fallen to £50,000. “A freeze on business rates would not need legislative change,” Sir Philip said. He also revealed that Arcadia’s annual rates bill of £150m could be reduced by £30m to £40m. “If we are to reflect current rents [they] would be significantly lower than we are presently paying,” Sir Philip said. Under the new system some rates, such as on Oxford Street, would go up because rents have risen but overall rents would reduce. “We need to conduct this [review] in a sensible way,” Sir Philip said. “If I phoned 50 retailers they would be on board with this.”
Speaking yesterday to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee during a hearing on the future of the high street, representatives from Boots, John Lewis, and Britain’s largest supermarkets identified business rates as the key issue facing Britain’s troubled high streets. Alex Gourlay, chief executive of Alliance Boots health and beauty division, said: “If you look at corporation tax, business rates, and employing people, two thirds of costs [for retailers] are on the indirect tax of business rates and employing people.”
Mr Gourlay said rebalancing the costs of retailing offers a “real opportunity for the Government to act” on protecting the high street. He pointed to a report by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers that showed the tax burden on Britain’s leading retailers has increased 65pc since 2005, driven by an 80pc increase in tax outside of corporation tax. The report by PwC warns that the Government’s pledge to cut corporation tax to 20pc by 2015 has been offset for retailers by a surge in business rates and employers national insurance contributions.
