Helium balloonist becomes first to cross the Alps
American Jonathan Trappe used only 54 helium balloons strapped to his harness to make the record-breaking journey. 4:25PM BST 15 Sep 2011
The perilous journey took Trappe, from North Carolina, nearly 12 hours to complete. Most of the adventure was carried out in the dark. Trappe, who crossed the English Channel last year using helium balloons, was able to watch the sunrise from an altitude of 15,000ft. “There’s nothing like watching the sun return to the sky from the sky", he said. His 94-mile journey began in the South of France. It took him past the massive Monte Viso in the French Alps, before he landed in the Italian town of Andezeno. He said: “The most enjoyable part of the trip was also the most terrifying. At one point I thought I was heading straight for a Monte Viso. "My altimeter told me I was clear of it but my eyes told me I was going to slap into it and in that moment I was really scared. In the end I sailed right past it without a problem, which was just exhilarating.

"The experience was just amazing and it goes to show you can accomplish your dreams," he added. “As children we all have this dream of flying off on balloons but we are told it’s not possible. But it really is possible and it makes me wonder how many other things do we tell our kids aren’t possible that really are." How about that?

HS2 likely to cause 'pain, misery and disappointment' to locals, says Nick Boles
The high-speed rail network is likely to cause “pain, misery and disappointment” for local people that can never be alleviated, the planning minister has admitted.

In a debate with MPs, Nick Boles suggested the controversial HS2 link “will never be acceptable to local people”.
He spoke out the day after the Government unveiled its northern route for the new line amid anger from Tories who say it will destroy large swathes of their country constituencies. The Tory minister said the failure to resolve planning disputes between local people and developments in the national interest is “profoundly to be regretted” but sometimes cannot be avoided.
“There are some times when you build a new prison, a new nuclear power station or as we are about to discover . . . a vital high-speed rail infrastructure to connect your major cities,” he said.
“In those occasions, it’s unfortunately the case that sometimes decisions have to be made which will never be acceptable to local people, which will never win their support, which will always cause them a level of pain, misery and disappointment that they will feel can never be alleviated by any mitigating measures.”
George Osborne was embroiled in controversy yesterday over the route of the line, which narrowly avoids the wealthiest areas of his Tatton constituency.
A local council leader issued a statement praising the Chancellor for having “fought hard” to keep the high-speed track away from the area – before later retracting the remarks.
The Chancellor has repeatedly said he did not influence the decision to route the line away from Knutsford and Tatton. But in his original statement, Michael Jones, the leader of Cheshire East council, said: “Your MPs George Osborne, Edward Timpson and I, have fought hard to keep the line away from Knutsford and Tatton, which we have been successful in achieving.”
Sources close to Mr Osborne last night reiterated that he had “absolutely nothing to do with discussions over HS2”.
Parliamentary convention recognises the right of ministers to lobby on behalf of their constituents against government policies. A number of senior ministers publicly opposed plans to run the high-speed line through their constituencies, including Cheryl Gillan, the forme Welsh secretary and Conservative MP for Chesham and Amersham.
Asked to explain his statement, Mr Jones originally backtracked by saying the Chancellor had merely been “supportive” of the work done by local councillors. “The fact is George Osborne said it is a good idea to run the line through Crewe,” he said. “If anything, he put pressure on me to get it delivered. All the MPs fought hard to get it to Crewe.” He later withdrew the statement about Mr Osborne’s involvement entirely.
Opponents of the scheme south of Birmingham have been incensed by the Government’s insistence that the line should take the shortest route from London, which means that 225mph trains will hurtle through the Chilterns and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
The same approach north of Birmingham would have seen the line slice through the heart of Mr Osborne’s constituency, spoiling some of the most expensive residential areas in the country. MPs and council leaders in the north pushed the case for Crewe, arguing that it would be a major transport hub generating 20,000 jobs and 5,000 homes. Politics
