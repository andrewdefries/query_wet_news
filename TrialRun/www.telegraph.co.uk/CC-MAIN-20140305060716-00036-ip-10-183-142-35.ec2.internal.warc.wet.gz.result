Comments
The longtime animal rights activist and former singer for 1980s rock group The Smiths urged the Staples Center arena to shutter the concession stands of fast food chain McDonald's and to halt the sale of meat by other outlets at the venue for his March 1 performance."I don't look upon it as a victory for me, but a victory for the animals," the "Irish Blood, English Heart" singer said in a statement.Staples Center operator Anschutz Entertainment Group and its promoter subsidiary Goldenvoice will donate a portion of ticket sales from the show to animal rights group PETA, Morrissey said.Morrissey, 53, who co-wrote The Smiths' 1985 song "Meat Is Murder," postponed a series of concerts on his North America tour last month after being hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer.He is expected to relaunch the tour with a performance on U.S. late-night talk show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" next week.

Girls outperforming boys in "masculine" subjects
Girls are outperforming boys in traditionally “masculine” subjects such as engineering and construction, despite repeated attempts to close the education gender gap, it emerged today. Girls are more likely to perform well in subjects such as construction, engineering and business, according to Pearson. Photo: GETTY By Graeme Paton, Education Editor
12:01AM BST 05 Jul 2012
Comments
New figures show teenage girls are more likely to achieve good grades in practical courses designed to lead straight to a job in traditionally male-dominated industries. They were almost twice as likely to score highly in vocational qualifications sat between the age of 14 and 16, while results were around a third higher in courses sat in the sixth-form. The disclosure – in data published by one of Britain’s biggest exam providers – comes amid continuing concerns over the gulf in standards between boys and girls. According to figures, girls are already ahead in most disciplines by the age of five and the gap widens throughout compulsory education. Last year, some 62 per cent of girls achieved five good GCSEs, compared with just 55 per cent of boys. Almost one-in-10 boys also failed to gain at least one C grade at the age of 16 – almost twice the failure rate of girls. Related Articles

Boys have traditionally maintained their hold over girls in a number of more traditional practical disciplines. In 2011, maths was one of the few areas in which they gained better results, with boys more likely than girls to gain A* to C grades. But a study by the publisher Pearson, which owns the Edexcel exam board, has found girls are now pulling ahead in other “male subjects”. Researchers analysed results in work-based BTEC courses traditionally sat by pupils at schools and colleges between the age of 14 and 19. Pupils can take courses at Level 2, which is equivalent to GCSEs, and Level 3, which is similar to an A-level. They found that at Level 2: • 28 per cent of girls gained top marks – a distinction – in business this year compared with just 17 per cent of boys;
• 18 per cent of girls gained the best mark in a “construction and the built environment” course, against seven per cent of boys;
• 28 per cent of girls secured a distinction in engineering, compared with 16 per cent of boys.
Although boys were far more likely to sit these qualifications, girls still made up a large number of entrants, with around 19,600 taking business and just over 1,000 taking engineering or construction. Only 11,000 girls sat the practical subjects at Level 3 – principally in business – at school sixth-forms or further education colleges. But of those completing courses, 48 per cent gained highest possible marks in business and construction, while 39 per cent did well in engineering. Among boys, only 37 per cent secured good grades in business, 29 per cent in engineering and 34 per cent in construction. Rod Bristow, president of Pearson, said: “I hope these figures will give more girls the confidence to see careers in business, construction and engineering as within their reach. A student’s gender should never influence the subjects they study nor be treated as an indicator as to how well they will perform.”
The conclusions come just days after MPs and peers from the All- Party Parliamentary Group on Literacy called for urgent action to tackle the gender gap in reading. They said that boys were failing to develop a love of reading during primary education because of a shortage of male teachers combined with an anti-book culture among many fathers. Schools should stock more action and adventure books to appeal to boys and draft men into schools to act as reading “mentors” to boys, it was claimed. Education News

Wealthy Charles Palmer-Tomkinson does all his own DIY, daughter reveals Prince Charles’ wealthy friend Charles Palmer-Tomkinson insists on doing all his DIY repairs himself, even donning a boiler suit to mend the roof, his daughter has revealed. Photo: ANDREW CROWLEY	By Hayley Dixon
6:52PM BST 23 Jun 2013
Follow With an estimated worth of £20million, the father of socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson could no doubt afford to employ a handyman to help him on his 1,200 acre Hampshire estate. But as a farmer he is “hands on” and refuses to pay anyone to fix issues for him, his daughter Santa Montefiore said. Mr Palmer-Tomkinson, who has been friends with Prince Charles since the seventies and regularly holidayed with his family, personally carries out the work at the Dummer Grange Estate, near Basingstoke, despite the fact that he is now in his 70s. The author said that she used her father as an inspiration in her latest novel The Beekeeper's Daughter, which she is currently editing. “I need colour for one character. I was watching my father up a ladder in his boiler suit mending a tile, and though, he’ll do,” his eldest daughter told the Sunday Times magazine. Related Articles

When it was pointed out that he could afford to pay someone to do it for him Mrs Montefiore replied: “My father won’t get a man in to do anything. He’s the DIY king. He’s a farmer, don’t forget, very hands on.”

Fifa 13 referees will 'hear' Xbox Kinect players swearing
Xbox Kinect owners will have to mind their language in the next version of Fifa, EA's football video game.
Lionel Messi in EA's Fifa 13 By Shane Richmond, Head of Technology (Editorial)
3:13PM BST 24 Jul 2012

Fifa 13 will take advantage of Microsoft Kinect to allow players to shout commands to their team to change tactics or formations without pausing the game.
But the system will also listen for players whose frustration gets the better of them. Swearing at the referee will influence their decision-making, possibly leading to more bookings. EA says that in Fifa 13's career mode, gamers will find that storylines will develop if they acquire a reputation for abusing referees.
Fifa 13, the 20th edition of EA's series, will be released on September 28th. After improvements to the defensive system last year, this year's title adds a new 'attacking intelligence' feature that makes computer players smarter and more creative in attack.
Other editions to Fifa 13 include the possibility of playing for or managing an international side in career mode, more physical battles between players and mini-games based on key skills such as shooting and crossing.

Microsoft's Kinect accessory contains a camera and a microphone, allowing gamers to interact with the Xbox console using gestures and voice commands. Fifa 13 is just one of many games to take advantage of the technology but Microsoft has been encouraging its use beyond games as well.
Xbox owners can already use Kinect to search the web and control online video using voice commands and later this year Microsoft says that Kinect-enabled interactive adverts will appear.
Microsoft sold eight million Kinect units in the first 60 days that the accessory was on sale.
