Yes, Prime Minister to return to British screens
Famed for its masterful lampooning of the inner workings of British government, Yes, Prime Minister captured the obfuscation of Whitehall mandarins to a tee. Yes, Prime Minister outside number 10 By James Orr
2:42PM BST 29 Mar 2012
Follow Comments
Now, nearly a quarter of a century on, the much-lauded satirical sitcom is set to return to our screens for a new series seemingly based on the current Coalition government. This time around the Rt. Hon Jim Hacker, previously played by the late Paul Eddington, will be confronting “the greatest economic crisis in a generation”. And to give the new series a further contemporary twist, Number 10 will also face issues over a Scottish referendum on independence and the possible collapse of the European Union. Yesterday UKTV, who commissioned the revised show for TV channel Gold, described the current political landscape in Britain as the “perfect setting” for a return of the series. Should Yes, Minister be resurrected?

Is a revival a good idea? Yes, Prime Minister
30 Mar 2012
Filming is expected to start over the summer but executives have yet to finalise details of who will be cast in the roles of Hacker, his permanent secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard Wooley, his famously obtuse principal private secretary. Jane Rogerson, Director of Commissioning at UKTV, said: “The political landscape in Britain today is the perfect setting for Yes, Prime Minister to return. “Just look at Pastygate. That could have been in the original Yes, Minister. We’ve only received the first script so far so I can’t give solid details of the plot other than to say the reference points about the crises, the challenges, the personalities; they are all utterly contemporary of the present day.”
Yes, Minister, set principally in Jim Hacker’s private office within the fictional Department for Administrative Affairs, was first broadcast in 1980 and ran for four years. Its sequel, Yes, Prime Minister began in 1986 and followed the beleaguered Hacker as he continued to clash with his civil servants on becoming Prime Minister. Sir Humphrey Appleby was played by the late Nigel Hawthorne, who died in 2001, and Derek Fowlds starred as Bernard. The series received huge critical acclaim and was even enjoyed by the then incumbent Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Today, writers Jonathan Lynn and Antony Jay, who co-wrote the original series and were involved in its later stage production, were confirmed as being the authors of the new programmes. The six-part series is expected to be screened either at the end of this year or at the beginning of next, and will be filmed in front of a live audience in London. Ms Rogerson added: “Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister are crown jewels of British comedy we all grew up with and I think the time is right for a modern take on government. “I’m thrilled that Gold has enticed Jonathan Lynn and Antony Jay to pen a brand new series, and can’t wait to see this constitutional treasure back on screens across the country. “The quality of their writing is wonderful. You can only get that tight use of English and humour from the calibre of Antony and Jonathan. Their scripts are more prediction than fiction.”

Toronto mayor Rob Ford's spectacular fall from grace
Despite admitting to smoking crack cocaine and propositioning an employee, the mayor of Toronto remains in post and even has his own TV show. As Rob Ford's behaviour veers between shocking, aggressive, apologetic and defiant, watch how the scandal unfolded...
8:00AM GMT 19 Nov 2013
Rob Ford, the scandal-plagued mayor of Toronto, is refusing to bow to political pressure to resign, despite the city's council stripping him of the last of his substantive powers. The mayor, who has admitted smoking crack cocaine, buying illegal drugs while in office and driving after consuming alcohol, remained defiant during the debate about his political authority on Monday, even charging a heckler and knocking down a councillor during proceedings. The furore over the mayor's drug use emerged in the Spring after US media blog Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper both reported they had viewed a mobile phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. Mr Ford spent months dodging questions about the video, but admitted earlier this month that he had used the drug "in one of my drunken stupors". Related Articles
