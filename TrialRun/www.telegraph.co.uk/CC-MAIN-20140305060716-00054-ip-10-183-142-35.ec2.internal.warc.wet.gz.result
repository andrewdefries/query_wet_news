The newspaper also reported that one of its reporters, who was participating in the parade, heard six to seven shots being fired. Nobody has been arrested. It's unclear what sparked the gunfire. "It's just a very tragic day for us," New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters after visiting some of the wounded in hospital. "We will find them," he said. "It really is important in this town for people to step forward now so that we can find people who do this and make sure that they don't hurt innocent victims anymore."
"It is important for us... to change the culture of death on the streets of New Orleans to a culture of life." Photographs of the shooting aftermath in the Times-Picayune newspaper showed a man lying on his stomach beside a pool of blood, being helped by two bystanders. Other photos showed a man in shorts sitting on a cobbled street, his calf bleeding and covered with a bandana. The violence occurred at what's known as a second-line parade - a loose procession in which people dance down the street, often following behind a brass band. They can be impromptu or planned and are sometimes described as moving block parties. Edited by Bonnie Malkin USA
