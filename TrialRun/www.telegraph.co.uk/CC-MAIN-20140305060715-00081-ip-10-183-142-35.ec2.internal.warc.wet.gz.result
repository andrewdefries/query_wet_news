Oil giant may need EGM over TNK-BP sale
BP could be forced to hold its first extraordinary general meeting in more than a decade to gain approval for selling out of TNK-BP. BP declined to say what proportion of proven and probable reserves TNK accounted for Photo: PA	By Emily Gosden

The British oil major is this week expected to receive an offer from its oligarch partners AAR to buy out its 50pc stake in their joint venture. It is also in talks with state-controlled Rosneft over a sale. But the venture is so significant to BP — accounting for 27pc of its proven reserves — that any sale could require shareholder approval. Under Financial Services Authority rules, an oil company disposing of an asset that accounts for more than 25pc of its proven and probable reserves must obtain shareholder approval before completion. BP declined to say what proportion of proven and probable reserves TNK accounted for, but oil analyst Malcolm Graham-Wood, at VSA Capital, said it was likely to be a similar proportion to the share of its proven reserves. He said it was therefore “unclear” whether BP would have to hold an EGM in the event of a sale but the company was likely to want to avoid such an outcome. BP’s management is already under pressure to achieve a good deal, with analysts warning that it appears to be talking down the price below the $25bn they believe it is worth. Related Articles

One institutional investor in BP told The Sunday Telegraph that, while shareholders were broadly supportive of plans to sell, “that could change if they decide to sell the asset at a price that we don’t believe is sensible”. A sale for $20bn would be “disappointing”, they said, while much below that would see shareholders “up in arms”. A BP spokesman said: “For the TNK-BP sale we will of course discuss with the listing authority and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements at the right time to ensure we have the correct approvals, including shareholder approvals if necessary.” BP has not held an EGM since 1999, when shareholders approved the $27bn acquisition of Arco. The oil giant has agreed to shed $35bn of assets towards a targeted $38bn to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster. Oil and Gas

Britvic profits hit by Ireland job losses Soft-drinks maker Britvic reported flat profits because of the cost of restructuring its struggling Irish business, where it announced 145 jobs would go earlier this year. Link to this video
By Amy Wilson 8:23AM BST 20 May 2009
Comments
In the first half, pre-tax profit was £7.2m compared with £7.1m the previous year, after £12.8m of costs linked to shrinking the Irish business. Excluding those costs, pre-tax profit climbed 16pc to £20m. Sales rose 6.3pc to £483.2m, as Britvic increased its market share in the UK with brands including Robinsons squash and Pepsi.In Ireland, where the collapse of the property and banking bubble has led to a deep recession and tax increases, Britvic's sales were hard hit in pubs and corner shops. The company bought the soft drinks business of Magners' cider maker C&C in 2007, to add Ballygowan water to its portfolio of drinks in the country.Britivc said in January it would "restructure and right-size" its Irish business, with the loss of up to 145 jobs. The company said it had seen "strong" sales growth in the UK since the start of its second half in mid-April and expects to meet full-year earnings forecasts. Analysts expect revenue of £948m and pretax profit of £74.9m for the year. Britvic increased its dividend 7.9pc to 4.1p a share for the first half. Retail and Consumer

Centrica names Chris Weston as British Gas boss
Centrica is set to appoint Chris Weston as the new head of British Gas, replacing Phil Bentley who stood down after a bust-up over strategy.

Mr Weston, a former Royal Artillery officer who now runs Centrica’s US retail gas business Direct Energy, will take charge of the UK energy business as it grapples with the challenge of driving profit growth following political criticism and growing regulatory scrutiny. From 2005 to 2009, Mr Weston was managing director of British Gas Services, which markets a range of boiler repair and domestic insurance services to the utility’s 16m-strong UK customer base and beyond. He joined Centrica 12 years ago following the acquisition of telecoms provider One Tel, where he was a senior executive. In 2009, he took over at the group’s Direct Energy business – described as a “mini-Centrica” by some analysts – with responsibility for its customer base of 6m in North America. He will now move to the UK energy business as it plans to drive further expansion in the North American market. Related Articles

Mr Bentley had been expected to stand down after a bust-up over strategy with Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica. Although Mr Bentley has been very successful at improving British Gas’ customer service demands, it is thought Mr Laidlaw wants British Gas to focus on new ways to promote growth in the face of creeping regulation. Mr Bentley, 53, joined Centrica as finance director 13 years ago. In 2007, he was transferred over to British Gas as managing director. The retail division provides power and electricity to 12m homes around the country and employs 31,000 people. Last year he was paid £681,000 in salary. His shares and options are worth £6.7m and he has a £210,000-a-year pension pot. Despite public fury over rising gas prices and household energy bills, Centrica is unhappy with the level of margin squeeze on its post-tax retail margins. The company currently has a 5pc margin on post-tax gas income from households and has been subject to a lot of regulatory creep, including a series of interventions from Ofgem. The last time Centrica unveiled a new strategy review was in 2010, when the company said it wanted to focus on growing its upstream business, like oil and gas production, in order to create a hedge for lower gas prices.

Gobbledygook – the latest threat to pensions
Impenetrable jargon could cause scupper the Government's new pension scheme, cutting the retirement incomes of millions of savers. Speaking in code: the use of terms such as 'pension accrual' and 'equities' instead of 'the way your pension builds up' and 'stocks and shares' risks alienating the new generation of savers, a leading actuary said By Lara May
3:35PM BST 01 Aug 2012
Comments
The use of terms such as "pension accrual" and "equities" instead of "the way your pension builds up" and "stocks and shares" risks alienating the new generation of savers about to be automatically enrolled in the new national scheme, according to Malcolm McLean, a consultant at Barnett Waddingham, the actuary. He pointed out that the glossary of a government report on workplace pension reforms published yesterday runs to 61 pension terms. "This glossary shows the extent to which jargon has become a problem in pensions, and why it is so important with auto-enrolment now very much in focus that this is substantially cut back and replaced wherever possible with everyday language," Mr McLean said. "Over the coming months and years there will be upwards of perhaps 5m people who will have little or no knowledge or experience of pensions and it will be vitally important that information is provided to them in a way that they can easily understand. "It is not going too far to say that the success or otherwise of the entire auto-enrolment project could depend upon it."

China Communist party congress: protesters head to Beijing to steal limelight
To petition the 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang Qizhi boarded a train from his home in Liaoning province but got off to avoid the police. Then he hired a car but ditched it and caught a bus.

6:49PM GMT 07 Nov 2012
Follow Finally, under the cover of darkness, the 57-year-old and his wife embarked on a midnight trek through a muddy forest and torrential rain. After eluding one last checkpoint, they arrived at Lü Number 3 Team Village, a dusty town one hour's drive from central Beijing where frustrated protestors can normally find a safe haven before entering the capital. "[The authorities] are super-nervous now," said the retired porcelain factory worker, justifying his four-day odyssey. On Thursday, as the curtains go up on China's once-in-a-decade political handover, the couple will make their final move, heading to the heart of Beijing to protest against rampant corruption that has robbed them of their pensions. "We came during the Party Congress to call attention," said Mr Zhang, a retired porcelain factory worker. "We do not have a democratic government, we have one-party rule. If things stay this way China is going down." Related Articles

Lu is home to around 700 permanent residents, many of whom supplement their incomes by renting shoddily built shacks to aggrieved men and women bound for Beijing to seek assistance from the central government. "I don't care who the tenants are, as long as they pay," said the owner of one of dozens of cramped guesthouses, who rents rooms for 10 yuan (£1) a night or 200 yuan (£20) a month. But the village's once-crowded guesthouses stand largely empty this week after police and security forces moved in to weed out potential troublemakers ahead of the highly sensitive leadership transition. The state media has dubbed the crackdown the "zero petitions" policy. A report in the Global Times newspaper last month claimed"petitioning cases" in Beijing had fallen 12% since August, after 10,000 detentions. Activists say security forces from across China have descended on Beijing to locate and 'deport' protestors. "We must soberly realise that various factors exist which can lead to disharmony, insecurity and instability, bringing many risks and challenges for the security work of the party congress," Zhou Yongkang, China's security minister, said recently. With guesthouses padlocked and empty, the numbers of petitioners has fallen from hundreds to almost none. "They've all been captured," said one woman at the village's entrance. She declined to give her name but offered a word of warning: "Don't go in there." A local rubbish collector was more forthcoming. "The 'Big 18th' is coming," he whispered, using the Chinese nickname for the Congress. "[The petitioners] have all been arrested. You won't find any now – even if there are one or two left they'll be hiding in secret places." With virtually all of the petitioners gone, police and plainclothes thugs have blockaded the village's main entrance, sealing it off from any new arrivals. After 4-day game of cat-and-mouse, Mr Zhang and four other protestors are lying low, preparing to move on Beijing once the Congress begins. "We are smart," he said, after nervously ushering the Daily Telegraph into the relative privacy of the tatty, redbrick box-room the group has rented for 50 yuan (£5) a night. Inside, six filthy mattresses were propped up on a bed of bricks. Two plastic fly swatters hung from nails on the peeling walls and a mosquito net dangled from the roof. At least a dozen undercover security agents were loitering nearby forcing one of Mr Zhang's comrades to keep watch outside. Mr Zhang's wife, Zhong Meishu, kept the door bolted. Mr Zhang said he had sent a letter detailing their plight to China's powerful Organisation Department and planned to protest at the All China Federation of Trade Unions, just a few kilometres from the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square where President Hu Jintao will deliver the Congress' opening address on Thursday. But with just hours until the "Big 18th" started, he admitted the petitioners were still not home and dry. After dark the group retreats to the forest while security agents searches the village's deserted guesthouses. "They try to ambush us in the middle of the night," explained Shanghai-native Zhang Jinbao, another member of the group. At the crack of dawn today, the group plans to launch a final push into central Beijing. With him, Mr Zhang would carry an A-2 poster. 'It is shameful to tread on human rights,' it reads. 'It is honourable to defend human rights!' China
