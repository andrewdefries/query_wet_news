The News by Alain de Botton, review
A lofty disquisition on the media will not satisfy the cravings of news addicts, says AN Wilson

Comments
This book bears every sign of having been dashed off on a laptop and never read again, either by its author or, if it had one, by its editor. Consider this sentence, written towards the end of a section on how news outlets – he does not distinguish between print journalism and the rest – deal with economic matters: “While continuing its regular routine of analysing derivatives, yield ratios and the state of M2, economic news should not forget its ultimate responsibility to a larger quest for a world capable of sustaining less anxious and ruinous, more secure and more meaningful working lives.” Somewhere here you can see where the ideas might have been heading. “News” cannot have responsibility, so he must mean journalists, or news organisations. Economists, he presumably means, should be concerned with life in general and not just with narrow measurements of the money supply such as M1, M2 or M3. (De Botton likes blinding his readers with science.) But the quoted sentence does not, in itself, make any sense. How about this sentence, in a section titled “World News”? “However, if Tolstoy, Flaubert or Sophocles were in the newsroom, the medium might well give us rather more of what we need in order to keep our souls from 'dying’, for what were War and Peace, Madame Bovary and Antigone in their original state but just the things that William Carlos Williams so unfairly attacked – namely news events?” This sentence, however often you read it, is sheer gobbledegook. Why would William Carlos Williams, in his poem “Asphodel, that Greeny Flower” (“It is difficult to get the news from poems”), have been thinking about those very different works? The point of the Williams poem is that deep events, things that affect our lives, are often not the big external things that get written about in newspapers. And as it happens, some of that conflict between big public things and inner grief is, precisely, present in the three great works of literature de Botton cites: Sophocles, in particular, was writing about the conflict between private and public duty – one of the key features of “news” in any form. But it is not worth trying to analyse nonsense. Related Articles

Alain de Botton’s 10 commandments could be a civilising influence
05 Feb 2013
De Botton clearly does not read through what he has written – else, how could he have set down: “A journalistic gaffe is something a powerful person inadvertently says or does in a momentary lapse.” Well, no. A journalistic gaffe would be one made by a journalist. But he is talking about gaffes made by a famous person and then reported by a journalist. De Botton is probably too fastidious to write about the blowzy subject of the news. This elegantly produced book is described as “A User’s Manual” but it does not feel like the work of a news addict. In his chapter on our vindictive attitude to celebrities, he writes, “The reasons why we need others to fail and why we delight in gossip about their missteps” – odd word, that – “are in the end deeply sad”. Really? No doubt if you are the mother or boyfriend of the celebrity in question it is “deeply sad” when publicity-hungry egotists make charlies of themselves. But for the rest of us, the symbiotic relationship between celebrities and the media is a comic one. Almost no actor, footballer or backbench MP manages to make it into the newspapers without strenuous efforts of self-promotion. Naturally, celebrities themselves think that the sycophancy will go on forever and, equally naturally, they are appalled when we tire of their triumphs and enjoy reading about their domestic upsets. But how this should be “deeply” sad, or “deeply” anything is, I am afraid, lost on me. De Botton claims loftily that Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar is “important and oddly fascinating” by contrast with the behaviour of modern Roman senators – especially Silvio Berlusconi. Once again, he is not coarse enough to see why a figure like Berlusconi delights news addicts. And de Botton never addresses one of the most interesting questions about the news: that is, whether the news actually creates the stories it reports. This is clearly true in relation to the lives of celebrities, about whom he seems rather confused. But, much more dramatically, acts of terror would be pointless if they were not reported. No one would have flown aeroplanes into the World Trade Center on that fateful September day unless their actions had been guaranteed to attract the attention of news cameras all over the world.

Eddie Chapman
Eddie Chapman, who has died aged 83, was known under the codename Zig-Zag as one of the most colourful of the Double Cross agents run by British Intelligence during the Second World War.
Chapman's false papers, identifying him as Hugh Anson, with which he reurned to Portugal in 1942 to re-establish contact with the Abwehr 12:01AM GMT 16 Dec 1997
Comments
A safebreaker who was liberated from jail in St Helier by the German occupation of the Channel Islands, Chapman was sent back to Britain to carry out acts of sabotage on behalf of the Nazis. He was immediately turned by the British and, with the aid of a professional illusionist brought in by MI5 and of carefully placed newspaper reports, gave the Germans the impression that he had carried out his mission to the letter. Chapman made his way back to Germany where he was welcomed as a hero and, after being briefed on the workings of the Abwehr, the German military intelligence organisation, was sent back to Britain on another mission, allowing him to pass his newly-acquired knowledge on to MI5. Edward Chapman was born in 1914 and brought up in Sunderland. He found work in the shipyards there, and at 18 showed his mettle by rescuing a man from drowning off Roker. For this he won a certificate from the Humane Society. Chapman then served in the Coldstream Guards until the mid-1930s, when he embarked on a second career as a safecracker. He enjoyed some success until 1939, when the police discovered him trying to blow open a safe in Glasgow. While awaiting trial, he broke out of jail and made his way to Jersey where he was arrested. He was about to be returned to Scotland when the Germans occupied the Channel Islands. Chapman always claimed that his offer to carry out sabotage for the Germans in Britain, using his knowledge of explosives, was motivated by a desire to return home. But one of the British Intelligence officers who later handled him was probably closer to the mark when he suggested that it was at least in part because Chapman "loved an exciting life". After training, he was given the codename Fritzchen. On the night of Dec 20 1942 he was dropped by parachute near Ely, equipped with a wireless, an automatic pistol, a cyanide suicide pill and £1,000. His mission was to blow up the De Havilland aircraft factory at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, where the new Mosquito fighter-bomber was being built. The Germans promised him that, if he succeeded, he would be given £15,000 and sent to America to carry out further acts of sabotage. But by now MI5 had set up the Double Cross system, whereby German agents arriving in Britain were intercepted and offered the stark choice of facing execution or working for the British. A key part of the scheme was the interception by Bletchley Park of the Abwehr's communications with its agents. As a result, MI5 knew a great deal about Chapman's impending arrival. Immediately after landing, he telephoned Wisbech police station but had some difficulty persuading the police that he was a former safecracker turned German spy who now wanted to work for the British. MI5 rechristened him Zig-Zag and allowed him to radio to the Abwehr that he had arrived safely. The Double Cross committee then set about creating the illusion that would allow him to claim that his mission had been accomplished. The first problem, a legitimate explanation of how he acquired the necessary explosives, Chapman solved by returning to a quarry near Sevenoaks with which he was familiar from his previous career. On the night of Jan 29 1943, Zig-Zag and an MI5 officer scaled the fence of the Mosquito factory and laid a series of notional charges around the power plant. Jasper Maskelyne, a celebrated magician and illusionist, then used a controlled explosion to blow out part of the roof. At the same time, he released smoke bombs and scattered pieces of transformer around the plant to give the impression of a much greater blast. The explosion was reported in The Daily Telegraph and other national newspapers and Chapman's Abwehr controllers sent him a message of congratulations. They told Chapman to make his own way back to Germany from where he would be sent on the second mission to America. Hoping to use him to take similar control of this operation, MI5 put him on a British ship bound for Lisbon, having firmly declined his numerous offers to assassinate Hitler. On arriving in the Portuguese capital, Chapman reported to the local Abwehr representative who gave him a piece of "coal" and offered him a large sum if he would go back to the ship and place it in its coalstore. MI5 was horrified to discover from the intercepts of Abwehr traffic that the coal was explosive designed to detonate when placed in a fire, but Chapman had handed it to the ship's master and asked him to give it to the War Office. The mission to America never materialised and Chapman spent the next year blowing his Abwehr pay on an extended holiday in Norway before being recalled to Germany. Chapman was now given a series of briefings on Abwehr operations. Before being sent back to Britain on another mission he was awarded the Iron Cross. He was then dropped on to the main road at Six Mile Bottom, Cambridgeshire, in the early hours of June 27 1944. When he reported to the nearest police station and told his story, the duty officer replied: "Don't be silly. Go to bed."
Chapman's response was: "That's exactly what they told me last time. Ring up your station in Wisbech. They'll remember me from last time."
After giving MI5 a breakdown of Abwehr operations, he was installed in a flat in Kensington. But the temptations of the £6,000 that the Abwehr had given him proved too much. Chapman was less than discreet to his friends among the criminal fraternity about the source of his new-found wealth, and MI5 was forced to abandon him. After the war, he wrote an account of his wartime experiences, which was serialised in a French newspaper. He again found himself in court, this time on a charge of breaching the Official Secrets Act. A second attempt at publication was thwarted by a D-Notice, but, as MI5 had found out during the war, Zig-Zag was not easily discouraged, and The Eddie Chapman Story eventually appeared in print. A film, Triple Cross, in which Chapman was played by Christopher Plummer, came out in 1967. Chapman leaves a wife Betty and a daughter. Special Forces Obituaries

When he was young and carefree: Laurent Fignon, the rider nicknamed 'the Professor', failed his final examination at the 1989 Tour after the Frenchman refused to use aero-bars and an aero helmet while LeMond opted to and went on to win the final day time-trial by 58 seconds. Not only did the American win the stage but he also took the yellow jersey off Fignon to win the Tour by eight seconds - the narrowest ever margin by which a Tour has been won. In his autobiography Fignon, who twice won the Tour (1983 & 1984) complained that he was always remembered for 1989 rather than his wins as he recalled a conversation with a cycling fan. "Ah. I remember you. You're the guy who lost the Tour de France by eight seconds," said a stranger before Fignon replied: "No, monsieur, I'm the guy who won the Tour twice." Fignon died in August 2010 after suffering from throat cancerPicture: GETTY IMAGES

Today on YouTube: Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp gets the 'Final Countdown' treatment ahead of the the big game
