Wrinklies need not apply
12:01AM BST 16 Oct 2006
Comments
In an admirably swift response to the Government's latest anti-discrimination gimmick, the recruitment agency Robert Walters has outlawed from its advertisements any words, such as "energetic" or "experienced", that might imply prejudice against a certain age group. The list, which also includes "hungry" and "gravitas", is imaginative, but not, we feel, exhaustive. "Literate" or "knowledgeable", for example, would surely deter most applicants under 30. Meanwhile, the first of the new generation of recruitment ads, commissioned by the Government itself, has fallen into our hands. "Someone needed to redraft sloppily worded legislation that will subject thousands of employers to needless inconvenience and make the law a laughing stock. If you can read this without moving your lips, you might just be the person we're looking for." Telegraph View

Ask John: Office romances have their pitfalls but you might still meet Mr or Mrs Right
Straight-talking, common sense from the front line of management
'Company rule books can’t control physical attraction.' Photo: REX	By John Timpson
5:12PM GMT 26 Jan 2014
Comments
Q One of my staff recently sent me a message on an online dating website. I was initially embarrassed but must admit that I do think he is very attractive. Is this a terrible idea? If so, how do I deal with the whole issue? A Company rule books can’t control physical attraction. It’s entirely up to you whether to go on the date but you may be heading for disaster.
It isn’t surprising so many relationships start through work. I know of 13 couples, currently employed in our office, and many Timpson shops such as Alfreton and Harlow are run by long term partners. But a few facets of your question give cause for concern.
You have to wonder why he made the contact online – didn’t he have the courage to declare his intentions face to face? You say he is “one of my staff” so I assume you’re his boss. It’s not a good idea to date a member of your own team. Others are bound to suspect favouritism especially if you work in the same part of the building and irritatingly gaze starry eyed across the office and hold hands as you go to the canteen together for lunch. If your relationship ends, life at the office could become so tricky that one of you will have to leave the business.

Is office romance a source of workplace heartache?
19 Apr 2011
Think carefully before making a move, I’ve listed a lot of the pitfalls but there’s always the chance this is the man for you. Plenty of company romances confound the critics and blossom into a life-changing partnership. My father met my mother in our office at Kettering. But he didn’t make his first move over the internet.
Q The media is suggesting there will be a large influx of Bulgarians and Romanians into the UK in 2014. Where will they find work? Did you recruit any Poles when a similar situation arose from Poland joining the EU in 2004? A We discriminate in two ways. We have pledged to recruit 10pc of our workforce from prison and we only choose applicants who “get it”. You could say we discriminate against weaker candidates.
We always try to pick people with personality, they come in all shapes and sizes. As a result the men and women who join us include Geordies, Poles, Cockneys, Somalians, Italians, Scousers, Scots, West Indians, Irish, Romanians, Welsh and Chinese – lots of nationalities with a wide range of accents who all speak our language.
Everyone starts as an apprentice so it is much easier for us to teach people with good English. Consequently, British born applicants have a built in advantage but I bet some Bulgarians and Romanians will become Timpson colleagues during 2014.
Q I work for a company as a sales rep but, after two years, they still haven’t come up with a commission offer despite working extra hours. How do you reward your sales staff? A We have a bonus scheme that hasn’t changed for over 20 years. We use the same system in each shop every week of the year.
All wages paid to anyone working at the shop that week are added up and multiplied by 4.5 to produce a sales target (we use 4.5 because it works!).
All sales over the target earn a 15pc bonus, which is paid out the following Thursday. The bonus is only given to colleagues there during the week, people on holiday or off sick don’t qualify. The payout is shared according to experience. Our training is linked to skill tests, with every pass earning an extra point. Colleagues with the most points earn the biggest bonus.
That system, which I hope sounds as simple as it really is, provides the adrenalin that puts a buzz into our business. It makes sure most of our colleagues are keen to look after their customers and hopefully helps to give our customers a better service.
It certainly works for us and may well work for lots of other businesses.
Q My friend applied for one of the Government’s Start Up Loans and spent it on a car and a holiday. The loan provider didn’t seem to care. Do you think that this whole wheeze is in fact being used as a secret form of quantitative easing?
A I would be surprised if the Government has a Machiavellian plan but Start Up Loans can clearly help to pep up the economy. I have never really understood quantitative easing (I just hope Mark Carney does) but, in a world where banks are so risk-averse, it must be right for the Government to step in and help budding entrepreneurs. Every government spends some of our taxes on business schemes that fill a political agenda but don’t necessarily have a commercial benefit. My big beef is about training. Sadly, too much of the billions spent on apprenticeships fails to find its way to the shop floor. By squandering his loan your friend wasted his opportunity as well as some taxpayer’s money (despite the red tape put in place to protect the public purse). This was probably caused by preferring process to personality. Start Up Loans shouldn’t be awarded on the basis of a business plan, they should simply back the right people. Even if your friend had a great plan on paper, they picked the wrong man.

Zara's sparkle sends founder Ortega up rich list
Zara-owner Inditex is chasing more global expansion as it toasts a strong year which saw its founder become the third richest person in the world.
Inditex founder and majority shareholder mancio Ortega overtook Warren Buffett and French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault on the Forbes 2013 rich list, with an estimated net worth of $57bn. By Denise Roland
10:01AM GMT 13 Mar 2013
Comments
In a year when the group launched online sales in China and Canada, and broke new ground in parts of eastern Europe, its founder and majority shareholder Amancio Ortega overtook Warren Buffett and French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault on the Forbes rich list, with an estimated net worth of $57bn. The Spanish fashion group, which also counts Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti among its brands, posted a 22pc pre-tax profit rise to €3.13bn in the year to January 31 as sales sales surged 15.6pc to €15.9bn. By the end of January, it had more than 6,000 stores across 86 countries and said it expected to launch flagship brand Zara online in Russia over the autumn-winter season and open a further 440 to 480 stores worldwide in 2013. It is already the world's biggest fashion retailer, making around 840 million garments a year. However, analysts were disappointed by the results, which were weaker-than-expected, largely due to falling sales in Inditex's austerity-gripped home market, where unemployment is at a record high of 26pc. Shares in Inditex fell 3.6pc in early trading but have risen 53pc over the year.

The retail giant sets itself apart with its "fast fashion" offering, with pieces appearing on rails within weeks of conception, and being replaced by even newer designs just as swiftly. Unlike its peers, it does not advertise, but enjoys plenty of publicity through its popularity with fashion icons such as the Duchess of Cambridge and sister Pippa Middleton. Inditex, which has seen its shares triple in value in the past five years and outperform European peers by more than a third over the last 12 months, said on Wednesday it would propose raising its dividend by 22pc to €2.2 per share.

Social services 'failed to protect teenager from years of family abuse'
Exclusive: Social services failed to protect a teenager from years of family abuse and violence, despite dozens of “very significant” warnings that the girl was at risk of harm, an independent review has concluded. The council's social services department was ranked as "inadequate" by Ofsted - the same verdict given to Haringey, the council that failed Baby P, pictured.

Comments
A catalogue of failures by Essex County Council over almost two decades caused “Agnes” to be unnecessarily subjected to physical and sexual abuse by her mother and relatives, the damning report found. A serious case review, conducted by the Essex Safeguarding Children’s Board, heavily criticised social services for failing to make risk assessments on Agnes their “prime focus”, The Daily Telegraph can disclose. Agnes, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was neglected and physically or sexually abused by her mother, her mother’s partners and her step-grandfather throughout her childhood and teenage years. But social services failed to act, despite being “overwhelmed” with at least 200 warnings, from concerned neighbours and her older siblings. Many of these warnings were deemed “very significant” and all would have required official investigation, the review concluded. Related Articles

Social services took my children
26 Feb 2011
The report, obtained by this newspaper, found that when officials did become involved, assessments on the abused child were initially left to students. The council last night admitted that no staff member or officials had been disciplined or had “any further action” taken against them following the blunders. Agnes, the youngest of several siblings – all of whom had been abused in some form - was placed into care in her mid teens in 2006 after she told police about her abuse. Before the family, none of whom can be named, moved to the area in 1990, they had already been known to social services in other parts of the country. But despite several years of involvement officials failed to raise concerns about why the family were no longer being monitored. It also found that while there was a history of abuse in the family, risk assessments on Agnes were "never the prime focus” for social services. The report found social workers wrongly thought Agnes would be better protected because several of her mother’s children had already been taken into care. An executive summary of the review into Agnes treatment, written in November 2010 last year but published several months later, also found that: * Risks of physical violence were either never considered or viewed as “peripheral” despite more than 30 incidents of harm involving her mother including assaulting police and doctors who visited her home. * Officials never questioned Ms T’s claims that Agnes “bruised easily”, which was used to “cover-up” the physical abuse. They also prioritised her mother's needs over the children’s while officials felt “sorry” for Ms T, who was violent and depressed. * Sexual abuse was “partially recognised” but rarely acted upon while domestic violence was never fully addressed. * No man who had contact with the family was subjected to background checks despite most known to police as being a danger. * Neglect to Agnes was never assessed despite medical evidence of poor growth and obesity. Bob Cook, the report’s author, said he wanted to understand why “Agnes remained in her mother’s care for so long” despite two decades of social services’ involvement and “very significant concerns” raised about the family. “The sheer volumes of concerns at some points in this case… must have led to a feeling of front line staff being overwhelmed,” he wrote. “The lack of strategic management response through the history of this case is one of the most striking features. "There were specific decisions raising questions of competence of some specialist staff."
Mr Crow called for better monitoring, communication and tighter control over cases that would be “sufficiently robust” to address the multiple failings. Last year its social services department was ranked as “inadequate” by Ofsted - the same verdict given to Haringey, the council that failed Baby P. A council spokeswoman admitted that no one had been disciplined from the case. “We are satisfied that there is no further disciplinary action arising from this case,” she said. She also admitted the review found social services were “focused too much on helping the mother”, in what she claimed was to help “improve her parenting skills”. “When it was becoming increasingly clear that this approach was not working, and not enough on safeguarding the children,” she added. But she denied up to 200 “warnings” were “ignored”. “The issue here is not that these incidents were ignored, but that they were not taken as cumulative evidence that a child protection enquiry was necessary,” she said. “In fact, this family received a lot of social work time and attention and were closely monitored for long periods.” The case was now used as training material, she added. She said it was publicly released “earlier than it should have been”. Children's Health

Numbers don't add up, but VW Polo is still the winner
If you believe a car is the second most expensive thing in your life, after a house, you are wrong...
Home comforts: VW claims cars are less expensive than we might think, but its evidence is flimsy
Photo: ALAMY	By Mike Rutherford
11:25AM BST 20 Sep 2010
Comments
That, at least, is VW’s view. The German giant has started producing contentious statistics to support its claim that cars are number five on our lifetime expenditure lists.
The firm makes a lot of generalisations and assumptions when trying to prove VWs are comparatively inexpensive.
It estimates the average Brit spends £1,785,264 during their lifetime, but I’m not sure how Mr or Mrs Average gets close. Volkswagen is sticking with that figure, though. Housing is the top item on the list, with a total figure of £835,588, at today’s prices. Of that, £645,078 pays for the home, another £98,580 goes on domestic energy while £91,930 takes care of creature comforts. All this equates to 47 per cent of the £1.8 million lifetime spend, the Germans say. Second comes food and drink, 18 per cent or £314,128 of our cash. Of that, £182,687 goes on food shopping, £91,539 on “dining” (eating in restaurants) and £39,902 on drinking. Related Articles

Buying a car doesn't have to be taxing

Having “fun” has a price tag of £287,514, or 16 per cent of your lifetime spend. Think £134,963 for going out, £34,458 for hobbies and £118,093 for clothes (which I’d have put on the “essential” list, personally).
Holidays are fourth and cost £136,397, or eight per cent, with £112,708 on annual breaks, £15,075 on weekends away and only £8,614 on days out. Volkswagen argues that cars are a lowly fifth - and last - in terms of big-league spending. At least, they are if they are VW Polos.
Buy them new, own and run each one until their warranties expire three years later and their “lifetime cost” will be £127,630, seven per cent of the average total expenditure over 80 years. But hang on - to stick to that comparatively low figure, we’re only buying 10 Polos, and keeping each for three years.
Generally though, keen, healthy drivers are likely to run cars for 60 years rather than 30, aren’t they? VW’s figure must surely be doubled to £255,260 if it’s to have any credibility. True, this means paying more than £250,000 on buying, owning and running modest, but newish, VW Polos.
A less painful and more productive way of looking at it is to acknowledge that the Polo ownership/usership figure per year is just £4,254. Do 12,000 miles a year and this works out at little more than 30p per mile. Correctly, VW is keen to point out that Polos are cheap to buy outright (from £9,790), refuel (petrol versions do 50mpg on the Combined cycle, diesels 80mpg), service (£250 for a 36-month package deal) and hold their value (most depreciating less than 50 per cent in three years). While I have doubts about VW’s expenditure claims, I can’t quibble with what it says about the Polo. If you’re looking to spend about £10,000, it is undoubtedly the best car available.

Cars line up in the path of lava flowing down the Eyjafjallajkull volcano in Iceland. The drivers parked their 4x4s in the path of the molten rock as it poured down the slopes of the volcano. Some even got out of their cars to take a closer look at the eruption. The images were posted online by 25-year-old student Kristjan Freyr rastarson - and instantly went viral on the internet. Within just a few days, they have received 300,000 hits - around the same as the entire population of Iceland.Picture: Kristjan Freyr rastarson / Barcroft Media

Alistair Darling: Alex Salmond is misleading Scots about the cost of independence
Alistair Darling has warned Alex Salmond is misleading Scots about the financial cost of leaving the UK after the White Paper on independence included only one “scanty” page of estimates.

The former Chancellor said he was “very, very angry” at the paucity of figures in the Scottish Government’s 670-page White Paper, published on Tuesday, and suggested that Mr Salmond was attempting to take his countrymen “for a ride”. He said the document’s page of projections outlining a newly separate Scotland’s finances in 2016/17 was so flimsy that it appeared to have been written on the back of an envelope on a kitchen table. While the White Paper suggested that a separate Scotland’s national debt interest payments could start at £3.9 billion a year, he warned this figure could easily reach £9 billion if the SNP’s “optimistic” assumptions were not realised. Mr Darling contrasted the document with the Red Book produced by the Treasury at every Budget, the most recent of which contained 112 pages of tax and revenue projections, and said Mr Salmond “should not be allowed to get away with it”. The leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign spoke out after Mr Salmond’s spokesman claimed that Scottish separation would be “cost neutral” despite having to create new government departments and armed forces.

The White Paper contained no price tag for creating a Scottish state, although a leaked paper by John Swinney, the Scottish Finance Minister, admitted that the cost of tax collection alone could more than double to £625 million. Although the document made a series of major spending promises, including a major expansion of childcare, none were costed and it ignored a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that an extra £6 billion of savings would have to be found. Speaking at a press conference in Edinburgh, Mr Darling said: “You would have thought when setting out something that was called a prospectus for a blueprint for Scotland’s future, you would have had more than one page and a pretty scanty page at that. “This is back of envelope stuff. This is something you do at the kitchen table – maybe that’s what happened to it on Saturday night before it finally went to the printers.”
The former Chancellor added: “Just look at the Red Book and the sort of things that’s in it and look at this one page and ask yourself is Alex Salmond taking the people of Scotland seriously? It just looks like he is taking us for a ride.” According to the White Paper, total Scottish spending in 2016/17 will be £63.7 billion but Mr Darling said this took no account of the costs of setting up a new state. The document said the interest on the national debt would be £3.9 billion if the latter was calculated using the balance between tax and spending since 1980/81, which coincides with the boom years of North Sea oil. The former Chancellor said an alternative figure of £5.5 billion, based on Scotland’s GDP share of the UK national debt, would be more likely. But he said the White Paper failed to take into account that a new and smaller nation state would pay higher interest on its debt, with an independent economic think tank estimating the additional cost being between £1 billion and £2.2 billion. Mr Darling said the document assumes North Sea oil will generate between £6.8 billion and £7.9 billion, whereas the independent Office for Budget Responsibility put the figure at £4.3 billion. The net result is a separate Scotland would start life making £9 billion of interest payments on its debt, he estimated, a higher proportion of its GDP (5.2 per cent) than the UK. Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister, said: “Alistair Darling’s rattled and feeble response to the White Paper says it all – the No campaign are rapidly running out of ideas, and have nothing positive to say.”
Meanwhile, David Mr Cameron told Prime Minister’s Questions that the White Paper was a thick document full of false promise” that had left a “huge set of questions” on a separate Scotland’s currency and Nato and EU membership. “In the absence of any detailed costings, it wasn't a blueprint for independence but a wish list,” he said.

Moving Egyptian statue brings visitor numbers to new record
The mystery of the spinning Egyptian statue has sent visitor numbers soaring at the Manchester Museum.
By Radhika Sanghani and agencies
10:36AM BST 25 Jun 2013
A 10-inch tall figure was filmed inexplicably rotating in its display cabinet has attracted record numbers of visitors to the Manchester Museum. Time-lapse video clearly showed the statue, which dates back to 1,800 BC, turning round inside the locked cabinet - without being touched by anyone. The story went global with international TV crews descending on the Oxford Road site to film the statue for themselves. It was also picked up by news websites in countries around the world - including in Egypt - and the museum has been inundated with calls from paranormal investigators. Museum chiefs also said it was the busiest Monday on record as hundreds of extra visitors turned up yesterday, with most asking to see the statue. Related Articles

Scientists, including TV presenter Professor Brian Cox, said they believed the vibrations caused by the feet of passers-by may have caused the statue to rotate. But others have speculated the statue may be rotating because of a 'Curse of the Pharaohs'. The statue of Neb-Senu was retrieved from a Mummy's tomb and handed to the museum 80 years ago - but it has only recently been spotted spinning. Tim Manley, head of marketing and communications at the museum, said: "We're sure there's a logical explanation, we're just not quite sure what it is yet." He added: "There's been a definite spike in visitors. I think it's been the busiest Monday I've ever seen. We usually get around 500 on a Monday during term time, but it was hundreds more today." Among the visitors was Ciaran Milner, 21, a final year History and Sociology student who admitted that he had never previously visited the museum. He said: "I've always been interested in history, but I'd never heard of a spinning artefact. I think I'd back Brian Cox's theory over spirits or aliens though." UK News

High-speed rail route 'under threat' as Tories refuse to support Labour's proposals
A high-speed train link from London to Birmingham is to become a political battleground after the Conservatives refused to support Labour’s proposals. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, has previously cautioned that the multi-billion pound project will not succeed unless it is 'above politics'. Photo: HEATHCLIFFE O'MALLEY	By Nick Collins
7:30AM GMT 19 Feb 2010
Follow Both Labour and the Tories support plans for a 200mph route from the capital to the Midlands but are expected to clash over which communities will be affected. The Tories have refused offers to see an advanced copy of the white paper on the project. The white paper will detail the location of the tracks – which is expected to pass through Buckinghamshire and parts of the Chilterns – to within five metres in urban areas and within 25 metres in the countryside. The Conservatives want to leave their options open so that an alternative route could be drawn up if they win the general election. The party has commissioned a team of independent rail experts to look over the proposals, which were drawn up by High Speed Two, a public company. They have not yet seen the final report. Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, has previously cautioned that the multi-billion pound project will not succeed unless it is “above politics”. Theresa Villiers, the shadow transport secretary, said the Conservatives had turned down the chance to see the final report on the proposals before they were published.
She said it would be “inappropriate” to make a decision without consulting people along the route. She told The Guardian: “We are not going to give a political blank cheque to Labour. “We would not want to close down debate on a route before the people affected by it have the chance to be heard. It would be very unfair for the people affected if they thought there was a cosy political consensus on the route.” The Conservatives have promised to develop a high-speed line between London and Birmingham instead of a third runway at Heathrow, and are believed to be in favour of making Heathrow central to the route. Lord Adonis said: “Full public consultation will of course take place on any route proposed by the government. The consensus I seek is on the principle of high-speed rail, so that it can be taken forward on a cross-party basis in the next parliament.” Road and rail transport

Baghdad liquor shop owner toasts the Green Zone
By Adrian Blomfield in Baghdad
12:01AM BST 22 Apr 2005
Finding a beer in Baghdad can be a challenge these days, what with the bombs and the rising Islamic militancy. But one off-licence in the Iraqi capital is going from strength to strength. Sa'ad Sabah, its proprietor, has become one of the city's most successful small businessmen. Within range of United States armour and watchtowers lining the blast walls of the Green Zone, his shop, The Rose, attracts customers from the suburbs. Mr Sabah has little competition largely because Islamic extremists now register their disapproval of alcohol by bombing his rivals' premises. The Rose, however, is unscathed, presumably because the bombers fear the proximity of US military hardware. Despite living in the shadow of what many Iraqis regard as occupiers, Mr Sabah insists that he is not a collaborator. But he does admit to profiting unwittingly from his competitors' misfortune. "When the other shops closed, I shut for only two days," he said. "Since then sales have gone up by at least 50 per cent. I'm still nervous, I'm still afraid. But I do believe that being so close to the Green Zone will keep us fairly safe."

Above the rows of vodka and cheap whisky, stands a shrine to his father, like him a Kurdish Christian, who founded the shop in 1971. Underneath his photograph are the words: "Love one another as I have loved you." Seeking to do just that, he has encouraged rivals whose businesses had been destroyed to set up shop nearby. There are now five off-licences within 300 yards and the street has become known as Alcohol Alley. Before the war business was good. The Koran forbade the consumption of alcohol but Muslims who chose to drink were indulged by a regime that was, for the most part, religiously liberal. The vast majority of visitors to Alcohol Alley today are still Muslim. But intimidation from the extremists necessitates discretion. Iraqis caught with alcohol risk kidnapping or execution. But Alcohol Alley is now fearful for its future. The new government is dominated by Shia politicians with ties to conservative clerics. "We are very concerned about the new government," Mr Sabah said. "It is possible they could ban alcohol.'' Iraq

Learn A New Language
Sharpen your focus with Babbel’s online language courses
Studying a new language or brushing up on an old one can have a positive effect on the brain. It has also been linked with staving off the effects of dementia
Babbel makes learning a language enjoyable and pressure free By Hazel Davis
5:07PM BST 08 Aug 2013
Being Scandinavian is just about the best thing to be at the moment. In fact, most of my decisions (baby clothes, breakfast items, TV viewing choices) are currently made using the question, “What would the Scandinavians do?” What they would do, undoubtedly, is embrace the idea that learning a language can boost your wellbeing. A couple of years ago researchers from York University in Canada found that speaking two languages has a positive effect on the brain, sharpening focus and even staving off the effects of dementia. My own previously sharp mind has taken a bit of a battering lately, what with juggling work and babies and all. So, in the interests of self-improvement and in a nod to the fact that my other half looks a bit like a Viking, I sign up to an online language course from Babbel. To get some focus. Fjord focus. Babbel offers 13 languages at various levels. To assess my suitability I take an introductory test, after which the site gently suggests I might want to start with beginner’s Norwegian at £8.95 a month (much cheaper than signing up to a “real-life” class).

Stay the course
02 Dec 2013
The really great thing about this site is it won’t let you get a question wrong
You can choose to do the course with or without speech recognition, which means you can practise in a café with no embarrassment or out loud in your bedroom while the dog looks on pityingly. Norwegian, the site tells me, has two forms; the literary language, Bokmål, and New Norwegian (Nynorsk) and children learn both at school. I am learning the book language. I’m a bit worried that this won’t equip me to ask for more rakfisk but I plough on. I also learn that there is no standard dialect as everyone speaks his or her own and everyone understands. The exercises are easy to start with. I get 78 per cent for my pronunciation of hei (hello), thank you very much. Then I have to fill in the missing letters in a sentence such as “Hei Lars”. It sounds childish but, you know what, it really sinks in. Filling in the blanks gets progressively harder and I get less cocky. Under each question there are little tips such as, “In older Norwegian texts it’s not uncommon to see aa written for the letter å for example. Håkon or mål (goal) as maal.” The really great thing about this site is it won’t let you get a question wrong, so there’s no ill-feeling between you and the machine. The blank simply remains silently red until you have got it right. Moreover, it knows I full well know what a personal pronoun is and what the different tenses are and does not condescend, but at the same time it also lets me listen 27 times to a lady saying, “God morgen, Per” (Good morning, Per) without judging me. You can pick and choose sections too, so that if one day you fancy skipping forward to ordering something in a café or if you want to go back to the section about pronouncing ø and o, you can (it’s a relief to have finally cleared that up). I swear I’m not making this up but after just a few days of regular practice, I do find myself thinking slightly differently. When I read, I read in a different way. It’s as though I am paying more attention, listening harder to people. I feel proud of myself, like I am achieving something. And I also now know how to say Jo Nesbø properly.

Spain
Atletico Madrid’s Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa will heed a call-up from Spain. Costa is leading scorer in La Liga with 10 goals but is ineligible for the forthcoming qualifiers against Belarus and Georgia due to a paperwork delay. “I have played my entire career here regardless that I was born in Brazil,” Costa said. “Spain has given me everything and if I can play for the national team I will do it as well as I can.” The forward turns 25 today and celebrated with both goals in a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo to give Atletico a record eighth successive win. Barcelona remained top on goal difference after beating Valladolid 4-1 but Real Madrid required a deflected strike from Cristiano Ronaldo in the last minute to see off Levante. Marko Marin, on loan from Chelsea, set up Sevilla’s winner as they beat Almeria. Germany
Table-topping Bayern Munich celebrated their recent success as their Spanish manager Pep Guardiola took the squad to the Oktoberfest beer festival. The former Barcelona coach, accompanied by his wife Christina, even donned the traditional lederhosen and hat for the occasion on Sunday. Bayern had leapfrogged Borussia Dortmund to go top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after drawing 1-1 with Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told the players: “Celebrate freely. Our next game isn’t for another two weeks. We can enjoy the beer.” There was little cause for jubilation for Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp, however. His side were defeated 2-0 by Borussia Monchengladbach, losing Nuri Sahin and Sven Bender to injury. Italy

Sampdoria will feel they were robbed of their first victory of the season when they were denied a goal against Torino because the referee had blown for half-time seconds earlier. Already leading 1-0, Sampdoria thought they had doubled their lead when Nicola Pozzi pounced on Angelo Palombo’s spilt free kick but referee Andrea Gervasoni ruled that the half had ended. To make matters worse Torino took a 2-1 lead after the break and Sampdoria required a last-minute penalty to earn a point. It took Sulley Muntari less than 30 seconds to open the scoring for AC Milan against Juventus but Andrea Pirlo and Sebastian Giovinco put the champions ahead. When Giorgio Chiellini scored a third after Philippe Mexes was dismissed the points seemed safe – then Muntari scored again. Juve, however, held on. France
Paris St-Germain reclaimed top spot from Monaco with victory against third-placed Marseille. Their task looked tough when Thiago Motta was sent off for kicking Matieu Valbuena in the box. Andre Ayew scored the penalty but the 10 men were level before half-time, Brazilian defender Maxwell nodding in. Inevitably it was Zlatan Ibrahimovic who settled the match, with another penalty. Monaco’s younger foreign stars shone brightest as Claudio Ranieri’s side overcame St Etienne. Belgian midfielder Yannick Ferreira Carrasco struck first but the visitors drew level through Romain Hamouma. Carrasco was withdrawn for Lucas Ocampos and the 19-year-old popped up with the winner. Lille kept in touch with the top three with a 3-0 win against struggling Ajaccio. European

Mike De Kock puts Soft Falling Rain's unbeaten record on the line in Newbury's Hungerford Stakes
Top trainers are busy characters, bustling from gallops to office to racecourse, all the time keeping in contact with their owners and staff, forever in search of the next big winner.

Comments
But Mike De Kock, the South African champion, takes that frenetic daily schedule to new levels. De Kock, having recently collected the trainers’ title for the eighth time in his native country, also has a large squad of horses in Dubai and keeps a satellite yard in Newmarket for the horses his owners purchase in this part of the world. No surprise then that De Kock has several quality horses on the go there at this time of the year and in the next week punters can look forward to seeing two of his best, Soft Falling Rain, who will make his British debut in Newbury’s Hungerford Stakes on Saturday, and Shea Shea in York’s Nunthorpe Stakes on Aug 23. The unbeaten Soft Falling Rain looked very classy when he landed the Godolphin Mile at Meydan on Dubai World Cup night in March, extending his winning sequence to seven. He has not run since and De Kock warned yesterday that there would still be something to work on. “He is going to improve with this run,” he said. “You can’t get them 101 per cent first up, but he’s as fit as I can get him without a race. We’ll see how he comes out of it, and then we might look at the Prix de la Foret, at Longchamp, on Arc weekend. He likes the Tapeta surface at Meydan, and also fast ground on turf.”
It is interesting that having won the UAE 2,000 Guineas and the Godolphin Mile, that connections feel the colt will be better placed coming back a furlong for his next two outings. Related Articles

De Kock has booked Frankie Dettori for Shea Shea in the Nunthorpe as regular jockey Christophe Soumillon is under suspension. “Frankie has ridden a couple of winners for me in Dubai. It is Christophe’s ride, but he is banned,” said De Kock. Shea Shea won the Al Quoz Sprint at Meydan, finished second in the King’s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and fourth in the July Cup at Newmarket. He will be well suited by the five-furlong track on Knavesmire. Dancing Rain will become the first Epsom Oaks winner carrying her first foal to be sold at public auction in more than 50 years when she goes under the hammer at Tattersalls December Sale. She has tested in foal to Frankel. Horse Racing

British and Irish Lions 2013: the issues facing coach Warren Gatland as selection D-day looms
From team selection to claims of bias, Warren Gatland has much to ponder over 48 hours.

Captaincy He is the only player that will be present at the Hilton London, Syon Park when the squad is announced at 11am on Tuesday and so will be the only one with any advance knowledge of selection. All other players will discover the squad at the same time as the rest of us. It boiled down to a choice between Paul O’Connell and Sam Warburton, with Brian O’Driscoll, Jamie Heaslip and Chris Robshaw all considered before slipping out of contention. It is understood that Warburton will pip O’Connell. In that case, it will be very much a case of head coach Warren Gatland stamping his mark on the tour. Warburton is his man. He was always a reluctant captain in the first place and needed considerable persuasion from Gatland to take the role for Wales in the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The recent RBS Six Nations was difficult for him, resulting in his not captaining against England even when stand-in skipper Ryan Jones was injured. But on the day he still led magnificently and managed a rapport with referee Steve Walsh that England captain Robshaw could not manage. It is Warburton’s first tour and he would have to deal with former captains in O’Driscoll and O’Connell, but he was Wales captain at the age of 22 after all, and should not be cowed by their presence.

Accusations of favouritism One problem might be that Gatland’s party is perceived as being too Welsh. Of the possible 38-man squad, as many as 15 could be Welsh, with prop Paul James a 16th possibility. And the appointment of Neil Jenkins last week added to Gatland, Rob Howley as coaches, as well as analysts Rhys Long and Rhodri Bown, plus medical performance manager Prav Mathema and head of physical performance Adam Beard. It is possible this could cause some grumbles elsewhere - especially in England - but then again Wales have won the Six Nations for the last two seasons. Back row This is the trickiest of areas, where there are a plethora of candidates and possible combinations. The first thing to say is that the selectors are probably fortunate that Ireland’s Stephen Ferris is injured and therefore unavailable. When both fully fit only a cigarette paper can separate him and Wales’ Dan Lydiate as the finest blindside flanker in Britain and Ireland. As it is, a gamble may have to be taken on Lydiate’s fitness. He has appeared just four times for Newport Gwent Dragons (two full matches) since returning from long-term injury, but Gatland is known to be a huge admirer of his chop tackling and general work rate. Lydiate has put on half a stone of muscle while injured and was outstanding in the Dragons’ win over Munster last weekend. For all the talk of genuine opensides and the like, any back row selection is all about balance. Warburton works best at openside with Lydiate at blindside, and with Toby Faletau as a powerful carrier in between. The option of Warburton and Justin Tipuric together, so effective against England, will be considered, but Tipuric’s ball skills and vision are more likely to be deployed in last quarters. It is believed that the selectors are keen to utilise Robshaw’s admirable leadership qualities and work rate but finding a place for him will be tricky. Sean O’Brien, equally adept at open or blind, is almost certain to travel, and Tom Croft is considered a better option than Robshaw at blindside. England’s Tom Wood and Scotland’s Kelly Brown look likely to miss out. At No 8 England’s Ben Morgan would surely have been pushing for a place had he played a full Six Nations. Indeed Ireland’s Heaslip can consider himself fortunate to be going given his recent indifferent form, but go he probably will. Props The biggest question is how many to take. Gethin Jenkins (who may have to fly out to Australia after the French Top 14 final on June 1), Adam Jones, Cian Healy and Dan Cole would appear to be certainties, but thereafter problems arise. Euan Murray or Mike Ross as an extra tighthead? Paul James arguably deserves a spot as someone who can play both sides of the scrummage. But should Gatland gamble on Mako Vunipola’s raw power in the loose or - an even greater risk - Alex Corbisiero’s fitness? And then there is Ryan Grant’s all-round attributes, which make him a candidate. Inside centre/utility player The Lions coaches mentioned Billy Twelvetrees long ago in briefings as a possibile selection and his place will be debated hard on Monday. He can cover fly-half, something Scotland’s Greig Laidlaw could do from scrum half. James Hook, not especially rated by Gatland, is unlikely to make it. But it is cover for Jamie Roberts at inside centre that is most needed. And in that regard Scotland’s Matt Scott, England’s Brad Barritt and Ireland’s Gordon D’Arcy look likely to be disappointed. Wings George North and Alex Cuthbert are going, and it will be a surprise if Tommy Bowe does not join them. After that it is uncertain. Wasps’ Christian Wade has his proponents but defensive frailties linger too strongly and the truth is that Gloucester’s Jonny May is probably ahead of him, even in England terms. England’s other wingers can forget it. Scotland’s Tim Visser and Sean Maitland, and Ireland’s Craig Gilroy also have question marks beside their names. Had Simon Zebo been fit throughout the Six Nations you suspect there would not be so much argument. Probable squad Full backs: Leigh Halfpenny (Wales), Stuart Hogg (Scotland), Rob Kearney (Ireland)
Wings: George North (Wales), Alex Cuthbert (Wales), Tommy Bowe (Ireland), Simon Zebo (Ireland).
Centres: Jamie Roberts (Wales), Jonathan Davies (Wales), Brian O’Driscoll (Ireland), Manu Tuilagi (England), Billy Twelvetrees (England).
Fly halves: Jonathan Sexton (Ireland), Owen Farrell (England)
Scrum halves: Mike Phillips (Wales), Ben Youngs (England), Conor Murray (Ireland).
Props: Gethin Jenkins (Wales), Adam Jones (Wales), Cian Healy (Ireland), Dan Cole (England), Ryan Grant (Scotland), Mike Ross (Ireland).
Hookers: Rory Best (Ireland), Richard Hibbard (Wales), Tom Youngs (England).
Locks: Alun Wyn Jones (Wales), Ian Evans (Wales), Paul O’Connell (Ireland), Geoff Parling (England), Richie Gray (Scotland).
Flankers: Sam Warburton (Wales, pictured), Justin Tipuric (Wales), Dan Lydiate (Wales), Sean O’Brien (Ireland), Tom Croft (England).
No 8s: Toby Faletau (Wales), Jamie Heaslip (Ireland).
