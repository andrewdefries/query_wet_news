Yanko Tsvetkov, a Bulgarian designer and illustrator living in London, has produced seven maps in which countries and regions are labelled according to the stereotypes of their inhabitants held by the people of other nationalities. Europe According to Britain
In a map titled Europe According to USA, Russia is blocked out in red and labelled "Commies" while France reads "Smelly People" and Germany reads "Dirty Porn". Britain is simply labelled: "Mummy". In the map of Europe according to Britain, the mainland is labelled "Evil Federated Empire of Europe" while Ireland reads "Rascals" and Turkey is labelled "No Pork Meals Here". Click here to see a bigger version of this map. Mr Tsvetkov, 33, said he was inspired to create the first map in the series during the gas row between Ukraine and Russia in 2009. In the first map, titled Where I Live, Russia is labelled "Paranoid Oil Empire", while Ukraine is labelled "Gas Stealers". Related Articles

The graphic designer said: "I created the first one in 2009 because at that time there was an energy crisis in Europe. I just created it to amuse my friends but when I put it up on my website so many people liked it that I decided to really focus on the project of mapping the stereotypes based on different places in Europe. I was surprised by the reaction because I never really expected it to take off like this." Mr Tsvetkov's website has been inundated with around half a billion visitors since he published the series, called Mapping Stereotypes. As well as maps of Europe according to the US and Britain, the continent is shown as seen by France, Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. Europe

Rafa Benítez tells critics to 'enjoy' Chelsea Europa League win
A grinning Rafa Benítez, Chelsea's interim manager, speaks to the press along with Juan Mata and match-winner Branislav Ivanovic, after the club score in stoppage time to beat Benfica in the Europa League final. 7:54AM BST 16 May 2013
Comments
Chelsea won their second European trophy in two years, as they followed up last season's success in the UEFA Champions League with victory in the UEFA Europa League on Wednesday. Branislav Ivanovic, who missed last season's Champions League final due to suspension, headed in Juan Mata's 93rd minute corner to seal a 2-1 victory against Benfica. Ivanovic was awarded the man of the match and the Serbian was elated after the game. "I think this is one of the best moments in my career, to score in the European final the winning goal is the dream of every player". Interim Chelsea manager Benítez, who was not a popular appointment with the club's fans due to his links with rivals Liverpool, said after the win that he had simply done his job when asked if he had proved his critics wrong. "I think we had to do our job, we did it and now it's just time to enjoy," he said, smiling. Source: SNTV

The Caledonian occupies a prime spot at the western end of Princes Street (Edinburgh’s shopping thoroughfare).
Peacock Alley, which was originally the station concourse and ticket office, has been roofed over to become a spacious bar and lounge area in the centre of the building.
There's a total of 241 very different rooms split into four categories: classic, deluxe, castle view and suites – in soft blues, creams and green-greys.
The reception opens directly on to the busy intersection of Lothian Road and Shandwick Place.
