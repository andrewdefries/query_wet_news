Mazda RX-8H review The use of liquid hydrogen instead of petrol still has its supporters. Mazda has adapted its rotary-engined sports car to illustrate the fuel's potential. Image 1 of 2	The hydrogen-powered RX-8 at its Norwegian launch Image 1 of 2	Filling with liquid hydrogen By Stuart Birch 4:47PM BST 05 Aug 2009
Comments
In the automotive world, hydrogen could be the goddess of temptation. As an alternative fuel for cars, it seems to answer the prayers of governments, Greens and the great and would-be good of the industry. But, like so many things that seem too good to be true, it probably is. There are issues about how it can be produced on a vast industrial scale and the level of emissions involved in that production – and the lack of infrastructure to supply it to consumers. Yet some companies optimistically believe that its potential has not been blown up out of all proportion and remain set on seeing hydrogen win through in the end: one of them is Mazda. To show Europe what it can offer, the company is collaborating with the joint industry HyNor (Hydrogen Road Norway) project in support of the development of a hydrogen economy in the country. HyNor is to purchase 30 dual-fuel Mazda RX-8s powered by hydrogen or petrol, each fuel selectable via a dashboard switch. Another issue for hydrogen is that it has received some extremely negative publicity involving the fiery demise of the Hindenburg and R101 airships. Those disasters were long ago and bear no relation to the Mazda RX-8H RE I was driving. But Akiro Kashiwagi, Mazda’s hydrogen programme manager, sparked my imagination by saying: “Hydrogen is a very combustible fuel compared with petrol.” Related Articles
Mazda sets new world record
17 Jun 2013
In that moment, the A-word had popped into my mind: airships. But the Mazda’s pressurised fuel tank has been designed and tested for maximum safety and might well be the most crashworthy item in the car. So, less emotion and more fact from Mr. Kashiwagi: “Vehicles powered by hydrogen emit only water; that is why they are called ‘ultimate clean vehicles’. There are two main ways to extract energy from hydrogen: to generate electricity via a fuel cell or combust it directly in an internal combustion engine.”
He quickly slammed the door on fuel cells: “They are very expensive and not reliable enough.”
So, Mazda is for burning – and uses its rotary engine to do the job. That’s because the rotary makes the most of hydrogen’s propensity to go bang efficiently and does it in a controlled way. The HyNor initiative aims to demonstrate use of hydrogen vehicles on a 360 mile route from Oslo to Stavanger to encourage a significant reduction in carbon emissions into the country’s atmosphere. Hydrogen refuelling stations are being built but for longer journeys (over 100 miles) petrol is the alternative fuel for the Mazda. Norway’s hydrogen is produced from several sources, including natural gas reforming, biomass and chlorine manufacture. My hydrogen Mazda drive was a steady experience because the very special RX-8H RE only produces 107bhp when running on the fuel. Hydrogen combustion is noticeably louder. Mazda has been focused on its hydrogen programme for 18 years but it is not the only possible answer to reduce emissions. Research and development boss Seita Kanai said that several other solutions are in the frame to achieve an average 23 per cent improvement in CO2 emissions by 2015 compared to those of 2008. The target is an average 95g/km. He explained that Mazda’s engines will become more efficient, vehicle weight will reduce by more than 200lb, and plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles will be developed. Other manufacturers – notably BMW over the past 25 years with its special dual-fuel 7-series – have also looked at using hydrogen to fuel internal combustion engines. Mercedes-Benz, though, prefers to use it for its fuel cell B-Class, due to appear in production form later this year. Concerns about refuelling hydrogen cars have been overcome by safe but simple-to-use pumps. And, contrary to popular myth, when I refuelled my RX-8H, it did not lift gently from the gas station forecourt like a stately airship. Oh, dear, I’ve mentioned the A-word again. Farm tractors are moving into fresh environmental technology fields. New Holland’s experimental hydrogen fuel cell NH2 tractor is part of the company’s Energy Independent Farm concept, aimed at freeing farmers from the increasing cost of fuel, writes Stuart Birch.
New Holland envisages farmers using electrolysis - taking electricity generated by wind turbines, solar panels or biomass and biogas processes on their farm - to break down water into its constituent parts of hydrogen and oxygen. Compressed hydrogen could then be stored in tanks on the farm ready for agricultural use.
So the NH2 could help plough the fields without scattering emissions, producing only heat and water vapour, while operating virtually silently.

Teenagers push abortion rate to record high
By Caroline Davies
12:01AM BST 20 Jun 2007
More teenagers are having abortions than ever before, fuelling a significant rise in the number of terminations in England and Wales.
Despite huge Government spending on contraception education, 19-year-olds are now the most likely of any age group to have an abortion, with 35 in every 1,000 having the procedure, according to Department of Health figures.
A total of 40,244 abortions were carried out on girls aged between 15 and 19 years, and 18,691 on girls aged under 18, including 1,042 on under 15-year-olds, 907 on 14-year-olds and 135 on girls under 14.
In total, 3,990 abortions were carried out on girls aged under 16 - the age of consent - last year.
Previously the highest rate was among women aged 20-24 years. There is concern teenagers now see abortion as a form of contraception.
The figures come one week after a report from a Government-funded advisory group warned that British teenagers were in a sexual health crisis fuelled by a "celebrity culture" that condoned alcohol abuse, drugs and promiscuity.
In total there were 193,737 abortions in England and Wales last year - an increase of 3.9 per cent on 2005. The rise between 2005 and 2004 was just 0.4 per cent.
A further 7,436 terminations were carried out for non-residents, of which 68 per cent came from the Irish Republic and 17 per cent from Northern Ireland.
The figures also show that 32 per cent of women who had an abortion had already had at least one previous termination. This percentage remained unchanged from 2005 despite the Government earmarking £40 million for contraception education and led to widespread condemnation yesterday that their sexual health initiatives are failing.
Caroline Flint, the health minister, admitted: "The NHS needs to work harder to reduce the demand for abortions by improving access to contraception."
She said the good news was that more abortions were taking place at an early stage - 68 per cent - under 10 weeks' gestation.
Yesterday's figures show that the under-16 abortion rate was 3.9 per 1,000 girls, up from 3.7 in 2005, and the under-18 rate was 18.3 per 1,000 women, up from 17.8.
Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: "These are disappointing figures, especially on repeat abortions which further illustrates the failure of the Government's strategies on sexual health and teenage pregnancy."
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the figures pointed to "a failure to address the problem of unplanned pregnancy, particularly in teenagers and young women".
"This now represents a major public health issue, and a failure of preventative medicine," it said.
The figures are released against the backdrop of an increasingly bitter debate as the Abortion Act marks its 40th year - with moves to make abortion even easier.
Next week the British Medical Association will debate recommendations approved by its medical ethics committee, which say women should be able to decide to have abortions within the first 13 weeks without consent from two doctors. Lord Steel, who proposed legalising abortion 40 years ago, said yesterday the figures indicated a "very unwelcome trend", especially the level of repeat abortions which was "extraordinary".
Paul Pully, from the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said: "Gordon Brown should end the Labour Government's policy of rushing women as quickly as possible through the abortion mill in its frenzy to cut waiting times."
Anne Weyman, the chief executive of the Family Planning Association, said: "The fact that there has been such a percentage rise in the numbers of women having an abortion since 2005 isn't surprising given that contraceptive services are in crisis and at their lowest point for many years.
"Services are being cut and clinics are closing up and down the country."

Facebook connects to Microsoft Office
New plug-in allows Facebook information to connect directly to Microsoft's Office email application
Microsoft Outlook: how can you read messages marked "spam"? By Matt Warman, Consumer Technology Editor
2:08PM BST 13 Jul 2010
Comments
Microsoft Outlook will now integrate with Facebook, MSN Messenger, MySpace and LinkedIn, giving users access to a social version of email.
The move aims to put Outlook, Microsoft’s premium email product, on a par with its web-based rivals, including Microsoft’s own Hotmail, Yahoo Mail and Gmail, which already include chat capabilities.
Last year, Microsoft launched the Outlook Social Connector plugin, which synchronises social networking feeds with Outlook contacts. The new Facebook integration includes pictures for contacts, status updates, wall posts and picture activities. Currently, however, users will not be able to "like" updates within Outlook. This, and connections to other networks such as Twitter, should be part of further developments, however.
Microsoft is separating email identities and social networks, so if a work email address is not connected to a social network, it won’t integrate even if a private email address for the same person is also connected. The aim is to avoid the potential privacy problems that could be encountered by blurring the lines between business and pleasure.
