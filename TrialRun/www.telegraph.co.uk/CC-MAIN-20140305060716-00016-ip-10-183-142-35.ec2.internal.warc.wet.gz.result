Nacht und Träume, CD review
Matthias Goerne (baritone), Alexander Schmalcz (piano). Rating: * * * * By Rupert Christiansen
6:42PM GMT 18 Feb 2011
Comments
Harmonia Mundi HMC 902063, £13.99
This is a selection of Schubert’s lieder, sung by Matthias Goerne with exquisite artistry. Only the warmth and simplicity that Goerne’s contemporary Christian Gerhaher brings to this music are lacking: as in his mannered interpretation of the title song, Goerne some-times allows the line to lose buoyancy and introspection to become affectation.

Downton Abbey boosted in Christmas TV war by catch-up viewers
Downton Abbey fared better in the Christmas Day television ratings war than initial viewing figures suggested, with an extra three million people watching it later via a catch-up service. A scene from the Downton Christmas special Photo: ITV	By Sam Marsden
10:41PM GMT 02 Jan 2013
Follow Comments
The Christmas special of the ITV1 country house drama drew an audience of 10.28 million including “time-shifted” viewing over the next seven days using digital video recorders like Sky+. This made Downton Abbey the second most watched programme on December 25, up from joint sixth in the overnight figures, behind the BBC soap opera EastEnders, which attracted 11.31 million viewers. Rival period drama Call The Midwife on BBC1 came third in the “consolidated” chart including catch-up viewing, with an audience of 10.18 million.
This pushed ITV’s Coronation Street down from second into fourth place with 10.16 million viewers. The updated viewing figures will be a relief for producers of Downton Abbey, whose well-reviewed two-hour Christmas special included the unexpected death of Matthew Crawley, one of the main characters.

Lord Julian Fellowes, the award-winning drama’s writer, has admitted that he would have loved to have kept Matthew Crawley in the series had Dan Stevens, the actor playing him, not chosen to leave the show.
Downton Abbey also proved to be very popular on catch-up services in 2011, when it topped the consolidated Christmas Day ratings. This is the Christmas Day top ten based on consolidated figures, with the original overnight position in brackets: 1 (1) EastEnders 11.31m viewers
2 (6=) Downton Abbey 10.28m
3 (6=) Call The Midwife 10.18m
4 (2) Coronation Street 10.16m

Girls, series two finale, Sky Atlantic, review
Alice Vincent reviews the final episode in the second series of Lena Dunham's Girls. 2.5
Lena Dunham stars as Hannah Horvath in HBO's Girls By Alice Vincent, Entertainment writer, online
8:20AM GMT 19 Mar 2013
Follow Comments
The problem with the second series of Girls (Sky Atlantic) was that it had stopped being about the girls. Lena Dunham - the creator, director and star of the cult HBO show that has caused many to dub her the voice of a generation - experimented more over these 10 episodes.
We’ve seen the central character, Hannah (played by Dunham), star alone in one episode, which marked the start of the, perhaps inevitable but rapid, descent of her mental state. Meanwhile, Marnie (Allison Williams) is working as a hostess and embarrassing herself at parties, despite still being encased in Stepford Wife trainer-tailoring. Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) has gained an independence from the boyfriend she desperately craved, and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) has just gone AWOL. We haven’t seen the girls together, all in one room, during the entire series.
So despite the season finale being called Together, it was unlikely the title characters would reunite.
Instead, rather awkwardly, they reunited with their past lovers - or found new ones. To swooping orchestral strings, mad dashes through subway stations and grand, tearful talks about the future. Girls may have started out as an antidote to the sitcom, but the finale was more romcom territory - and after the previous bleak episodes touching on subjects such as OCD, rape and abandonment, it sat awkwardly.
However, even this couldn’t dampen Dunham’s writing. Marnie telling on-off boyfriend Charlie (Christopher Abbott) she wanted to “sit and watch [him] die” was a perfectly sharp barb in a saccharine scene. Hannah talked, with painful reminiscence, about being sheltered from the shards of broken glass to friendly ex-junkie neighbour Laird, who was neatly re-introduced after only featuring in episode three.

But some of the best lines went to the boys, who seemed to be doing rather better at "almost kind of getting it together". Dunham’s male characters have been the most engaging in this series, and they didn’t disappoint in the finale.
Shoshanna's boyfriend Ray discussed girl problems with his boss Hermie, which included a frank and funny dissection of Shoshanna’s croissant-shaped handbag, before he landed a promotion in "classy" Brooklyn Heights. Hannah's ex, Adam, appeared to be entering into a normal, adult relationship with another woman, smashing the boat he’d been constructing during his break-up from Hannah - an ironic symbol of freedom, if one a little hackneyed.
As for Charlie, well, now he’d landed his sweetheart Marnie to match his good fortune.
It was all a little cosy, really. Laird said to Hannah: “I think it’s a pretty dark scene inside your head.” Perhaps so, but the world Dunham has created here is far more rosy than it purports to be. Follow Telegraph TV & Radio on Twitter

School closed after pupils bitten by mites in eco-roof
A school was forced to close due to an infestation of harvest mites in the classroom block's recently installed £6m grass eco-roof. Walney School, in Cumbria. Photo: CASCADE	By Rhiannon Williams

Pupils were sent home last Friday after the mites began biting them after crawling through roof vents at Walney School, Cumbria. Fumigation teams were called to deal with the pests, which the secondary school described as "still an ongoing problem". Dennis Laird, chair of governors at Walney School, told the North West Evening Mail: “As a result of an insect infestation, the school’s management team took the decision to close the school today at lunchtime. “We are now working closely with the county council to resolve this issue and it is anticipated that the school will re-open on Monday as normal. “Clearly it is not acceptable and pupils and parents will rightly expect the problem to be solved quickly.”

Walney School said the pest control company fumigated the venting systems throughout the weekend and used smoke bombs to keep the mites at bay. Acting headteacher Helen Collis admitted the problem lies "with the type of roof that has been installed", and said a council representative would be meeting with the Department for Environment to resolve the issue. The grass eco-roof has been in place for around 12 months. A Cumbria County Council public health spokesperson said: "Although a bite can be itchy and uncomfortable, harvest mites in the UK do not carry any diseases that present a risk to humans. “The best way to get rid of mites on the body is a hot bath or shower, and to make sure clothes are washed at a normal temperature."

Peer-to-peer lender's bond scheme, which links retail investors with entrepreneurs, is a "stepping stone" to a full small business bond market, the company's managing director claims. From a borrowing small company’s perspective, the debt will be similar to a conventional bank loan with monthly repayments. By James Hurley

When Business Club, think tank Nesta and Conservative MP Sam Gyimah proposed a bond market for small companies last year, critics pointed out a number of hurdles.
Among them were the possibility of punitive fees, the difficulty in rating risk in small businesses and uncertainty over their demand for long term debt. The Government is still consulting on how these challenges can be overcome to stimulate such a market, but it may have been beaten to the punch by a “peer-to-peer” lending start-up.
ThinCats, a website that links business borrowers with retail savers, has launched a bond scheme in partnership with fund manager Innvotec that it believes will encourage retail investors to back entrepreneurs. Savers invest a minimum of £5,000 for a gross return of 8pc over three years, with funds invested in an “actively managed” portfolio of secured small company loans vetted by Innvotec, which is authorised by the Financial Services Authority. The company said no loan will represent more than 7.5pc of the funds committed to the bond issue, which is aiming to raise £1m. Related Articles

From a borrowing small company’s perspective, the debt will be similar to a conventional bank loan with monthly repayments. Kevin Caley, ThinCats managing director, said the bond would move peer-to-peer lending “into the mainstream, making it worthy of consideration by any investor or their adviser”. Peer-to-peer lending markets, which are unregulated, traditionally require savers to pick small companies to back or use automatic systems to spread investments across a number of companies. However, the scheme doesn’t resolve another issue for small business bonds – the lack of a secondary market. The bond will not be listed, although Mr Caley said he sees it as a “stepping stone to a full bond market for these loans so people can buy and sell them as they wish”. Fees for the borrower include a £950 for listing and legal documents, a 1.5pc premium on the interest rate determined by the auction on the ThinCats site and a “success fee” of between 2pc and 6pc.

Go Ape swings for more expansion
Treetop assault course provider Go Ape is to create 100 new jobs as it opens a new site in southern England. Go Ape is set to open its 29th forest adventure playground this year By Denise Roland
4:25PM GMT 04 Feb 2013
Comments
The forest adventure company, which saw visitor numbers hit a record high in excess of half a million in 2012, will embark on a plan to boost revenue by 20pc as it opens its 29th location, in Tilgate Country Park, West Sussex. Go Ape also plans to add new courses to some of its existing sites in England, Scotland and Wales, and double its US presence to six locations. "2013 marks the next phase in an exciting new chapter for Go Ape,” said Jerome Mayhew, managing director at Go Ape. “Last year saw us embark on ambitious growth plans following a rapid rise in consumer demand for outdoor-based activities. It resulted in our best year to date."
The company, established in 2001 by husband-and-wife team Tristram and Rebecca Mayhew, has won a raft of business awards for its high-wire forest adventure playgrounds and said turnover hit £12m in 2012.

Serves six
Buttermilk does amazing things to chicken, tenderising and flavouring it through to the bone. If you can’t find kohlrabi you could either just leave it out or substitute 200g (7oz) mooli or ordinary radishes. For the chicken:
560ml (19fl oz) buttermilk 6 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tsp ground cayenne
12 chicken joints (thighs, drumsticks or breasts on the bone) For the slaw:
½ savoy cabbage
½ small red cabbage
1 large fennel bulb
juice of ½ lemon 1 small kohlrabi bulb 1 tart green apple
1½ tsp Dijon mustard
20ml (¾fl oz) cider vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar
50ml (2fl oz) olive oil
50ml (2fl oz) groundnut oil
½ red onion, very finely sliced into thin crescent-moon shapes
35g (1¼oz) chopped pecans Mix together the buttermilk, garlic and cayenne with plenty of salt and pepper. Put the chicken into a container and pour over the marinade. Turn the pieces over, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, turning the chicken every so often. Related Articles

Gently shake off the excess marinade (but don’t wipe the chicken clean). Put the joints into a roasting-tin. Roast in an oven preheated to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5 for 40 minutes, or until cooked through. Cover with foil if the surface is getting too dark. Meanwhile, make the slaw. Remove and discard the core from both cabbages and shred them finely. Quarter the fennel, trim the tops and remove coarse outer leaves. Core each quarter. Cut into wafer-thin slices using a very sharp knife or mandolin. Put into a bowl and toss in the lemon juice. Slice the kohlrabi wafer-thin and add to the bowl. Halve and core the apple, cut it into matchsticks and toss with the fennel mixture. Put the mustard into a small jug and whisk in the cider vinegar and sugar, then oils. Season. (For a more muted dressing add 1 tbsp of whipping cream.) Put all the vegetables, the apple, onion and nuts into a serving-bowl. Toss with the dressing. Season to taste. Serve the chicken joints on a warm platter with the slaw on the side. Recommended wine: Les Grands Cailloux Viognier IGP Pays d'Oc 2010. Get it from Telegraph Wine > The peach and apricot notes with the weight of the wine will be in harmony with the apple and buttermilk chicken.

Police appeal over Surrey stabbing
Abigail Witchalls with her son Joseph 11:49AM BST 22 Apr 2005
A man and woman have been arrested in connection with the stabbing of Abigail Witchalls after turning themselves in, police have said. The 28-year-old man and 29-year-old woman went voluntarily to Leatherhead police station. Mrs Witchalls, a 26-year-old mother of one, is still in a critical condition but is said by police to have "slightly improved" today as her family hold a vigil by her hospital bed. She suffered a single three inch stab wound to the back of her neck as she took her 21-month-old son out for a walk in the quiet Surrey village of Little Bookham on Wednesday.
The attack is believed to have been unprovoked. Det Supt Adrian Harper, leading the investigation, warned: "This person may strike again."
He said the details of the attack are still very sketchy as the only people who witnessed the crime were the victim and her son Joseph. When police arrived, Mrs Witchalls was on the ground and her son was out of his buggy beside her. The child did not appear to have been harmed, Mr Harper said. Police confirmed today that Mrs Witchalls had been able to whisper some words to the neighbours who went to her aid. But detectives were not prepared to release details of exactly what she said. Mr Harper said there were no signs of a struggle on the narrow muddy path where the attack took place. He also confirmed that although she had been carrying a rucksack containing cards and cash, nothing was taken. News

Another part of the Roma community lives in a slum-like area of rundown apartment blocks on Horea Street. In 2012 the city mayor Catalin Chereches controversially ordered a wall to be built around this settlement. Although the move was popular with many of the city's non-Roma residents, Roma rights groups condemned it as a modern form of segregation. They also argue that forced evictions violate the rights of the Roma. Picture: EPA/ZSOLT CZEGLEDI

The One Where Dave Spends Even More Time with His Family
Even on the beach in Cornwall, Dave remains on top of things, in the latest instalment of our political sitcom.

“What's that, Daddy?” asked Arthur. “It’s a scale model of the Libyan capital, Tripoli,” said Dave. “Daddy is a very important man and has to stay in touch with world events at all times.”
“By building a sandcastle?” asked five-year-old Arthur scornfully. Dave yawned and decided to ignore him. Time for a mid-morning siesta. Putting down his bucket and spade, he lay back contentedly on the Cornish beach, the sand between his toes, the soothing sound of the waves lapping on the shore. Golly, he loved being Prime Minister: free car, excellent pension and as much annual leave as he liked. “Tough morning?” His reverie was broken by Sam, back from the shops with a picnic of Duchy Originals.

“Exhausting,” said Dave, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. “Honestly, much more of this and I’ll need a holiday to recover from all the holidays.”
“Just make sure that whenever you resign, you don’t tell the press that you want to spend more time with your family,” said Sam. “They’ll never believe you.”
Dave’s laughter was cut short by the sound of his mobile. He looked at the number on the screen and wondered whether to leave it to go to the voicemail he’d recorded back in April, just before their first summer holiday: “Please leave a message and I’ll get back to you after the party conference season.”
This time, however, he decided to pick up. “Hello, Nick,” he said. “I’m glad you called. Could you see if Jacqui’s got any spare prisoners she could send round to North Kensington to give our drawing room a fresh lick of paint while we’re gone?”
Nick, however, did not sound in the mood for jokes. “I’m sorry to tell you that there has been a rather worrying development in international affairs,” he said. “Oh, I’ve read about that,” said Dave breezily. “I didn’t think Anne Hathaway’s accent was that bad.”
“No, no,” cried Nick. “It’s Libya. Gaddafi appears to be on the way out.”
“Oh him,” yawned Dave. “I know all about that, of course. Quite a coup, wouldn’t you say?”
“But what should we do next?” asked Nick. “Oh, I don’t know,” said Dave, rubbing out the Libyan leader’s compound with his big toe. “Let’s leave it be. It worked out fine in Iraq, didn’t it? Anyway, can’t you just ring Barack? He’ll tell you what to do.”
“He’s on a cycling holiday with his family,” said Nick, sniffing a little. “It’s not easy being the international fort-holder, you know.”
Dave tried and failed to stifle a giggle. “I think you should know,” Nick continued sternly, “that people are beginning to murmur about your absence. Where’s Dave, they cry. Has he lost his grip on a country in flames? Has he let the rebels take over the streets? Which luxurious bunker is he holed up in now? Is he, like Gaddafi, secretly stalking the streets of our capital?”
“Oh, do relax, Nick,” said Dave, gesturing to Sam to bring him another strawberry Daiquiri. “Why don’t you just go out and paint the town red? Or yourself blue...”

Labour 'gives up' on mixed-sex hospital wards
Figures reveal that 31 pc of NHS trusts admit to having fully mixed wards - without any form of partition By Nic Fleming,
Medical Correspondent
8:10PM GMT 28 Jan 2008
Labour has admitted it had abandoned its historic commitment to eliminate mixed-sex wards from NHS hospitals.
Health minister Lord Darzi of Denham told the House of Lords that the key manifesto pledge repeated in 1997 and 2001 was "an aspiration that cannot be met".
Lord Darzi said the Government was committed to single sex accommodation, but that this could be achieved by splitting up mixed wards into bays.
Patient charities have campaigned for years for an end to male and female patients sharing facilities in NHS hospitals, and a number of women have been the victims of assaults from men in mixed-sex wards.

Pledge to abolish mixed-sex wards by year's end
15 Aug 2010
Catherine Murphy, of The Patients Association, said: "For more than 10 years we have had Tony Blair and successive ministers calling for an end to mixed sex wards.
"This is a U-turn. They have given up on the MRSA target and now they have given up on mixed sex wards.
"What patients, especially female patients, mean by single sex accommodation is being cared for on a ward where only patients of their sex are present, and not sharing bathroom and toilet facilities."
Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said: "This is an astonishing admission of failure on an issue of crucial importance to patients.
"The Government has flip-flopped on this manifesto commitment for over 10 years."
Last month The Daily Telegraph reported comments from a Department of Health official who said: "We have to get away from this idea of single-sex wards.
"We are moving away from a set target on single-sex accommodation. It is possible to envisage patient privacy and dignity with patients of different sexes on the same wards but with proper segregation."
Asked to clarify, the official said a mixed ward divided into bays by fixed partitions - not necessarily fixed to the ceiling, but high enough that patients perceive they are in a separate room - counted as single-sex accommodation.
At the time Health Secretary Alan Johnson denied the statements amounted to a U-turn or a retreat by the Government.
However yesterday Lord Darzi told fellow peers: "Our guidance requires the provision of single sex accommodation, not wards.
"This may mean single rooms or single sex bays within a mixed ward as well as single sex wards.
"The only way we are going to have single sex wards in the NHS is to build the whole of the NHS into single rooms.
"It is not achievable in transforming a ward into a single sex ward. That is an aspiration that cannot be met."
Tory Lord Naseby responded: "After 10 years of this Government the removal of mixed wards is no longer part of their policy, and the whole issue is now fudged totally by the answer that you have just given.
"I have just come back from Sri Lanka and visited the public wards there. They are 100 per cent single sex. If a developing country can do it why can't this country do it?"
Figures obtained by the Conservatives last month showed 31 per cent of healthcare trusts admitted still having fully mixed wards - without any form of partition and excluding intensive care, emergency and children's wards.
This is almost double the amount stated in a report released last May by the Chief Nursing Officer.
A quarter of trusts reported washing facilities were not segregated on all wards, while 29 per cent said separate lavatories were not always available.
In May, Patricia Hewitt, the then Health Secretary, said there was more to be done to "meet our commitment to eliminate mixed-sex wards". Two years ago Miss Hewitt stated that partitioned bays were "not good enough".
In November 1996 Tony Blair, then Leader of the Opposition, attacked John Major, saying: "Why has the Prime Minister not yet made good the promise given two years ago to eliminate mixed-sex wards in our hospitals?"
The 1997 Labour Party manifesto stated "we will work towards the elimination of mixed-sex wards", while the manifesto of 2001 stated "mixed sex wards will be abolished".
Kate Jopling, of Help the Aged, said: "Sharing mixed sex wards remains an ongoing concern for many older people who may find the experience distressing and an inappropriate infringement of their privacy, and therefore dignity."
A Department of Health spokesman said Monday night: "Lord Darzi's comments were fully in line with the Government's long-standing commitment on mixed-sex accommodation. The aim of the NHS is to reduce mixed-sex accommodation and ensure privacy and dignity for all patients.
"But sometimes the need to treat and admit will take priority over complete segregation. The NHS will not turn patients away because the 'right sex' bed is not immediately available."

Theresa May blames Europe for Qatada debacle
Theresa May tonight attacked European judges for “moving the goalposts” in her attempts to deport terror suspect Abu Qatada. By Tom Whitehead, Security Editor
6:42PM GMT 12 Nov 2012
The hate preacher will be back on the streets tomorrow after a senior British immigration judge ruled he should not be deported to Jordan, where he faces terror charges. But that decision followed a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights earlier this year which said he could not be removed because he risks facing trial on evidence obtained by torture. The Home Secretary tonight blamed Strasbourg for the chaos and accused them of repeatedly making it harder for Governments to deport dangerous foreign nationals. It came as MPs called on Mrs May to defy the courts and simply put Qatada, whom she described as a “dangerous man and suspected terrorist”, on a plane and deal with the legal fall-out later. But Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said there were “serious questions” as to whether Mrs May had adopted the right strategy in her attempts to remove Qatada. Related Articles

Abu Qatada released
13 Nov 2012
The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) today allowed Qatada’s appeal against deportation after concluding there remained a risk he would not face a fair trial. Mr Justice Mitting said the Home Secretary had failed to “satisfy” the court that there was no risk of evidence potentially obtained by torture being used against him. The decision was a major humiliation for Mrs May who travelled personally to Jordan earlier this year to obtain assurances that Qatada would face a fair trial, details of which were then scrutinised by Siac. It raises the prospect that Qatada could now remain in the UK indefinitely if the Government fails to overturn the ruling. The Home Office immediately announced plans to take the case to the Court of Appeal as Mrs May said she “strongly disagrees” with Mr Justice Mitting’s decision and claimed he had applied the “wrong legal test” in coming to his conclusion. In an emergency statement to the House of Commons, she said: “Despite these assurances, despite the determination of the Jordanian Government and judiciary to allow Qatada a fair trial, despite the change to the Jordanian constitution that expressly prohibits torture and the use of evidence obtained by torture, in the absence of clear case law Mr Justice Mitting still found in Qatada's favour.” But she also blamed the original “deeply unsatisfactory” ruling from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). She said the court "continues to move the goalposts for governments trying to deport dangerous foreign nationals". Mr Justice Mitting effectively sided with the ECHR even though domestic courts previously ruled it is safe to return Qatada. In 2009 the then Law Lords ruled there were no reasonable grounds to suggest Qatada would not get a fair trial. Qatada is accused by Jordan of conspiring to cause explosions on Western and Israeli targets in 1998 and 1999. But he has successfully fended off deportation for more than a decade and cost the British taxpayer more than £1 million in legal fees and costs to keep him here. Ms Cooper accused Mrs May of making “overblown” promises that Qatada would be removed, telling the Commons: “This is an extremely serious and worrying judgment that means Abu Qatada will be back on Britain's streets. "There are some serious questions that need to be answered about the Home Secretary's strategy to get this deportation in place and the action you are taking now to keep the public safe.” Tory MP Peter Bone told Mrs May: “Just deport him and worry about the consequences after." Fellow Conservative Bill Cash urged the Home Secretary to urgently repeal the Human Rights Act so British courts not Europe could decide such cases. Jordan's acting information minister Nayef al-Fayez said his government shared the British government's "disappointment and concern" and vowed to work with it to resolve the matter. At Siac earlier, Robin Tam QC, for the Home Office, told Mr Justice Mitting: "You have ruled that there is a real risk of the admission of evidence, where there is a real risk that this evidence was obtained by torture. "That is a possibility of a possibility which falls below the legal test.” Speaking outside Siac, Qatada's solicitor Gareth Peirce said: "It is important to reaffirm this country's position that we abhor the use of torture and a case that was predicated upon evidence from witnesses who have been tortured is rejected – rejected by the courts of this country as by the European Court.” Terrorism in the UK

Angel Cabrera's dignity in defeat highlights the beauty of sport's slow-burners
They say you never remember the loser, but it will be a long time before I forget that little thumbs-up Angel Cabrera gave Adam Scott at the beginning of their Masters play-off, when the young Australian fired off a perfect drive.

Nor am I likely to lose from memory the breadth of his smile when his young opponent won the Green Jacket by the narrowest of margins, or the warmth of his embrace. It went beyond mere sportsmanship to speak to the character of the man; it suggested exactly the kind of person who can walk around a golf course with his son as a caddie without ever coming to blows. It cannot have been easy for Cabrera to behave like that. If he had won, he would have been, at 43, the second oldest person to win the Masters, following Jack Nicklaus’s extraordinary 1986 triumph at the age of 46. He would have been the first grandfather. And for a man languishing at 269th in the world, it is the kind of opportunity that will not come along very often any more. But he has heart and he has class. And he knew that the difference between winning and losing on Sunday night was the width of a centimetre. I wonder if Tiger Woods could have behaved with such effortless generosity. Somehow, I doubt it; he can lose with dignity but rarely with good grace. So a good guy lost – but a good guy won, too. Cabrera summed it up: “Adam is truly a good winner. Obviously I would have been happier if I’d won, but he’s a great person and a great player.” Which is true and it was a sign of the kind of man Scott is that, in the very moment of his victory, he dedicated his triumph to Greg Norman. Norman, of course, is the other loser you can never forget, not least for the desperate agonies of squandering a six-shot lead at Augusta to Nick Faldo in 1996. He bore that bravely, but it was tough to watch, let alone to live through. Related Articles

That is the thing about golf. Spectators and players are in it for the long haul, and amid the piercing pressure of a major championship, the stories that emerge are all about who the players really are, and what is going on in their minds. In this, it is much like Test cricket, which is the ultimate slow-burning thriller, a book whose pages fill the sunny days with twists and turns of drama and psychology. The Nightwatchman, a new quarterly collection of elegant and interesting writing about cricket, published by Wisden, and co-edited by my colleague Tanya Aldred, has an excellent essay by the novelist Patrick Neate on this very theme. He argues that all sport is narrative, but most “are plot driven pulp, built on archetypes of heroism and villainy”. Cricket, he argues, is driven not by plot but by character, “and the nuances to be found therein are, if not limitless, as diverse as humanity itself”. As we enter the season where brave men wear white, it is a fascinating way to look at the sport. It explains why – to the amazement of many – the England Test team’s series draw in New Zealand was greeted by most fans as the most stirring victory, and one in which, once again, good character could be revealed. As one of my friends wrote to me at the time: “What other sport is there when 22 players can bash one another about, and swear at each other for 15 days and when it’s all over, walk off the battlefield arm in arm with the opposition, patting one another on the back?”
This too, goes beyond sportsmanship into something deeper. Neate sums it up: “Cricket, like a novel, like life, often ends in moral stalemate. And it’s all the better for it.” Which is another way of saying that those sports which divulge character over a period of time are infinitely more fascinating than those which provide the adrenalin rush of excitement but do not leave you with the insight into human nature that a kindly thumbs-up or a gentle pat on the back can sometimes provide.

As Apple's product range has grown, iTunes has adapted in tandem to utilise the multimedia capabilities of new devices. Seen here is the iPod Shuffle, the first ever iPod Nano, and the new iPod in September 2005. Advancements in solid-state storage and battery technology make these devices seem unfeasibly bulky and of limited use compared to the Apple products available in 2013.Picture: AP

Perfect end to a perfect day
A good country walk is much more enjoyable if you book into the right hotel. Fiona Duncan finds great places to stay in spectacular surroundings.

I'm all for exercise, as long as I'm rewarded for it. There's got to be serious pleasure in my keep-fit regime and I can think of nothing more pleasurable than a weekend away, walking in beautiful landscape, returning at the end of the day to good food and a warm bed in a welcoming hotel. Over the past few months I have stayed in six hotels in prime British walking country. These were picked not just for their quality, but also because their location allows guests to set out on a circular walking route on the first day, return for a long soak, a good dinner and a comfortable night, then strike out in another direction next morning after an indulgent breakfast. Cresting a hill after an eight-mile tramp and seeing the perfect inn where you are expected for the night - that's a proper reward.
The walks, hotels and practical details are described below. Suggestions for less expensive alternatives are given where appropriate. Welsh borders
The walk Monmouthshire has a flavour all its own: very green (but with red soil); not exactly rolling, but full of abrupt little hills, often topped with woodland, with plain, hardworking farmhouses tucked into their folds; cared for, yet delightfully free of the suburban air that can spoil so much of southern England; sleepy, lost in time, with few outside visitors (we encountered just four other walkers on the entire route). The Three Castles Walk, designed and waymarked by Monmouthshire County Council, is a 19-mile route that links three atmospheric Norman castles (two free, one with a small entrance fee), through woods and meadows, with many a stile to cross (any dog that has to be carried over, such as our portly spaniel, should be banned). The scenery is consistently beautiful, at times small-scale, magnificent at others, and the castles - Skenfrith, White and Grosmont - make absorbing and atmospheric goals. Our picnic spot, just after crossing the high wood between Grosmont and Skenfrith, had one of the loveliest views we had ever seen in Britain. Most people should easily manage the whole 19 miles in two days, although we didn't. We chatted too much, the dog was too heavy, the scenery too beautiful and the hotel too seductive, so we only completed two of the three legs. The hotel
The Bell, Skenfrith (01600 750235; www.skenfrith.co.uk; doubles from £95 per night, including breakfast), goes with this walk like wine with cheese. Right on the route, it's the perfect hotel for city-dwellers seeking their rural inner-selves. Situated on the River Monnow, it has a candlelit, flagstoned dining-room serving locally sourced modern British dishes; a well-organised wine list; a huge inglenook surrounded by sofas; and eight simple-sophisticated bedrooms. In the morning, the enormous Welsh breakfast will set you up for another day's delightful walking. The details
The walk is thoughtfully waymarked, but while it's fun trying to spot the next yellow marker, it's probably best to buy the Three Castles Walk booklet, available from Monmouth Tourist Information Centre (01600 713899; £3.95). If you start at the Bell and split the walk between two days, the hotel will pick you up at the end of the first; it will provide packed lunches and has a drying room, plus an unlimited supply of sticking plasters.
If you don't want to do such a long walk, the hotel has put together six others, equally lovely, and designed to complement the season. Dorset
The walk Once a hunting ground frequented by royalty, Cranborne Chase has the feel of an ancient place, with its ox droves, Roman roads and prehistoric earthworks, and its combination of woodland, rolling fields and steep scarps. With wide views, big skies and a few scattered villages, it makes for superb walking. Leaving the car by the pond at Tollard Royal, we blew away the cobwebs on Win Green, the highest point, with marvellous views, walking back alongside Madonna and Guy Ritchie's house, Ashcombe, which lies in its own valley (5.5 miles in all). The following morning we made an 8.5-mile exploration of the quiet Tarrant valley and the feudal village of Chettle, set in a wooded hollow, overlooked by its fine 18th-century manor house. We set off early as we wanted to be back at the Museum Inn for Sunday lunch - a good decision. The hotel
Cranborne Chase is closely associated with General Augustus Pitt-Rivers, the 19th-century archaeologist who built the Museum Inn, Farnham (01725 516261; www.museuminn.co.uk; doubles from £95 per night, including breakfast) to accommodate visitors to his nearby museum. Today it's owned by Vicky Elliot and Mark Stephenson, with cheery Australian staff and convivial, well-heeled customers (Madonna drops in from time to time). You can eat either in a cosy corner of the rambling bar, or in the elegant Shed restaurant, which is done out in crisp white and green. Mark Treasure's sophisticated bistro food ranges from pressed ham knuckle and guinea-fowl terrine to whole lobster and French fries, plus a great Sunday roast. The prettiest bedrooms are those in the inn itself, as opposed to the stables, and the best is the General's Bedroom, which has plenty of light and a four-poster. The details
The Win Green walk was devised by the hotel's owners, who will give you the directions and a marked-up Explorer Map 118 Shaftesbury&Cranborne Chase. The Tarrant Valley walk is from Adventurous Pub Walks in Dorset by Anne-Marie Edwards (Countryside Books, £7.99), also available from the Museum Inn, as are packed lunches. Cotswolds
The walk An exhilarating, strenuous, figure-of-eight ramble taking in Cotswold quarries and country churches. There are plenty of swoops and troughs as you climb high on to sheep pasture and dip down into quiet valleys. The northern (nine-mile) loop incorporates a particularly attractive section of the Cotswold Way, with spectacular wold and scarp views, including the striking rock pinnacle, Devil's Chimney.
The southern (six-mile) loop makes a tour of three charming villages, each with an interesting church. A main road interrupts more than once, but you soon walk away from it into a pleasing rural landscape. The hotel
The sort of exercise taken by the average guest at Cowley Manor, Cowley (01242 870900; www.cowleymanor.com; doubles from £230, including breakfast) ranges from carrying a laptop on to the terrace to working-out in the gym or swimming in one of the two pools at C-Side, the hotel's fine spa. Walking - that time-consuming, old fashioned pursuit - doesn't feature much (despite the row of complimentary wellies by the front door). The hotel's beautiful lake-filled Grade II-listed grounds and its position in prime Cotswold walking country remain something of a well-kept secret. It's not for granny (staff wear T-shirts and brothel creepers), but its seamless blend of stone grandeur and contemporary bliss-out suits stressed urbanites and their children. The elegant stone terrace is a suntrap, with views that promise rewarding walking.
Sit there and pull on your boots - you'll amaze your fellow guests - and when you return, you'll see why Cowley (which means cow pasture), with its plentiful water and its sheltering woods and hills, was a self-sufficient farming community from earliest times. Alternative accommodation
The Green Dragon Inn, Cockleford (01242 870271; www.buccaneer.co.uk/greendragon; doubles from £80 per night, including breakfast). The details The directions for the walk, which follow waymarked stony tracks and field paths, plus some Tarmac lanes, are available from the hotel, accompanied by a marked-up Explorer Map 179 Gloucester, Cheltenham & Stroud. If you want to take a packed lunch, you can choose from the hotel's delicious picnic menu. Norfolk
The Walk
Even if you stay in Holkham for several days, you need never stray from land belonging to the Earl of Leicester. As well as visiting stately Holkham Hall, you can follow a number of gentle walks around the estate, encompassing pinewoods, parkland, meadows, farmland and beaches. Starting from the hotel, we chose the Lake Walk, just over 3.5 miles, contrasting it next morning with the Beach Walk, which can be extended from two to 10 miles, as you wish. The former began in leafy, sun-dappled woodland, peppered with deer, passed St Withburga's church on its grassy knoll, then opened on to classic 18th-century landscaped parkland, complete with winding lake (trips by electric boat) and the hall's charming 17th-century thatched ice house. The latter is an enchanting and instructive meander (owned by the Earl of Leicester but managed as a reserve by English Nature) past lagoons and grazing marshes, through woods of Corsican pine and along the natural, dune-swept beach to the Lifeboat Station, beach huts and sailing boats at Wells-next-the-Sea. The hotel The theme may be colonial India, with colourful furnishings imported from Rajasthan, but The Victoria, Holkham (01328 711008; www.victoriaatholkham.co.uk; doubles from £120 per night, including breakfast), which was built in 1838 and given a major revamp in 2001 by Viscount Coke and his wife, feels thoroughly English in a laid-back, slightly scuffed, child-oriented sort of way. Though it's described as hip and stylish, it's more friendly and feel-good than that, with guests ranging from retired couples to familiar-faced actors. The food is a highlight (perfect fish and chips, and rib-eye steak were favourites), and there's an appealing buzz in the restaurant. The details Serious walkers can tramp nearby Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, while circular walks in the Holkham area are described in Coastal Circular Walks in Norfolk by Joy and Charles Boldero, which is sold in local shops, including Holkham Art, Crafts and Fine Food Centre. Here you'll also find the Marshes Larder, an upmarket deli and café, where you can choose your picnic (or let the hotel do it for you) and have it packed in your rucksack or a pretty wicker basket. Directions for the Holkham Estate walks, including hand-painted maps, are available from the hotel and on the website. The park is occasionally closed to walkers - inquire first. Dogs must be kept on the lead. A perfect day (continued) >>>

Woman covered in bedbug bites after night at London Travelodge
A woman woke while spending the night at a London Travelodge hotel to find herself covered in bed bugs.

Debra Bratt said she became aware of insects crawling over the beds of her room at the London Central Kings Cross Royal Scott Hotel during the early hours of the morning. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the Hartlepool Mail. “To think that they had been crawling around us while we were asleep is absolutely awful and now I’m covered in these bites.”
“We had been watching 'I’m A Celebrity' earlier in the night and when I woke up I felt like I was in a Bushtucker Trial.”
Mrs Bratt, a mother of two from Hartlepool, had been visiting a sister in London with two other sisters. When they encountered problems on their return home and her sister complained of feeling ill, they took a last-minute decision to stay the night at the Travelodge in central London. After going straight to bed, Mrs Bratt woke up a few hours later to find the insects, and then collected some in a tissue, which she took down to reception in the morning. “I didn’t want to cause a scene but I explained the situation to them,” she said. “The woman on reception asked me why I didn’t come and tell them straight away but I explained that my sister had been really ill and I didn’t want to disturb her, and I had some of the bugs in the tissue to show them.”
She also said she had to take a course of antibiotics after the bites she received became infected. Mrs Bratt compared the experience to an episode of 'I'm a Celebrity'
Travelodge has agreed to refund the sisters. In its official response, the company said it was “very sorry to hear of Mrs Bratt’s recent experience”, and that the room was treated by pest control immediately. Bedbug infestations were not foreseeable, the hotel chain argued, saying the insects could come from many different sources, including tube seats and theatres. It added: “Since this isolated incident on November 11, we have been in regular contact with Mrs Bratt and we are doing everything we can to help her.”
