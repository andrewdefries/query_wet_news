Blondie: Panic of Girls, CD of the week
Blondie picks up the pace with Panic of Girls. Rating: * * *
By Helen Brown
11:26AM BST 30 Jun 2011
Comments
Blondie Panic of Girls Eleven Seven, £8.69 With a heavy focus on the peroxide hair, cultural theorists across the internet reliably argue that without Debbie Harry there would have been no Madonna and no Lady Gaga. Yet there is a huge difference in attitude between the Blondie frontwoman and the pop divas she inspired. Related Articles

You simply couldn’t imagine her building biceps like Madonna, or pulling sidewalk striptease publicity stunts like Gaga. Too cool to bop to her own disco beat, Harry stood on the stage like a high-school delinquent, chewing gum outside the principal’s office. Her brittle, glass-hearted vocals reflected the same attitude. Along with guitarist Chris Stein’s pulsating pop smarts, that’s what made Blondie such a great disco choice: here was music you could really move to, while allowing you to radiate that couldn’t-care-less-who’s-watching-or-what-they-think vibe. The band played with reggae, disco, punk and rock rhythms while Harry’s audibly raised eyebrow allowed the dancer to maintain an ironic distance. But when they reformed in 1997 the new music made me feel as bored as Harry often looked. The anthemic hit single Maria (1999) proved a popular singalong with beery festival crowds, but it droned on drive-time radio. This new album picks up the pace a bit from Maria. On the cyberpunky opener, D-Day, Harry sings as a woman hacking into another romance: “Make a mess of/ Your last love/ Transfer your love to me.” Against the hot-wired crunch and grind of synth static, Harry’s voice (never strong on emotional or musical depth) is perfectly suited to the computerised detachment. But over the next few tracks (including single Mother) melodies get stretched Maria-esque and the Killers’ producer Jeff Saltzman gives it a similarly tedious feel: that sense of songs being all charged up with nowhere to go. There’s a pleasant, if pointless, cover of Sophia George’s 1985 reggae hit Girlie Girlie which allows Harry to play with a little ironic Jamaican patois. Elsewhere, the mood is varied by the appearance of some French accordion on Stein’s Le Bleu and some enjoyably up-tempo salsa on her own Wipe off my Sweat. None of it will set the Saturday dancefloors on fire with pouting thrills, though it may sound cool enough over coffee in the cafés of Sunday morning. Download this: D-Day CD Reviews

City Diary: I asked Save the Redwoods League first, says eco-tycoon
The truth is out there about the controversial Lord of the Rings-themed wedding that cost Napster founder Sean Parker $2.5m (£1.6m) in fines.

The internet billionaire has finally “set the record straight” about his clash with the California Coastal Commission over building fake ruins and a cottage in a Big Sur beauty spot without the proper permits. The venue, the Ventana Inn, was unwilling to accept financial responsibility for any potential penalties, says Parker.
So, with just 20 days to go until the big day earlier this month, he had “no choice” but to cough up. But never mind the money. The most “emotionally difficult” part of the wedding drama, posted Parker on Facebook, is the accusation that he “trashed trees”. For the environmental record, the eco-tycoon says he gave the wedding site the green light only after consulting the Save the Redwoods League. Related Articles

Government's hedge fund adviser profits from the rise and fall of RBS
13 Jun 2013
-------------------- Has oilman Aidan Heavey been treating himself after his company’s executive bonus pot hit up to €16m (£14m) in March? The Tullow Oil boss has been clocked sporting an “uber-flash” watch that my horological expert, Paul Broughan, of Weir & Sons, has confirmed as a €53,600 Patek Philippe design. Fashioned from 18-carat rose gold, the trophy timepiece contains rubies as part of its internal workings and – should all Tullow’s wells dry up – would fetch a “high price” at auction.
-------------------- Book a date with destiny Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor, the chairman of UAE conglomerate Al Habtoor Group, reckons his world is “as animated as it is inspiring”, and plans to publish an account of his “remarkable story”. The autobiography is not due out until September, but Al Habtoor has started his marketing efforts early.
After treading the divots at the polo tournament he sponsors, the Al Habtoor Royal Windsor Cup, he held an “informal” press conference where the self-publicity flowed as freely as the Champagne. “Destiny had plans far beyond my wildest imagination,” the tycoon told Diary. -------------------- Searing wit in the Square Mile thanks to Jake and Dinos Chapman, who have installed a sculpture of “prehistoric creatures” in the heart of the City’s red braces-wearing insurance district. The artists’ dinosaur artwork, titled 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', sits at the foot of The Gherkin, as part of the new Sculpture in the City exhibition. It’s a stone’s throw from another ironic interpretation of the City’s contribution to the economy: Ryan Gander’s 'Really Shiny Things That Don’t Mean Anything'.
-------------------- BT's Livingston presumes Not everyone was delighted that BT’s CEO, Ian Livingston, is off to fill ex-HSBC chairman Stephen Green’s shoes as trade minister. Diary imagines the organisers of Retail Week magazine’s 25th anniversary, which was “kindly sponsored” by BT, may have had a few choice words when Livingston dropped his bombshell the day before their party. Still, at least the outgoing telecoms boss gave the guests more food for thought than the cakes designed by the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother, James, when he made his exit speech at the event. Sir Philip Green, the Topshop tycoon, even gave Livingston some “friendly advice”. -------------------- The City's feminist 30% Club would have something to say about Angela Knight’s schooldays. The head of Energy UK spent her formative years learning cricket, to help her understand what her future husband was up to when he spent Sunday afternoons playing the sport. “Of course, we rebelled,” said Knight of her Malory Towers era at a recent debate on businesswomen and sport.
But the alternative was equally grim. “Instead, we were made to go swimming in the salt-water, unheated swimming pool, so cricket was infinitely better." -------------------- harriet.dennys@telegraph.co.uk

Telegraph reader Darren Moston writes: "I go to a local pond in Warrington where there is a heron. When I turn up he flies over towards me and lands right next to me. As I throw bread for the ducks the fish also come up to get it. The heron will then throw himself in the water right next to me to catch the fish. I took these last night when he caught at least 12 fish!" If you have a photograph you'd like us to consider for a picture gallery, please email it to mypic@telegraph.co.uk, supplying a little info on where and when the picture was taken.Picture: Darren Moston

Nigel Farage hangs up on BBC interview over 'hatred' in its questioning
The Ukip leader Nigel Farage has condemned the "fascist scum" who forced him to take refuge in an Edinburgh pub and hung up on a BBC Scotland interview over outrage at the "hatred" in its questioning. By Rowena Mason, Political Correspondent
11:47AM BST 17 May 2013
Follow The leader of the UK Independence Party said the "excesses of Scottish nationalism" can be "pretty ugly" and "deeply unpleasant" after he was surrounded and hassled by hardline demonstrators yesterday. He spoke to BBC Good Morning Scotland about his ordeal, but ended up leaving the phone call early in protest at their line of questioning. Asked about how many elected representatives he has in Scotland, Mr Farage said: "Absolutely none, but rather more than the BBC. We could have had this interview in England a couple of years ago, although I wouldn't have met with such hatred as I'm getting from your questions. Frankly, I've had enough of this interview, goodbye." Related Articles

Egypt interior minister survives bomb attack Egypt's interior minister has survived a bomb attack on his convoy in northern Cairo that he said marked the "beginning of a new wave of terrorism". The minister was interviewed later, saying that the attack had been by means of a "remote controlled device" – believed to be hidden in a motorcycle. Photo: GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP	By Richard Spencer, Cairo
3:45PM BST 05 Sep 2013
Follow Mohammed Ibrahim, who was appointed by the former Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi but supported his overthrow, was leaving his home when the attack happened shortly after 10.30am.
No one was killed in the explosion, although two men alleged to be attackers were said to have been shot dead by the security services minutes afterwards.
The minister was interviewed later, saying that the attack had been by means of a "remote controlled device" – believed to be hidden in a motorcycle.
"It was a heinous attempt," he said. "Even if I am martyred, another minister of interior will come and continue the war on the evil terror until we secure the country."
Opponents of the military-backed regime's crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its forced dispersal of protests with the loss of more than 1,000 lives have warned that it might trigger a violent response.

The government says that the Brotherhood itself has encouraged terrorism.
One of the few senior Brotherhood leaders not arrested or on the run, Amr Darrag, put out a statement condemning the attack.
It was witnessed by large numbers of people living in the middle-class Nasr City district of Cairo, home to both a number of bases of the security forces and of the mosque that became the centre of pro-Brotherhood protests after Mr Morsi was overthrown.
"I live just near to the ministry and I heard a massive explosion," said Raouf Mahmoud, 25, a doctor. "People were running around randomly. Two police cars were set on fire. Fifteen minutes later an ambulance came and took four or five people away.
"Then we heard some gun shots, about 20 or 30 minutes after that. They lasted for two or three minutes. After that we just saw the smoke and the fire, and we hear there are some bodies or remains of the people who died there."
The wreckage was strewn across the road, cars with their tops peeled off and nearby shopfronts shattered.
Egyptian activists said they feared a return to the Islamist terror campaigns of the 90s, in which scores of people including western tourists were killed.
Gamaa Islamiya, the terror group responsible, later abandoned its terror campaign, formed a political party and has taken up seats in parliament. It also condemned the attack.
There have already been a number of militant attacks in the Sinai, which has suffered from increased lawlessness in recent years and has its own branch of al-Qaeda operating. However, this was the first major attack since the coup in the capital.
In all, 22 people were said by some reports to have been injured, including two policemen from the convoy, a young boy and two British women.
A government statement said: "The cabinet insists that this criminal act will not prevent the government from confronting terrorism with force and determination." Egypt

The Masters 2011: final round live
Follow the final round of the The Masters 2011, with Rory McIlroy four shots clear at Augusta National. Down South: Fifty years after Gary Player became the first overseas player to win The Masters, South Africa's Charl Schwartzel repeated his feat Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Mike Norrish
9:15PM BST 10 Apr 2011
Comments
Final leaderboard: Schwartzel -14, Day -12, Scott -12, Woods -10, Ogilvy -10, Donald -10. McIlroy -4. Midnight: Okay, signing off. Enjoyed your company immensely this evening. Sorry if I didn't treat Schwartzel's win with quite the excitement some in South Africa might have liked, but it's very late, I'm very tired and I have lost a lot of money. That said, it was a truly absorbing Masters. 2355: Rory's in. Missed his birdie putt on 18, obviously. And that's an 80. And a back nine of 43. A man who needs a quiet pint. Then about 14 noisy ones. 2352: Fabulous final round, then. Schwartzel goes into the scorer's shed to sign his card. Cabrera and Rory coming down 18 now to finish things off. Rory's t-shirt is hanging out the back of his arse now. That kind of day. He's a pretty phlegmatic kind of bloke, Charl, and doesn't look particularly wobbly-lipped yet. 2348: And in it goes! Birdie! Charl Schwartzel wins The Masters! Birdies the last four holes for a Sunday 66! Hats off. Not the winner anyone in my profession wanted, to be honest, but a fabulous player. Gets a big bear hug from Chubby Chandler, who must be rather chuffed so many South Africans decided to sign with him. 2345: Schwartzel doing the winner's walk down the 18th. Hat off, crowd on their feet. Can he three putt from here? Don't leave it short, son. He's pin high and it's about the distance Mickelson had to win his first one. The one Alliss forgot. 2004? Was it? 2344: So Schwartzel needs a four to win The Masters. Good strike...and a he finds the middle of the green! 2342: Scott makes his par. And he's the clubhouse leader on -12. Schwartzel, on -13, is in the middle of the 18th fairway. And Day makes his birdie on 18! Brilliant. Schwartzel -13, Scott, Day -12. 2251: And it's left. And it's long. And that's a vile prospect coming back for par. Schwartzel's to lose now, surely? Schwartzel played well in our pro-am too. Only carried him for bits of the round. "I think that the dumbing down of the course to try and generate excitement cost Rory almost as much as his temperament," mails Tony Thompson. The number of balls that should have been in the water but did not get there is incredible…I hope Rory does not go backwards from this experience, he is too good a golfer and person." Here, here. 2337: Yep, brilliant drive down Schwartzel on 18. What a round this is. Scott MUST make this putt on 18 now. 2335: Schwartzel birdies 17! And that's -13, and unlucky for Scott, you have to feel. That's a hell of a putt, and probably an opportune time to mention that I once played in a pro-am with Schwartzel. No one's really that impressed when I tell them. So for purely selfish, boasting reasons, I hope he becomes a Masters winner. 2331: Another bogey for Rory. He's eight over for the day. Bo van Pelt has finished on -8. Scott's second into 18 is good and getting better. Starts tracking back down the slope towards the pin, but it pulls up probably 20 feet from the pin. 2328: What a drive from Day on 18. Absolutely rippped it down the middle. Very good from Schwartzel on 17. Floats his approach over the bunker and he'll have a birdie chance there. 2324: Every Jason has his Day! Birdie from the Aussie on 17 and he's -11 on his Masters debut. What a performance. Scott's got a tough putt here to save par. This is massive. Enormous broom putter he's got. Looks ludicrous. But it works like an absolute dream! In she goes! What a superb putt. In all the way. Scott, Schwartzel -12. Day -11. Woods, Ogilvy, Donald, Choi, Carbrera -10.
2323: Scott has found the greenside trap on 17. Needs to get up and down to stay -12. Schwartzel loses his drive on 17 to the right, but he's got a shot from there. In the first cut. 2319: Donald birdies 18 and is in the clubhouse on -10. Brilliant putt from off the green, and that's the biggest celebration I've ever seen from him. Scott, Schwartzel -12. Woods, Ogilvy, Donald, Day, Choi, Carbrera -10.
2316: Rory's not been on the TV for a while. I hope they're not showing him for the same reason they didn't show those horses yesterday. Poor sod. Schwartzel birdies 16! And he's 12 under for a share of the lead! 2314: Scott's drive is well left on 17, but he should get a decent enough lie there. Not what he wanted though, with Schwartzel on his tail. 2310: Schwartzel ties the lead with a birdie on 15. But that share lasts for about 15 seconds as Scott dribbles in his birdie putt on 16. Is this the moment for Scott. Often gets forgotten when he talk about sport's great underachievers, but this astonishingly talented golfer could finally be about to grow up. 2309: Ogilvy is in. Pars the last two holes and is in the clubhouse, along with Tiger, on -10. Donald has dropped one on 17 and is nine under. 2303: Just a par then for Scott on 15. Missed chance. His tee shot on 16 though is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! And that could be The Master for Scott! What a shot. Pitched it to the right of the flag and it just tracked down the slope. Looked very good, and then it looked great. He's got 18 inches for birdie and a two-shot lead. AP McCoy on Twitter: "Sometimes sport can be so horrible and cruel so gutted for Rory but they say what doesn't kill u can make u stronger Rory will be back."
2259: Tiger: "I'm still in it. I'm one back. I'm gonna go eat. I'm starving." I wish he hadn't done that interview really. "The girls seem a bit preoccupied with making money right now, but I'll ask a few," replies Tim Walker in answer to my request for play-off clarification. "We do have the Masters on the big screen, though -- wish you could be here with us sharing a pint! Iif you ever find yourself in Dayton, Ohio, stop by The Harem and say hello." The Harem? With the golf on? Doesn't sound like my kind of joint Tim, to be honest. 2258: Very candid interview from Lee Westwood: "Hit it well enough to win the tournament but my putting was abysmal. It's a weakness in my game and I need to sort it out."
2255: That's a par for Tiger then on 18. Quite brilliant 67. But -10 surely won't be enough, will it? He's back though, that's for sure. Question for Tim Walker, do any of the girls know what the deal with the play-off is? I think it's 16,17,18 but can't quite remember. Can you ask Candice? 2251: And now Donald joins the pack! Birdies 16 and he's in an eight-way tie for second! Birdie, par, par, birdie, birdie for Luke. Here's your predtions: Pierce Mackinlay-West is going for "rock solid" Schwartzel. Nigel Stephenson reckons it's "an Aussie for sure" and Rick Humphries says "everyone chokes and Tiger wins."
By far my favourite email though comes from Tim Walker: "I'm working today as a DJ in a strip club in Dayton, Ohio -- and I'm reading your coverage instead of paying attention to my girls onstage. Excellent reportage! Well done!"
2250: Par for Schwartzel on 14. Scott's done something unspeakable on 15. Big chance for him and he's messed it up badly going for the green. He's in the galleries, so perhaps not terminal. 2246: Rory managed to save par on 13. But he's not even on the first page of my leaderboard anymore. Day's tee shot on 17 has left him behind the tree. Tiger's approach on 18 isn't great. And if anyone can shoot -11 that may be that for Tiger. Some round though... 2242: Tiger's on 18 now after a par on 17. His drive is perfect. "Bite! Bite!" he yells at it. Needs a three here or one of these Aussies will surely pass him. Anyone willing to stick there neck out at this stage? Let me have your predictions with an electronic mail. I'm going for Rory.... Scott -11, Tiger -10, Ogilvy -10, Van Pelt -10, Day -10, Schwartzel -10. Conclusion? Play off. 2237: Scott holes for birdie on 14 and leads outright. "Please let Rory finish without any more comment," mails Martin. Feel like doing exactly that to be honest. 2234: Australia's year? Could well be. Ogilvy has joined Day and Scott up at the top of the leaderboard! He's birdied 16 is on the most incredible charge. Began the back nine on five under, and has gone par, par, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie. The mirror opposite of Rory, basically. 2233: It gets worse, I'm afraid. God this is painful. His tee shot on 13 is pulled horribly and splashes into the drink. He's down to -5 now, and is +6 for today. He's gonnan struggle to break 80 at this rate. 2228: And he's missed it! Oh no. He's gone, I'm afraid. He's four-putted! He's double bogeyed 12. Utterly, brutally, awfully, cruel. 2227: Rory's tee shot on 12 is straight at the flag. Good chance now for birdie, but he's just not been making these. Yep, and that's another chance gone. Never threatened the flag. He'll also have a tricky one coming back. Has missed a couple of six-footer like this. 2223: Tiger's birdie putt on 16. Spent an age over this. Amazing scenes as he sends it towards the cup. Crowd are on their feet...but it's staying up. Throws the putter in the air in frustration. So, so close. But he's running out of holes. "Its 3 in the morning here in Mumbai," mails Mihir. "Last weekend, we were still celebrating India's win the in the World Cup. We thought nothing could be better than cricket. Well, that's only till today. I am having hundreds of heart-attacks between your updates."
2219: Brilliant from McIlroy on 11. Great drive, even better long iron, but he leaves the putt left! Another chance missed. Needed that badly. 2277: Tiger on the par three 16th. Some happy memories here for him, it's fair to say. And he almost holes his tee shot! Extraordinary. Pin's tucked away but he's taken it on, and that's just a brilliant iron shot. It's probably 12 feet away now, and he'll have that for birdie. 2214: Tiger's missed it! Just when you thought he was fixed! Just lost it left, and he looks like he can't quite believe it. Make birdie though, and joins a five-way tie for the lead. Best Masters ever? "Can't believe he just missed that," tweets Graeme McDowell. "Thought the script had been written. #gameon"
2209: As bad as I feel for Rory, it's been an absolute privilege to watch Tiger in his form. Nothing like it. So at the moment, we now have a four-way tie for the lead - Scott, Schwartzel, Choi and Cabrera are all on -10. Tiger, though, if he holes that eagle putt, will top them all on -11. McIlroy has dropped from first to eighth. Compelling. "Tiger tiger woods y'all!" mails Rick Humphries. Anyone speak American and fancy translating? 2207: This is horrible. McIlroy misses, and that's a triple bogey seven. Game over, surely? Tiger's smashed his drive down 15. And hello...look at this! Shot of the day from Tiger, hits a towering, beautifully ballance five iron to three feet for eagle! And he LOVED that the moment it left his club. Twirl of the stick and a strut down the fairway. 2203: All going tits up for Rory, I'm afraid. His fourth shot on 10 hits the tree. He chips on now but it's far from great. He's got a 18 foot putt for a double bogey. If he misses that, then it starts to get really ugly. "Gutwrenching" says Graeme McDowell on Twitter. 2159: Adam Scott on the charge now. There's a birdie on 11 - one of the few - and he's upto second. Rory's making a horrible mess of 10. Smashes his three wood into the ground and his ball's gone left, way left, behind a scoreboard and into the trees. Colin Murphy mails to say he "played Sandy Lane in 2007. Best rum punch ever." It's a golf course in Barbados. But you knew that already didn't you. "Come on Rory," adds Colin. Keep it together."
2156: Rory chips back onto the fairway - assuming no one was home in the house his ball ended up next to - but he's a long way back. 2155: Where the hell is Rory? He's caught a tree with his drive on 10 and he's almost off the course! Seriously, that's gone miles off track. He's at least 100 yards away from the 10th fairway after a massive deflection from the tree. Wow. He's actually playing his second shot from what looks like someone's front porch. 2150: Rory pars nine, Tiger does the same on 13. Probably the best birdie chance on the back nine, though, 13, so time's running out for Tiger unless he can do something extraordinary. Which he's obviously capable of. 2143: Tiger goes for the 13th green but he's over the back. His chip down the hill ain't great and he'll struggle for birdie there. Just stalling a bit, here. McIlroy hits another howitzer drive down nine, and leaves himself 15 feet for birdie there. "Sitting in Sandy Lane watching your coverage" mails Ian Fitzpatrick. "Daughter has the remote and can't get hold of it. She's the boss. Very exciting." Sure is Ian, bit worried about your daughter though. Don't know you or your family, obviously, but you need to teach these kids the score early these days or they'll be chaos when she's older. Where is Sandy Lane, anywhere near Sandy Lyle? 2134: Just a par for Rory on eight. Chance missed after that drive. Cabrera birdies though, and ties Tiger and Schwartzel now on -10. Couple of golfing greats copping some awful flak from the cricketers on Twitter. Jimmy Anderson being nasty about Monty, and Shane Warne less than impressed with Nick Faldo's self-aggrandising commentary. 2129: Tiger misses a tiddler on 12! That's a bogey, and a bad one. Three putt from 18 feet. Par putt dived left just at the last second, and that's a big break for Rory and the rest. That's his SIXTH three putt this week. His drive on 13 is a gem, though. Has been brilliant with that stick today. TW -9
2125: No birdie on 12 for Tiger. Rory's going for the green on eight with his three-wood. Smashes it brilliantly, but gets a little unlucky with the bounce and he's through the back. RMc -12, TW -10, CS -10
2121: Tiger finds the heart of the green on 12. Swinging so smoothly now you could almost wonder what all that fuss was about. Woods is four holes ahead of the final pairing, so he's going to be able to post a clubhouse target, so McIlroy and the rest will know exactly what they've got to do. 2115: R-Mac - the only player in the top 10 who's over par today - hits his best drive of the day on the eighth. Might be reachable in two from there after a big, ballsy drive. Tiger's on the front of the 11th green, his birdie putt is hole high and he taps in for par. Not too many birdies on 11. 2110: Back comes Rory! Attaboy. Finally makes a putt on the seventh. Great stuff. Birdies to take the lead at -11. Be awful if he just gave this up to Tiger today. Another birdie chance on the par-five eighth coming up. Poulter on Woods, on Tuesday: "I don't think he'll finish in the top 5. The shots he was hitting at Doral, they were very inconsistent. You can't afford to hit shots like that on this golf course and get away with it. I don't think you want to rely on your short game that much around this place."
2107: Just a par for Tiger on 10. KJ birdies seven and is fourth outright now on nine under. Tiger's drive on 11 is beautiful. Huge shouts from the gallery as he coming tearing into Amen Corner. 2101: Woods, famously, has never come from behind to win a Major. But now he's got a birdie putt on 10 to take the outright lead. "Hmmm, I like the look of this Woods chap," tweets Graeme Swann. "Where has he come from, do we know anything about him?" 2058: Tiger's tee shot on 10 is straight down the middle. Paul Azinger on Twitter: "I love @ianjamespoulter but..just sayen I think he tugged on superman's cape!"
2053: So where are we at? Three way tie for first. TW -10 Rm -10 CS -10. And three way tie for fourth. J Day -8 KJ Choi -8 Cabrera -8 Basically, it's the most exciting Masters finale since 1996, don't you think? 2050: And Tiger saves his par! 25 footer up the hill that was going nowhere else. Just brilliant. All those 'changing of the guard' pieces that the journos have been penning all day are looking destined for the spike. That's Tiger out in 31!. If he pulls this off you're looking at one of the great surges. Michael Vaughan tweets: "This is sport at its ultimate best..Tiger fist pumping always means danger. Brilliant viewing."
2043: Another bogey for Rory on five! Big breaking putt from about six feet and it's lipped out. Two over for the round and the green jacket looks a long way away now. Just hasn't got going, hasn't found his flow. 2041: More trouble for Tiger on nine. Finds the greenside trap from the trees, and his flop out of the sand's a little heavy. He'll have 25 feet to save his par and keep this unbelievable charge going. 2040: Tiger's drive on nine finds the trees. Donald drops one on the seventh - his first bogey of the day - and he's down to seventh now. 2032: In she goes! Tiger eagles the eighth and is -10. Big. There's a knee-up fist-pump, there's a high-five for Stevie, and there's a decidly exciting back nine coming up, don't you think! Someone find Poulter and stick a microphone in his face! So he's five under for the day. And if he pars nine he'll be out in 31. "I need a big front nine" he said on the radio this morning. Wasn't kidding. Email from Neil Sawyer: "Cracking shot from Tiger into eight, but he always seems to get lucky. Anyone else hitting that shot, their ball would have bounced the other way.."
2027: Tiger's got an eagle putt on eight! Has absolutely smoked a three-wood there, and it's just perfect. Runs up the right side of the green then snakes round towards the flag. If he makes that he's -10, one of the lead! 2024: Movement up top. Schwartzel three putts on the four and that gives Rory the lead again. First thing Schwartzel's done wrong today, and shows you how dangerous that fourth green can be if you're the wrong side of it, as Schwartzel was. 2020: McIlroy monsters his drive down the middle on three. Shot, but next time he sees a leaderboard he's not going to be at the top of it for the first time since Thursday. He has a birdie chance on three, good one too, but that's another poor putt. Pars the third and stays -11. 2009: Oh good man. McIlroy pars the second. BUT SCHWARTZEL'S EAGLED THE THIRD! Shares the lead now with McIlroy! Incredible. Holed his iron from the middle of the fairway. Birdie/par/eagle and McIlroy's lead lasted half an hour. 2006: Westwood's out in 33, and he's up into the top 10. McIlroy's fourth shot across the second green is good. Really tough shot and he committed to it well. If he holes this six-footer back he'll feel a heck of a lot better about life. On that note, I've just switched from Sky to the Beeb and feel happier and cleaner already. 2001: Tiger holes it! Birdie two on six. He was after that one too, liked it all the way, and is that just a hint of swagger coming back there? Trouble on two for McIlroy though. Bunker off the tee, then hits the lip and makes up about 80 yards. His third shot on the par five two then finds the greenside trap. Playing like a very nervous young man right about now. 1958: Tiger likes this one. Stunning tee shot on six. Pin is tucked on the extreme left of the green, but instead of flying it over the trap, Tiger draws a wondeful iron onto the right of the dancefloor, and watches as it moonwalks all the way over to six feet under the flag. Brilliant. 19.50: Wow. Rory bogeys the first. Man, that can only be nerves. His chip back was okay, 7 out of 10, and left him with five foot back up the hill, but he missed it left. RMc -11, CS -9. Rio Ferdinand: 'Good luck Rory....whatever happens its really important u stay on your feet!! Hope u go on and finish it off.' Bit last week, that, isn't it... 19.46: Rory's a little awry with his approach. Just had a wedge in there, after that bean-bouncing drive down the first and he's a little long. Cabrera is at the front of the green. Pin's right back left and McIlroy will have a fairly routine chip and putt for his par. Cabrera's parred. Michael Vaughan on Twitter: "Nice start Afro boy.. Always nice to see one go straight down the runway.."
19.42: McIlroy will have to go some to beat Schwartzel's start though. He's birdied the first with an extraordinary chip and run from the right of the first green. Must have been 50 yards. Brilliant. He's second on his own now on nine-under, and McIlroy's four-shot lead has been trimmed already. 19.39: So here he goes on the first. Remember Westwood last year? Hit this drive onto the second fairway and never really recovered. What will Rory do? Oh it's a beauty. Wonderful rhythm, full commitment to the swing. Straight down the middle. And it's long too. Nerves? Me? In the final round of The Masters? Pah! 19.35: Three putt for Tiger on four. Told you, didn't I. 19.30: Nice start from Westwood today. Wearing Tiger/Forest red as he does these days, and he's two under for the day after a birdie on six. Schwartzel and Choi has teed off at the first now, so we just have the final group to go. He's so wonderfully calm, isn't he, McIlroy? Always has been. Just a perfect temperament for sport. But. As he walks along the path towards the first tee, flanked by five security guards and followed by his caddie, he'll be ticking. Carbrera's sartorial choice is interesting too. His shirt can only be described as Masters green. 19.27: Tiger's tied for sixth now on seven under. Not gonna happen. Don't worry. Not a hope in hell of a Tiger charge. He's pretty cheesed off on the tee on four as a camera shutter in his backswing causes him to pull his tee shot left. Well, that's what he's blaming anyway. 19.25: That's big news from Garside isn't it? Rory all in black. Interesting choice. His mate G-Mac wore a pink cardie when he won the US Open. I felt at the time he hadn't really thought that through, replay wise. Speaking of replays, Tiger's playing like he used to and has birdied two and three. Couldn't buy a putt yesterday, but he's already holed two crackers here. 19.15: Kevin Garside at Augusta: Rory McIlroy has chosen black for big day. looks at ease on range. Tiger's coach Sean Foley just wished him well, or was he asking for work? 19.00: Proving that you don't need to be on Chris Evans's salary to be late for a Masters shift, here I am! Very much looking forward to this and entirely convinced that Rory McIlroy will be having a ill-fitting green jacket slipped over his shoulders by a grinning Phil Mickelson at about midnight. He tees off at 19.40. He shoots 70 today and it's his, surely? Ping us an email, or a tweet, if you think otherwise. Here's your full leaderboard...
