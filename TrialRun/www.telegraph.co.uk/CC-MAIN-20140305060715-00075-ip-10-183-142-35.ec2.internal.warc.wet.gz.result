£30,000 for texting bollards A £30,000 grant has been awarded to a bizarre new art project which enables people living in Bristol to text their bollards and lamp posts. The art project Hello Lamp Post is costing £30,000 By Daisy Bowie-Sell

Hello Lamp Post! is the name of a bizarre £30,000 project which allows Bristol residents to text bollards, lamp posts, benches, post boxes and more. In an attempt to harness the technology behind the 'smart cities', London-based design studio PAN will set up Hello Lamp Post! in Bristol this summer. The idea is purportedly to "communicate through lamp posts, bus stops and other street furniture". The project takes advantage of technology generally used by councils for practical reasons – to highlight when a light bulb might need to be changed, for example – and uses it for playful communication. Each post box, bollard, bench and storm drain in the city has a unique code. People will be invited to write a text to a special phone number saying "Hello + the name of the object and its code". The object will then immediately text you back a question. The project was picked from a group of 93 applications for the £30,000 Playable City Award. Musician Imogen Heap was on the judging panel, which picked PAN for its "approach to public spaces, which uses inanimate objects to trigger playful interactions". Related Articles

Heap said: "I love this for its whispers on the street, guardians in dark corners, humanising our cities' appendages whose eyes and ears now have a voice. Vessels for an ever evolving conversation, connecting us together. They were there all along!" Judge Tom Uglow of Google said: "Hello Lamp Post! stood out with a potential for both art and play using existing urban furniture. It filled me with childish delight." Combining art and technology, the idea behind the commission is to to find art which utilises creative technology to 'explore the theme of the playable city. The project will begin in July this year. The award is supported by a number of organisations including Aardman, Toshiba, Univeristy of Bristol and Bristol City Council.

Baffled by wine buffs? You're not alone
A study has found widespread bewilderment among wine drinkers at the "pompous" terms used by producers, retailers and critics to describe how a bottle tastes.
I’ll drink to that: wine drinkers said they preferred simple descriptions on wine labels to pompous terms like “haunting” and brooding” Photo: ALAMY	By Jasper Copping

From a "nervy" red to a white boasting a subtle hint of "spring hedgerows", if you have ever been baffled by the descriptions given to wines then don't worry, you are not alone. New research has revealed widespread bewilderment at the terms used by producers, retailers and critics to convey a bottle's taste. More than half of wine drinkers who took part in the survey (55 per cent) said the descriptions given to wines failed to help them get an understanding of the flavour. And the drinkers were also able to pick out those terms they found most mystifying. They were given a list of 43 words and phrases used to describe different wines and were asked to identify the five they found most and least helpful in conveying the drink's taste. Related Articles

Those found most confusing were the phrases "firm skeleton" (designated least useful by 37 per cent), "old bones" (35 per cent), "nervy" (31 per cent) "wet stone" (27 per cent), "tongue spanking" (21 per cent) "haunting" (21 per cent), "spring hedgerows" (19 per cent) and "brooding" (18 per cent). Other terms found puzzling included: "vegetal", "leathery", "chunky", "canny" and "minerality". The most helpful terms were "fresh" (considered useful by 47 per cent), "zesty" (43 per cent) and "peachy" (31 per cent). All the terms used in the survey were taken from the bottles or websites of leading wine brands, or recent reviews by leading wine critics. The survey of 1,000 wine drinkers by polling firm, One Poll, found that in total, more than half of respondents (55 per cent) said that descriptions failed to help them understand the taste. When questioned further, only a third (33.7) said they were helpful, while almost half (45 per cent) said they found them "pompous". Nearly two thirds of respondents also said they never get the same smells from wine as those which are suggested from the wine label. Those taking part were relatively well-informed on wine terminology. When asked whether they understood the terms "mature" and "young", only 29 per cent said no. The research was carried out for Laithwaite's Wine, an online retailer, although its own customers were excluded from the survey. Justin Howard-Sneyd, consultant for the firm and a master of wine, said: "Describing wine is not an exact science; wine and taste are very personal, very subjective things. A wine that I think tastes of cherry, could taste totally different to someone else, so it's no wonder that there is such a vast variety of language when it comes to wine descriptions. "We have probably been guilty ourselves of using overblown language in the past but this is a wake-up call to the whole wine industry to make a change."

News in brief
12:00AM BST 25 Sep 2000
THE head teacher cleared on appeal of slapping an unruly 10-year-old is expected to be interviewed by police about new allegations of mistreatment as the school faces fresh turmoil. Graham Powell, chairman of the governors and a campaigner to have Marjorie Evans, the suspended head re-instated, could be ousted by his deputy at a meeting on Thursday.
It was unclear whether the move reflected diminishing support for Mrs Evans or opposition to Mr Powell who has been vociferous in his backing of the head teacher. Yesterday, Mr Powell said he wanted to remain as chairman and re-iterated his claim that there was a "witch-hunt" by staff members and parents against Mrs Evans.
Ian Williams, solicitor for Mrs Williams, said the new allegations included shouting at noisy children in an inappropriate tone of voice.
Pilot and wife escape crash
THE pilot of a helicopter and his wife crawled from its wreckage with cuts and bruises after it plunged to the ground. Edward Meredith encountered bad weather above the 1,000 acre New Zealand Farm at Chute, Wiltshire, after taking off in good conditions from Thruxton airfield, five miles away in Hampshire. The couple were returning home to Gloucestershire from a party.
Baby hurt in explosion
A FOUR-MONTH-OLD boy was badly hurt in an explosion at a house in Fareham, Hampshire, when the owner lit a solid fuel fire fitted with a back boiler. Andrew Metcalfe escaped with minor injuries and shock, but his son Robin suffered burns to his face, airway and torso. He was seriously ill in hospital last night.

But this is nonsense." East Dunbartonshire Council said: "Obviously any such decision should involve the entire school community."

Gaza conflict: ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hamas
Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire, due to take effect from 7pm GMT, on the eighth day of intensive Israeli fire on the Gaza Strip and militant rocket attacks out of the enclave.

5:46PM GMT 21 Nov 2012
Follow Egypt has been leading international efforts to end more than a week of violence in and around Gaza, with Mohammed Kamel Amr, the foreign minister, announcing that "these efforts have reached an agreement for a ceasefire." First word of the truce came from a Palestinian official who has knowledge of the negotiations in Cairo, where Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, was also pursuing peace efforts. Barack Obama, the US president, was quick to praise Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, for agreeing to support the ceasefire. "The president commended the prime minister for agreeing to the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, which the president recommended the prime minster do, while reiterating that Israel maintains the right to defend itself," the White House said. Mr Netanyahu had told Mr Obama he was ready to give a ceasefire a chance, but warned more forceful action might bee needed if it fails. Related Articles

"(Netanyahu) spoke a short while ago with President Barack Obama and agreed to his recommendation to give the Egyptian ceasefire proposal a chance, and in this way provide an opportunity to stabilise the situation and calm it before any more forceful action would be necessary," an Israeli statement said. Mrs Clinton said the ceasefire had come at a crucial time for countries of the Middle East.
"This is a critical moment for the region. Egypt's new government is assuming the responsibility and leadership that has long made this country a cornerstone for regional stability and peace," she said at a joint news conference with her Egyptian counterpart, Mr Amr.
She also thanked Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi for his mediation efforts and pledged to work with partners in the region "to consolidate this progress, improve conditions for the people of Gaza, provide security for the people of Israel".
In Cairo, Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal was due to give a press conference following the announcement, according to Hamas sources.

US election: Obama and Romney in frantic dash for final votes
The two men who would be president presented their closing arguments to the American people on Saturday, as they embarked on a frantic three-day dash for the finishing line in what is poised to be one of the closest contests ever seen in the United States. By Alex Spillius, Portsmouth, New Hampshire
5:23PM GMT 03 Nov 2012
Follow After months of speeches, dozens of diner visits, hundreds of thousands of commercials and billions of dollars spent by the campaigns and outside groups, the race is still too close to call. Mitt Romney promised Americans that under his leadership the country would rediscover its greatness, after languishing under Barack Obama for four years. Under a slogan of “Real Change from Day One” – a deliberate dig at the president’s winning mantra from 2008 - the Republican contender said that his rival’s “big government” policies had failed. “If there is anybody who fears the American dream is fading away, I have a message for you: America is about to come roaring back,” he said at his first rally of the day in New Hampshire, one of the closest swing states. “President Obama is offering excuses, I am offering a plan. He is asking Americans to settle [for what they have got]. But Americans don’t settle, we dream, we aspire and we achieve great things.” Related Articles

Romney's push to win New Hampshire votes
03 Nov 2012
Mr Romney is now the candidate offering a sense of hope, prosperity and unity, while the president is visibly on the defensive. “I will not just represent one party, I will represent one nation,” Mr Romney said. The challenger’s supporters and aides are convinced momentum is on their side. They point to previous elections decided by a surge on the last weekend, such as 1980, when Ronald Reagan overtook Jimmy Carter at the final hurdle. “People then were not happy with the economy. Democrats either stayed at home or said ‘to hell with it, I will vote for the other guy’,” said Andrew Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire. “That election is the most similar dynamic we have to now.” The crowd of several thousand that turned out in temperatures close to freezing in Portsmouth for Mr Romney suggested that the pattern could be repeated. As Mr Romney and his wife Ann took to the stage, they were greeted by chants of “Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!” and “We love you Ann!”
Visiting the Granite State was a return to the scene of the climb for Mr Romney. It was the place where his bid to be his party's nominee was effectively launched by a primary victory in January. “New Hampshire got me the Republican nomination, and New Hampshire is going to get me the White House,” he said to roars. The difference between Romney then and now is marked. He is more confident, less awkward and altogether clearer about his message. Supporters – who used to file away semi-satisfied at the conclusion of his speeches – afterwards thronged to shake his hand at a crush barriers. Behind, his plane – emblazoned with logo “Believe in America” – sat waiting to speed him to his next destination, Iowa. His flight path could well have encountered Mr Obama’s yesterday, as he too crisscrossed the nation, visiting Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Virginia. Appearing in Mentor, Ohio, Mr Obama said the election was a choice "about two different visions for America: the top down vision that crashed the economy, or a future built on a strong and growing middle class". The national polls show the two candidates separated by only a few decimal points. But Mr Obama leads in more of the closest swing states, which could prove crucial in the state-by-state electoral college system. On the back foot ever since his dismal first debate performance, the president was boosted last week by simply doing his job efficiently during Hurricane Sandy, and reminding voters that he is their leader. The late endorsement of Michael Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York, won’t have done any harm. But he has been forced to draw heavily at the 11th hour on the celebrity support that has been a feature of his ascendance. Katy Perry, Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder are among those who will appear and perform with the president in the final few days. Mr Romney has been blessed only by a warm-up routine from Kid Rock, best known beyond American shores for his brief marriage to Pamela Anderson. For Romney supporters however, the president’s Hollywood allure is part of the problem. With the economy making a painfully slow recovery, the election in their minds has come back to where it started: how to get America back on its feet. Star appeal is irrelevant and they see Mr Romney, a phenomenally successful former venture capitalist, as the man best qualified to do that. “I voted for Obama four years ago. I thought it was the right thing to do, but I regret it now,” said Norman Le Moine, waiting for Mr Romney to speak. “I believed in hope and change and thought the country needed different leadership. He was very charismatic and inspirational. But he has moved the country too far to the left. We are $16 trillion in debt, too many people are out of work - and America is better than that.” The owner of a business selling health products online, Mr Le Moine, 59, admitted that he is actually better off now than four years ago. “But listen, a lot of my friends aren’t doing so well. I put my heart and soul into my business – like Mitt Romney – that’s why I think he is the guy to win. He has the right experience, the right leadership skills.” Over in southwestern Ohio, Kerrie Logan Hollihan, an author of historical books for children, agrees that in tough economic times the White House needs a “capable administrator” in residence. Having voted for both Democrats and Republicans, she is just the sort of floating voter the Obama camp craves as it tries to cling on to Ohio, one of the largest swing states. But she looked at how Mr Romney turned around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, his achievements in business, and bipartisan style as governor of Massachusetts, a solid Democratic state, and decided to plump for him. “I haven’t found Obama convincing as a leader,” she said. “He came from nowhere and surprised a lot of people, and convinced a lot of people, especially the young. “But he is like a lot of ambitious and talented people in this world who convince other people to put them in a leadership position, and when they get there, there is this sense of ‘now what’?” Democrats in Ohio and other swing states are acutely aware that with Mr Romney breathing down the president’s neck, getting out the vote on the day will be crucial. Morris Reid, a former official in Bill Clinton’s White House who hails from the state, said: “It will come down to turnout and ground game. If we get African Americans to turn out we can get an extra two to three points in Ohio.” A misleading TV ad by the Romney campaign which claimed local Chrysler plants were preparing to ship jobs to China has angered labour voters and women with blue collar husbands, he said. That could make the crucial difference at this late stage, by encouraging extra numbers to show up at polling stations on Tuesday. “I believe we will win, but this is close, very close. It makes me nervous. I have never been so nervous about a race,” said Mr Reid. US Election

Moscow no longer city of dreams - Russia Now
This online supplement is produced and published by Rossiyskaya Gazeta (Russia), which takes sole responsibility for the contents.

Stay-at-home Russians prefer the regions
The time when every Russian dreamt of moving to Moscow may be coming to an end, data from state-run pollster VTsIOM poll shows.
More people now believe that they can become richer or start their business more easily in the region where they live or elsewhere in the country, the poll said.
Forty-six pc of respondents believed that they could find their fortune in Moscow, down from 57pc a year earlier. While the number of those who said they could find a prosperous life in the regions has increased to 19pc, from 12pc last year.
The number of respondents saying they could find a suitable job in the capital rather than in the regions fell to 46pc, from 57pc last year.

“After the crisis hit, Russians turned toward stability from the adventures they pursued before,” VTsIOM spokeswoman Olga Kamenchuk said.
“They tend to agree to a lower-paying but stable job at home rather than a possibly lucrative but unstable job in Moscow.”
Besides, Russians may just find the love of their life right next door.
Only 8pc of the respondents believed that they had a better chance of finding a partner in Moscow rather than in the regions, down from 12pc.
The poll surveyed 1,600 people in 42 regions and republics in late August.
