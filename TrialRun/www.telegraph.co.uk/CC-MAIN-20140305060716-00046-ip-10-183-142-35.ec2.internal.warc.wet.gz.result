Stonehenge comes full circle
Inigo Jones believed that Stonehenge was a Roman temple Matthew Sturgis

Matthew Sturgis reviews Stonehenge by Rosemary Hill
One evening last month - between 9pm and 10pm - there was an incident at Stonehenge. As a local police spokesman put it, employing the unique argot of the British constabulary, 'two male offenders were seen disturbing the monument with a hammer and screwdriver'.
The vandals made off, in a red Rover 400, with their prize - a 10p-sized scrap chipped from the monument's 'Heel Stone'.
Such acts of mineralogical trophy-hunting are now rare but 150 years ago they were part of every day-tripper's excursion to the site. As Rosemary Hill describes in this fascinating and delightful book, the sound of hammer on stone was the background accompaniment to many a Victorian visit. Chisels were even handed out to visitors by the official guides.
The mysterious gathering of megaliths that constitutes Stonehenge has stood on Salisbury Plain for millennia. Since the beginning of recorded history it has remained largely unchanged (save for the odd crash, and the occasional bit of 'restoration'), but the attitudes and the ideas of those who have looked upon it have shifted and altered like the light on a spring day. And it is these wild fluctuations that Hill charts with such lucidity, wit and insight.
The constant questions that confront the enquiring mind are: Who put the stones there? When? And why? Over the years the answers have included Geoffrey of Monmouth's theory that it was a cemetery for the Britons treacherously slain by the Saxon warlord Hengist; Inigo Jones's suggestion that it was set up by the Romans; the notions that it was the focus of a Druidic cult, that it was the work of Phoenicians, the Vikings or the Ancient Greeks; even that it was a Buddhist temple.
John Lubbock, the 19th-century gentleman polymath who later became Lord Avebury and coined the term 'cave man', sagely considered that, in the face of Stonehenge, 'it is wiser to confess our ignorance, than to waste valuable time in useless guesses'. Such wise counsel was, of course, never likely to be taken, and every generation has been only too ready to guess away the time.
Each age creates Stonehenge in its own image. For Enlightenment scholars it was 'the Grand Orrery of the Ancient Druids', to the Romantic imagination it was fraught with thrilling foreboding, for the 1970s counterculture it was the ideal place for a pop festival.
The concerns of our own times seem reflected in the current crop of theories. The recent discipline of astro-archaeology has revived the 'orrery' idea, bolstering it with the latest computer modelling, to suggest that Stonehenge is indeed a highly sophisticated construction, aligned in accordance with the lunar and solar cycles.
It might also, apparently, have been a centre for alternative medicine. The idea, first put forward by the notoriously unreliable Geoffrey of Monmouth, is back in vogue with modern academics.
Among non-academics, too, the sense that the monument is imbued with some indefinable but positive force continues to gather strength. Crowds of 30,000 or more now turn up to witness the sunrise on the summer solstice.
Although developments in archaeology, geology and other related disciplines have increased our store of knowledge about the monument (current estimates place the erection of the stones around 2400 BC) many of the greatest advances in understanding have come simply from careful and sympathetic observation of the site, an ability to look upon the familiar with new eyes.
It was John Aubrey, the 17th-century antiquarian and author of Brief Lives, who first discovered the ring of 56 holes on the outer perimeter of the site. As late as the 1950s, Professor Richard Atkinson, photographing one of the stones in the raking light of a summer's evening, noticed with a jolt that it was carved with images of a short dagger and two Bronze Age axes.
Who knows what fresh discoveries there are to be made in the same way?
For many people, though, the view of Stonehenge is from the car-window as they speed (or crawl) along the A303. For decades there have been plans to bury the road in a tunnel. But putting this into practice has proved beyond the power of the various quangos and interest groups involved. Hill's final chapters include a darkly comic account of this so-called Stonehenge Master Plan, which began with the designing of an expensive trademarked logo and culminated - after eight years of consultation, debate, decisions and appeals, costing some £25 million - with the announcement that all the schemes were too expensive to carry through.
Happily for us, and for all those who have been touched by the beauty and mystery of Stonehenge, the planning process was clearly rather simpler in Neolithic times.

Keynesians are wrong, because George Osborne's cuts are actually very modest
Sometimes, doing the right thing requires sticking your fingers in your ears, singing ting-a-ling and blocking out the shrieks from those around you who have lost their heads. The most valuable spending for an economy's long-term health is investment, such as roads and buildings. Yet this kind of spending will collapse by 21.9pc between 2010-11 and 2017-18 Photo: Alamy	By Allister Heath

Refusing to listen to critics is not a course of action I would usually recommend to George Osborne, the Chancellor, who has made far too many mistakes already.
But there is one issue on which he should remain steadfast, and that is his modest programme of public spending cuts. The Government mustn’t listen to those calling for a dramatic U-turn. The Coalition’s commitment to reducing the size of our bloated state is the best thing about its economic policy, and that will remain true regardless of how good or bad the GDP figures turn out to be on Thursday.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bill Gross of Pimco, Paul Krugman and all of the other Keynesian advocates are wrong. They should be ignored, in exactly the same way that Margaret Thatcher ignored the 364 economists who wrote complaining about her policies in 1981. There are major problems with the Coalition’s austerity policies, including the idiotic decision to hike the tax burden on an already hard-pressed nation, and simply trimming the state without unleashing the private sector was always going to be foolish. But the spending reductions are the good part of the overall austerity package; and the simplistic attack on Osborne for “cutting too much, too fast” has no basis in reality.
To understand why, consider the facts. Last time I checked, total, real terms spending cuts of just 2.7pc spread over seven years is hardly the greatest of revolutions. It is the sort of belt-tightening that companies and individuals routinely push through in one fell swoop; it is the kind of cut that would have been historically large but not unmanageable had it happened in one single year. It certainly is not the sort of change that causes an economy to stagnate for years.
Yet, astonishingly given the rhetoric, cuts of just 2.7pc are what the Coalition is planning by 2017-18, compared with the levels of spending seen in 2010-11. Nobody believes me when I dig up these kinds of figures but they are all public information, available from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Between 2011-12 and 2014-15, the annual cut is supposed to be just 0.5pc after adjusting for inflation; spending is then meant to go up by 0.2pc in 2015-16 before falling by 0.4pc during the subsequent two years.

In cash terms, spending will go on rising. Economists find nominal figures meaningless, but it is the way the rest of us, families as well as companies, deal with our own finances, so it is of some interest that cash spending is increasing from £693.6bn in 2011-12 to £765.1bn in 2017-18.
The fundamental problem with the Coalition’s cuts is their composition: the most valuable spending for an economy’s long-term health is investment, such as roads and buildings (Gordon Brown used to dub all spending as investment to fool his critics). Yet this kind of spending will collapse by 21.9pc between 2010-11 and 2017-18. That is hurting growth. It would have been better to focus the cuts elsewhere; the answer now ought to be to get the private sector to start building roads, homes and airports, privately financed, to compensate. The Coalition’s big error is that it has failed to remove the red tape to allow this to happen.
By contrast, current spending, such as wages and benefits, tends to be bad for long-run economic growth, yet will drop just 0.9pc by 2017-18, which is shockingly insufficient. This masks the pain that some parts of the public sector are facing, and departmental spending will be slashed by 16.7pc. But surging welfare (including pensions) and debt interest payments mean that the overall bill will barely decline.
That is the reality of the cuts: very harsh in parts, politically difficult, and excessively focused on easy-to-axe capital projects, yet very modest in their totality, mainly caused by inflation rather than actual cash reductions, and dragged out over a ridiculously long period of time. They are not what is choking the economy: for that we should blame inflation that is slashing wages and savings; front-loaded tax increases; a monetary policy that is keeping zombie firms alive; excessive red tape; a ridiculously counter-cyclical financial policy which is seeing banks have to hike reserves at the worst possible time, crimping credit; a construction industry crippled by red tape; declining North Sea output; a crisis in the eurozone which is reducing exports; and an abject failure of the Government to introduce the sorts of supply-side and tax policies that would once again encourage businesses to build, spend and hire.
The insufficiently large current spending cuts, combined with the absence of a proper supply-side growth agenda, explain why the deficit is no longer shrinking meaningfully: it was £121bn in 2011-12, £120.6bn in 2012-13 (only slightly down, thanks to further investment cuts) and is expected at £120bn in 2013-14. This is dreadful.
Public sector net debt will hit 85.6pc of GDP by 2016-17, 15 percentage points of GDP higher than Osborne originally hoped for. It will rocket from £1.104 trillion in 2011-12 to £1.637 trillion in 2017-18. That means ever more spent on interest. It will also increase the authorities’ incentives to eventually inflate the problem away.
I don’t accept the view, increasingly prevalent, that our woes are proof that basic Keynesianism has been shown to be right, and that we should ignore the deficit for now and spend even more. The well-publicised discovery of flaws in one piece of research that suggested that excessive government debt is bad for growth shouldn’t blind us to the fact that a growing body of work has reached a similar conclusion, including work by Stephen Cecchetti and colleagues published by the Bank of International Settlements.
Between 2010 and 2013, the UK Government’s cyclically-adjusted primary deficit was cut by just 2.7pc of GDP, similar to America’s fiscal tightening of 2.6pc, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The fact that America has enjoyed a much stronger recovery reminds us that the short-term impact of increasing or cutting deficits is often exaggerated.
Paradoxically, given that the Keynesians have recently been given much succour from the IMF, a working paper published recently by that very same organisation by Anja Baum, Marcos Poplawski-Ribeiro and Anke Weber suggests that boosting spending wouldn’t actually work. It finds, in the case of the UK, that such policies have a limited and often statistically insignificant impact on growth. In the jargon beloved of economists, the multipliers are small.
There is much that is wrong with the economy, and Osborne has made many mistakes, cutting the wrong things, allowing inflation to rip and failing to bolster incentives to work and invest. But he is right to be staying well clear of the Keynesian Kool-Aid.

Waterstones plans job cuts ahead of new distribution centre Waterstones, the biggest bookshop chain in Britain, is expected to cut hundreds of jobs ahead of opening a new distribution hub. By Amy Wilson 12:29PM GMT 12 Jan 2009
Comments
The book chain, which is owned by the music and DVD retailer HMV, told staff today it plans a "number of redundancies". with some reports saying 200 staff could be affected, the latest in a string of redundancies by retailers. HMV rivals Zavvi and Woolworths, and childrenswear chain Adams, which is in adminstration, have all been forced to cut staff after running into financial trouble because of the economic slowdown. Waterstones job cuts are thought to be linked to the opening of a new central distribution centre in Burton-on-Trent, which will come into use over the next few months. The hub will mean fewer deliveries as it will deal with all store orders, so in turn Waterstones shops will need fewer staff. The book chain’s like-for-like sales fell 3.1pc in the six months to the end of October, although they were only down 1.4pc excluding the sales boost from the final Harry Potter book, which was published during the first half of the previous year. HMV’s chief executive Simon Fox said at the time that the main reason for the decline was the slump in popularity of hardback non-fiction titles such as celebrity and footballer biographies, which have been a huge money-spinner for the publishing industry in recent years. Waterstones said it has "communicated to its staff that a 90-day consultation period will begin shortly with those affected" by the planned redundancies. Retail and Consumer

Housing market 'turns corner' across whole country
Britain's housing market has finally "turned a corner", according to surveyors who report that rising prices and activity are no longer confined to the South East but are seen across the whole of the UK.
It's no longer just London that is experiencing a housing market recovery, say surveyors By Emma Rowley

House prices rose in July for a fourth consecutive month, marking their fastest growth since November 2006, according to surveyors polled monthly by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Significantly, they saw price growth across every region, not just the stronger market of London and around. Both the West Midlands and north-east England had seen their highest levels of interest amongst buyers for 14 years. For the West Midlands it was the highest level since the figures were first collected, in April 1999. Wales and Scotland also saw an increase. "It looks like at long last a recovery could be around the corner," said Peter Bolton King, global residential director at RICS, "Growth in buyer numbers and prices have been happening in some parts of the country since the beginning of the year but this is the first time that everywhere has experienced some improvement."
Elsewhere, lenders said mortgage loans to first-time buyers has reached the highest levels since before the financial crisis, while there was evidence of rising activity translating into higher prices. It came as official figures showed the average price of a flat has breached the £250,000 mark. Related Articles

In July, the number of people looking to move or buy for the first time grew at the fastest rate in four years, according to RICS. A net balance - the percentage of those seeing a rise in demand, against the percentage of those seeing a fall - of 53pc surveyors saw an increase. The figures reinforced the picture of a housing market recovery that is gaining momentum. Government help for the housing market is one reason for the pick-up in activity, said RICS. George Osborne announced his Help to Buy scheme in the Budget in a bid to kick-start the sluggish UK economy. Under the scheme the taxpayer lends buyers with a 5pc deposit up to 20pc of the value of new-build properties worth up to £600,000. RICS said mortgage availability has also been helped by the Funding for Lending (FLS) scheme, where banks can borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England, providing they lend it on to businesses or individuals. "We certainly feel that Funding for Lending has made a big difference," Mr Bolton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. He said the extension of the Help to Buy scheme from January to include help for buyers of existing homes will drive more growth in the housing market. The number of first-time buyers has hit its highest since 2007, according to high street lenders. A total of 68,200 people bought their first home in the second quarter of this year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported, the highest quarterly number seen since the financial crisis. On a monthly basis, lenders reported an increase in the amounts that were being loaned to first-timers. The average was £117,000 in June, up from £112,500 in May. That took the total value of loans advanced to first-time buyers in June to £3.5bn, up 40pc on a year ago. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said on Tuesday that Government initiatives are creating a "sustainable" boost in UK housing, as he unveiled figures showing reservations for new-build homes under the Help To Buy equity loan scheme had reached 10,000. Mr Pickles said the equity loan scheme was "giving the confidence to house builders to deliver and build more new homes" and that housebuilding was now at its highest level since 2008. Between October 2010 and October 2012, 319,000 additional homes across England were added to the supply, according to figures released by his Whitehall department, with more than 150,000 affordable homes added. Repossessions were also at a six-year low and mortgage arrears at their lowest since 2008, officials said. "This Government's package of measures to boost the housing market is working, with house building and housing supply on the up," Mr Pickles said. "The tough decisions we've taken to tackle the deficit left by the last administration and clear up the mess are now delivering a sustainable increase in housing and providing real help to hard-working people. "With over 10,000 reservations in four months, it's clear that the Help to Buy: Equity Loan is working well. By dealing with the big challenges, we are helping thousands of young people and families get on and move up the housing ladder, and Britain is building again."
But Labour pointed to the sluggish new build market, with only 101,920 new homes started to be built in the 12 months to March 2013, down by 3pc compared with the year before. Jack Dromey MP, Labour's Shadow Housing Minister, said this failure to build more “affordable homes the country needs means there is real concern that this scheme will do little to bring the cost of housing within the reach of low and middle income earners”. Local Government minister Brandon Lewis was pressed about the figures on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme. He said that what is “generally happening is good news”, but he accepted that it was “not a good thing” if prices were rising and not enough new homes were being built. He said: “If house prices are going up purely because we have not built enough homes, it delays getting people into a home, that in itself is not a good thing.”
He added that it was not as straightforward as “good news” or “bad news” because rising prices could also pull people out of negative equity, when the value of their home has been less than the mortgage on the property. There have been fears that Government schemes to people to buy new homes could cause an unsustainable housing bubble. Graeme Leach, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, has attacked the scheme and said it will “drive up prices”. He said last month: “The housing market needs help to supply, not help to buy and the extension of this scheme is very dangerous. Government guarantees will not increase the supply of homes, but they will drive up prices at a time when it seems likely that house prices are already over-valued.”
To buy a flat will now cost you an average £250,101 across England and Wales, according to the Land Registry. The high price of property in the capital, where flats can change hands for millions of pounds, appears to be driving that figure. Overall, flats account for 18pc of the total housing market. According to London Central Portfolio, investment advisors who crunched the data, the most expensive flat sold in the last quarter was in Kensington and Chelsea, at £13.25m. The numbers refer to the quarterly data from the Land Registry, which uses different methodology to its monthly house price index. Separately, the Legal & General Mortgage Club, an industry group for brokers, said July was the biggest month for mortgage completing in its 18-year history. - What next for house prices?

Tommy Smith
Tommy Smith, who has died aged 75, rode Jay Trump to victory in the Grand National in 1965 — the first time an American horse and rider had won the race.

Comments
Smith was an amateur, having his first and only ride in the National, and the eight-year-old Jay Trump’s odds were 100 to 6. In the field of 47 runners, Smith and Jay Trump proceeded cautiously on the first circuit. “A horse fell in front of me at the third fence,” the jockey said afterwards. “My horse stepped on the rider. It almost made me sick. I’ve never been in so much bedlam.”
On the second circuit they gradually made up ground, and were fighting the 7-2 favourite Freddie for the lead at the second last. Jumping the final fence, Jay Trump went a length clear, and hung on to prevail by three quarters of a length at the line. Only 14 horses finished.
Crompton Smith (always known as Tommy) was born on October 16 1937 at Middleburg, Virginia, the son of a dairy farmer. It is said that when Tommy was only six months old, his father strapped the infant into a basket saddle so he could join a hunt. Tommy’s grandfather, Harry Worcester Smith, a rich Massachusetts mill-owner, was a hunting fanatic whose principal ambition in life was to produce the first all-American winner of the Grand National.
In 1912 Harry and Crompton Smith Snr (Tommy’s father) sailed across the Atlantic in the Lusitania with 17 horses which they would stable in Ireland. The best of the horses would be ridden by Crompton in the 1913 National. But the plan went awry when Crompton broke a leg in a hunting accident, and Harry refused to consider using either an English or Irish jockey in his place. Harry died in 1945, his dream still unfulfilled.
The Grand National thus had resonance for Tommy from his earliest years — an illustrated map of the Aintree course hung above the fireplace in the drawing room of the family home at Middleburg. After attending Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, he went on to Princeton, but left to concentrate on his career as an amateur jockey, and at 21 won his first Maryland Hunt Cup.
In 1960 he was asked by Mary Stephenson, of Ohio, to find her a top-class steeplechaser, and he came up with Jay Trump, a failure on the Flat and bought for only $2,000 out of a seller. Trained and ridden by Tommy Smith, the horse won 11 races, including two Maryland Hunt Cups (1963 and 1964). Then, in July 1964, Jay Trump was sent to England, to the Lambourn yard of the trainer Fred Winter, to be prepared for the following year’s Grand National. Again ridden by Smith, Jay Trump won three of his five prep races. When the yard was hit by a coughing epidemic, the horse was isolated, tended lovingly by his jockey, and escaped infection.
Three months after the National, Smith and Jay Trump were leading at the last fence in the Grand Steeplechase de Paris at Auteuil (France’s premier steeplechase), but could finish only third. But in 1966 they won a third Maryland Hunt Cup, after which both horse and jockey retired.
Smith worked as a health care executive in Minnesota and Massachusetts, and in 1995 moved to Maryland to concentrate on training racehorses. In 2001 a horse he was riding tripped and Smith fell, leaving him a quadriplegic.
He is survived by his wife, Frances, and by a son and a daughter.
Tommy Smith, born October 16 1937, died March 5 2013

CJD doctors study throwaway surgical tools
By Celia Hall, Medical Editor
12:00AM GMT 05 Jan 2001
GOVERNMENT scientists are considering introducing disposable surgical instruments because of the possible risk of passing on the human form of mad cow disease.
A £200 million programme to modernise sterilisation equipment in the NHS was announced yesterday. Throwaway instruments are to be used in surgery to remove tonsils from this year and Prof Peter Smith, head of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, said the use of disposable instruments in a wider range of operations could be the next step.
"This is something that will have to be looked at over time. At the moment I have to stress there is a theoretical risk. Tonsillectomy is being used as a pilot study to some extent to see what the problems and the possibilities are. I think consideration will be given to whether it should be extended to other procedures."
Such a move would be extremely costly. The cost of using throwaway instruments in tonsil surgery is estimated to cost about £25 million a year. The £200 million investment will be used in England to modernise NHS decontamination and sterilisation units. It will allow the provision of fully-automated machines for cleaning surgical equipment.
John Denham, the health minister, said: "We have no evidence of any patient being infected with variant CJD in hospital. While we are still learning about the progress of vCJD, we should take precautions to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission to patients."

Libya: 'son of high-ranking official' raped woman detained in hotel A woman who has become the public face of Libyan oppression has said the son of a high-ranking official raped her. Link to this video
By Damien McElroy, Tripoli
5:34PM BST 27 Mar 2011

Moussa Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Libyan government, attempted on Sunday to allay fears for Iman al-Obeidi, who was arrested over the weekend after storming into a Tripoli hotel full of foreign journalists and making public accusations of torture and sexual abuse. Mr Ibrahim promised those responsible for alleged gang rape would be prosecuted. But he failed to honour a promise that the woman would be allowed to speak to journalists. Five men, including the son of a security force leader, who has not been named, have since been arrested. Mr Ibrahim on Sunday implied the woman was forced to earn a living from prostitution. A party with a group of men she had previously known went wrong last week after she was forced to drink alcohol. "We asked her why she was making a political issue of this and unfortunately one of the young men who had raped her was the son of a high-ranking person working for the state," he said yesterday.

Libyan woman says regime's men raped and tortured her
26 Mar 2011
"It is unfortunate but it seems that she has a young child and is living with her sister after a divorce. It seems that she has to making a living by partying with men." "Look at what Gaddafi's militias did to me," Miss Obeidi told journalists at the weekend. "Look at what happens – Gaddafi's militiamen kidnap women at gunpoint, and rape them – they rape them." Although Miss Obiedi lives in Tripoli, she suggested her connections to the rebel-held east had prompted the attack. Powerful military defectors, Gen Abdulfattah Younis al-Obeidi and Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi. are prominent supporters of the uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi. She said: "Easterners – we're all Libyan brothers, we are supposed to be treated the same."
The incident provided a stark example to the cordoned-off press corps of the oppressive regime's readiness to use force against ordinary people with grievances. One official brandished a pistol and a waitress in the Rixos hotel coffee shop brandished a table knife before attempting to put a bag over Miss Obeidi's head. The woman, who appears to be in her thirties, had cuts to her face and thighs. Mr Moussa said she had spoken with a social worker and an activist with the government-backed Libyan Human Rights Commission. Ordinary Libyans who learned of the incident from satellite television have applauded Miss Obeidi's courage in confronting a system that metes out harsh punishment and torture to those that challenge its enforcers. "Did you she her?" asked one Tripoli resident. "She had the courage to show how bad conditions in Libya are under Gaddafi."
The government has promised to arrange a meeting between Miss Obiedi and female correspondents should her sister and other family members agree. "She is keen to meet with the press to explain all this but her family must agree. It's a very local thing – a custom in Arab society that the family must give their consent," Mr Ibrahim said. Khaled Kiam, Libya's deputy foreign minister, said the complaint against the men would be investigated fully. One apparent complication is that Miss Obeidi refused to undergo a medical examination to establish her rape claims. Libya News

Ravi Bopara and Neil Dexter put Essex in cruise mode against Gloucestershire
Essex (279 & 150-2) need 31 runs to beat Gloucestershire (275 & 184) By Christopher Lyles at Chelmsford 12:29AM BST 25 Jul 2008
Comments
Essex will return today with victory all but assured after an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 143 between Ravi Bopara, who batted beautifully for his 83 from 98 balls, and Neil Dexter knocked the stuffing out of Gloucestershire.
The home side claimed the extra half-hour, but scoring 64 runs in nine overs was always going to be a stiff requirement. And Gloucestershire, who were walking off the field at the end of the normal day's play before being recalled by the umpires, most certainly made their feelings clear in a tetchy 30 minutes, for Essex made no effort to go for the runs. And the visitors certainly had a point.
Still, Dexter scored his first half-century for Essex since joining on loan from Kent last month while Bopara has now failed to record a fifty in only one of his eight Championship games this season. That Essex required what could have been a testing target was due to four dropped catches that allowed Kadeer Ali and Steve Snell to take root in an obdurate seventh-wicket partnership that 85 runs.
David Masters had them both pouched at second slip with the second new ball before Danish Kaneria, who was below his best on a pitch that continued to offer generous turn, mopped up the tail to finish with his 16th five-wicket haul for Essex in 37 Championship matches. Related Articles

James Cracknell begins the Marathon des Sables
James Cracknell is running the Marathon des Sables, dubbed ‘the toughest footrace on earth', covering approximately 150 miles of the Sahara Desert in Morocco over six days to raise money for Mencap. He is recording his progress in a daily video blog. 11:55AM BST 05 Apr 2010
Comments
"It's all about the long day" - that was the last piece of advice I was given before stage one of the Marathon des Sables. The long day is stage four. So the aim today was to take steady, leaving something in the tank for the double marathon over the finest sand dunes Morocco has to offer. Obviously those plans went out the window on the start after two days packing and repacking my backpack and now with helicopters buzzing over head it turned into a 30km race not stage one of six. Hence at the first checkpoint I was just outside the top 10. I was feeling pretty good but the first batch of dunes were ahead. Five minutes later my speed had dropped 25 per cent and my heart rate risen by the same amount. Not great for motivation but in these long races there is always someone worse off and today that was Julio from Spain who cramped up 100 metres from the finish line hence my appearance for at least one day in the top 10.
