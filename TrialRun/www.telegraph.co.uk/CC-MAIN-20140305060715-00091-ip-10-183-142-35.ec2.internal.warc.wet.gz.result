Rose Prince's Baking Club: jam tarts
Our weekly column shows you the way to beautiful bread and consummate cake. Today: jam tarts Sweet success: jam tarts are a reliable way to finish off last year's jam Photo: Andrew Crowley	By Rose Prince

It might still be the fallow period for soft fruit, but we are furiously eating jam in order to clear the shelves in time for the summer berry glut. No matter how meticulously we plan to make enough jam for the year (plus a little more to give away as presents), there always seem to be half-a-dozen pots left sullenly on the shelf. It is a sad fact that once the new season's jam is made, last year's will remain at the back of the cupboard like the proverbial old hat. April and May then become the season of jammy puddings; yet, as the weather warms up, the concept of a roly-poly or steamed sponge with jam seems too heavy. Queen of Puddings is a lighter, meringue-topped, eggy-breadcrumb-based dessert that will use up a good quantity of raspberry, strawberry or blackcurrant jam. So will a Bakewell tart, in an understated way, with a thin layer underlying its almond sponge. My thoughts, however, have turned to jam tarts, a pastry that has been around for centuries but lately fallen into decline. I have never bought a jam tart that did not coat the roof of my mouth with clods of dry pastry crumbs, and which was not filled with a low-grade jellylike substance. Time to revisit, I decide, taking a jar of my mother-in-law's excellent raspberry jam off the shelf. It seems to make sense to use unsweetened pastry for jam tarts when their contents are full of sugar, so the short pastry recipe I now rely on to line tart dishes or make a pie is the one to use. This is a pastry with a high butter content that can be rolled thin, and never shrinks. For this reason, it can also be trimmed to make a pretty rickrack edge with the use of a knife or an angled pastry cutter. The pastry cases must be baked blind before the jam is added. This will not add much time or trouble to the process, but it ensures the pastry is very crisp after the second baking with the jam inside. Related Articles

Makes 12
Equipment – 1 bun tray For the pastry 185g/6 ¼ oz plain flour 125g/4 ½ oz unsalted butter, from the fridge About 50ml/2 fl oz water For the filling: 350g/12oz high fruit (preferably home-made) blackcurrant, raspberry, strawberry, apricot or other jam Sift the plain flour into a bowl. Cut the butter into dice and add to the flour. Lightly rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the water then mix to a dough, first with a wooden spoon then knead lightly with your hands on a worktop dusted very lightly with flour. Do not overwork the dough or the butter will warm up and the dough become greasy. Due to dry ambient conditions, or to the moisture content in the flour itself, you may need to add more water to make a smooth malleable dough. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a plastic bag or wrap in cling film, then refrigerate for 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll into a large disc on a floured worktop. Roll very thin, until almost transparent. Use a 9cm/3 ½in-10cm/4in round cutter to make 12 discs (you may need to reroll the pastry a second time). Use a knife or the point of another pastry cutter (I have used a "star" cutter) to trim the edges, making a frill – this is optional. Line the holes in the bun tray with the pastry discs, then place a circle of baking parchment in each. Do not use greaseproof paper, because it sticks to pastry. Place a few baking beans (dried haricot beans will do) in each tart case and bake blind for 10-12 minutes until the edges are dry and pale gold. Remove from the oven and take out the paper and beans. Fill three-quarters full with jam and place back in the oven. Bake until the jam begins to bubble and the edges are golden. Take out of the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before removing from the tin. Eat when completely cool – these tarts will keep for two days. Your letters
Making a sourdough starter and baking sourdough bread remains a hot topic among Baking Club followers (column, April 8). Having made the starter, Peter Schedler writes to ask if it must be used all the time: "Once the starter is made, can one keep it for a week or more before using it? "If so, should one keep it in a fridge, in the freezer or in a closed container at room temperature until such time as one has enough time to go ahead and actually make the bread according to your recipe?"
Once you have an active starter, it must be either "fed" or refreshed with a little flour and water, but you do not need to use it. Just keep in the fridge between refreshment, or use in baking. I find that the freezer kills some of the yeasts although other bakers swear a sourdough can be stored in the freezer. Recipes

Council leader abused wife for a decade and then shot her dead
The leader of a Conservative council abused his wife for a decade before shooting them both dead, and was able to get away with it because authorities were "blinded by his public image".
Council leader Keith Johnson at an event with his wife, Andrea Photo: ALBANPIX	By Claire Carter
6:51PM BST 24 Sep 2013
Follow Keith Johnson, 58, shot his wife Andrea, 44, with her own shotgun at their home, before he turned the gun on himself, after leaving explicit instructions for their funerals, an inquest heard. A report into the deaths warned opportunities to spot abuse can be missed because of people's public persona and perceptions about affluent areas not having domestic violence issues, after a diary written by Mrs Johnson was found and revealed she had suffered years of abuse from her husband - which was never picked up on. Mr Johnson, leader of North Norfolk District Council and former Cromer mayor, killed his wife in December at their bungalow near Cromer in Norfolk. The inquest heard the pair had both had affairs, and Mr Johnson had asked his wife to come home after throwing her out the day before, lying in wait with a gun. Norfolk Coroners’ Court heard how a diary kept by Mrs Johnson since 2004 explained how he would “change like the devil” and recorded incidents where he beat her. A Domestic Violence Homicide Review was published after the inquest, and looked at how police, health authorities and other organisations were involved. Related Articles

It found that despite being treated for depression and attempting suicide no one asked Mrs Johnson about abuse because “they had not received training to identify the signs and did not have the confidence to ask".
The report found: * Mrs Johnson was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital after trying to kill herself in 2006 by taking an overdose of anti-depressants and alcohol. She told staff she was having “marital problems” and had had an affair, but didn’t mention domestic violence. This information was not passed onto her GP. * In 2007 she had sessions with mental health staff and saw her GP 10 times, but her medical notes didn’t mention relationship problems or domestic abuse. * Mrs Johnson had regular appointments with her GP. The report notes that her husband was often at these appointments, and states: “This would have impinged on any opportunity she may have wished to take to discuss her health or relationship candidly with her GP had she wanted.”
* In 2011 Mrs Johnson called police asking for help. But when officers arrived Mr Johnson said he would sort it out and his wife later told them it was only a verbal altercation. The report found police followed procedure, insisting they talk to her on her own, but in her diary after the incident she wrote: “He hit me a lot. He went to town."
* She told two relatives that she had been hit around the head so hard she was worried “that it had affected her hearing for a while; she thought her eardrum had been damaged". But the report said neither of her relatives knew how to report domestic abuse. The report, which refers to the couple only as A and B, found that the incident could not have been predicted but said: “There is a tendency to think that domestic abuse does not happen in affluent areas and it does not happen in relationships such as Mrs A's and Mr B's. "This case graphically demonstrates how the public face of an individual can be very different to the one behind closed doors. "The phrase 'it doesn't happen here' needs to be dispelled and information needs to be available across the county for professionals, families, friends and colleagues to help them identify domestic abuse."
Coroner William Armstrong concluded that Mrs Johnson suffered an unlawful death while Mr Johnson killed himself. He said: "These deaths could not have been foreseen by the police, by medical professionals or anybody else concerned."
In a statement after the inquest, Dr Alasdair Lennox, a GP based in Cromer, said it was not unusual for partners to accompany each other to appointments. He said: “We are very sorry and sad to learn that Mrs Johnson had experienced domestic abuse and nobody could have anticipated this would have happened. This is a tragic case and we must learn to recognise the warning signs of domestic violence and to respond quickly to women and men who need help.”
Norfolk Police said it had "reviewed" processes in relation to domestic violence following the report. They added: "As a result of the review, we believe that Andrea suffered domestic abuse over an extended period of time and it is, perhaps, one of the biggest tragedies of all that she never felt able to disclose this to people who could have helped protect her."
Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust, responsible for mental health services, said it had also introduced "new policies" for greater awareness of domestic violence since 2007. Law and Order
