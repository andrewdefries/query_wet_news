The ultimate garden sale: family sells off entire contents of stately home
An aristocratic family are auctioning off the entire contents of their stately home in a garden sale so they can downsize to a normal family house. Jenny and William Copeland, owners of the Trelissick House in Feock Photo: SWNS	By Rosa Silverman

The Cunliffe-Copeland family have lived in Trelissick House in Cornwall for generations, filling it with treasures acquired on their travels around the world. Having decided to move to somewhere more modest, however, William Copeland and his wife Jennifer will no longer have room for their collection of antiques. They are holding a two-day sale of ancient ornaments, paintings, furniture, jewellery, silverware, books, rugs and wine in the grounds of their 18th century manor near Truro on July 23 and 24. The auction is expected to generate up to £1.5 million and there is no reserve price on many of the items, meaning almost everything must go. The most expensive item on sale is a Chinese Imperial vase made for emperor Quinlong in the 18th century and now worth £100,000. Related Articles

World’s most valuable Alfa Romeo to be sold at auction
02 Jul 2013
A George II mahogany desk is valued at £30,000, while a pair of 18th century walnut side tables is expected to fetch £30,000. A Victorian silver candelabra is thought to be worth around £7,000 and an ornate 10-piece silver dessert service from the same period is valued at £25,000. The sale also includes what is said to be the largest and most important collection of Spode ceramics in private hands anywhere in the world. Mr Copeland's great-grandfather, Leonard Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, began the collection in the late 19th century. Mr Copeland said: "My great-grandfather had very fine tastes and collected many works of art from his travels in Europe and further afield. "We have been guardians of these fine works for a number of years and now that we are moving locally it is time to pass them on for others to enjoy." Ida Copeland, Leonard Cunliffe’s stepdaughter, inherited Trelissick and in 1955 gave 376 acres of the gardens, parkland and woods to the National Trust, retaining use of the house for the Copeland family. Richard Hird from Bonhams Auctioneers marks up items from the extensive collection (SWNS)
The sale this month is being categorised on the basis of which room the relics have been displayed or stored in. From the wine cellar there are 11 bottles of 1990 Chateau Palmer for £1,200, two bottles of a 1906 St Lheurine Petite Champagne Cognac for £1,500 and three bottles of a single malt whisky from 1935 for £1,200. The attic includes three pairs of wooden skis dating from the turn of the 20th century, while in an outbuilding on the 375-acre estate there is a 15ft wooden open day boat that was built in 1925 and used to sail on the nearby Fal Estuary. Roger Tappin of Bonhams, the auctioneer organising the sale, said it was a rare opportunity to buy something from a stately home. He said: "You could have two or three of these sales a year per auction house back in the 1960s. "After the war, a lot of these estates fell into disrepair and the owners didn't have the funds to do the work and so they were sold off with everything in it. "Stately homes in private ownership like Trelissick are becoming scarcer and these sales now are as rare as hen's teeth.” A pair of decorated Iznik water bottles from Trelissick sold for £757,500 in a separate sale of Islamic art in April.

Valentina Lisitsa, Royal Albert Hall, review
Pianist Valentina Lisitsa played with an urgent intensity which explains how she has racked up 43 million hits on YouTube, writes Ivan Hewett. 3

Comments
Valentina Lisitsa, born in Ukraine but now living in America, is officially the web’s favourite classical pianist. Her YouTube site has had 43 million visitors, which is probably a thousand times more listeners than the great virtuosos of the past reached in their entire lifetimes. It was clear that the promoters had tried hard to make this Albert Hall concert as close to the YouTube experience as possible. Two big screens carried close-up images of Lisitsa, and at every possible opportunity these were replaced by a publicity photo, which like all publicity photos was glamorous and anonymous. They were almost comically inapt, as Lisitsa is neither glamorous nor anonymous. She came on to wild applause, cracked a joke about the Ukraine-England football match (at that moment under way) in an accent you could have cut with a knife, clearly nervous and anxious to get to the keyboard. Those were the only words we heard from her. She didn’t emote verbally about each piece à la James Rhodes, and when she played she didn’t strike flamboyant Lisztian poses like Lang Lang. Instead she sat hunched over the keyboard, smiling to herself as if oblivious to us and the live audience on her YouTube channel. It soon became clear Lisitsa is a serious artist. She’d chosen a hugely taxing programme, book-ended with two Liszt showpieces. She played these with urgent intensity and a feeling for their sudden moments of pathos, which lifted them out of their showpiece status. Her essential attribute is a fevered urgency, an almost desperate desire to suck the expressive marrow from a piece. Related Articles

Wagner: Die Walküre, CD review
15 Jun 2012
Joined to her iron-clad technique (Lisitsa is no wunderkind – she’s now 39, and has been practising hard since she was three), this often engendered a huge emotional charge, as in Liszt’s arrangement of Schubert’s Erlkonig. At the other end of the scale, the middle movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata was beautifully remote and poised, as if made from porcelain. Not everything worked so well. Chopin’s C minor Nocturne was one of several pieces whose subtlety was dissipated in febrility. This showed Lisitsa’s strength is also her weakness, in the sense that she identifies too much with each passing moment. She needs to take a more balanced view, temper her passion with a little distance and irony. But that may not be so immediately gratifying, either for herself or her millions of YouTube fans. This concert is now available for pre-order as a digital release on the Decca label, appearing June 25. The CD will be released on 3 July.

Britain at War Readers' Memories
Britain at War: Exchange with a German student
I was born 21.12.1923 and was therefore just 14 at the time of Munich. I had just started my second year at Charterhouse. In those days the school year commenced at the end of September.
3:31PM BST 21 Oct 2008
My sister, who has just celebrated her 90th birthday, had been enjoying an exchange visit with a German student and returned to England the day before Mr Chamberlain made his first flight to Germany to meet Hitler. During the month of August, Hjaho had been staying with us. My brother and I would greet Hjaho every morning with “Heil Hitler”. On the third morning he said very seriously, “I have heard “Heil Hitler” more often in your house than in my father’s house.” They were not Nazi supporters.
We were totally unprepared for war. No precautions against air attack, no gas masks, civil defence etc. – we did not think war possible. At the last moment we at Charterhouse were aware that war was possible, and that the air raid shelters, which we had helped construct, were inadequate. Everything seemed to happen so quickly that you had no time to think.
After the flight to Munich and Chamberlain’s return to England with “Peace in our time,” there were differing opinions. Some felt the humiliation of surrender; others felt that Sudeten Land was far too far away for us to be involved in a further war.
Germany had been rearming since 1933 and had shown their power in support of France. Our rearmament program was just starting. Related Articles

31 Oct 2008
On balance, Munich was thought to be right, provided that we never repeated it, we rearmed and became a power in military terms, able to command respect and able to defend ourselves against Germany.

More snow on the way as train and flight delays continue to cause havoc
More heavy snow will hit Britain today as commuters struggle to work amid further train cancellations, flight delays and road closures. Trains travel in and out of Victoria station in front of Battersea Power Station Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Alice Philipson
8:21AM GMT 22 Jan 2013
Northern England could see up to 10cms of snow while 2cms is expected to fall in East Anglia. Tonight, around 6cms will fall in southern England, forecasters predicted. The heavy snow and frost have so far claimed the lives of three people, including a postman who Royal Mail last night confirmed died while carrying out his rounds during the weekend's freezing temperatures. The snow and ice has led to further delays at airports and on the rail network today. Five Eurostar trains have been cancelled, while Gatwick Express trains are also subject to delays and cancellations. Related Articles

Snow travel chaos: as it happened
21 Jan 2013
Greater Anglia trains to and from Stansted airport may be running up to 60 minutes late and Southern is running an amended timetable. East Coast services are subject to disruption and there are delays of up to 40 minutes to trains between London Kings Cross and Berwick-upon-Tweed / Hull / Leeds. Heathrow airport is fully operational today but it warned passengers to expect delays and cancellations. Gatwick has also said delays are possible. Temperatures reached as low as -11C in Buckinghamshire overnight with many places struggling to rise above freezing today. Icy conditions on the roads will create hazardous conditions for drivers, the Met Office warned yesterday. The AA has said breakdowns were being reported yesterday at a rate of around 2,000 an hour with the busiest areas being the Midlands, London, the South West and the South East. Total call-outs numbered more than 17,000. Three people have died in the severe weather. John Bircham died on Saturday during his collection on Exmoor, Somerset, after 25 years of service as a postman. It is thought he suffered a heart attack while trying to free his van from snow. It is thought a 25-year-old woman died after collapsing in the snow on her way home in sub-zero temperatures following a night out. Bernadette Lee was discovered in the front garden of the house next to her sister's by a man walking his dog on Sunday at 7.30am in Church Meadows, Deal, Kent. Kent Police are investigating the cause of death but there are reports she had no visible injuries and was found without a coat. A man was killed in another weather-related incident when the car he was driving left the road and crashed into a tree on the A12 in Essex last night. It comes after four people died in an avalanche as they descended Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe on Saturday afternoon. A further two people survived. Elsewhere, a teenager remains critically ill in hospital after being injured while sledging in Middlesbrough. The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings as rain falling on to frozen surfaces increases the risk of ice. Amber warnings remain in place for heavy snow across the higher ground of north-east England and eastern Scotland while yellow warnings are in place for ice and snow across parts of South Wales and western England. A forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: "With more snow coming today, we can expect more disruption. "This morning we will see up to 10cm in snow in Scotland, northern England and around 2cm in East Anglia followed by more snow this evening in southern England – maybe up to 6cm. "Temperatures were very low overnight, as low as -11.3 in Buckinghamshire, and will be low again tonight with many places struggling to stay above freezing during the day. "The rest of the week will see widespread frost and showers." Weather

To the Chinese, pandas represent love, happiness, warmth and nature. Jian Qin, founder of the first panda-themed hotel says the venture is an opportunity to promote the panda spirit to the whole world and raise awareness for the protection of the environment. All the hotel's facilities are related to pandas, including the slippers, towels and pyjamas, and the staff wear giant panda suits.
Mr Qin believes pandas are not just for China to enjoy but the whole world. He told The Telegraph he hopes to open another panda-themed hotel in London if the first one is a success.
