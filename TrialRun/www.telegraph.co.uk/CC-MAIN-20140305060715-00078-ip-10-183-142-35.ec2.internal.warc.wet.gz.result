The Big Gypsy Eviction, BBC One, review
Catherine Gee reviews BBC One's contentious documentary The Big Gypsy Eviction, following the UK's largest Irish Traveller campsite's battle against eviction. Irish travellers Mimi Sheridan and Mary Ann McCarthy in The Big Gypsy Eviction Photo: BBC	By Catherine Gee

As we learned earlier this year following Channel 4’s Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, Irish Travellers pull in high ratings. The brash, extravagant ceremonies with severe fake tans and dresses that could weigh 30-40 kg attracted 8million viewers a week. Tonight filmmaker Richard Parry gave us a rather more sober documentary – The Big Gypsy Eviction (BBC One). For six years he filmed Dale Farm, the largest settlement in the UK, near Basildon in Essex, as its inhabitants attempted to fight off eviction. They own the land but, because it is green belt, half of them don’t have planning permission to have built on there. Basildon council had repeatedly voted to expel them. The Travellers, on the other hand, were making the process as difficult as possible. The Travellers themselves accepted Parry warmly – and, when around people they see as friendly, they do seem a welcoming, sociable group. However, as we learned, one local resident, the vocal Len Gridley whose house backs on to the campsite, had lost £300,000 from the value of his house. He was of the opinion that if he took £300,000 of the Travellers’ money they might kill him. The Traveller community is a tight one and it has been on the site for 10 years so it’s easy to see why they don’t want to leave – especially considering no other council would willingly take them on. Those who live in the nearby village of Cray’s Hill were adamant, however, that they wanted them out. As we saw towards the end of the programme, because the Travellers are so determined to fight for their campsite, it would cost £8 million of local authority money to evict them.

It was clear that Parry had become fond of the community. Allegations of of sexism, tax-dodging, violence, truantism and the various other complaints regularly directed at Travellers were either ignored or mentioned but not dwelt upon. There was clearly an attempt at balance in the documentary but in the end the impression was favourable. It was hard to ignore the tense, aggressive atmosphere. “There’s going to be a lot of lives lost,” said Mimi Sheridan, referring to the stockpile of petrol and gas canisters they planned to use against the bailiffs when the time came. Indeed, many times we saw the Travellers correct themselves or backtrack when they commented on the violence they saw coming and what they wanted to do to the people who wanted them gone. The whole programme led up to a big expected showdown between bailiffs and the Travellers of Dale Farm that never arrived as the deadline for the eviction is not until August. Why Parry chose to end his film early is not clear – perhaps he was overeager to get it on the television, or perhaps he had his own deadline. The result may be greater pressure on Basildon Council to reverse their decision. Either way we can be sure it won’t be pretty. TV and Radio

Debt crisis: as it happened, June 11, 2012
Spain faces supervision by international lenders after a €100bn bailout for its banks, EU and German officials said, contradicting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy who had insisted the cash came without such strings.

• Spanish, Italian bond yields climb above 6pc
• Cyprus may request bailout by end of June
• Spanish loans to be monitored by EU and IMF
• Spain to be handed around €100bn to save banks
• Osborne warned not to blame eurozone for weak UK
Latest 20.08 We're closing off the live blog for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow. I'll leave you with this interesting fact, courtesy of Paul Waugh over at Politics Home:
Twitter: Paul Waugh - No country in the eurozone has yet to beat a country from outside the eurozone #euro2012 #politicaltrivia
Goodnight.
19.17 Spain will not face more belt tightening in return for its €100bn bail-out, according to Olli Rehn, the EU's economic affairs commissioner. Speaking in the European Parliament, he said: Policy conditionality will focus on the financial and banking sector [...] There will be no new conditions on fiscal policy and structural reforms because these issues are dealt with under the reinforced economic governance and there, the normal policy conditionality applies.
18.31 Dennis Lockhart, the chairman of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, has described the Spanish bank bail-out as "good news," but that markets were still expecting more detail on the bail-out. On the possibility of QE3, Mr Lockhart said that more money printing wasn't needed "quite yet". However, he added that no policy tool should be taken off the table just yet. 18.11 Spain has issued a statement saying that it has sought a €100bn bailout. No news there, obviously, but there's an interesting line towards the end which shows its intention to keep selling (or attempting to sell) bonds: The details on this financial assistance package will be established in coordination with our European partners and duly communicated to the market. In this context, the Spanish Treasury reaffirms its commitment to capital markets, and will therefore continue to execute its funding programme through its regular auction calendar.
17.50 S&P says that Spain's bank bailout won't have an immediate impact on its rating: The Spanish government's decision to seek up to €100bn from eurozone member states to recapitalise its banks has no immediate effect on our ratings on Spain. 17.12 Reuters reports that eurozone finance ministers have discussed imposing capital controls in a "worst-case plan" for a Grexit. This would also involve temporary stringent border controls and a limit for cash machine withdrawals. But sources were keen to stress that it was contingency planning, not planning for an expected event... 16.47 European markets breathed a sigh of relief as it appeared that Spain would be saved by a bailout, sending stocks soaring this morning. At one point the FTSE 100 hit a high of 5,536 and Spanish 10-year yields came back under 6pc. But it wasn't to last: reality set in after lunch and shares first gave up their gains, then slipped into the red. Spain's yield climbed all the way to 6.465pc and Italy's rose to 6.004pc. The FTSE 100 lost 0.05pc, the CAC dipped 0.29pc and Spain's IBEX slipped 0.54pc. Italy's FTSE MIB tumbled 2.79pc. Only the DAX escaped the gloom, gaining a modest 0.17pc on the day. Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex, gives us her take: The markets have whimpered to the finish line today after a bout of knee jerk euphoria post the announcement of the Spanish banking bailout at the weekend. The markets haven’t perceived the bailout as way to reduce credit risk in the periphery, in fact Spanish bond yields rose to their highest level since the end of May as investors digested the prospect they may not get all of their money back in the event of a Spanish default. And it didn’t stop there. Italian 10-year yields are rising at an alarming rate, and have ended the European session above 6pc, for the first time since January.
16.31 Fitch downgraded Spain this month, and now it's moved in to take a swipe at two of its struggling banks: BBVA and Santander. Both have been cut from A to BBB+, with a negative outlook into the bargain to suggest that it could be taken even further. 15.25 Britain could be on the way to leaving the EU, suggests Tim Bale, Professor of Politics and European Studies at Sussex University. In a blog post for the LSE he argues that the Conservatives may need to promise the UK a referendum on EU membership at the next election, and Labour may have to follow suit. I never thought I would write this sentence but here goes: the UK is on the road to leaving the EU. This doesn’t mean that it will happen – there are too many powerful interests with a stake in continued membership for that. But it does mean that it might. The Tories are moving, seemingly inexorably, from ‘soft’ Euroscepticism (a critique of the EU and how it currently functions) towards ‘hard’ Euroscepticism (the belief that membership of the EU is inimical to the national interest). And in David Cameron they have a leader who, ever since he made and then honoured his rash promise to pull Tory MEPs out of the EPP-ED group in Brussels, seems unwilling or unable to tell them ‘no’.
15.07 Reuters is reporting (from an unnamed source, so far from concrete) that the Spanish bailout is likely to come from the existing EFSF, rather than the ESM which comes into being in a few weeks. They're similar bailout pots, but there are some subtle differences... An ESM bailout could potentially raise Spain's borrowing costs in the long run, as the loan would take precedence over private investors for repayment in the event of a default. But an EFSF loan would involve troika inspectors and demand the approval of other eurozone nations. Twitter: Fabrizio Goria - RTRS: Spanish bank recapitalisation likely to be in EFSF bonds, similar to Greek recapitalisation
Twitter: Fabrizio Goria - RTRS: Spanish bailout could later be taken over by the ESM, but extended loans would not become to other debt
Twitter: Faisal Islam - So a month after ECB President basically describes the EFSF as badly designed failure, it is now primary instrument in Spanish bank bailout
14.42 The US markets have opened for the week, catching up with the latest situation on Europe's markets to make cautious gains on the Spanish bailout announcement, tempered by concern over upcoming Greek elections. The Dow Jones is up 0.56pc in early trading, the S&P 500 by 0.53pc and the Nasdaq has gained 0.59pc. 14.31 With a couple of hours trading left in Europe, the relief rally kicked-off by Spain's request for a bailout is winding down, but still remains firmly in positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up just 0.68pc, the CAC is 1.19pc higher and the DAX has gained 1.7pc. Spain's IBEX is up 1.95pc at 6676, having hit a high earlier in the day of 6937. Twitter: Katie Martin - What's the saying? It's like wetting your pants at the North Pole? Feels warm for a bit, but soon leaves you in even more trouble. #spailout
14.10 A pithy response to Spain's agreement and a potential request from Cyprus for bail-out funds from strategist Lorcan Roche Kelly: Twitter: Lorcan Roche Kelly - Well done everyone for getting their bailout demands in ahead of the Greek election
13.55 While Spain scrabbles to help its banks and investors start worrying about Italy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is still pursuing the issue of the financial transaction tax - and plans to discuss it at a summit with France, Spain and Italy later this month. Her spokesman Steffen Seibert said Germany "is not the only one in Europe that can decide when such a tax would come" but insisted: "We will be campaigning for it hard." The UK remains opposed to such a a tax on an EU-wide basis, saying it would have a disproportionate hit on the City of London as Europe's largest financial centre. 13.40 A domino effect seems to be in action - Cyprus has hinted today it may need to aply for a bailout before the end of June, for both its banks and its government funds. Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said: The issue is urgent. We know the recapitalisation of the (island's) banks must be completed by June 30, and there are a few days left. One of the country's biggest lenders, Cyprus Popular Bank, has been very hard hit by its exposure to the already bailed-out Greece, and Cyprus has been under pressure to apply for aid to prop up the bank. Cyrpus is due to take on the rotating EU presidency for six months on July 1, which could lead to embarrassment if the issue is not resolved. 13.30 Spanish newspaper El Mundo is reporting a fairly extraordinary set of text messages between PM Mariano Rajoy and the country's finance minister during the bank bialout negotiations this weekend. According to El Mundo editor Pablo Rodriguez, Mr Rajoy texted Luis de Guindos: "Resist, we are the 4th power of the EZ. Spain is not Uganda."
A follow-up message has been translated as: We are powerful, and if they don't give in, the whole thing will go down. It will cost Europe 500 billion if Spain goes bust, and then another 700 billion if Italy goes bust. Did Mr Guindos (below) take this advice on board when he was at the negotiating table? 13.25 Sport and politics - a little bit of late-lunch eurozone levity, thanks to Twitter: Twitter: Fabrizio Goria - NWO RT @bill_easterly: Spain's Rafael Nadal wins French Open, then forced to listen to German national anthem
13.15 Here's more detail of what will be in the terms of Spain's bank bailout - this time on the interest rates likely to be charged. European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said it would be "reasonable" to charge a rate of 3-4pc on a rescue loan for Spain's banks. He told public television station TVE: It is premature to talk about interest rates, you cannot talk about a definite rate since it will depend on market conditions. But, yes, percentages of 3pc or 4pc are reasonable for these operations.
13.00 Here is what has happened to Spanish 10-year bond yields over the last week - this morning's delight was short-lived... 12.20 And a bit more from Bruno Waterfield on that inspection of Spain's finances by EU and IMF officials: Twitter: Bruno Waterfield - #eurozone EU source - eurogroup content with Spain's macro-economic policy for now but 'it's only the beginning'
12.10 The other detail on the Spanish bailout now coming through is on which EU fund will stump up the money. A German government spokesman said the permanent ESM fund, which comes into effect on July 1, is mos likely to be the source. Martin Kotthaus said: The ESM is a more likely option than the EFSF... The ESM is in almost every regard more effective than the EFSF.
It will depend when Spain submits its formal application for financial aid whether the ESM is used, Mr Kotthaus said. 12.00 Bruno Waterfield, our man in Brussels, is reporting details of how a Spanish bank bailout might be arranged, via Twitter. It looks like it will indeed involve supervision by the EU, ECB and IMF, meaning it is more similar to the other bailouts than it at first seemed: Twitter: Bruno Waterfield - #eurozone 'EU official' - Spanish MOU will include monitoring of reforms by EC, ECB and IMF
Twitter: Bruno Waterfield - #eurozone Spain - If looks llike a troika, has same people as troika, is it a troika? Not if you're a commisison official
11.50 Spanish shares are still up, but not nearly as spectacularly as first thing this morning, when they jumped close to 6pc. The IBEX index is now up 2.5pc, while yields on 10-year government bonds have gone back above 6pc. David Jones from IG Index explains why the 'bailout bounce' will only be temporary: 11.45 The OECD has some fairly gloomy predictions out this morning - the economic think tank's latest leading indicators show the pace of growth in China and India starting to falter and the eurozone economy continuing to suffer as a result of the debt crisis. The OECD said its composite leading indicator (CLI) for China, which provides a measure of future economic activity, slipped to 99.1 from 99.4 in April, falling further below its long-term average of 100. The CLI for India also showed signs of weakening, dropping to 98.0 from 98.2, again below the 100 average. The euro area, meanwhile, remained stable at 99.6, as did France, while Italy inched down to 99.1 from 99.2, as ongoing debt troubles in Europe continued to keep economic growth below long-term trend. The CLI for Germany was also unchanged at 99.4. Britain's, however, inched up to 99.8 from 99.7 but remained below its long-term average. 11.30 As reported in our 07.40 post, George Osborne has come under fire from some MPs on his own side for blaming the eurozone crisis for the continuing recession in the UK. Our commentator Jeremy Warner says in fact neither the eurozone, austerity measures nor lack of supply-side reform are to blame. The true reason why Britain's economic recovery has lagged other G7 nations lies somewhere else – it's almost wholly down to still subdued household consumption. Household spending has failed to recover as robustly from the post Lehman crash as in other major economies. The current process of adjustment in household spending back to a more sustainable, income dependent, path has in all probability still got several more years to run, so we can expect demand in the UK economy to remain weak for quite a while yet, almost regardless of what happens in the eurozone and the degree of structural reform the Government engages in. Up to a point, Osborne is right that there is little he can do about the present economic funk, but he's chosen the wrong target as an alibi. It's not the eurozone, much of which after years of living high on the hog actually faces the same problem as the UK in adjusting to a lower overall standard of living, but the toxic legacy of over indebtedness left him by the last Government.
11.20 Cold water has been poured on Ireland's hopes for a renegotiation of its bailout - also designed to row out banks which had taken on too much debt in a property boom - following the agreement with Spain. The Irish Times reports this morning that because the money will not go directly to Spain's banks but be guaranteed by the government, it does not open the way for Ireland to receive direct bank aid too, removing onerous terms on the Irish state. 11.05 Questions are already being asked about Italy, following Spain's agreement to a bank bailout over the weekend. And Italian politicians are already giving the idea short shrift: Italy has "already done what was needed to save itself," said industry minister Corrado Passera. 11.00 Well, that didn't last long - Spanish bond yields are now back over 6pc, trading at 6.2pc now. 10.00 The price of oil has also had a boost today - Brent was up more than $2 a barrel at $102.21 in morning trading after the larger-than-expected bailout for Spain. 09.40 Fidelity's David Simner, portfolio manager of the Euro Bond Fund, explains why the markets have rallied on news of a Spanish bank bailout, but also sets out why there are many reasons to remain cautious: This weekend's announcement is positive for several reasons. It will enforce the long-awaited external scrutiny of Spain's banks. This will remove a significant element of economic uncertainty once a final clean-up cost is arrived at. The funding will be provided at below-market rates and, we assume, long maturities, which takes the heat off Spain's regular sovereign issuance. It is a signal of intent by eurozone powers that they want to stop the rot by pre-emptively deploying firewall resources. This raises hopes for progress at the end-of-June European Council meeting. On the other hand, Spain's banks are only one layer of the economy's shaky foundations. It still has the highest unemployment and the third widest fiscal deficit in Europe in the context of a painful recession. The current government has a poor track record of crisis management and data quality has been poor. The funding provided by the EFSF/ESM will inflate the government's debt and there is an open question of creditor subordination.
09.10 Italy's latest GDP figures are out - the final revision - and show the economy shrank 0.8pc in the first quarter of 2012, and contracted by 1.4pc year-on-year. 08.45 Good news! Spain's bail-out already has it's own abbreviation - the 'spailout' according to Blake Hounshell, the editor of Foreign Policy. For everyone who was tiring of Grexit... 08.35 Markets have certainly taken heart from the news Spain has agreed on an EU bailout for its banks, however market watchers are highly sceptical the rally can last - even until the end of today. The BBC's Robert Peston has called the move "another very large piece of sticking plaster but not a permanent solution", while Sky's economics editor Ed Conway has a number of questions, including whether Ireland will now be seeking a renegotiation of its bailout terms, which were far more stringent than Spain's, and whether this is a pre-emptive move by Spain to protect itself in case of a Greek eurozone exit after this coming weekend's elections. 08.10 And it's not just good news for stock markets, in bond markets, Spain and Italy's borrowing costs have fallen. The yield on 10-year Spanish government bonds fell below 6pc, down 0.2pc percentage points to 5.96pc, while Italy's yield fell 0.14 percentage points to 5.6pc. 08.05 European shares have followed Asian markets higher at the open: The FTSE 100 was up 1.6pc at 5,524 points shortly after opening, while Spain's IBEX jumped more than 5pc. 07.50 Joaquin Almunia, the EU Competition Commissioner, has spoken about Spain's bank bailout this morning - and it doesn't look good for people hoping Spain has not handed over any financial independence with the move. The banks which receive aid will have to present restructuring plans to to EU, Mr Almunia said this morning, and there will also be a visit of the "troika" - the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - to Spain. 07.40 George Osborne has been ticked off by Tory MPs for using the eurozone crisis as an "alibi" for Britain's own economic problems. As reported over the weekend, the Chancellor said the debt crisis on our doorstep has "killed off" the recovery. However, some MPs said there was still plenty the UK could be doing to help itself. Rowena Mason reports: Mr Osborne delivered a stark message that the Government is powerless in the face of “headwinds” from Europe, as Spain became the fourth country to require a multi-billion pound bail-out. But he was accused of making excuses for Britain’s “awful economic performance”. David Ruffley, an MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, urged the Chancellor “radical action” to get the economy growing. “Of course eurozone meltdown is damaging business confidence but this must not be used as an alibi for no growth in the UK,” he said. “We can’t just say the eurozone is destroying confidence in the UK and nothing can be done.”
07.25 In the spirit of full transparency, political blogger Guido Fawkes, as mentioned in the 06.58 post, has refuted our claim that he may have overdone the euro gloom and has even put his money where his mouth is: Twitter: Guido Fawkes - Telegraph City pages reckon I overplayed Spanish #€urogeddon, well I shorted bounce in €/$ in Tokyo last night. We'll see...
07.10 Time for a look at the specifics of the €100bn bank bailout which Spain has been offered by the EU. The full terms were not available last night, but Spanish officials said the loans would cost the country 3pc a year in interest, rather than the rates of 6pc-7pc which Spain is paying to borrow from bond markets. The EU indicated over the weekend that the money for the loans would come from its bailout funds, but not which ones. Using the temporary EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility) would have to be voted for by individual member states, according to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. The permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which comes into force in July, could be used instead, however it has its own problems, as Louise Armistead reports: Since ESM debt would rank above private bondholders, loans from this fund could make Spain even less attractive to private investors on the capital markets. 06.58 So, markets up, euro up - for the short-term at least things are looking a little brighter. It seems Guido Fawkes and City AM editor Allister Heath overplayed the "eurogeddon" angle last week: Twitter: Guido Fawkes - Spanish €urogeddon risk is back on, yet bank shares are up. Markets like a happy junkie expecting more QE, bailouts, ECB rate cuts et al.
Twitter: Allister Heath - Ratings agencies always behind the curve but Fitch's three-notch downgrade of Spain today another devastating blow
06.55 The FTSE 100 is expected to open 2pc higher at 8am, with the Dow up 1.2pc this afternoon. 06.52 Italy is holding a bond auction later today. Will be interesting to see how it fares after the Spanish bank bailout. 06.50 Ambrose Evans-Pritchard maintains that Europe's democracies must not subcontract their destiny to the Bundesbank: The weekend deal is a fresh evasion by EU leaders. Another loan package will be inflicted on another country that cannot afford more debt, though the stakes are higher this time. Europe’s democracies can stop this destructive course before it is too late. They do not have to subcontract their destiny to the Bundesbank. The broad Latin bloc commands the majority votes to compel the ECB to act as lender of last resort and reverse monetary contraction. They should use that power. If such a confrontation causes Germany and its satellites to storm out of EMU in a huff, that too is a solution of sorts. Monetary asphyxiation would end. The Latin euro would weaken to equilibrium levels. Capital would flow back into southern Europe once the boil had been lanced. Just do it. Call the German bluff. One bound and you are free. 06.45 The Sunday Telegraph's James Quinn believes the bailout won't end Spain's property nightmare: The situation that is now playing out in Spain is one that risks the very firmament of the entire European financial sector. Although at the time of writing the early stages of a plan to rescue the Spanish banking system appeared to be coming together, there is no guarantee that the capital that will be injected will be enough. The Spanish predicament is, as was the case in the US with the subprime mortgage collapse that fuelled the 2008/9 financial crisis, property-led. Recent data from the Knight Frank Global House Price index shows that Spanish residential properties fell by 7.3pc in the year to the end of March. Official Spanish data state that prices are down 20pc from the peak, but those figures are based on bank valuations, rather than actual sales. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the fall from the top of the market is closer to 30pc, but how much further can prices go? 06.42 Asian markets and the euro have jumped this morning following the bailout. The euro rose nearly 1pc to $1.26694, its highest level since May 23, while Japan's Nikkei average added 2pc, after sagging 2.1pc on Friday. 06.40 Mr Rajoy said he was not pressured into requesting aid, saying he was the one who had pressed for this line of credit, insisting it was different than bailouts taken by Greece, Ireland and Portugal because their lifelines include strict outside control over public finances - and Spain's does not. Spain admitted last week that its high borrowing costs of between 6pc and 7pc have meant it was effectively locked out of the money markets. Spain's deep economic misery will get worse this year despite a financial lifeline to save its banks, Mr Rajoy said. This year is going to be a bad one: Growth is going to be negative by 1.7pc, and also unemployment is going to increase.
06.35 No prizes for guessing what the big news of the weekend was. Spain will be given a €100bn bailout for its struggling banks, with PM Mariano Rajoy saying the move boosted the credibility of the euro. If we had not done what we have done in the past five months, the proposal yesterday would have been a bailout of the kingdom of Spain... Yesterday, the credibility of the euro won, yesterday the future won, yesterday, the European Union won.

Ireland plans €7bn banking sector bail-out with Anglo Irish first in line
The Irish government is said to be negotiating a rescue of its banks worth up to €7bn (£6.5bn) and may take an 80pc stake in Anglo Irish, after a loans scandal forced its executives to step down.
By Amy Wilson
8:19PM GMT 21 Dec 2008
Comments
The government is expected to make its part of the investment by buying preference shares. The country's two biggest lenders, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, would reportedly get €2bn each from the state, and shareholders would have the option to invest another €1bn in each. Anglo Irish, whose chairman and chief executive stepped down on Friday after now ex-chairman Sean FitzPatrick failed to disclose €87m in personal loans, may get €1bn from the government. The bank's shares have been almost wiped out this year, losing 98pc of their value as Ireland's property boom came to an abrupt end and concern about bad loans increased.
After Friday's resignations, the shares dropped 40pc to 25 cents. At its height, Anglo Irish was trading at €17 a share and was worth €13bn. Anglo Irish declined to comment on whether it would be getting government funding. Reports said the government's injection of funds into Anglo Irish is dependent on the whole board stepping down, with the exception of newly appointed chairman Donal O'Connor. Mr O'Connor was formerly a senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chief executive David Drumm and non-executive director Lar Bradshaw, who borrowed jointly with Mr FitzPatrick, also resigned last week.
As the global financial crisis worsened dramatically in the autumn, Ireland moved to guarantee deposits at its largest banks, and the country is working on a €10bn recapitalisation plan for its lenders. Unlike Britain, Ireland has not yet bailed out or nationalised any of its banks, and none of its institutions has undertaken capital raising.
Ireland's financial services regulator said over the weekend it would look into directors' loans at all six banks and building societies covered by its guarantee scheme, and staff from the regulator have been placed full-time in all of those companies, reports said. That includes Irish Life and Permanent, Irish Nationwide building society and the Educational Building Society as well as the three banks expected to benefit from a state bail-out.
Ireland's financial regulator has also come under pressure in the Anglo Irish fall-out. Banks and Finance

Virgin Rail to continue running West Coast line for now
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is expected on Monday to set aside legal threats and name Virgin Rail Group as his preferred operator to run West Coast train services on a temporary basis from December.

Virgin is the favourite to run the London to Scotland services on a short-term contract, which could be as brief as six months. The Department for Transport (DfT) has been examining whether there is a legal case that would allow Virgin, which has operated the West Coast Main Line for the last 15 years, to be awarded an extension or whether the state-owned Directly Operated Railways (DOR) could be mobilised quickly enough to take over the franchise on December 9. Mr McLoughlin has pledged to inform Parliament of his decision by Monday. The West Coast franchise competition was scrapped 12 days ago because of “significant technical flaws” in the way the process was handled by the DfT, which named FirstGroup winner of the competition in August. Virgin has been pushing for an 18 to 24-month extension, but sources have suggested the DfT could fudge the situation by asking Sir Richard Branson’s rail group to continue running the services for a further six months, or until the end of the financial year in March, before handing over to the DOR, which would operate the franchise until it is re-let. The DfT has asked recruiters to “test the market” and see if a senior management team could be hired quickly enough to run the West Coast line on behalf of the DOR from December 9, but industry experts believe there is no longer enough time to transfer all of the contracts to the state-owned operator. Usually 120 days is required to transfer all contracts, staff and rolling stock. A third, half-way house option, which would see Virgin remain in the driving seat for another six months, could help defuse the threat of legal action. Lawyers have warned the DfT it could be in breach of European competition or procurement law if it hands Virgin a new 18 to 24-month contract. Related Articles

Five ways to boost retirement income
Here are the top tips to ensure your income at retirement meets your expectations.
3:01PM BST 24 Jun 2013
Fewer people are saving enough for retirement than they were at the peak of the recession, yet they expect double the income that they are likely to receive when they eventually stop work. Rock bottom interest rates, high inflation and poor investment returns have made it more difficult than ever to save enough for the future, but this hasn’t dampened our expectations for income in retirement. According to a report by insurer Scottish Widows, only 45pc of people are currently saving enough for their old age, compared to 54pc in 2009. Its research found that the average level of annual income people would feel comfortable living on at the age of 70 is £25,200. However, based on what people are actually saving, they are more likely to end up with an annual pension of only £3,860. This increases to £11,400 per year once the state pension is factored in, but is still 55pc less than the £25,200 annual income people are looking for. Andy James, advice policy manager, at wealth advice business Towry, said, "With annuity rates and other investment returns at all-time lows, it is questionable whether those even with wealth in excess of £500,000 would necessarily have sufficient to see them through a comfortable retirement. “At current rates, £500,000 used to purchase an annuity would be unlikely to provide more than £22,000 or so net of taxes, assuming a level income. While not leaving someone on the breadline, this is hardly going to put them in the lap of luxury.” However, there are ways to ensure your income doesn’t drop dramatically once you stop work. Here, we explore five different ways to maximise your income in retirement. 1. Choose the right annuity
Annuity rates have been hard hit by quantitative easing, which is effectively the creating of new money to stimulate the economy. As this money has focused on buying gilts, to which annuity rates are linked, this has forced up prices and so lowered their interest rates, reducing the income people can get from their pension savings. Although experts claim rates are likely to show signs of improvement soon, research from AXA Life Europe found that rates have declined by 29pc since the Bank of England began its quantitative easing programme. As a result, it is more important than ever that anyone planning on buying an annuity with their pension finds the best rate possible for them. Everyone has the right to exercise what is known as the ‘open market option’, which means you can use your pension fund to buy an annuity from any provider you want to. Remember to consider any health issues you may have, as this could result in a significant uplift in annuity rates, depending on the condition. If you do have any health problems, including being overweight, a smoker, or having high blood pressure, you may be eligible for an enhanced annuity which will provide you with a higher income than a conventional annuity. This is because your life expectancy is considered to be shorter than if you were in the peak of health. For more information about your annuity options call 0800 030 4693 or visit the Telegraph Retirement Planning Service, provided by Skipton Financial Services Limited 2. Consider drawdown
Those with pension funds of more than around £100,000 may want to consider drawdown, where they can start to take an income from their pension but, unlike an annuity, their money stays invested. Patrick Connolly, of IFAs AWD Chase de Vere, said, “This provides the opportunity to generate a higher level of income than an annuity over time if their investments perform well. There might also be scope to lock into a higher annuity rate in the future as you get older and if annuity rates increase. “However, drawdown is riskier than buying an annuity because your investments might perform poorly which could mean that you are forced to accept a lower level of income in the future. Those in drawdown should therefore regularly review their investment strategy, how their funds have performed, and the level of income they are taking.” 3. Review your savings and investments
As savings rates and investment returns have dropped in recent years, far fewer over-55s now receive an income from this source. According to Aviva’s Real Retirement report, three in ten people in this age group identified investments or savings as a source of income in May 2010, falling to 27pc in May last year and only 24pc in both December 2012 and May 2013. It’s not hard to understand why, especially as interest paid on most savings accounts is below the rate of inflation, even for cash Isas where all interest is tax-free. According to research by MoneySupermarket.com, currently no easy access accounts beat inflation, while there are just three fixed rate bonds and five fixed rate cash Isas that beat inflation. However, provided you are happy to accept a level of risk, you can increase your income by reducing the amount of cash you hold and reinvesting into other assets which are paying a higher level of income. Mr Connolly said, “Rather than investing in just equities or fixed interest, you should look to spread risks by investing into a combination of income producing assets. This can provide a more consistent level of income while hopefully also offering a reasonable level of capital protection. “Income investors shouldn’t just look at those asset classes or funds paying the most income as they are likely to take a high degree of risk in order to achieve a greater income"
Always seek professional financial advice to help you find the best investments to suit your individual circumstances.” For more information call the Telegraph Investment and Savings Service, provided by Skipton Financial Services Limited call 0800 121 4596
4. Release value from your property
Many people approaching retirement have the majority of their wealth tied up in their home. Research by Key Retirement Solutions, providers of The Telegraph Equity Release Service, found that pensioners own property worth almost £770bn, with 4.7 million retired householders owning their homes outright. One way to release some of this money is to downsize to a smaller property, although this may involve moving to a location or home which is less appealing than the one in which you currently live. Alternatively, you may want to consider retiring overseas, to a country where the cost of living may be lower than in the UK. However, for those who don’t want to move from their property, another option is equity release. These schemes involve releasing cash from your home, typically through either a lifetime mortgage or home reversion plan. A lifetime mortgage is a loan secured against your home. You don’t make regular repayments as the loan and interest are rolled up and usually repaid when you die or go into long-term care. A home reversion plan, however, allows you to release an amount of money by selling all or part of your home to a home reversion provider. You should always seek advice before opting for equity release as there are drawbacks. For example, take a cash lump sum and the costs involved will reduce the value of your estate and the amount of inheritance you will be able to leave, and may affect your tax position and welfare benefits. For more information call the Telegraph Equity Release Service, provided by Key Retirement Solutions Ltd on 0808 252 9087
5. Claim any help you may be entitled to
As much as £5.5bn of benefits goes unclaimed by pensioners, according to charity Age UK. It claims that older people often miss out because they think the application process is too complicated, or because they don’t think they will qualify. If you are on a low income you may be eligible for the guarantee element of Pension Credit, which tops up your income to at least £145.40 per week for single people and £222.05 for couples. You may also be able to get the savings element of the pension credit, worth up to £18.06 per week for single people or £22.89 for couples. While there is no upper savings limit to qualify pension credit, if you have savings of more than £6,000 the benefits are reduced.

Katharine Welby: 'I got to the point where I just couldn’t bear the thought of living any more'
Katharine Welby, daughter of the Archbishop of Canterbury, speaks for the first time about her battle with depression
By Cole Moreton
7:00AM BST 05 May 2013
Follow Comments
When the news broke that her father was about to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, Katharine Welby found herself in floods of tears. “I ended up crying and crying,” she says, but not because she didn’t want her dad to get the job. “I was excited for him and for what he could do for the Church,” she says, although she was also “scared” by the impact it would have on her life and that of the whole family. But that wasn’t the reason for the tears. “I was overwhelmed. My head is permanently full at the moment. There isn’t very much leeway. It gets to a point where it is too full. I cease being able to function.”
Her weeping was caused by depression. The illness is “a constant struggle” in her life and creates moments of crisis in which she wants to “run away and hide in a hole”. In the past, it has brought her to the brink of suicide. Related Articles

Archbishop of Canterbury's daughter: My battle with depression
23 Apr 2013
And it left her unable to cope with the emotional overload last November, as the rest of the world found out what she already knew but was not allowed to tell: that her father had been chosen as the new head of the Church of England, spiritual leader to nearly 80 million people around the planet. “That is a terrifying thought,” she says with a little laugh. “Especially if you know my dad. No, he’s a wonderful man.”
She clearly loves and admires him very much. She is also evidently nervous, smoothing her skirt repeatedly at first as we sit together in an office in east London. The nerves are understandable, given that what she wants to say is both intimate and revealing. This pale, petite 26-year-old with a skittish sense of humour and a distracted smile is trying to make sense of the realisation that an awful lot of people want to know about her private struggles, after the extraordinary reaction to a blog entry she wrote last month. Meant to be read by a few friends, it provoked headlines and news reports around the world. Katharine Welby, daughter of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby (GEOFF PUGH)
“I have depression,” she wrote. “I get it quite badly on a regular basis and kind of cry and get tired and just generally see no hope in the world.” The chemicals in her brain seemed to be at war with her circumstances, she wrote. “I have friends, a nice home, a very supportive family nearby, a good church, a good job, a brilliant doctor and an incredibly wonderful boyfriend. However, previously I have had many of these things and still found myself unable to find a way out of the despair.” Faith had helped her find hope, she wrote, even though Christians often failed to support or understand people with depression. Did she really think the media would not pick up on such an honest, moving confession, with its challenge to the Church? After all, she had already been in the papers for tweeting a picture of herself in a tea cosy that happened to look very like a mitre, just before a fiercely contested vote on women bishops. “I was like, ‘Oops. Sorry. Shouldn’t have done that’,” she says of the tweet now, laughing. The blog showed another side to her, and this time she showed it to her father, who warned it would get picked up. “In the past, that has meant one or two people getting in touch to ask if I would like to talk to them, to which I have always said no. I said to him, ‘You didn’t tell me it would go viral, that’s not fair!’”
Faced with a flood of interview requests, she found allies in Time to Change, a campaign led by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, which seeks to fight the stigma and discrimination around mental-health problems. This is the only interview she has given. “It is a scary and intimidating thing: I am worried about getting boxed up as the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Depressed Daughter.” Does she regret writing the blog then? “No, I am glad I did it because the reaction I got was so huge and encouraging, loving and generous. I had a massive sense of relief.” Most of the hundreds of emails and tweets she received thanked her for speaking out. Today, on home territory, dressed in businesslike black leggings and a black top with a fuchsia skirt that offsets her striking red hair, she is able to overcome the nerves and begin to tell her story. It starts in 1986. Born in London, she grew up in Durham, then various parishes in Warwickshire, and the city of Coventry. Depression began to make an impact while she was studying for A-levels. “I found that I wasn’t quite living in the world. Wherever possible, I was escaping. I was buying four or five DVDs a week and spending all my time watching them or reading books. Life was just a bit too much. I closed down to what was happening around me.”
Things came to a head after her first year reading theology at Manchester University. “I couldn’t really work, I was miserable. It was a relief to be told I was depressed. The doctor said, ‘Get help now and catch it before it gets bad’. So obviously, I just ignored that and didn’t go and get any help...”
She’s funny, in a dry, self-deprecating way. The depression came back after her degree. “It got really bad, but this time a doctor called me a hypochondriac.” She started having counselling, moved to London and joined the police force, believing everything would be OK. “I wanted to make a difference. I do believe in justice.”
For three years she patrolled in Hackney, one of the toughest beats in the country. “I’m a tiny person, so I’ve always been a bit more feisty than people expect, just to show them. I might be tiny but I can fight you. In a totally non-violent sort of way…” She laughs again, but the things she saw in the police were brutal. Women battered by their husbands, children pressed into becoming “revolting” members of gun gangs, and decomposing bodies. “I dealt with a lot of sudden deaths,” she says. “The first I ever saw was in a hostel. He was in his Seventies. Nobody knew anything about him. You couldn’t tell what smelt worse: the milk and steak he had left out of the fridge before dying, or him. He was skin and bone. A tiny little man. The idea that someone could die and no one would even know until the flies arrived… that’s devastating.”
She found the work exhausting, emotionally. “I couldn’t give enough to people. The police are not here to heal the wounds of society, they are here to hold the line. I wanted to make society better.” The depression surged again at the beginning of last year, with what she calls “catastrophic” results. “I did not like being me. I hated it. I was exhausted by it. I wanted to be someone else. Or nowhere else.” Was she suicidal? “Not quite. That came in April. My boyfriend broke up with me. That was the final straw. I didn’t have the space I needed in my head to grieve for this relationship. My head was already full of things that were hurting.” She went off sick. “My whole life fell apart. What was happening reminded me how worthless I was, how no one wanted me, how much of a burden I was. All of these underlying things I had believed for a long time but ignored. I got to the point where I just couldn’t bear the thought of living any more. That got very aggressive and all-consuming.”
She knew enough by now to act against it. “I would go out every day, which was often the most horrendous effort, but I knew that if I didn’t then I would get myself into some real trouble,” she says. “When I completely lose it, I do get very erratic and just try to harm myself in any way possible. I knew that if I left myself alone for days at a time I would be a serious danger to myself. So I had a few very good friends I could just go and sit with.”
They let her know they cared, however much she withdrew. Her parents were in Durham, where her father was bishop. Did they know? “I hid it from them quite well. I don’t want to put a burden on other people – which in a way is quite selfish, because you’re actually giving people no opportunity to love you back to health. They found out in the summer when I went to stay with them. My weight had dropped drastically. I was down to seven stone.” How, then, did she begin to recover? “I spent hours every day reading the Bible and praying. I had Post-it notes with encouraging verses written on them and I stuck them all over my room. Everywhere. I got to the point where I was so miserable in myself, but so happy and peaceful with God.” She was also helped by a “fantastic” doctor who listened, understood and eventually found the right medication. “I had cognitive behavioural therapy for a while. That helped. I had very good friends. I moved to a church where you are noticed and included immediately.”
What is her experience of the Church failing people with depression? “Some Christians will say, ‘You’re not depressed’. Then they insinuate – or state directly – that you don’t have enough faith, or that depression is not biblical because the Holy Spirit gives us joy, or that you haven’t experienced the love of God. To which I just say, ‘I experienced the love of God more during my darkest period than at any other point in my life.’” In the autumn, she began to work with Livability, a charity that supports disabled adults and children, enabling them to live as independently as possible. She co-ordinates a team of community workers and engages with social media on behalf of the charity. “I am able to work now because it is a very clear routine,” she says. “I get up at a certain time, have my shower, do my hair, do my make-up, have my breakfast with a cup of tea, read my Bible, do my journal, go to work, come home from work, do something in the evening and go to bed. It is very clear and distinct. That keeps me going. But I have so many ups and downs.”
She has the support of a boyfriend called Mike, who is an IT consultant. “I have been afraid of telling boyfriends in the past about the depression, because of a couple who couldn’t deal with it. It is great when you do find someone who understands that it is not who you are but an add-on. Then the fear evaporates, because they do just love you for what you are.”
As life began to improve, she was able to shrug off speculation about her father getting Canterbury. He had only been a bishop for a year, after all. “It seemed ridiculous,” she says. “Right the way up to when he called me and said, ‘Katharine, I’ve got an interview.’” What was her reaction? “I was like [shouting]: ‘What? No! You said this would never happen in a million years. Seriously? If you’re going to say no, then you’ve got to mean no. I don’t understand!’ ”
Her laughter is infectious. How did she feel when she’d had a chance to calm down? “Partly, I was really excited. I am biased, I am his daughter, but my dad is a brilliant man. He is an extraordinary man, of grace and humility but also authority, which is a very rare combination.” Only partly? “I had a mixed reaction – I was very excited and very scared.” So far, the Welbys are surviving a level of scrutiny that would make the Camerons call for Special Branch. But Katharine has some decisions to make, in the wake of the fuss about her blog. “People work for years to get a profile and it just got landed on me. It feels like, ‘This is rude. I should just keep my head down’. But at the same time, I’m not naturally good at that,” she says. “I do want to say what I want to say. I care passionately about the fact that people with mental problems or any form of disadvantage are excluded. This isn’t good enough. God created everyone. We are all designed in his image. That’s true of a person with autism, a person with cerebral palsy, a person in a wheelchair, a man, a woman. Every single person can give a glimpse of God.” She doesn’t know if her depression is inherited, and doesn’t particularly care. “Hopefully, one day I will be able to live free of it, and happily so. Maybe I won’t. But we have to acknowledge it is a very real thing, which affects a huge number of people,” she says. “These people need support and they need love, and they need to know that if they have to retreat into a dark hole, someone might text them and say, ‘Hey, thinking of you’. Or drop in with a stew, so they can eat. Whatever it is, a sign that someone is thinking about them. “I know from personal experience that when you withdraw, you are often desperate for someone to reach out to you. If that’s all the rest of us can offer, it’s a start.”

Thick ice thwarts efforts to rescue ship trapped in Antarctic
Chinese icebreaker unable to reach Russian vessel stranded in packed ice since Tuesday; Australian ship to reach area on Sunday
By Jonathan Pearlman, Sydney
9:40AM GMT 28 Dec 2013
A group of tourists and scientists remain trapped aboard a ship off the coast of Antarctica on Saturday after watching a rescue vessel appear on the horizon only to grind to a halt in heavy ice.
The MV Akademik Shokalskiy has been stuck in a desolate stretch of sea ice since a heavy blizzard on Christmas Eve.
The passengers and 20-odd Russian crew members now remain in an icy limbo.
They are hoping a third rescue vessel, Aurora Australis, an Australian resupply ship, will be able to break through the ice. It is due to arrive on Sunday.
“We all know that there’s a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted sit and wait,” a passenger, Andrew Peacock, told AFP via satellite phone.

The MV Akademik Shokalskiy is trapped in the ice at sea off Antarctica The 74 passengers, including researchers and tourists from Australia, New Zealand and Britain, thought their ordeal had finally ended on Saturday as a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, came within sight and prepared to lead them to open water.
“There’s a lot of relief amongst the team, and there’s lots of happy faces,” an Australian scientist, Chris Turney, said on Friday in a video posted online.
But the Snow Dragon came no further. It stopped about six nautical miles away as the ice proved thick and its master opted — wisely, according to maritime experts - to ensure the safety of his own crew. A nearby French vessel also failed to break through the ice.
The Russian ship remains trapped some 100 nautical miles east of a French Antarctic station, Dumont D’Urville, and about 1,500 nautical miles south of the Australian island state of Tasmania. The vessel was two weeks into a four week voyage to follow the path a century ago of the great explorer, Sir Douglas Mawson, whose own expedition across Antarctica went perilously close to disaster.
Professor Turney, who helped organise the voyage, said in a tweet that “everyone [is] well”.
He said the vessel initially became trapped in the ice pack off Antarctica just two nautical miles from open water after strong winds pushed blocks of ice into the ship’s path.
“We just wanted to let all our family and friends know there is no risk to the vessel and everyone is well,” he said in a blog post.
The Shokalskiy is stocked with enough fresh food for another two weeks and some dehydrated food. The crew has been running the engines for part of each day to prevent the boat’s workings being damaged by the ice.
Authorities say the passengers are not in danger and could be winched to safety by helicopter if necessary.
The expedition is repeating many of the original experiments conducted by Mawson, an Australian explorer, and are seeking to assess the changes in the environment over the past century. Mawson nearly died while traversing part of the continent and lost his two fellow team members before dragging a sledge 100 miles to safety; he famously survived by eating some of the dogs he brought to assist with transport.

Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal launches his political career in Pakistan
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, vowed to continue his mother's fight for democracy on Thursday night as he declared himself the heir to her political dynasty. By Dean Nelson, Taha Siddiqui in Karachi
5:25PM GMT 27 Dec 2012
Follow In a rally before several hundred thousand supporters to mark the fifth anniversary of her assassination, the 24-year-old Oxford graduate formally launched his political career by vowing that the Bhuttos would never be silenced by violence. He invoked his mother's memory at the family's mausoleum in Sindh's Garhi Khuda Bakhsh and laid claim to its blood-soaked legacy, saying: "Bhutto is an emotion, a love. "Every challenge is soaked in blood, but you will be the loser. How ever many Bhuttos you kill, more Bhuttos will emerge from every house."
Although is too young to stand next year's elections himself - the minimum age is 25 - Mr Bhutto Zardari is expected to be a figurehead of the ruling Pakistan People's Party campaign in place of his father, President Asif Ali Zardari, who is barred from involvement. In his speech on Thursday, he told supporters that he would continue his mother's fight against poverty and demanded to know why her murderers had not yet been brought to justice five years after her assassination.

He also launched a frontal attack on the country's chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who forced Yusuf Raza Gilani to step down as prime minister earlier this year over his reluctance to order a new corruption inquiry into his father. "I asked the top judge, can't you see the blood of Benazir Bhutto on the roads of Rawalpindi? I, as an heir of Bhutto, ask why the killers of my mother have not been punished," he said. Mr Bhutto Zardari's emergence as the face of Pakistan's largest political party marks a third generation of Bhutto leadership. The party was created by his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1967 and was eventually taken over by his mother after Zulfikar was overthrown in General Zia's 1978 coup and executed the following year. Benazir Bhutto served two terms as prime minister, each terminated before completion, and later fled into exile in London and Dubai. She was assassinated in a bomb and gun attack in 2007 as she waved to supporters following a rally in Rawalpindi. Her two brothers were also killed – Murtaza was gunned down by police outside the family's home in Karachi in 1996 and Shahnawaz died in 1985 in a suspected poisoning. Following Benazir's death, her son was named as her chosen successor alongside Asif Zardari, but he remained in Britain to complete his studies and has kept a relatively low profile since his return to Pakistan. He is understood to have undergone intensive training in Pakistani political culture and the Urdu language to prepare him to lead the coming general election campaign. Although the last campaign in 2008 was led by his father, it was the image of the 'martyred' Benazir Bhutto which sealed the victory which eventually saw Asif Zardari replace former military dictator General Musharraf as President. President Asif Ali Zardari told the crowd that he was "filled with pride that the grandson of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and son of Benazir Bhutto is in your midst". "He has finished his studies and now it is time for his political training. He has to learn a lot from the people of Pakistan," he said. Security for the speech was tight - surveillance helicopters hovered overhead and police said more than 15,000 officers had been deployed, as well as some 500 government paramilitary forces. Senior PPP figures told the Telegraph they had no concerns for Mr Bhutto Zardari's political skills because he had, in effect, been in training since he was born. "He was already shaped by being with his mother which was his learning process. Oxford polishes people very well. He has very good eye contact, he's very pragmatic and sensible. His style is more like his mother, he's very thorough like her. But he is respectful and humble like his father – he is not proud," said one minister who has known him since childhood. Pakistani political analysts however said his elevation was a gambit to distract voters from the government's poor record in government with the Bhutto family's glamour. "Bilawal is the only card that is left with the political party that his grandfather launched. In almost five years of their rule, they have not delivered on any account. Now they are trying to make it up by introducing a fresh face. They are banking on him now," said Rasul Bakhsh Raees, professor of political science at Lahore University. "The party has always thrived on the name of Bhutto. It is the legacy of Bhutto and the sacrifices they made that they are trying to resell but the public has become smarter than that and this strategy will not work," he added. Pakistan

Comments
England striker Emile Heskey was subjected to monkey chants from a small section of the crowd at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb after being booked during the 4-1 victory for Fabio Capello's side. The Football Association had asked Fifa to investigate the incident and the world governing body have today issued the fine. "Racism has no place in football," a Fifa statement said. "Fifa is determined to continue broadcasting this message around the globe and deploying all of the means at its disposal to eliminate this form of discrimination." It is not the first time Croatia's fans have been sanctioned for racist abuse. Croatia had to pay a small fine during Euro 2008 for racist abuse from their fans during their quarter-final against Turkey. Fifa's disciplinary committee have now warned the Croatian Federation that further incidents could result in "more severe sanctions". The statement continued: "The Fifa disciplinary committee has fined the Croatia Football Federation CHF 30,000 (£14,920) for the racist behaviour of some of their supporters at the 10 September 2008 Croatia v England preliminary competition match of the 2010 Fifa World Cup. "The Croatian Football Federation was found guilty of a violation of article 58, paragraph 2 of the Fifa disciplinary code, and received a warning regarding its future conduct according to article 13. "Further infringements of article 58 would lead to more severe sanctions by the Fifa disciplinary committee." England
