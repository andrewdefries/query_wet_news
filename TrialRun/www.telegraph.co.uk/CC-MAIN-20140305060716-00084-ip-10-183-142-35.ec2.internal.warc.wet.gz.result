Edinburgh 2013: Nikolai Lugansky's love and toil for Rachmaninov
Ahead of concertos at the Edinburgh Festival next week, Russian pianist Nikolai Lugansky tells John Allison why he just can't get enough of Rachmaninov. Range: Nikolai Lugansky represents the gold standard in Rachmaninov interpretation. By John Allison
7:30AM BST 17 Aug 2013
Comments
"If you are in love with somebody, it’s quite difficult to explain why.” The pianist Nikolai Lugansky is speaking of Rachmaninov, whose music has defined his career thus far. But this is no unrequited love, for of this generation of pianists – the self-effacing Muscovite is 41 – Lugansky represents the gold standard in Rachmaninov interpretation. His recent, award-winning recording of the two Rachmaninov sonatas (on the Naïve label) encompasses all the contrasts between the works and makes one of the strongest cases on disc for the neglected and fiendishly challenging First Sonata. With a Proms appearance in Rachmaninov’s Third Concerto just behind him and the composer dominating his three concerts at the Edinburgh Festival, it’s easy to forget that Lugansky is in fact a completely rounded musician. As a warm-up for his two Rachmaninov concertos with the Russian National Orchestra next week, his Edinburgh recital on Thursday was balanced with Schubert, Liszt, Wagner and Janácek. “For me, Janácek wrote the most emotional music ever. He is so intense you need a holiday after playing his works.”

If Lugansky never seems to take a break from Rachmaninov, that is because he finds him – along with Chopin – the most pianistic composer of them all. “It’s such a pleasure to play, and so brilliantly written that it’s never possible to transcribe his music for other instruments. Well, Respighi tried with the Etudes Tableaux, just as Glazunov made ballet music out of Chopin, and I can understand why people have wanted to spread this beautiful music around, but it really belongs to the piano.”
Outwardly, Rachmaninov’s range of expression might look narrow. His themes are almost incestuously related, he greatly favoured minor keys and his music could be described as morbid for the way in which it is stalked by the “Dies Irae” requiem plainchant. In Lugansky’s hands, though, it always sounds both autumnal and vivaciously springlike. “Questions of death stand before almost every great artist. Not many artists are biologically strong enough to ignore them, and in Russia probably only Pushkin and Prokofiev managed to look away. Rachmaninov, more like Chekhov, was typically serious in these matters, but his answers to these deep questions never sound depressing.”
Lugansky has been known to play all five Rachmaninov concertos in a single season – he once squeezed them into two consecutive nights in Moscow – but usually he finds himself performing just the three most popular, leaving room for other composers among the “10 to 15” concertos he plays each season. One of those coming up is Prokofiev’s Third, with which he will make his London Symphony Orchestra debut next month. “When Prokofiev and Rachmaninov met, both in Russia and later in America, they couldn’t be friends. It didn’t help that the older Rachmaninov had established himself as the greatest pianist in the world, leaving little room for Prokofiev when he arrived in America. “But temperamentally they were so different. Rachmaninov was incredibly self-critical, Prokofiev never looked back or paused for reflection. What they had in common was that they both changed the history of the piano.”
Nikolai Lugansky appears at the Edinburgh Festival on Monday & Tuesday. He plays with LSO at the Barbican on Sept 29 Follow @TeleMusicNews
