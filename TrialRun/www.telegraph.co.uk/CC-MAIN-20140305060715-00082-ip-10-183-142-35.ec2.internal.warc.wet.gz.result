Money MoT: Yorkshire's 1.99pc two-year fixed rate mortgage
Our new column road-tests the latest financial products on the market to see whether they come up to scratch. By Kara Gammell

Yorkshire Building Society has become the latest lender to launch a 1.99pc two-year fixed rate mortgage. THE DEAL:
Charging a fee of £995, this loan is available for first-time buyers and those remortgaging with at least 40pc deposit or equity. However, existing Yorkshire Building Society mortgage customers can't remortgage on to this deal unless they are moving house. To find out more information, visit ybs.co.uk or call 0845 1 200 100.

"This is a cracking rate for a two-year fix with relatively low fee," said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. This deal beats its equivalent from HSBC due to its lower fee. HSBC is charging a fee of £1,999 compared to £995 from Yorkshire. However, there is an early redemption charge of 3pc for the duration of the fixed period and is only available to those with a 40pc deposit so will be out of the grasp of many first-time buyers. Interested borrowers should act quick to secure this rate because previous deals that offered such low rates have been pulled within weeks due to demand. Tesco, which also offered a 1.99pc fixed-rate mortgage, said it was forced to withdraw its cheap mortgage less than a month after it was launched in October after the allocated funds were exhausted. "Overpayments amounting to ten per cent per annum are allowed without penalty, which is fairly standard," said Mr Harris. "There is a 3pc early repayment charge during the fixed period so don't opt for this deal if there is a chance you may move sooner than this." Borrowers should bear in mind that the rate reverts to the lender's standard variable rate (SVR) of 4.99pc at the end of the term, which isn't the most expensive, but it isn't one of the cheapest either. So make a note in your diary if you wish to remortgage to a more competitive rate. Watch the Telegraph series on how to buy a home.

Twitter files for IPO
Twitter has pressed the button on its initial public offering (IPO) by filing an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The S-1 filing is the first step towards a stock market lisiting. Photo: PA	By Sophie Curtis

The social media company announced the news in one of its trademark 140-character messages: Twitter: Twitter - We’ve confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.
The filing is the first step towards a listing that analysts estimate will value the company around $10bn (£6bn) and allow backers, who have ploughed in around $1.2bn, to get a return on their investments. It is also expected to make the company’s three founders — Evan Williams, 41, Biz Stone, 39, and Jack Dorsey, 36 — hundreds of millions of dollars each. Twitter's flotation will be the most high-profile technology flotation since Facebook’s disastrous stock market debut in May last year. Related Articles

Twitter's IPO to meet Wall Street appetite for web firms
13 Sep 2013
On Wednesday, Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg gave this advice to Twitter at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. For a smooth IPO, he said: “You have to know everything about your company. You’ve got to stay focused on doing the right stuff.”
He cited Facebook’s strong growth in mobile as an example of the importance of identifying the right areas of focus for a company. Lack of mobile presence had weighed on the company's shares but this changed in July when the company reported that 41pc of its total advertising revenue was derived from mobile. Twitter recently announced plans to update its site and mobile apps to make it easier for users to carry out conversations on the site and share them with others outside of Twitter. Twitter has also acquired a mobile advertising firm, marking its biggest acquisition to date and helping to plug some of the holes that could hinder its flotation. MoPub, a mobile advertising business, enables companies to buy ad space automatically. It bought the company for a stake in Twitter valued at between $300m to $400m, according to reports. "The news that Twitter has confidentially filed for an IPO will come as little surprise to most, as over the last twelve months there's been a marked increase in Twitter's focus on its paid advertising services, as well as an increasing focus on building relationships with key agencies and businesses," said Jed Hallam, head of social strategy at media agency Mindshare UK. "I'd expect to see a similar response from Twitter post-IPO that we saw from Facebook – a razor-sharp focus on building the platform into a financially viable business (which, given it has confidentially filed for an IPO, suggests current revenues are under $1billion). "While there will be key challenges around data (as Twitter doesn't have the same depth of data on its users that Facebook has), Twitter has been strategically aligning itself with television and traditional media over the last six months (including numerous acquisitions), and this should strengthen its position as it begins to focus on monetisation."
Twitter, which launched in March 2006, has over 200 million active users worldwide, who generate over 500 million tweets daily. Sixty percent of its users worldwide are active on mobile, rising to 80pc among UK users Since its launch, Twitter has become one of the ten most visited websites on the web, and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". "Twitter has firmly established itself as a social tool that people love to use and that the press loves to reference - and more than 60pc of US marketers are now on Twitter as well. And Twitter works hard to serve those marketers: the company learned how to sell sponsored tweets without upsetting users, when critics weren't sure it was possible, and it offers more useful marketing measurement tools than bigger competitors like Facebook," said Forrester analyst Nate Elliott.
"But there's still work to be done if Twitter wants to become a viable business. Marketers aren't yet fully satisfied with the results they're achieving on Twitter, and the company still has to improve its ad targeting and find additional ad formats to sell. If this move helps them grow the business faster and focus on those challenges that'll be good news not just for Twitter but also for the marketers who use the site."

Two flights were cancelled in Australia in 2009 following scenes reminiscent of the cult movie Snakes on a Plane. A dozen Stimson’s pythons were being transported from Alice Springs to Melbourne on a Qantas flight, but when the plane landed it was discovered that four were missing. Despite an extensive search, the four creatures were never recovered. Comments are closed on this picture gallery.
