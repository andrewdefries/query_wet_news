Lost in Translation
If Anglais est allowé dans les rooms de classe, Français will becomez une “dead language”, pensent les grandes fromages. Sacré bleu! “Let’s stop behaving like the last representatives of a Gaulish village under siege,” a dit le Libération newspapier Photo: Alamy	By Telegraph View

Comments
Le newspaper français, Libération, a publishée son front page entirement en Anglais, pour l’édification de le gouvernment Socialiste de Monsieur Hollande. Maintenant, le law de France ne permits pas les universités à teach les lessons en Anglais. Les grandes fromages de la vie culturelle français think que if Anglais est allowé dans les rooms de classe, Français will becomez une “dead language” – mais, dit Libération, c’est un objection très silly. “Teaching in English: Let’s do it now”, il a dit. “Let’s stop behaving like the last representatives of a Gaulish village under siege.” Ici en Angleterre, sur l’autre main, nous should être envieux. Notres enfants et étudiants, suffisament good at parlering français pour understander une classe entire en la langue? Nous devrions bleedin’ coco.

'Beast from the East' Nikolai Valuyev under fire over bear and beaver hunt
Nikolai Valuyev, the 7ft Russian former boxer, has been criticised for photos of him posing with a dead bear and beaver after a hunt.

He is known as the "Beast from the East" for his enormous frame and gargantuan head.
Now Nikolai Valuyev, the 7ft Russian boxer and former two-time WBA world heavyweight champion, has boosted his brutish image by killing another giant: a full-grown brown bear.
The 23-stone sportsman, who retired in 2009 after losing to British rival David Haye, is under investigation for allegedly breaking hunting rules when he shot the bear. He also showed off a dead beaver.
Mr Valuyev, 39, posted a picture of himself in camouflage with a hunting rifle and the dead bear on Twitter, saying: "A little adventure took place, after all. He unexpectedly came out towards me."
A picture of him in a boat in Russia hoisting up the beaver by its tail was captioned: "I dragged this out of the water."

The posts caused a squall of protest in social media, with some critics suggesting the bear had been shot out of season. Others ridiculed the idea the animal had been encountered by chance.
Mr Valuyev later deleted the pictures – taken earlier this month – and apologised for causing upset, but said he had shown documents to officials that demonstrated the legality of his hunting trip in the Arkhangelsk region of northern Russian.
"I'm sorry if I upset anybody with my photographs," he said, adding: "But I will remain a hunter."
After hanging up his gloves, the boxer became a pro-Kremlin MP for the United Russia party – whose symbol is a bear – and had to have a special extra-large seat built to accommodate him in Russia's lower house of parliament.
Prosecutors in Arkhangelsk said they had launched a probe to establish whether the pugilist-turned-politician violated hunting rules.
It is not the first case of controversy over a bear hunt and a well-known public figure.
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, caused national outrage in 1997 when he shot dead a hibernating female bear and her two cubs.
In 2006, a conservation official claimed King Juan Carlos of Spain had shot a tame bear that was made drunk on vodka and released into his path by handlers in Russia's Vologda region. Russia

Huma Abedin: Hillary Clinton's confidante choosing to stand by Anthony Weiner Huma Abedin has been a fixture in the inner circle of Hillary Clinton since she arrived at the White House as a 19-year-old intern in 1996. Miss Abedin had never spoken at a press conference before Tuesday evening Photo: AP	By Philip Sherwell
7:38PM BST 24 Jul 2013
Follow Anthony Weiner denounced for his 'lies' by woman at centre of sex scandal "If I had a second daughter, it would be Huma," the former first lady and secretary of state once observed of her aide and confidante. But Mrs Clinton and her protégé share another unwanted bond – they both chose to stand by their husbands during sexual scandals under the withering gaze of public scrutiny. Huma Abedin with Hillary Clinton in 2011 (AFP)
Miss Abedin, 36, may be no stranger to political drama, but she is a famously private figure who had never spoken at a press conference before Tuesday evening. Related Articles

Weiner refuses to quit NY mayor race after second scandal
24 Jul 2013
Anthony Weiner, 38, her husband and New York mayoral hopeful who quit as a US congressman in disgrace two years ago after sending explicit messages and photos to women online, had just admitted to a fresh "sexting" affair. Glancing around nervously, occasionally smiling at her husband, Miss Abedin read from a prepared statement in a painfully raw exposure before the cameras. "It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony," she said. "It was not an easy choice in any way, but I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage. "We discussed all of this before he decided to run for mayor, so really what I want to say is, I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him." Behind the scenes, Miss Abedin has played a key role in Mr Weiner's mayoral campaign, drawing funds and supporters from her years in the Clintons' world. The daughter of college professors from India and Pakistan, she was born in Michigan, but moved with her family to Saudi Arabia aged two and returned to the US to attend college in Washington. As in intern during Bill Clinton's second term, she was assigned to the first lady's office and immediately impressed. She met Mr Weiner during the 2008 election campaign and the two – she is Muslim, his father is Jewish – were soon an item. Mr Clinton officiated at their wedding, confirming them as a golden couple of Democratic politics. US Politics
