Thomas Hemsley
Thomas Hemsley, who has died on the eve of his 86th birthday, was an English baritone who excelled in singing German music in Germany.
Thomas Hemsley as Purcell's Aeneas 5:42PM BST 12 Jun 2013
Comments
His high baritone voice had an appealing quality in lieder that was matched by his exceptional intelligence and acute musical sensibility, while in opera he thrilled audiences as Sixtus Beckmesser in Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, notably in its centenary production at Bayreuth in 1968.
Hemsley joined Aachen Opera in 1953, later moving to Düsseldorf and Zürich, building up a repertoire of some 100 major roles. Yet he was never away from Britain for so long that he was forgotten; nor did he neglect English music, creating, for example, the role of Demetrius in Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1960 for the composer, and a decade later singing the role of Magnus in the premiere of Tippett’s The Knot Garden under Colin Davis at Covent Garden.
All his roles were carefully chosen and thoughtfully prepared. For each he would try many different interpretations until finding those with which he was comfortable. “Good music will itself ultimately determine how you tackle it, right down to how you walk,” he once said.
Thomas Jeffrey Hemsley was born at Hugglescoate, near Coalville in Leicestershire, on April 12 1927. His grandfather had begun working for the mines, at the age of seven, preparing candles for the miners; his father, an amateur flautist, was secretary of the local colliery. The young Tom spent many a wartime evening singing madrigals with members of his extended family.
After Ashby-de-la-Zouch Grammar School, where he was head boy, Hemsley was instructed by the RAF to take his Physics degree at Brasenose College, Oxford, before completing his National Service, which was spent teaching Physics to pilots. He spent much of his undergraduate time with the choir of New College or giving his own concerts while also developing a reputation as a promising athlete.
Moving to London, Hemsley took private lessons with Lucie Manén and, after being confirmed (he had been brought up a Baptist), became a Vicar Choral at St Paul’s Cathedral in 1950. He was soon being drawn into the world of Britten and Pears and, in June 1951, appeared at the Aldeburgh Festival in a concert of 16th-century music. Three months later, as part of the Festival of Britain, he made his London debut as Aeneas to Kirsten Flagstad’s Dido in the Mermaid Theatre’s production of Purcell’s opera, leading one critic to note that he carried the role “with conviction, and sings with round effective tone”. He also sang in many early performances of Britten’s War Requiem, including at the Proms on three occasions.
Much of the next 20 years were spent in Germany . However, his absence also helped to add a sense of occasion to his appearances back home, his Wigmore Hall performance of Schubert’s Die Winterreise (accompanied by Paul Hamburger) being described by one newspaper as a “red letter day”; the critic added that Hemsley’s “mellifluous baritone voice can command a splendid, dramatic ring when necessary”.
Hemsley sang in 16 Proms . At Glyndebourne his roles ranged from Hercules in Gluck’s Alceste (1953) to Dr Reichsmann in the premiere of Henze’s Elegy for Young Lovers (1961) and included the role of Music Master in Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos (1957).
By the time he retired from singing, Hemsley was well established as a director, teacher and lecturer and, from 1987 to 2004, when he had a stroke, he ran the opera programme at the Dartington International Summer School.
When the public performances stopped, Hemsley tended his allotment, joined a sculpture class, worked as an alternative health practitioner and enjoyed strolling around the south of France.
Thomas Hemsley, who was appointed CBE in 2000, married Gwenllian James, the eldest daughter of the 4th Lord Northbourne, in 1960. She survives him with their three sons.
Thomas Hemsley, born April 12 1927, died April 11 2013

Syria: desperate Homs residents collect snow to drink as water is cut off
Citizens in the besieged Syrian city of Homs have been forced to collect falling snow to drink after water supplies are cut off.
3:13PM GMT 01 Mar 2012
Follow live updates on the situation in Syria
Homs has been under siege for months as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad tries to crush a rebellion that has engulfed his country for almost a year. Citizens inside the city have been suffering as first food and now water is becoming scarce. Amateur video posted online purports to show a large group of people in a street in Homs with bowls at their feet to catch the falling snow. Elite Syrian forces are trying to destroy rebel resistance by pounding the shattered district of Baba Amr, despite international alarm at the plight of civilians trapped there. Related Articles

Hugo Chavez: a look back at the Venezuelan President's life
Venezuela's charismatic president Hugo Chavez has died aged 58 after a two-year battle with cancer. 9:50AM GMT 06 Mar 2013
Follow latest developments: Hugo Chavez dies in Venezuela Hugo Chavez was first elected President of Venezuela in 1998. The former military commander rose to power from modest means to become one of the region's most popular, yet divisive leaders. As President, Chavez vowed to end corruption and promised sweeping social reforms in education and health care. Over the years, he was a vocal critic of US foreign policy and capitalism, and on the world stage, he was a firebrand who was, at times, unpredictable. Related Articles

He did not shy away from criticising foreign governments, angering Britain when he claimed the Falklands should be returned to Argentina. At the 2006 UN General Assembly, he told the audience, "The devil came here yesterday," when referring to George W. Bush. He then made the sign of the cross and said he could even smell sulphur. In 2009, President Obama shook hands with Chavez, signalling an attempt to improve strained relations between the US and Venezuela. Chavez was never camera shy around other world leaders, meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin, Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Syria's Bashar al-Assad. He also remained close friends with former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and a staunch ally of Cuba. He met the actor Sean Penn several times, praising the Oscar winner for his humanitarian work. Chavez travelled to Cuba in 2011 for cancer treatment after a tumour was discovered in his pelvic region. Despite claiming to be cancer free in July last year, he was forced to undergo more cancer treatment for a fourth time in December. He returned to Caracas in February and his death was announced on March 5, leaving a country in mourning and a government in turmoil. Source: APTN

Ferdinand 'confused' by record £18m deal
By John Ley
6:47PM GMT 25 Nov 2000
LEEDS were confident yesterday that Rio Ferdinand would complete his £18 million transfer from West Ham when Peter Ridsdale, their chairman, confirmed that only a medical test stood between the player and his record move to Elland Road. However, West Ham manager Harry Redknapp added confusion to the equation by suggesting Ferdinand had yet to confirm he was to leave Upton Park. Ridsdale, who hopes Ferdinand can be introduced to Leeds fans before tomorrow's home game against Arsenal, said: "The deal is done with the one remaining aspect being the medical. "Personal terms have been agreed and pleasingly, from our perspective, we have landed a player of Rio's calibre without going outside our existing wage structure." Pini Zahavi, Ferdinand's agent, said: "Talks have been completed with Leeds and everything is okay. There were no problems."

Redknapp said: "I just don't think he is over keen to leave West Ham. I had him in my office for five minutes and when he walked out I was none the wiser. It has come as a shock to him and he is confused." Redknapp, though, is determined to strengthen the team with the money if Ferdinand does leave, as still seems likely, and is hoping to sign Rigobert Song, the Liverpool defender, on Monday. Leeds have followed up their move for Ferdinand by making a £4 million offer for the Ivory Coast winger Felix Ettien, 21, who plays for Spanish second division club Levante. Celtic have failed with a second bid for Leicester City's Northern Ireland international midfielder Neil Lennon. Leicester manager Peter Taylor has insisted that Lennon must stay at Filbert Street. Taylor said: "I want to make it perfectly clear that Neil Lennon is not for sale. I have told Celtic that I expect this to be the end of the matter." Southampton hope to sign Blackburn's former Liverpool midfielder Jason McAteer. Premier League

Radamel Falcao (Atletico Madrid)
Who wants him? Everyone…but it’s down to three: Chelsea, Real Madrid or Manchester City
How much will he cost? £48m (release clause)
Will he leave in January? Highly unlikely although it might not stop a club – namely Chelsea – testing that resolve. Has stated he will see out the season and then go in the summer.
