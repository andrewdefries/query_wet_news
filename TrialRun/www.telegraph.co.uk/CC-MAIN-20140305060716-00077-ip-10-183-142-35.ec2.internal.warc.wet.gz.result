TUI Travel boosted by Britons seeking sunshine abroad
TUI Travel, the holiday giant behind Thomson and First Choice, has seen profits jump almost 40pc as British families refuse to compromise on their beach holidays abroad despite pressure on the household purse.
TUI Travel, which owns the Thomson and First Choice brands, saw pre-tax profit jump to £201m in the year to September 30, up from £144m. By Nathalie Thomas

The group reported statutory pre-tax profits of £201m for the year to September 30, up from £144m previously, boosted by sales of unique packages that holidaymakers can't purchase anywhere else. On an underlying basis, which excludes factors such as exceptional items, profits were up 8pc to £390m. TUI also gave an upbeat outlook for next year, with sales in the UK of summer 2013 holidays already 12pc ahead as Britons refuse to run the risk of another wash-out summer back home. Robust performances in the UK, Nordic region, Belgium and Canada helped overcome problems in the French market last year, where cash-strapped households are choosing to holiday within France rather than venture abroad. The UK business generated record underlying operating profit margins of 5.4pc last year, as more holidaymakers chose differentiated or exclusive packages such as Sensatori, SplashWorld and Couples. Online sales in the UK also grew by 5 percentage points and now account for 44pc of all bookings in this country. Related Articles

TUI suffers 16pc fall in profits as early Easter knocks sales
14 Aug 2012
Despite the strong performance at a pre-tax level, group revenue dipped 2pc to £14.5bn, which TUI blamed on a negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Peter Long, chief executive of TUI Travel, said: "The year has been one of many successes. We have delivered record group profits while the UK achieved outstanding results both in terms of profit and margin all against a backdrop of continued economic uncertainty."
He added: "Our proven strategy continues to evolve and drive strong trading momentum throughout the group. Overall, with the exception of France, trading for both Winter 2012/13 and Summer 2013 is very encouraging."
TUI's results compare to a £485.3m loss at rival Thomas Cook during the same period. Leisure

Friends: The One with George in Tears Recalling the emotion of Lady Thatcher's funeral at St Paul's Cathedral was too much for the Chancellor
George Osborne crying at Baroness Thatcher's funeral By Harry Mount
5:45PM BST 20 Apr 2013
“Oh, do cheer up, George,” said Dave, tugging the last Kleenex from the box in the Downing Street kitchen.
“But I still miss her,” said George, grabbing the tissue as rivers of tears cascaded down his cheeks.
“I know it was sad, but it was tremendously uplifting, too,” said Dave. “The dignity, the spectacle, the cheering crowds – and the two-and-a-half protesters. The readings were pretty good, too…”
“Gosh, yes – wasn’t Amanda Thatcher marvellous?” said George, as the ghost of a wistful smile passed across his face. “There was a touch of the Lady in her, wasn’t there? The grace, the smack of cool command. Presumably she must have British citizenship? Vote Mandy Thatcher, the Texan Lady, in 2015! It has a certain ring to it, doesn’t it?”
“Hang on a moment,” said Dave. “We’re not going anywhere.”

“Exactly – that’s the problem,” said George. “We’re going precisely nowhere. Even Christine Lagarde says my growth figures are rubbish. I thought she liked me but now she’s turned all mean. The Lady would never have behaved like that…”
George tried to hold back the emotion, but then it all came flooding back – the St Paul’s choirboys’ treble notes rising high above the Whispering Gallery, the Bishop of London’s duck pâté gag, the applause rolling down the nave, all the way from Westminster. The waterworks came back on, at full spurt. George reached for the kitchen roll above Sam’s chrome sideboard.
“But that’s the thing about Maggie, George,” said Dave. “She was unpopular, too. More unpopular than us, sometimes. And you know the result – three election wins, retired undefeated…”
“So the election campaign in 2015 will be, 'Vote for the Unpopular Party,’ ” said George. “I can’t really see it working.”
“Not quite,” said Dave. “When I said, 'We’re all Thatcherites now,’ I meant it. But it takes time for the legacy to kick in – we weren’t all Thatcherites then.”
“I was!” snapped George, warmly remembering that joyous May day in 1979 when he’d been allowed to stay up late to watch the election results. Then all that came flooding back – the St Francis of Assisi quote, the pussy-bow blouses, the heroic “No, no, no”. He couldn’t control himself, and tugged so hard at the kitchen roll that it spat out 25ft of super-absorbent paper. Not to worry – it was bound to come in useful later, thought George, stuffing it into his pocket.
“Well, most people weren’t Thatcherites; not in the middle of the election cycle, anyway,” said Dave. “But, come election day, she cleaned up – and so will we. Just imagine it. Thirty years from now, some hip, young, wonderfully unpopular prime minister will be saying to a 100-year-old David Dimbleby, 'We’re all Cameroons now!’ ”
“Or Osbornites, maybe!” said George, his spirits lifting once more.
“Mmmm, less likely, I think,” said Dave. “Can’t say I’ve ever heard anyone call themselves a Howeite or a Lawsonite.”
“Never heard much about Majorism or Heathism, either,” sobbed George grumpily, as he stomped out of the room, a strip of kitchen roll trailing behind him.

Gambian parents jailed in Spain for circumcising daughters
Gambian parents have been sentenced to 12 years in prison in Spain for circumcising their two daughters in a landmark case pitting Spanish law against African tradition. 'Female circumcision is not a culture. It is mutilation and discrimination against women' said the written judgement Photo: AFP	By Fiona Govan, Madrid
3:23PM BST 23 May 2013
Follow In what is believed to be the toughest sentence in Europe to date for parents who allowed genital mutilation on their daughters, Binta Sankano and her husband Sekou Tutay, were sentenced to six years for each crime against their young daughters.
A panel of judges at the Provincial Court in Barcelona ruled that the parents, both of Gambian nationality and resident in Spain for 20 years, were criminally responsible for the clitoridectomy performed on both their daughters.
"The couple deliberately mutilated their young daughters either directly or through a person of unknown identity," said the written judgement. "Female circumcision is not a culture. It is mutilation and discrimination against women."
The case came to light when doctors examined the girls in January 2011 and discovered that both had undergone a procedure of female genital mutilation during a period of six months since their last examination. They were aged six and 11 at the time.
It is one of the first such cases to be successfully prosecuted in Spain because despite not knowing exactly when or who carried out the procedures it was proven that they must have occurred on Spanish soil and not on a visit to Gambia and that the parents were aware it was illegal.

21 Mar 2003
The parents accepted in court that the family had not travelled from their home in Villanova I la Gertru, a small town 25 miles south of Barcelona, to Gambia since 2009.
Social services had visited the parents in 2008 and discussed the issue of female circumcision.
"On that occasion the woman made a promise as a mother not to undertake such a practice on her daughters," the court ruling stated. Both parents denied knowledge of their daughters having undergone any procedure and Sankano insisted that she was not aware that such a practice was illegal in Spain.
The written judgement observed the "inevitable clash of cultures" that occurs with migration but said: "Respect for cultural traditions must be limited against the respect for human rights as universally recognised." There are no reliable figures for how many female circumcisions take place in Spain each year. Spain

Renault addicted to winning
By Kevin Garside in Imola
12:01AM BST 22 Apr 2005
Comments
Conversations with Pat Symonds rarely last into the second cigarette. Renault's director of engineering was well into his third when championship leader Fernando Alonso appeared at his shoulder, pursued by paddock photographers. Alonso is at the celluloid end of Renault's grand prix offering. Symonds is busy behind the scenes pulling strings. And relishing the moment. The car for which he is responsible has dominated the season's opening exchanges and has another chance to prove its superiority in the San Marino Grand Prix on Sunday. So confident in it is he that talk of the championship is premised by the world "likely" as opposed to the catch-all "possible". Symonds's optimism is informed by the experience gained over 19 years at the cutting edge of Formula One. He knows a winner when he sees one. And in Alonso and the R25 he sees an irresistible marriage of driving ability and engineering brilliance, a joyous echo of the Benetton revolution of which he was part 11 years ago. The tyro at the wheel then was Michael Schumacher, in whom Symonds immediately detected a "spark". A lot of drivers have crossed his path before and since but only three have rattled his imagination: Ayrton Senna, Schumacher and Alonso. "It was immediately obvious to me that Fernando was special. There are no idiots in F1. All these guys are very quick. But not all of them can tell you why. It's a question of intelligence," said Symonds, tapping his temple with a smoking hand. "All the great sportsmen seem to manage their situations better than the rest, and make best use of the tools at their disposal.

"When we ran Fernando in the car for the first time, he was just another guy we were testing. Whenever we do that I always put them in for an afternoon and then a morning. Never a full day because they need time to stop and think about things, not to mention to cope with the physical demands. "When Fernando drove in the afternoon, I thought, 'hell, this kid is good'. The next day I felt I had to give him a run to see what his consistency was like. His was better than the team driver with him that day. I thought, 'Jesus, this boy is something special'. I discussed it with Flavio [Briatore, the team principal] that night. Flavio took him under his wing until we were able to introduce him to the team." Benetton won back-to-back titles in 1994 and 1995. Symonds is once more thinking in multiples. The reaction of Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella in January, when they tested the R25 for the first time, told him all he needed to know. The car was fast, and the drivers loved it fresh out of the box. Symonds acknowledges that had the regulations not changed so radically over the winter, enforcing one engine for two races, tyres for one and considerable aerodynamic restrictions, Renault would probably not have caught Ferrari. That said, the point of discovery was the same for all. Renault got on with it. Ferrari did not. The result is an advantage over Ferrari of 26 points and six places in the constructors' championship and 24 between Alonso and Schumacher in the race for the drivers' title. Symonds knows that a response from Ferrari is inevitable. Since the last race in Bahrain, Ferrari have spent an estimated £11 million funding a testing programme at private tracks in Mugello and Fiorano. They were even at it three days this week, running tyre programmes and shaking down the car that will race at Imola. It is the first time that Symonds can remember competing on terms so unequal. Ferrari were not party to the agreement limiting the nine other teams to 30 days of testing during the season. As a result they are free to burn cash at will in pursuit of parity. They need to. Their problems are rooted in rubber, the hardest to solve. The production of competitive tyres is a black art that has nothing to do with the colour of the product. Michelin have happened across compounds and constructions that fit the Renault profile like a glove, unlike Bridgestone with Ferrari. The cooler temperatures should help, but there are no guarantees. Each of Renault's three victories has come with something to spare over all terrains and in differing conditions. Hot and cold, dry and humid. The reliability issues that have thwarted Fisichella since his victory in Melbourne prompt the only note of caution in Symonds's spring report. Fisichella comes here armed with a new engine as a consequence. "I've been in this business long enough to have immense respect for our rivals. Anyone who doesn't is a fool. Ferrari have immense resources. They can and will come back. But I'm not convinced it will be this weekend. Irrespective of what they do, we're not going to go away. We have more potential to win this weekend than any other team in the pit lane. I'm confident of that." A fourth Mild Seven beckoned. As hope turns to expectation, all at Renault hope for Alonso's sake that Symonds's cigarettes are the only things that go up in smoke. www.telegraph.co.uk/garside

Ian Holloway named new Crystal Palace manager as Dougie Freedman's replacement
Crystal Palace have confirmed Ian Holloway as their new manager on a four-and-a-half-year contract. New start: Ian Holloway is taking over at Crystal Palace Photo: ACTION IMAGES	By Telegraph Sport
11:38AM GMT 03 Nov 2012
Follow Comments
The 49-year-old has left fellow Championship side Blackpool to fill the vacant position at Selhurst Park, with the Eagles having allowed Dougie Freedman to join Bolton last month. The move, confirmed on Palace's official Twitter account, brings an end to Holloway's three-and-a-half-year stay with Blackpool, with his greatest achievement having been overseeing their promotion to the Premier League in 2010. Relegation followed a year later, but not before the former QPR midfielder and his players had made a sizeable impression on the top flight. Last season, their first back in the Championship, Holloway guided them to the the play-off final where they were beaten by West Ham. They are currently 12th in the table, eight places and six points adrift of Palace. Holloway said: "I just see this as too good an opportunity to turn down." Related Articles
