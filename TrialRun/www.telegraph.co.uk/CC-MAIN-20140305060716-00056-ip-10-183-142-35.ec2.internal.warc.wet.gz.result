New 'ABacc' to be added to school league tables
Schools and colleges face being ranked by the number of students they prepare for places at elite universities under Government reforms. Schools will be ranked by the number of pupils who gain the 'ABacc' under new plans. Photo: PA	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor

Comments
New-style league tables could be drawn up to mark out schools with the highest proportion of “Russell Group ready” teenagers, it was revealed. The move would be made to ensure sixth-forms encourage more 16- to 18-year-olds to take rigorous academic subjects that act as a gateway to the most prestigious degree courses. The disclosure came as it emerged that the Government was planning to introduce the “Advanced Baccalaureate” – a new college leaving certificate. Under plans, teenagers will be awarded the so-called ABacc for successfully completing a 5,000 word dissertation-style essay and undertaking voluntary work – in addition to their three specialist A-level subjects. They will also be required to take one AS-level qualification in a subject completely unrelated to their three core disciplines to promote more breadth in their education. Related Articles

The Government said the plans – currently at a draft stage – were intended to make sure teenagers were better prepared for the demands of university, particularly elite institutions belonging to the Russell Group. It is believed that the proposals are being driven by Elizabeth Truss, the Tory MP for South West Norfolk, who was promoted to post of Education Minister in the recent Government reshuffle. She penned a report on the subject as a backbencher earlier this year in which she insisted that it schools and colleges could be ranked in league tables by the number of students they push towards the ABacc. “Schools should be measured on how many ‘Russell Group ready’ students they produce,” she said. “This should be through a new ABacc comprising three academic A-levels with at least an AS mathematics and AS humanity/language. “This should be the approach to get students from low income backgrounds into good universities.”
The planned introduction of the ABacc comes on top of a major overhaul of A-levels. Under proposals, existing bite-sized modules will be scrapped in favour of traditional end-of-year exams. More open-ended questions will also be introduced to stretch pupils further. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, is also reforming exams for 14- to 16-year-olds by scrapping GCSEs in favour of new-style English Baccalaureate Certificates in the core subjects. Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ umbrella group, said it welcomed Government efforts “to improve skills in extended writing, critical thinking and research”. But a spokesman added: “In terms of subject choices, however, it is important to remember that there is not a magic formula to gain entry on to specific university courses.”
The new proposals were condemned by teachers’ leaders who claimed they failed to cater for pupils more interested in entering the workplace – rather than university. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: “This is another example of Michael Gove’s ideological manipulation of the school curriculum. “These changes are being made on the basis of his own personal prejudices rather than developing a curriculum which is fit for children and young people in the 21st century.”
Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, said: "We support the concept of an ABacc, however Labour would ensure it includes a broad range of subjects... for vocational courses. “Michael Gove seems to be ignoring important subjects like computing and engineering which are critical for the modern economy."

Amazon 'will give its mobile phone away for free'
Amazon is planning to give away its upcoming mobile phone for free, according to reports.

The retail giant is expected to offer customers the gadget free of charge via its website, despite talking to wireless carriers about selling the product through them. Amazon, which makes the hugley popular Kindle e-reader, could require people to sign up for services such as Amazon Prime in exchange for the phone. Launched in the UK in 2007, Prime delivers products to customers free-of-charge within two days for a flat annual fee. It also allows subscribers in the US to stream selected films and TV shows at no extra cost and borrow certain books from its Kindle library for free. Amazon Prime costs £49 a year in the UK and $79 a year in the US after a 30-day free trial. However, Wall Street Journal reporters Amir Efrati and Jessica E Lessin claim that Amazon wants the device to carry no cost regardless of whether people sign up to a wireless plan at the same time as taking the phone. Wireless carriers regularly reduce the price of phones if customers sign up for a one- or two-year wireless contract. Amazon still needs to seal a deal with a hardware partners to manufacture its phone, which has been rumoured since 2011. Related Articles

In April the company, which also makes the Kindle Fire tablet, hired former Windows Phone boss Charlie Kindel for an undisclosed project, raising expectations Amazon was making a phone. “Amazon presented an opportunity to build something new that has ginormous potential. I simply couldn’t pass the opportunity up,” he told GeekWire at the time. His LinkedIn page stated that he was “hiring cloud and mobile developers and testers, program managers, and product managers”.
Amazon reported a surprise net loss of $7m (£4.5m) in the quarter to June 30, compared with a profit of $7m a year earlier, as revenues grew to $15.7bn. The company has been spending heavily on order fulfilment and digital content rights, which continue to weigh on margins. For the current quarter, Amazon is forecasting revenue of $15.45bn to $17.15bn.

Instant Expert: the perfect cut-throat shave
Alex Glover, master barber at Murdock London, demonstrates the perfect traditional shave and explains that preparation and products are as important as the shave itself. By Sumant Bhatia, Video by Erica Elkhershi & Chris Stone

People who know me know that I get a five o'clock shadow at about 3.30. Perhaps even earlier, if I'm honest. So the team at Telegraph Men decided that my tough tufts of hair would provide the perfect test for Alex Glover, master barber at Murdock London a fashionable yet reassuringly old-fashioned barbers in Covent Garden. He does not flinch. Preparation is all-important. First, a cleanser is applied to get rid of yesterday's grime, followed by a pre-shave to soften the hairs, and an exfoliator (recommended three times a week) to banish dead skin. Next, Alex wraps a hot towel (50% boiling water to 50% cold) around my face to open the pores. There is no sign of a can of foam, or a trendy gel: instead there is a traditional shaving soap, lathered up in a dish, with a moist badger brush to keep it company. Alex applies the mixture on my face, and he insists that the more senior of his clients, who use this method, have the best-kept skin. Related Articles

He then produces the blade, and cuts in the direction of my hair growth, with intricate steps under the chin involving shaving both up and down. The razor-stage finished, Alex smothers me in a towel soaked in warm water to get rid of any residual soap, and also to stop my skin from drying out. Next, cold water to close the pores, and then an after-shave balm is applied above the shaving line. A cologne, splashed on to leave the skin smelling fragrant, provides the finishing touch. So, was this shave an indulgence? Of course. Could I do all these steps every day? Definitely not. However the thought of having healthier and younger-looking skin means that I will endeavour to use a badger brush in the future. Now if only Alex could find a way of making sure that the shadow does not re-appear quite so quickly... This video is part of Telegraph Men's Instant Expert series. The Filter

Extra holiday to celebrate Queen's Diamond Jubilee Workers are to be given an extra bank holiday in 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, it was confirmed today.
Lord Mandleson said the extra holiday would be a "truly historic occasion" and "a testament to the hard work and dedication" of the Queen Photo: GETTY IMAGES	3:24PM GMT 05 Jan 2010
Tuesday June 5 has been picked as the additional day off marking the monarch's 60 years on the throne, Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said.
The late May bank holiday will also be moved to Monday June 4 to create a special four-day break, he told the House of Lords.
Lord Mandelson also announced that the Queen had agree to bestow the status of royal borough on Greenwich, south east London, in 2012.
Lord Mandelson, who is also Lord President of the Privy Council, told peers organisation for events to mark 60 years since the Queen came to the throne were in an "early stage" but would take place around the first week of June 2012. He said it would be a "truly historic occasion" and "a testament to the hard work and dedication" of the Queen, who would follow Queen Victoria as only the second monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee.

"However modestly our present Queen might approach this celebration, I know that people across the whole country will want the chance to recognise this remarkable achievement, paying tribute to the Queen and celebrating with great pride and affection Her Majesty's 60 years on the throne," he said. "It will also be an opportunity for us as a country to reflect on the incredible changes that have taken place, both here and around the world, over the last six decades." He said bank holidays were a devolved matter but the Government would "work closely" with the Scottish Government "to ensure that people across the United Kingdom can celebrate the jubilee together". Competitions will be launched later this year "for city status, a Lord Mayoralty and Lord Provostship" and consideration will be given as to "who should be eligible" for the Diamond Jubilee medal. Lord Mandelson said Greenwich's "rare honour" had been "bestowed in recognition of the historically close links forged between Greenwich and the Royal Family, from the middle ages to the present day, and the borough's global significance as the home of the Prime Meridian, Greenwich Mean Time and a Unesco world heritage site."

Wine connoisseurs pay record prices at Burgundy auction
Burgundy’s famous annual charity wine auction at the Hospices de Beaune smashed its previous record with a total sale of 5.9 million euros.

Comments
The auction, now in its 152th year, saw the average price of a bottle rocket by more than 54 per cent compared to last year to reach around 380 euros.
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the former French first lady, who was guest auctioneer at the event, joked: “At €200,000, I’ll deliver the wine. At €250,000 my husband [Nicolas Sarkozy] will deliver it with me.”
This year’s record was reached despite a 30 per cent drop in the number of bottles on offer after a year that saw yields in Burgundy plummet due to terrible weather and disease.
“This is above our predictions,” said Jean-David Camus of the Albert Bichot merchant house. The event, which is now run by British auctioneers Christie’s, attracts wine lovers from all over the world. Organisers said they had seen rocketing interest in the sale from Asian buyers. China is now Burgundy’s fourth largest export market behind Japan, Britain and the US. Related Articles

However, local wine growers and experts have expressed their concern that China’s nouveau riche are more interested in splashing out and speculating than appreciating great quality wine – which has led to price bubbles hitting Bordeaux’s top grands crus. The Chateau of Gevrey-Chambertin, producing Napoleon Bonaparte's favourite red from one of Burgundy's most prized vineyards, was bought by Chinese gambling tycoon Louis Ng Chi Sing three months ago
“After having made the market price of certain Bordeaux explode in an irrational manner, they’re now logically interested in Burgundy and its niche wines,” Laurent Gotti, a Burgundy specialist, told Le Parisien. They want everything that is the most expensive and are prepared to fork out incredible sums.”
He said that “not long ago, all they could talk about was Romanée-Conti” – the world’s most expensive wine whose annual output of 6,000 bottles costs thousands of pounds each. Last year, a single jeroboam of 1999 Romanée-Conti sold for more than £47,000 at a Hong Kong auction. “Today, a dozen domains have taken their fancy. But they don’t really give a damn about what’s inside the bottle,” said Mr Gotti. The warning comes three months after a chateau producing Napoleon Bonaparte's favourite red from one of Burgundy's most prized vineyards was bought by Chinese gambling tycoon Louis Ng Chi Sing. An increasing number of Chinese are ruffling feathers in the conservative region when they arrive via minibus or in small groups. One owner in Chambolie-Musigny said: “They never say hello or goodbye. All that matters is the price. If it’s €60, they’re not interested. If it’s €250, they take six. They don’t give a stuff about the wine itself.”
Paul Vallin, a wine specialist and Asia connoisseur, said their approach reflected cultural differences. “It’s just that for them, wine is also a business,” he said. But Louis-Fabrice Latour, the chairman of the union of Burgundy winemakers, said talk of an Asian invasion was exaggerated. “In simple terms, [annual sales to] China represent less than one month of sales to the US.”

US 'planned to blow up a nuclear bomb on the Moon' The US planned to explode a nuclear bomb on the Moon during the Cold War as a show of strength, according to reports. US planned to blow up the Moon during the Cold War Photo: Nasa	8:36AM GMT 28 Nov 2012
Comments
American military chiefs allegedly devised the secret project, named 'A Study of Lunar Research Flights' – or 'Project A119' – in the hope that the Soviet Union would be intimidated by viewing the nuclear flash from Earth. It would give the US a much needed morale boost after the Russians successfully launched Sputnik in 1957, according to physicist Leonard Reiffel, who was involved in the project. According to the report in The Sun, the US would have used an atom bomb, because a hydrogen bomb would have been too heavy. The planning reportedly included calculations by astronomer Carl Sagan, who was then a young graduate. Military officials however reportedly abandoned the idea, which would have taken place in 1959, because of fears that it would have an adverse effect on Earth should the explosion fail. The project documents were kept secret for nearly 45 years, and the US government has never formally confirmed its involvement in the study. Related Articles

Frankie Dettori faces inquiry following positive test
Frankie Dettori’s 2012 season, which ended with him parting company with Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin after 18 years as stable jockey, got a whole lot worse on Tuesday when it was announced he had failed a drugs test while riding in France in September.

8:03PM GMT 13 Nov 2012
As the racing world celebrated all that was best about the 2012 season at the Cartier Awards on Tuesday night, there was an air of shock among the guests that Dettori, one of the most recognisable faces in the sport, would be facing the medical committee of France Galop next week with the possibility of a lengthy ban. France Galop, who had not even informed their British counterpart the BHA of the case yesterday, instigated the inquiry after Dettori returned a positive sample following his ride on Farhh in the Prix Moulin at Longchamp on Sept 16. The colt was beaten a head by Moonlight Cloud in a great finish. He also had three other rides on what is otherwise known as ‘Arc Trials’ weekend. As was the case with Kieren Fallon and Dean Gallagher, British-based jockeys who also failed drugs tests in France, France Galop refused to issue a statement before the hearing, which is set for an unspecified day next week. However, in a short statement Dettori’s legal representative, solicitor Christopher Stewart-Moore, confirmed that the popular Italian would be required to attend next week’s hearing. "In compliance with, and out of respect for, the regulations of France Galop," it said, "he will not be commenting further until the France Galop procedures have been completed."

Dettori a potent force in Godolphin success
22 Oct 2012
Dettori, who became a global sports star after his Magnificent Seven at Ascot in 1996, was not available for comment nor was his business manager, Peter Burrell. One of the troubles with no, or very vague, statements – which do not even confirm which day the hearing is on – is that it will lead to a week of speculation as to the nature of the drug, which caused Dettori to fail the test. The jockey, who has entertained crowds with his flying dismounts for over two decades, has not taken a ride in this year’s valuable Japan Cup, a race he has won three times, on November 25. Perhaps that is not such a surprise now given the strict stance on drugs taken by the Japanese racing authorities. Early in his career, in 1993, Dettori was given a police caution after being caught with a small amount of cocaine in his pocket in London. In his autobiography he admitted that after some early success he had become a ‘tearaway, a night-club wolf, a drugs dabbler who was perilously close to seeing his career go permanently off the rails’. Speaking to the Daily Mail more recently he described the incident as the ‘best thing that happened to me, but I didn’t know it at the time. It was terrible at the time because I wanted to walk round with a big bag over my head."
In a Newsnight programme on the BBC he also admitted taking diuretics, chocolate laxatives and even Lasix, to keep his weight down, before the Jockey Club outlawed them in 1998. As a rule of thumb, British testers used to take a urine and breath sample of each jockey at least once a year but, among jockeys at least, there is a feeling that this has been upped this year. A minimum of one racecourse a week is selected by the testers and at it every jockey is breath tested – the threshold for alcohol is half what it is for driving – and a dozen will provide a urine sample from a random draw. When Kieran Fallon was banned by the French authorities after testing positive for a metabolite of a banned substance at Chantilly in 2009 he was banned six months. He tested positive again at Deauville on August 19 2007, a second offence for which he received an 18-month ban. Gallagher was banned by the French authorities for six months in 2000 having tested positive for cocaine on three occasions and was handed a further 18-month suspension when failing another test at Newton Abbott in September 2002.
