Di Canio will bring fireworks and fury to the Premier League
06 Apr 2013
Team News Chelsea striker Demba Ba is set to return up front in place of Fernando Torres for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Sunderland. Ba, scorer of Monday's FA Cup winner against Manchester United, was cup-tied for Thursday night's Europa League defeat of Rubin Kazan, when Torres scored twice, but is poised to be restored as Rafael Benitez rotates his squad for the Blues' fourth match in nine days. Ashley Cole (hamstring) and his fellow England defender Gary Cahill (knee) remain out alongside long-term absentee Oriol Romeu (knee). New Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio has doubts over midfielder David Vaughan (groin) and defender Carlos Cuellar (ankle). Captain Lee Cattermole (knee) and striker Steven Fletcher (ankle ligaments) will both miss the rest of the season but there is some hope for long-term absentee Wes Brown (knee), who is continuing to train without suffering a relapse. Match Notes Paolo Di Canio can expect to spend plenty of afternoons as the pantomime villain after his turbulent start to life at Sunderland but that is unlikely to be the case for the Italian’s first match in charge. For once, he will not be the least popular man in the dugout for Sunday’s game at Chelsea, with Stamford Bridge supporters counting the days until Rafael Benitez’s controversial tenure expires. However, Di Canio will need far more than that to arrest Sunderland’s slide. Betting: Home 7-20, Away 8-1, Draw 19-5. Stat of the game: Chelsea have netted 36 goals in nine Premier League games against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. Prediction: Chelsea 2 Sunderland 0. Premier League
