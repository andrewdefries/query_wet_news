Undercover florist: 'A man bought Valentine's roses for 17 women'
Our spy reveals the strange and extravagant requests floristry shops have to deal with – particularly on Valentine's Day Behind the blooms: our undercover florist knows a cad when she sees one Photo: Alamy	By Clara Finnegan

Comments
Floriography, or the "language of flowers" is often mocked. We associate it with the Victorians, that prudish bunch, who covered up chair legs, never smiled in photos, and used flowers to convey private feelings. We consider ourselves less sentimental than our Victorian ancestors. Previously, I would have scoffed at the idea of using flowers to express emotion. Not any more. Since taking a job in a florist, I have seen that flowers communicate as much feeling as ever. Love, sorrow, ardour, gratitude: people buy flowers for all sorts of reasons, in as many different circumstances. Unsurprisingly, romantic gestures are the most common. A man appeared in the shop last week asking for “rose petals to save his life with”. He made it clear that unless he made a big romantic gesture, his girlfriend was going to leave him. As I tore up the roses (a task I never enjoy – it seems such a waste), I wondered whether a bed cluttered with petals would change this woman’s mind. Of course on Valentine’s Day, a rose garners even more meaning. But what happens if you have more than one person to woo on the 14th? The scurrilous cad ordering two bouquets on Valentine’s Day is a famous sight in flowers shops – one for his wife, and one for his mistress. Related Articles

Flowers make men optimistic about love. I once took an order from a man for 17 individual roses, all to be sent to different women, with a note attached to each one reading "from your secret admirer". That’s the "scatter gun" approach. Then there’s the ‘all or nothing’ approach: another man ordered one hundred roses for a woman he was going on a blind date with. She must have either run a mile, or fallen in love with him then and there. There’s certainly no centre ground when it comes to a bouquet this heavy. There can be confusions too. A few months ago I produced a huge bouquet for a woman, which was sent with an anonymous card. The following day, I received a frantic call: “Who are they from?” she demanded. The man didn’t leave a name, so I apologised and wished her well. An hour later, a very flustered looking woman in her mid-thirties appeared in the florist, demanding to speak to whoever had produced this bouquet. She promptly pulled out of her bag A4 pictures of two men, and asked who had bought the bouquet. One man was her husband, and the other her lover. Her husband had bought the flowers. She looked crestfallen, then left in a huff. Then there are the brides, who come armed with pastel-toned swatches, belligerent mothers and all manner of neuroses. They are always oblivious to the seasons, and want succulent lily of the valley in mid-winter and crisp snowdrops in summer. On the other hand, they tend to have roomy budgets. Flowers can convey more malignant feelings too. A man once asked me to produce a bouquet that could suggest to his mother-in-law that he thought she was awful, but would look, on the surface at least, like a thank-you present. He had done his research, and asked for a mix of mint (suspicion), hydrangea (heartlessness) and marigold (pain). Fortunately I had none of these flowers, so he left with a simple bunch of tulips. Just as flowers can symbolise all the joys and tomfoolery of life, they also symbolise the misery of death. A cluster of care homes nearby all have accounts with us, and funeral flowers are important business. In Charles Dicken's Oliver, the undertaker Mr Sowerberry exclaims that “it’s a sickly season” so “coffins are looking up”. And death is good news for florists too. Lilies are the most notable British funereal flower, but care must be taken when it comes to other nationalities. An Italian woman rang up to ask why she had received a bouquet with carnations in when she was still “very much alive”. The carnation is a symbol of death in Italy. Flower diplomacy is important. David Cameron failed to pay attention to the meaning of flowers back in 2010, when he wore a poppy on his lapel during a trade visit to China. For Cameron, the poppy commemorated Armistice Day, but for the Chinese, the flower was a vivid symbol of the Opium Wars, and a reminder of China's humiliation at the hands of Europe. My own encounters are less political. As Eliza Doolittle found, being a twenty-something girl working surrounded by roses seems to draw attention, wanted or not. Roses are sometimes bought and then handed back with a wink. Sadly I’ve yet to meet a professor of phonetics offering to turn me into a duchess.

Stop wasting aid budget on wealthy countries, ministers told
Ministers told spending on projects including climate change schemes for wealthy countries could undermine public support for overseas aid The Development Secretary Justine Greening Photo: REX	By Matthew Holehouse, Political Correspondent

Ministers have been ordered to stop squandering British aid on wasteful projects, including climate change schemes in wealthy countries, the Telegraph has learnt. Justine Greening, the development secretary, fears Whitehall departments, in particular the Department for Energy and Climate Change, could undermine public support for overseas aid by funding poorly-run projects in middle-income countries that do not need help from British taxpayers. In a letter seen by the Telegraph, Mrs Greening warns ministers they risk breaching international protocols and face investigation by Britain's aid watchdog if they spend continue to spend money on anything other than relieving extreme poverty in the world’s poorest regions. Mrs Greening fully supports the Government’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid. But the warning that some departments are may be misusing aid will bolster Conservative MPs who want David Cameron to divert some of the £8bn a year aid budget on flood relief in Britain. Mrs Greening’s department, which accounts for the lion’s share of aid spending, has stripped funds from more than a dozen rapidly growing countries and has been swift to shut down programmes that misspent funds. She wants private sector firms such as supermarkets to work with her department to help developing economies come off aid and stand on their own feet. Related Articles

Is foreign aid just money down the drain?
17 Aug 2013
Mrs Greening did not single out any departments in the letter, which was sent to every member of the Cabinet. However, she is understood to be particularly frustrated at Liberal Democrat Ed Davey's energy and climate change department, which oversees hundreds of millions of pounds of grants designed to help poor and middle-income countries curb their carbon emissions. It recently gave £15m to cattle ranchers in Colombia, the world’s 30th richest country, to help cut flatulence in cows. It has also funded projects in Turkey and Chile, which are enjoying rapid economic growth. Ms Greening has also faced hostile questions in the Commons over the EU aid budget, which has been spent in countries including Belarus, a dictatorship. Britain is a major donor to EuropeAid but the Department for International Development (DfID) insists it is the job of the Foreign Office to negotiate the budget. The letter, which was sent on December 23, was copied to the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg and passed to the Telegraph from a source outside of DfID. In it she thanked Cabinet colleagues for helping to meet the 0.7 per cent aid target, before pointing out that her department has cut aid spending from 43 countries to 28, including ending support to Russia and China. Aid must strictly go on poverty reduction in “low income countries rather than those that can pay for their own development,” she said. She warned her colleagues that aid spending must meet the strict criteria of the OECD, the global club of developed countries. Departments that fund wasteful projects money face investigation by the Independent Commission on Aid Impact, Britain’s aid watchdog. She wrote: “We are making sure spending is targeted to where it is needed the most. "British taxpayers rightly expect all overseas development aid, irrespective of the spending department, to be high quality and well targeted. “All departments need to make sure they are delivering this and show they are meeting the OECD eligibility criteria. “As non-DfID overseas development assistance grows, the Independent Commission on Aid Impact will increasingly scrutinise spending outside of DfID by other government departments.” The intervention comes as some departments attempt to protect their pet projects from Treasury cuts by relabelling them as overseas assistance and “tucking under” the ring-fenced foreign aid budget. As such, the letter has been interpreted in Whitehall as a shot across the bows of ministers ahead of the next spending review, which will slice billions more from budgets, warning them not to indulge in clever accounting. “She is trying to make sure she doesn’t get mud on her face because of reclassification,” one Whitehall source suggested. The UK in 2012 spent £8.62bn in overseas development assistance. Some 87 per cent, or £7.53bn, was spent by Mrs Greening’s department. The rest was spent by bodies which include the Foreign Office (£268m), the Department of Energy and Climate Change (£241m) and the UN and other global agencies (£107m). The Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport also have aid budgets running to tens of millions of pounds. The DWP’s aid goes to the International Labour Organisation, which promotes workers’ rights, while the health department’s share goes to the World Health Organisation. Mrs Greening has asked her officials to work with departments including the Foreign Office, Defra and HMRC to “provide best practice advice”, the letter said. Neil Parish, the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, last week said some foreign aid is wasted and said it should be spent on rebuilding railways and coastal defences in flooded areas. “We’ve got to make sure we look after our own at this stage,” he said. Ian Liddell Grainger, a Tory whose Bridgwater constituency includes the Somerset Levels, added: “We send money all over the world. Now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need.” A DECC spokesperson said: “Around two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions are forecast to come from the developing world by 2020, so it is key to help those countries switch to renewables like wind and solar, and so stop climate change that could impact us all through extreme weather.”

Palestinian hunger-striker exiled to Gaza for ten years A Palestinian prisoner who was on long-term hunger strike arrived in Gaza on Sunday evening after inking a deal with Israeli officials, reports said.

Ayman Sharawna reached a deal under which he was freed from prison but exiled from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip for 10 years.
He was met at the Erez border crossing from Israel by a Palestinian ambulance which took him to hospital for examination, Palestinian officials at the border said.
Sharawna was one of four Palestinian prisoners refusing food for months over the conditions of their detention by Israel, whose cases sparked expressions of concern from the United Nations and the European Union.
Earlier on Sunday the Ramallah-based Prisoners' Club told AFP about Sharawna's deal.
"Palestinian prisoner Ayman Sharawna, who has been on hunger strike since mid-July, has reached a deal with the Israeli side under which he will be released to Gaza and exiled there for 10 years," Qadura Fares, head of the Prisoners' Club said.

Israel's Shin Bet security service said that the Hamas activist from the West Bank would be allowed to go home after his exile if he was not involved in future militant activity.
"It was decided that after 10 years he would be able to return if it is concluded that he has not gone back to terror activity," it said in a statement.
Sharawna, 36, is a long-term security prisoner who was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to 38 years behind bars, but released in October 2011 under terms of a prisoner swap deal.
But he was rearrested three months later and charged with violating the terms of his release, although the evidence against him was kept secret.
He began refusing food in July after Israel threatened to make him serve out the remainder of his original sentence.
On February 28, Jaafar Ezzeddine and Tariq Qaadan, ended their three-month hunger strike after refusing food for three months, pending a hearing on their case. Both have been held without trial since November.
The fourth hunger striker is Samer Issawi, a security prisoner who is currently being held at Kaplan hospital near Tel Aviv after intermittently refusing food for eight months.
Like Sharawna, Issawi was freed under the 2011 swap deal but rearrested last year on charges of violating terms of his release.
Last week, Israeli medics raised the alarm over his state of health, informing the Prisoners' Club that he had suffered cardiac failure and was at risk of dying after he stopped taking liquids.
