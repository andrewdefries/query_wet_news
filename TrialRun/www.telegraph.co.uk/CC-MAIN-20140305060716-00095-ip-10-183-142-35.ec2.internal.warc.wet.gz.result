The Pope puts the Falklands on the map
Greg Burke, the Vatican's communications adviser, says Pope Francis seems unaware that he has maps in his official residence which refer to the Falklands, rather than the Malvinas, which is how they are referred to in his native Argentina.

Comments
Given his Argentine heritage, it is an issue upon which he has pledged not to pontificate, but Pope Francis may still be unwittingly boosting Britain’s right to the Falkland Islands. Greg Burke, a former Fox News correspondent, who is now the Vatican’s communications adviser, has let it be known that the official maps of the world inside the Apostolic Palace in Rome effectively acknowledge the UK’s sovereignty. Burke says he is “pretty sure” that the venerable elaborate maps, upon which the place names are inscribed in Latin, refer to the South Atlantic archipelago by its British name, the Falklands, rather than the Argentine Malvinas. In a jocular reference to Pope Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Burke says: “I’m wondering if he has seen that.”
At a gathering at Heythrop theological college, organised by the Roman Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Burke admits that he was minded to take photographs of the maps that he saw in his office in the Vatican Secretariat of State, on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, the so-called the Terza Loggia, close to the papal apartments. “I’ll have to take a photo, I’m pretty sure it is up there – there is a big wall of maps and there is even a second wall of maps, they look quite beautiful. “On the second one I think it says 'Falklands’ and not 'Malvinas’. OK I don’t know when it dates from, but I’m wondering if he [the Pope] has seen that, but I’m pretty sure that [it’s there] – in Latin, but you can make it out.”

Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the Argentine president, has already sought the support of the Pope over her country’s claim to the islands. History does not, alas, relate whether Burke was referring to the frescoes of maps in the entrance hall to the Secretariat of State, which date from the early 16th century – more than 200 years before the islands were settled.

Susan Sarandon has a realistic approach to acting. “I’ve always thought of it as playing,” says the star of the The Big Wedding, which is released later this month. The last time I saw the amiable star was at the chic La Residencia in Majorca. No airs and graces and no entourage. She told me she filmed her role as a character planning a wedding at the same time she was helping her daughter, Eva Amurri, plan hers. “Everyone was very nice to each other, nothing like that wedding in the movie,’’ she noted.
Any takers for English Heritage? The top job at the National Theatre may not be regarded as the glittering prize it once was – Michael Grandage and Danny Boyle etc told me they are not interested in succeeding Sir Nicholas Hytner – but one hopes that there will be some suitable takers for the chairmanship of English Heritage. The Labour peer Baroness Andrews, 70, is stepping down, but presumably not because of the stress of the job. It commands a salary of £40,000-a-year for “up to” two days a week. The blurb says “an outstanding individual with vision and stature” is required. The best known former chairman is undoubtedly Sir Jocelyn Stevens. Joanna’s limits
Joanna Lumley may be a chum of the Duke of Edinburgh – I disclosed how, in 2008, the actress had been quick to go to his hospital bedside as he recovered from a chest infection – but she has no wish to follow Dame Helen Mirren and play the great man’s wife. “I’ve never been asked and I’ve never really thought about it,” Lumley tells me when I raise the subject. She concedes that she has the right diction, and there is an element of typecasting when it comes to posh characters, but she wonders if, even with a lot of make up, she could pull it off. “Acting is pretending, but, even so, I am not particularly similar to her,” she adds.

Syria crisis: John Kerry says 'world wants to know if US can make a difference'
John Kerry, the Secretary of State, has warned senators that “the world is watching” to see whether “in a dangerous world, we can still make our government speak with one voice.”
By Jon Swaine, Raf Sanchez and Peter Foster
9:04PM BST 03 Sep 2013
Comments
Mr Kerry, the secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel, the defence secretary, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to make the case for action in Syria. He said said that the world wants "to know if America will rise to this moment and make a difference."
“Against multiple warnings from the President of the United States, from the Congress, from our friends and allies around the world - and even from Russia and Iran, the Assad regime, and only, undeniably, the Assad regime, unleashed an outrageous chemical attack against its own citizens,” said Mr Kerry. “A dictator and his family’s personal enterprise, in their lust to hold on to power, were willing to infect the air of Damascus with a poison that killed innocent mothers and fathers and hundreds of their children, their lives all snuffed out by gas, in the early morning of August 21.”
He added that the debate is not about Mr Obama’s “red line” on chemical weapons, but rather “the world’s red line.”

Chuck Hagel, the US defence secretary, warned senators that "a refusal to act would undermine the credibility" of the US overseas. "The word of the United States must mean something," said Mr Hagel. "It is vital currency in foreign relations and international and allied commitments". "The United States must demonstrate through our actions that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable," he added. Mr Hagel, also a Vietnam war veteran, stressed the threat posed by Assad's actions to US allies such as Israel, Turkey and Iraq. "The use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only an assault on humanity – it is a serious threat to America’s national security interests and those of our closest allies," he said. Opening the hearing, Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat of New Jersey and the committee chairman, said Congress was charged with deciding whether the US would “stand silent in the face of human suffering”. Mr Menendez warned inaction would embolden Iran, North Korea, Hizbollah and Hamas, while “Israel will think we don’t have their back”. As shouting anti-war protesters were hauled out of the Senate hearing, Mr Kerry said he sympathised because he had similar feelings while testifying to the same committee on the war in Vietnam, from which he had just returned, in April 1971, at the age of 27. “That is exactly why it is so important that we are here talking about these things,” he said, but insisted: “This is not the time for armchair isolationism”. Amid concerns from senators that Mr Obama's proposal is too open-ended, Mr Kerry and Gen Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, stressed the US was not making plans for "boots on the ground". "The task I've been given is to develop military actions that deter Assad and degrade his ability to use chemical weapons," said Gen Dempsey. He conceded that such an attack might also harm Assad's "overall capacities". However Mr Kerry raised eyebrows by requesting that the use of troops not be explicitly ruled out in the proposal in case "Syria implodes" or other catastrophic developments unfold. "I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be on the table," he said. Pressed on his remarks, Mr Kerry said he had merely been "thinking out loud" about hypothetical developments but would "shut that door now as tight as we can". "Let me be very clear," Mr Kerry said. “There will not be American boots on the ground with respect to the civil war”. Kerry, Hagel, Dempsey Testify on Use of Force in Syria. (JIM LO SCALZO/EPA)
Earlier, President Barack Obama secured the crucial support of Republican leaders in Congress for military action in Syria, as he promised strikes against Bashar al-Assad's regime would be part of a "broader strategy" to support rebel forces. Having previously insisted a US attack would punish Assad for using chemical weapons but not aim at regime change, Mr Obama stressed for the first time it would "degrade Assad's capabilities" and help end the near three-year conflict. “We have a broader strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition, allow Syria ultimately to free itself from the kinds of terrible civil war, death and activity that we’ve been seeing on the ground,” said Mr Obama, as he met congressional leaders at the White House. His new emphasis promptly secured the support of John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, whose endorsement could be key to the White House’s efforts to convince a sceptical Congress to endorse US military action next week. “I’m going to support the president’s call for action,” he said. White House aides were increasingly optimistic that Mr Obama would get the go-ahead for intervention from Congress, after his former rival Senator John McCain offered to help him avoid a humiliating defeat in exchange for assurances the US would do more to back the rebels. “An authorisation for some limited use of force is all but certain to pass on a bipartisan basis,” a senior Republican Senate aide told The Daily Telegraph. “While anything can happen, it would take some kind of game-changing event to tank the vote in the House.”
Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, warned military action may only unleash more turmoil. “We must consider the impact of any punitive measure on efforts to prevent further bloodshed and facilitate the political resolution of the conflict,” Mr Ban said. “I call for the Security Council to unite should the allegations prove true.”
Mr Obama signalled he was open to allowing Democratic senators to rewrite the resolution authorising force to explicitly ban the use of US ground troops and include a possible end-date for military action. “This is not Iraq and this is not Afghanistan,” he said. Protestors hold up signs in the hearing room on Capitol Hill in Washington. (J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/AP)
Members of both parties complained the resolution was too broad and gave the White House a “blank cheque” without setting limits. White House lawyers are ensuring new language does not prevent the US from sending small groups of covert special forces into the country. Mr Obama also stressed failing to punish Syria would embolden Iran and endanger Israel, warning chemical weapons could fall into terrorists’ hands and “pose a risk to allies and friends of ours, like Israel, like Jordan, like Turkey”. After the meeting Mr Boehner said: “We have allies around the world, and allies in the region, who need to know America will be there — and stand up — when necessary.”
“This is behaviour outside the circle of civilised human behaviour,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader. “And we must respond.”
Mr Obama is in Sweden on Wednesday and will fly on to Russia for the G20 summit, leaving his senior aides and Joe Biden, the vice president, to continuing lobbying members of Congress who remain reluctant to give their support. Representative Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat like Mr Obama, who lost both her legs when the Black Hawk helicopter she was piloting was shot down during the Iraq war, said of the Syrian opposition: “I don’t know if they are actual rebels or whether they are terrorists. “If I could guarantee that everyone who comes to get weapons that we would provide was actually a legitimate rebel and not al-Qaeda, then I would be more supportive of it”. Ms Duckworth said there was “real reluctance among American leadership, and myself especially, in committing our troops to another endless war”. Several congressmen stressed the US public seemed overwhelmingly to oppose military action and said they were coming under pressure from constituents to block Mr Obama’s plan. “I received 225 emails over the weekend regarding Syria, and out of the 225 only three support US military action,” said Tim Griffin of Arkansas. Chris Murphy, a Democratic Senator for Connecticut, said he had not received so many messages from voters since the divisive battle over Mr Obama’s healthcare overhaul in 2010. Syria

Nine years on: the children of Beslan

Fariza’s parents urged her to study in Moscow but, six months before graduation, she decided to stay in Beslan. She will attend the medical academy in Vladikavkaz. “I know a family that has a lot of children,” says Fariza. “Here they are, smart girls, but they think that they won’t have a future, because the parents simply have no money at all. Why do they keep giving so much just to us? It seems unfair somehow. Seriously.” “We – our class and others – have seen a lot,” says Fariza’s classmate, Amina, smiling. “We took trips to Greece and to America. And we went to Germany and Italy. There were trips to Jordan and to England. And [Fariza] went to school in Moscow.” “Yes,” says Fariza. “We were invited. I went to that school for three years; it was nice, but the kids were mean. I went there in the fifth grade. “Everyone urged me to go. I didn’t want to but I didn’t want to upset my mother. Three years later, I came home in the summer and stayed.” “You know how it is here,” says Amina. “Guests arrive. They go first to the cemetery, to the City of Angels memorial where the Beslan children are buried. Then they go to the gym, where the terrorist attack took place. Our tourist attractions are a cemetery and gymnasium. “So now they are going to start giving out apartments to victims of the terrorist attack. You wouldn’t believe how the adults are behaving – especially the parents of dead children. They are arguing about which floor their apartment will be on. Their children are dead, nobody will return them. Why do this?” “And when I was handing in documents to register at our local technical school, parents were there fighting for a place in line,” Fariza adds, laughing uncomfortably. “Now they don’t let parents inside. Last year, they had a fight inside; this year, it was outside. “There are some families where one child was killed and the other survived, and they are so fixated on the first that they forget about the second child. “Even I am ashamed, Fariza continues, her voice trembling. “I remember how it was, the terrorist attack, and it makes me... I think, if I had been older, I would have helped someone. “When I got out, people around me were wounded. We could have helped them. But we just got out; that's all that was on our minds. “At one point, my brother went and poured water into his shoe and I drank straight from it. My mum asked me for some, but I didn’t give her a drink. I’m so ashamed of it. She says she doesn't remember now.” Hostages were taken at School No 1 in Beslan, North Ossetia, on the morning of September 1, 2004, during a ceremony held to inaugurate the new academic year. For two-and-a-half days, the terrorists held more than 1,100 people – including children, their parents and school staff – in a building filled with explosives. On the third day, there were explosions in the school, and a fire started that caused the building to partially collapse. After the first explosions, the hostages began to run out of the school and security forces stormed the building. During the chaotic shootout that ensued, in which civilians also participated with their own weapons, 27 terrorists were killed. The only terrorist caught alive was sentenced to life in prison.

Dennis Bergkamp in line to take over Arsenal academy Dennis Bergkamp will be among the candidates to replace Liam Brady as Arsenal’s academy director and head of youth development when the 56 year-old leaves his current job at the end of next season.

Brady has held the position since 1996, the same year that Arsène Wenger became manager, but has told the club of his intention to stand down in May 2014 when he will have spent 25 years at Arsenal as both player and coach.
Arsenal still want Brady to remain at the club in a consultancy role and he will also be involved in the search for his successor. The early favourite for the position is Bergkamp, another legendary figure at Arsenal for his feats as a player at the north London club. Bergkamp has also made an impressive start to his own coaching career during five years at Ajax.
Having managed Ajax’s celebrated under-19 team, Bergkamp has risen to the role of assistant to manager Frank de Boer.
In an interview this month, Bergkamp outlined his desire to eventually work at Arsenal although he did also stress that he was keen not to leave Ajax prematurely. The timeframe, then, of potentially taking over from Brady in the summer of 2014 could be appealing.

Asked if he would consider a coaching job at Arsenal, Bergkamp said: “I would, yes.”
He added: “We have started something good now at Ajax and I know a little bit in my role now, what I like and what I don’t like so if I could fulfill a similar role abroad, especially at Arsenal that would be one of the things that I would like to achieve in the future. But not in the near future because we have just started here.” Arsenal will not rush their search for Brady’s successor, with the position regarded among the most important at the club. There is, however, an appreciation that it could be advantageous to have the position taken by an iconic former player, such as Bergkamp, particularly when it comes to the highly competitive job of persuading the best young players to join your club.
The forthcoming departure of Brady follows the loss of Pat Rice, Wenger’s assistant, last year. Both had been at Arsenal throughout Wenger’s tenure, with the Frenchman’s own contract due to expire in 2014.
With Premier League clubs now introducing the new Elite Player Performance Plan, it is understood that Brady regarded next year as a logical time to depart.
Brady joined Arsenal as a 15-year-old youth team player in 1971 before making his senior debut two years later. He was part of the 1979 FA Cup-winning team. After managing at Celtic and Brighton, Brady returned to Arsenal under Wenger where he has helped develop Ashley Cole, Jack Wilshere, Cesc Fabregas and Kieran Gibbs.
Arsenal have also won three FA Youth Cup titles since 1996 as well as back-to-back academy Premier League titles in 2009 and 2010.
“Liam has a deep understanding of what it takes to discover and develop a talented youngster into someone who can perform at the highest level,” said Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive. “He has made a massive con­tribution to Arsenal Football Club. It will be difficult to find a worthy successor but we will be looking for someone who can build on what Liam and his team have created,” Gazidis added.
