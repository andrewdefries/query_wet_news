The Venice Architecture Biennale opens on Wednesday 29 August. The theme of the world's largest architecture festival is "Common Ground" and director David Chipperfield from Britain said it was important that today's architects reflect social concerns and not just go for glory projects.

Willie Walsh attacks 'Heathwick' plan
The head of one of the world's largest airline groups and owners of British Airways has dismissed plans for a new super-airport covering Heathrow and Gatwick as lacking credibility.
Mr Walsh was speaking after it was revealed that officials at the Department for Transport were looking at plans to create a linked hub, bringing the UK's two leading airports together. The airport's Whitehall code name is Heathwick. By Kamal Ahmed, Sunday Business Editor

Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, said that proposals to link Heathrow and Gatwick with a high-speed rail link would be difficult to deliver and more expensive than the previously rejected project to build a third runway at Heathrow. Mr Walsh was speaking after it was revealed that officials at the Department for Transport were looking at plans to create a linked hub, bringing the UK's two leading airports together. The airport's Whitehall code name is Heathwick. As part of an aviation review, the Government is also looking at proposals to join the RAF base at Northolt, west London, with Heathrow, also with a high-speed rail link. Officials close to the Transport Secretary, Philip Hammond, said that both options were being discuessed but that there appeared to be more draw-backs with the Northolt plans as the runway already there was aligned the wrong way and the base was in the middle of a built up area which threw up more problems than expanding Heathrow. The Government is at present reviewing its aviation policy after criticism that the Coalition's decision to rule out any capacity expansion in the south-east was untenable. The Government is expected to produce a consultation document in the spring. "The challenge it faces are very significant," Mr Walsh said of the Heathwick plan. "It is sub-optimal, it is not an efficient way of doing things. Related Articles

"I don't know how long it would take to develop, I don't know how much it would cost. It would clearly be significantly greater than the previous options that have been rejected. I struggle to see how it would be funded. "The beauty of the third runway at Heathrow was that it was very clear who was going to fund it. It was going to be funded by the airlines flying in there. "Who is going to fund a high-speed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick? The airports are not owned by the same owner anymore. Is it going to come from the taxpayer? I'm not sure the taxpayer would welcome that."
Mr Walsh said that the Government's lack of a coherent aviation policy was a "scandal" and that the UK was in danger of losing out on economic development opportunties by failing to connect with overseas markets. Congestion at Heathrow, which is 98pc full, and high aviation taxes were putting off business travellers, he said. Yesterday a new report on costs to business from the Air Passenger Duty put the figure at £600m a year. "Personally, I think the prospect for a 3rd runway at Heathrow is incredibly slim," Mr Walsh said. "I think the opportunity has been missed and I think we will look back in furture years and say that was a huge mistake. "The fact that they have no plan B and are not likely to have any sort of plan until 2013 at the earliest is a scandal. It highlights the degree to which we have taken the economic contribution that aviation makes for granted."
IAG, which also owns Iberia, is now looking to expand its presence at Lisbon and Madrid airports for access to lucrative Latin America routes. Aviation experts believe that in the longer term it will also look at working with Finnair, also a member of oneworld, at Helsinki to expand the number of connections to Asian growth markets. "Sitting here at an IAG level we have to look at alternatives for growth. I don't see how we can access serious growth when we have a Government that appears to be hell-bent on facilitating the decline and the international status of Heathrow."
He said Heathrow would not be the world's leading hub airport by as early as 2014.

Couple robbed and tortured in Clapham home reveal 'ordeal of unbelievable brutality'
A gang of masked robbers repeatedly raped a 26-year-old mother in her own home as they tried to convince her boyfriend to hand over more cash. Gavin Gordon who was part of a gang that raped a 26-year-old woman in her home in Clapham, south London Photo: PA	4:01PM BST 21 May 2010
Gavin Gordon, 31, who has a string of convictions for violence dating back to his teens, was jailed indefinitely yesterday for the "horrendous and barbaric attack". In an emotional victim impact statement, the woman, who cannot be named, said that she suffers from constant nightmares, repeated panic attacks and has lost two stone through depression since the attack in October 2008. "Before all this happened I was a confident, outgoing girl that enjoyed going out to clubs and had a wide circle of friends,” she said. "Sadly all this has now changed. "I now feel that as a mother I will never be able to protect my daughter, as on that night I could not protect myself. " I still feel totally vulnerable and will live with this for the rest of my life.” In his victim statement, her boyfriend said he lost his job following the attack and became "extremely stressed" that his attackers could be anyone he passed in the street. Southwark Crown Court heard that the woman was leaving her flat shortly after midnight on October 26 2008 when several men approached her and demanded money. They covered her head and forced her back inside her flat, where they made her text her boyfriend and ask him to come over. When he arrived, they tied his hands with his belt and tortured him, wrapping computer cable around his throat, pressing a hot iron against his forehead and thigh, and rubbing lemon juice and bleach into his injuries. He was also repeatedly kicked and punched as the robbers tried to get him to reveal the location of a haul of cash which did not exist. The woman was repeatedly raped as she heard her boyfriend screaming in the next room. The gang later escaped with two cars - an Audi A3 and a Golf GTI, a black Skype 3G mobile phone, a black Nokia mobile phone, £300 in cash and keys. Gordon, whose DNA was found on a juice carton at the property, was found guilty of robbery, unlawful imprisonment, actual bodily harm and theft. Two other men, Reon Hall and Aaron Gelly, both 20 and from Surrey, were sentenced to nine years each in June for their role in the sustained three-hour attack. Jailing Gordon, Judge Stephen Robbins told him: "You and others subjected this man and woman to a sustained attack, an ordeal of unbelievable brutality, subjecting the male to what can only be described as torture, burning him with an iron, covering him in bleach and rubbing lemon juice into his wounds.” "The female was orally raped by one of you in this concerted attack carried out in the mistaken belief there was money to be stolen from the premises."
Gordon's actions "can only be described as horrendous and barbaric crimes on these individuals whose lives have been ruined", the judge said. Crime

Family holiday suggestions
Christine Davies writes
My daughter is trying to find somewhere for her and her 10-year-old son for a holiday with a communal swimming pool and nearby restaurants. She’d prefer to book direct with the owner. Any ideas?
Sophie Butler replies
Portugal’s Algarve offers a good choice of villa and apartment complexes with shared pools, close to beaches and restaurants. Try holidaylettings.co.uk or ownersdirect.co.uk, both of which offer this type of privately owned accommodation. Help driving abroad
Siobhan Weir writes
Are there any useful devices to alert drivers to keep to right-hand side of road when driving in mainland Europe?
Sophie Butler replies
There’s a product called 'Lanesafe’ that projects an image of a red cross and green arrow onto your windscreen to remind you which side of the road to drive on. It’s suitable for both day and night driving, and costs £19.99 from the AA (theaa.com), including p & p.
Accessible hotel rooms
Michael Howard writes
I’m not in a wheelchair but I am looking for a room that is either on the ground floor or close to a lift, with walk-in shower. Is there a website that lists suitable hotels in the UK?
Sophie Butler replies
I suggest you try Open Britain (openbritain.net), a website which offers a useful directory of accessible accommodation throughout the country. The advanced search facility allows you to key in specific requirements at hotels and guest houses. Activity holidays in the Azores
Charlie Devlin writes
Do you know of a holiday company that offers family activity holidays in the Azores? Sophie Butler replies
Archipelago Choice (01768 775672; azoreschoice.com) offers a one- or two-week itinerary in the Azores. A fortnight costs from £4,667 for a family of four, including flights, car hire, self-catered accommodation and a whale-watching trip.
