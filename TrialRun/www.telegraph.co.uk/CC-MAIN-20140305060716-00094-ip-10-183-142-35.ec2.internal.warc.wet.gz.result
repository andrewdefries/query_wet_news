Mike Lynch should be quizzed 'under penalty of perjury'
HP has said it wants Autonomy founder Mike Lynch to answer questions “under penalty of perjury” in the latest stage of a war of wards over allegations of “serious accounting improprieties” at the British technology company.

Comments
On Tuesday, Mr Lynch published an open letter to the US company’s board calling for HP to publish the evidence behind its allegations, saying he “utterly rejects all allegations of impropriety”.
HP shocked the financial world last week by taking a $8.8bn (£5.5bn) writedown and claiming that Autonomy, which it bought in 2011 for $11.1bn, had inflated its profits by using irregular accounting methods.
In its first public statement since the allegations emerged last week, HP said: “While Dr Lynch is eager for a debate, we believe the legal process is the correct method in which to bring out the facts and take action on behalf of our shareholders. In that setting, we look forward to hearing Dr Lynch and other former Autonomy employees answer questions under penalty of perjury.”

Michael Portillo says Eddie Mair did Boris Johnson a favour with BBC interview
Michael Portillo, the former Conservative Party politician, says Eddie Mair did Boris Johnson a favour when he grilled the Mayor of London on The Andrew Marr Show.
Boris Johnson is seen as a contender to be Prime Minister By Tim Walker
7:30AM BST 06 Apr 2013
Comments
Once seen as a serious contender for the top job in British politics himself, Michael Portillo doesn’t think Boris Johnson did himself any harm by agreeing to be interviewed by Eddie Mair, who described him during their bruising encounter as “a nasty piece of work.”
“Boris doesn’t seem to have suffered any damage at all,” Portillo tells Mandrake at the launch of The Speedicut Papers at Buck’s club. “It would be difficult for the next interviewer he faces to be able to take the questions much further, so maybe Eddie Mair has done him a favour.”
Portillo, like the Mayor of London, has faced questions about his own private life and would appear, to some extent, to empathise with him. “I think it’s difficult to draw a proper dividing line between a politician as a public figure, and his private life,” he says. “It is a fact of life that people will be asking difficult questions, and, if Boris wants to go to the top, obviously he’ll have to deal with that.” Portillo, like Johnson, knows the importance of politicians saying the right thing at the right time. Two years before he was a candidate in the 2001 leadership election, he said he had “no ambition” to be leader of the Conservative Party.”
Johnson, in 2002, said there was “not a remote possibility” that he would have a crack at the leadership. Related Articles

Australia declares convicted murderer innocent after 80 years Australia has declared innocent a convicted murderer even though the crime occurred almost 80 years ago and the wrongly-convicted man has been dead for 35 years. Fred McDermott was initially sentenced to death by hanging after his conviction in 1947 but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment By Jonathan Pearlman, Sydney
8:51AM GMT 28 Nov 2012
The family of Fred McDermott, a sheep shearer, has been fighting to clear his name ever since he was found guilty of the murder of Harry Lavers, who disappeared from his farm in 1936. His family said he never recovered from the taint of the conviction and died in 1977 – "a ruined man". In a unanimous decision today which prompted emotional scenes among Mr McDermott's family, the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales ruled that he had suffered a "substantial miscarriage of justice". It was the first time an Australian court has posthumously quashed a conviction and followed the discovery of the victim's corpse in a cave in rural New South Wales in 2004. "We always believed he was innocent," Mr McDermott's second cousin, Betty Sheelah, said after the decision was handed down. "It's a wonderful day for Fred. I wished he was here to share it. This was a stain on our family history. Today he is finally innocent."

Mr McDermott was initially sentenced to death by hanging after his conviction in 1947 but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment. He was freed more than five years later after a Royal Commission and several court appeals, but the conviction was never quashed. The barrister representing Mr McDermott's family said the murder trial had several "unusual, almost freakish" features which led to a miscarriage of justice. The flawed evidence included claims by a woman, Essie King, who said she saw two men near the scene of the crime on the day that Mr Lavers disappeared. Nine years later, she identified Mr McDermott from poorly-shot photographs, including one where Mr McDermott had his eyes closed. There was also evidence that Mr McDermott's de facto wife claimed he had killed Mr Lavers "for a drop of petrol". But the court heard that he was taunted constantly by his wife and would "parrot what she said as his best way of placating her." The family barrister, Tom Molomby, SC, told the court that "the dead matter to the living". "If a person has died, it would seem not only unfair but cruel to close family and friends ... if the conviction could not be quashed," he said. The Crown did not contest the argument of the family and the judges returned with their ruling after a brief adjournment. "We are satisfied the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal, notwithstanding the death of Mr McDermott," Chief Justice Tom Bathurst said. Outside the court, Ms Sheelah said: "The justice system has made what was bad good." Australia
