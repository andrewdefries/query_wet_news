Rupert Christiansen reviews OperaShots at the ROH2 Linbury Studio. 4
More ballet than opera: Esteban Fourmi, Aoi Nakamura in Home as part of OperaShots Photo: Catherine Ashmore	By Rupert Christiansen
5:07PM BST 23 Apr 2012
Comments
Having recently endured the flops of three new operas (Miss Fortune, Circus Tricks and Life is a Dream) produced by companies who should have known better, I hope I can be forgiven for approaching ROH2’s OperaShots with trepidation.
Part of a longer-term programme that commissions left-field composers who have never attempted opera before, its results to date have not been particularly exciting and on entering the auditorium, I took a deep breath and thought of England: bitter experience warned me this was unlikely to be fun.
How wrong that was. Both Graham Fitkin’s Home and Neil Hannon’s Sevastopol proved not only innovative and accomplished but enjoyable, too. Neither has been cowed by the freighted challenge and both have wisely interpreted operatic conventions in their own way, without being arrogantly ambitious. I left wanting more rather than less.
Home is perhaps more ballet than opera, but what does that matter? In little more than half an hour, it explores an atavistically powerful theme: a young couple (danced) move into their new dwelling and work at making it their own. But forces from without – tutelary spirits, eloquently sung by Victoria Couper and Melanie Pappenheim – menace them.
Torches shine through the window and eventually some of the instrumentalists – trumpeter, saxophonist and clarinettist – break though the walls, too, as what seemed secure turns out to be exposed and hostile. Fitkin’s melismatic music and Jasmin Vardimon’s choreography both gather intensity relentlessly, and the performers are admirably assured.

La Fille du Régiment, Royal Opera House, review
20 Apr 2012
Hannon, singer-songwriter for the rock band Divine Comedy and composer of the theme tunes for Father Ted and The IT Crowd, has had an even more unexpected idea. His 40-minute opera, based on the young Tolstoy’s visit to the Crimea in 1854, takes place in eight loosely connected episodes: the tone is naturalistic, with the figure of Tolstoy himself (the excellent Richard Burkhard) providing a linking commentary.
Hannon writes strong, clear recitative and has a gift for melody, albeit of a conventionally tonal kind. The text was audible (which cannot be said of Home), the scenes are sharply contrasted in pace and mood, the scoring is bright and inventive: my attention was held. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to commission a grand opera from Hannon – his technique is unsophisticated – but somebody like Cameron Mackintosh should certainly consider him for a dramatic musical on the Les Miz model. The performance was first-rate.

New drug 'could prolong life of ovarian cancer sufferers' A drug that could prolong the lives of women with ovarian cancer is being tested by scientists. 8:09AM BST 07 Apr 2009
Comments
The development could see the first new treatment for the cancer, a particularly aggressive form which kills 4,500 a year, in more than a decade.
The drug, codenamed CNTO328, could be available within five years, according to researchers. It has been trialled at the Centre for Experimental Cancer Medicine, which is part of Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry. A group of 18 women with the disease, who were expected to live for less than a year, took part in the trial, which began in late 2007. Eight out of the 18 women involved found that their tumours stabilised or shrank while they were taking part. Seven of those eight are still alive.

The drug also did not produce the side effects caused by chemotherapy, including hair loss, vomiting and fatigue.
Professor Iain McNeish, a professor of gynaecological oncology at Barts hospital in London and chief investigator of the trial, told The Guardian: "The results are promising ... The hope with this group of patients was to slow down the progress of their ovarian cancer, improve the quality of their life and possibly make them live longer. "We have been quite successful in doing that. If this becomes a treatment, this is a whole new approach to treating ovarian cancer."
Annwen Jones, the chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, told the newspaper: "This early stage trial certainly shows promise, because it appears that the growth of tumours has been slowed down in a good proportion of the patients who took part in the study. "Women being treated for ovarian cancer could be forgiven for despair, particularly when they grow resistant to chemotherapy and there are no drugs that can get them over this hurdle. Research projects like this are vital if we are to develop desperately needed new treatments." Health News

Chelsea striker Fernando Torres says consistency is key to taking Manchester United's Premier League title next year
Fernando Torres, the Chelsea striker, has said the west Londoners are not "too far away" from being the club who can wrest the Premier League title off champions Manchester United in 12 months time.
Title talk: Fernando Torres already has his eyes on next season's Premier League title Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Telegraph Sport, and agencies
12:00PM BST 20 May 2013
Follow Torres, 29, has enjoyed his highest goals return since his £50 million move from Liverpool in January 2011 - scoring 22 goals in 64 appearances - to take his tally to 35 goals in 131 appearances for Chelsea. The Spaniard, though, has said he hopes to improve next season while the club can launch a credible title bid. "I'm happy for the end of the season, for the statistics this season, but I'm asking much more from myself and hopefully next season can be much better, " Torres said. "The Premier League is tough, because as soon as you lose a couple of games you're out of the race for the league. "Man United were very consistent this season and even Man City couldn't keep winning games the same way and Man United won the league maybe two months before. Related Articles

"We're good enough to be consistent. We need to learn from what we have done badly this season, it's a young squad and hopefully the experience of this year can help the team for the next one. I don't think we're too far away."
Torres, who played under former mentor and Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez in the second half of the season, reflected on a strong finish to another tumultuous campaign at Stamford Bridge. "We must be happy for the way we ended the season," Torres added. "It's not the way we wanted to when we started the season, but during the season you have to adjust the targets and objectives. "In the last couple of months we've been working really hard to secure third place, win the Europa League. We have done both, so we must be happy."
