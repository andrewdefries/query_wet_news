Comments
Works by Iris Grace Halmshaw, who cannot speak, have sold to bidders for more than £800. Her mother Arabella Carter-Johnson, 32, saw her daughter’s work unexpectedly rise to fame after she posted copies of the paintings on Facebook, which received rave reviews, and then decided to set up a website to showcase her daughter’s work. She said: “We realised about three months ago she is actually really talented. Inquiries to buy her paintings were flooding in from all over the world and a framed print sold in a charity auction in London for £830." So far eight of the three-year-old paintings have sold, and her parents are also making prints available (Raymonds)

A spark of insight into autism
16 Jan 2013
Iris Grace was two when she was diagnosed with autism. She rarely made eye contact with her parents and they tried a number of different therapies to try and help her. Mrs Carter-Johnson, of Market Harborough, Leicester, said: "We started with play therapy and we've had speech, equine, occupational and music therapy, looked at her nutrition and quite a few other methods. "She used to be consumed by books, eye contact was a rare occurrence, she didn't want to, or know how to, play with us and got desperately distressed when we took her near any other children. "Her autism has created a style which I've never seen in a child of her age - she has an understanding of colours and how they interact. She beams with excitement and joy when I get out the paints." As the youngster’s works continue to be in demand, her parents are planning on holding an exhibition in London to showcase her works. Mrs Carter-Johnson added: “I would love to think that Iris Grace's story can be an inspiration to any parents with an autistic child." Her father, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, 43, added: "When she started doing art therapy we thought it was amazing, but we're her parents so we think everything she does is amazing. "But lots of other people started saying it was great. It went berserk from there." Culture

Duchess of Cornwall and James Patterson spearhead literary campaign
The Duchess of Cornwall and the world's number one thriller writer team-up to encourage fathers to read to their children more.

Comments
The Duchess of Cornwall and best-selling author James Patterson have teamed up to encourage fathers to read more with their children, as part of a new literary campaign. The UK’s leading reading charity Booktrust are launching ‘Get Dads Reading’ after conducting research that reveals some worrying trends about family reading habits. The Duchess of Cornwall, who is a patron of the charity, and Patterson, the number one best-selling thriller writer in the world, yesterday visited a dads’ reading group in Greenwich to lend their support to the cause. A poll carried out by Opinium shows that just 13% of fathers are the main reader with their children. A quarter of them blame late working hours as the main reason, but further research from the Institute of Education suggests that many fathers see reading as being a typically female domain. When they do read to their children, fathers tend to favour their daughters over their sons by reading to them for longer and more often. The research surveyed 1,016 parents of children aged 0-11 and revealed that 43% of mothers read to their children everyday compared to just 26% of fathers. In addition to long working hours, fathers blame being too tired and many are already satisfied with the amount of time they spend reading with their children. Booktrust have described the findings as a “major concern”, as a father’s involvement in their child’s early reading is proven to boost academic success and improve social and emotional wellbeing.

23 Jan 2013
Viv Bird, chief executive of Booktrust says: "The most crucial thing for dads to understand is that if kids see their dads reading, they’re more likely to enjoy it themselves. There is evidence that boys are slipping further behind girls in reading – and this emphasises how important it is that dads are positive role models to their sons as well as their daughters when it comes to reading." The Booktrust campaign will enable fathers to access a whole range of resources and guidance about how to get the most out of reading with their children. A host of celebrity fathers, known as the Booktrust’s ‘Dad’s Army’, will be lending their support to the campaign. Patterson, one of the 'Dad's Army', says of the campaign: “I believe that dads have a huge role to play in encouraging their children to read. We need to give fathers the support they need in reading to their children. If I can help dads to understand their role in making books and reading more important in children’s lives, I’ll be a happy man.”

How about that
Three hour mission to rescue goat from rock ends when animal hops away Rescue workers spent three hours trying to reach a goat they believed was stranded on a rock only for it to hop away on its own when they got within reaching distance. 11:18AM BST 10 Oct 2012
Rescue teams called to help out a stranded goat where left wondering why they had bothered after the creature leapt to safety of its own accord. The female goat, dubbed 'Black Rock Billie' had been stuck on the ledge outside the village of Cornholme, near Todmorden, West Yorks, for around five days.
Rescue teams lowered a rope down the high rock face but as workers got within touching distance of Billie she unexpectedly suddenly jumped onto nearby rocks and leapt ten feet down into a field.
She trotted away unscathed none the worse for her ordeal - as villagers broke out in a round of applause.
Footage of the rescue on Cornholme Craggs outside the village of Cornholme, near Todmorden, West Yorks, was posted onto YouTube.

Major rescue for 'amorous' couple who fell over wall
13 Jan 2013
Calder Valley Search and Rescue Team based in Hebden Bridge were asked by police to go and help the animal after concerns that it might have been ''stuck'' on the ledge for up to five days with no food, water or sleep - just inches from a 40ft drop.
Team leader Al Day, who works as a paramedic, said: "We were contacted by Cornholme residents who were concerned that their community goat, "Black Rock Billie" had been stuck on a narrrow ledge for five days.
''A couple of villagers had already attempted to rescue the goat themselves using makeshift ropes and the police were worried that someone might fall and seriously injure themselves so we agreed to turn out to help.
''The ledge was also crumbling so of course it was a worry that the goat herself which was something of a local celebrity in the village might fall.
''There was quite a crowd of villagers at the scene but we formulated a plan with the RSPCA to lower one of our team members down to the stricken goat to coax it away along the path it had taken to get onto the ledge.
''Our guy got down to the ledge from the opposite side of the path the goat had orginally taken and as a result she trotted off the other way to safety.
''Another of the team had been on standby with a harness on the side just in case but he wasn't needed. ''Billie appears to be none the worse for her ordeal, much to the relief of her local admirers. It is fair to say she is now safely eating grass and contemplating the days events.
''It was one of our more unusual rescues. Normally we help walkers who need rescuing from the moors and we helped out during recent flooding. But it is rare we are called upon to rescue animals.
''On this occasion the locals were cheering and clapping us and lady was so grateful she gave the rescue team a substantial donation.'' Local Labour councillor Penny Langham said: "They took quite a long while up there because they were trying to work out the best way of rescuing the goat without scaring her.
"There are a couple of goats up there all the while and have been ever since I can remember and they seem happy enough.
"But I suppose if there were any real concerns about them getting old and frail then the RSPCA could step in and have a look."
An onlooker said: "Black Rock Billie is safe. The goat just needed to be scared off I think. But we should thank the mountain rescue for what they did."
Villager Leanne Blake said: ''The rescue was absolutely amazing. Everyone cheered for joy. The RSPCA and Search and Rescue teams are worth their weight in gold.''
Calder Valley Search and Rescue Team is manned entirely by volunteers and receives no funding from the government. Running costs are £30,000 a year - so the group is always on the lookout for donations and supporters.
Last month the team helped victims of severe flooding in Hebden Bridge and during once incident a policeman had to be rescued from his patrol care after it began floating away due to the torrent of water. All donations go towards maintaining the team's base, equipment and vehicles - or the purchase of new equipment.
People are also encouraged to make a contribution by donating their own professional skills, helping out with fundraising or at one of the team's events, joining training sessions playing a 'casualty' or by joining the support group.

Sketch: A minister's toughest audience... toddlers
Michael Deacon watches Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, give a speech about child poverty - in a nursery.
Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be determined to focus on preventing marital breakdown and helping more families to stay together Photo: GEOFF PUGH	By Michael Deacon, Parliamentary Sketchwriter
4:36PM GMT 15 Nov 2012
Follow In 1999 Tony Blair pledged to abolish child poverty by 2020. As 2020 is still over seven years away it would be unfair to speak too soon, although at present it does look as if the pledge is about as likely to be met as Mr Blair’s similar pledges to abolish rain, sadness and socks going missing in the wash. In any case, we now have a different government, and it’s decided to take a different approach. This morning Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, announced that he wants to redefine child poverty. Admittedly there may be Left-wing cynics who would say that his government has in a sense been redefining child poverty ever since it came to power (“You thought that was child poverty? That was nothing! This is child poverty!”). But that of course would be grossly unfair. What Mr Duncan Smith meant was that we need to measure child poverty in a new way: not just by family income but by other factors, such as parental joblessness, poor housing and going to a bad school. To me this revised definition of poverty seems eminently sensible, and indeed I intend to put it to my bank the next time they fine me for being overdrawn. (“For heaven’s sake, stop judging me by how little money I have. Judge me by my exam results, the lovely suburb I grew up in, and the number of parents I have who are in work. By these measures I’m very well off, and I demand a large, interest-free loan on the strength of it.”) Related Articles

Child poverty: minimum wage 'does not meet basic costs of raising children'
05 Sep 2012
Mr Duncan Smith made his announcement at a nursery, or Early Childhood Centre, in south-east London. It looked a suitable area, but one drawback with nurseries, or Early Childhood Centres, is that they tend to contain children. As a result, numerous members of Mr Duncan Smith’s audience were under the age of four. And, as such audiences often will, they proved to be somewhat vocal. Thus the Secretary of State’s serious and heartfelt speech was punctuated by heckles such as “Doh!”, “Mooo!” and “Uuuurgh!”
“The disproportionate focus on income,” Mr Duncan Smith said gravely, “does little to reflect the experience of those trapped in poverty.”
“No, no, NO!” cried a small boy. “A closer look will show that real incomes did not rise.”
“NO!”
“It may seem strange, a politician coming here to say, ‘I’m not going to claim a massive success for something'.”
“OW!”
“Harnessing the expertise of local organisations, charities and…”
“DADDY!”
The poor man. Trying to give an important speech while his audience sat drooling, groaning and burbling nonsense. He must have felt as if he was at party conference. Still, throughout the atonal chorus of wails and squeals, he soldiered on. Politely, the Quiet Man resisted any impulse he may have felt to turn up the volume. From time to time, parents hissed, “Ssshhh!” I’m almost certain it was the children they were trying to silence. Politics

Michu: £2m
Michael Laudrup appears to have pulled off the bargain signing of this season in taking Michu from Rayo Vallecano to Wales. Already with 13 goals in the league and helping Swansea to within touching distance of a Wembley final, he is now worth at least 10 times that price. Picture: ACTION IMAGES

Brendan Rodgers plays envelope mind games and picks three players 'who will let team down' in 'Being Liverpool'
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has opened himself up to even more scrutiny, and potential ridicule, after being filmed playing psychological games on his players.

In the latest episode from the reality TV series Being Liverpool, Rodgers is seen attempting a variation on mind games played by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United nearly 20 years ago. Back in 1992, Fergie told his squad that he had put the names of three players who would let the team down the following season into an envelope as a means of making his squad deal with success. He later admitted in his biography that there was actually no such envelope. In Being Liverpool, Rodgers shows his team three envelopes and reveals that, inside, are the names of three players who will "let us down this year". In the clip, Rodgers says to his team: "When I arrived here, the first few days were analysing the group, the staff, the players. "I think there’s three players who will let us down this year - the cause, the fight, everything. And I have written them down already. Related Articles

"Now my point to you as players - and staff - is make sure you are not the one in the envelope, because you are so important. "If we are going to achieve, to be the best we can, we need to be together. But I think there’s three, maximum, who will let us down. Make sure you’re not the one."
If Rodgers thought this would coax the best out of his players, though, he was very much mistaken as the very next day Liverpool lost their opening game of the season 3-0 at West Brom. Being Liverpool is exclusively on Channel 5 on Friday at 9pm.

London 2012 Olympics: Ye Shiwen swim described as 'disturbing' by United States coaching expert
Ye Shiwen, the 16-year-old Chinese swimmer who has been the story of the pool in London, broke another record on Monday night. Shiwen Ye is delighted after breaking the 400m-medley world record, but controversy over her performance has arisen Photo: PA	By Duncan White, Aquatics Centre
5:14PM BST 30 Jul 2012
Follow Her swim in winning the 400m medley in world record time on Saturday had been described as “disturbing” by a respected US coach earlier in the day but the scrutiny being placed on her performance clearly did not affect her. She went quickest in the semi-final of the 200m medley in a time of 2 mins 08.39sec, breaking Stephanie Rice’s Olympic record by 0.06sec. Ye broke the world record in winning the 400m individual medley on Saturday in a time of 4:28.43, taking more than a second off Rice’s record. It was not even supposed to be her strongest event: it is over 200m that she is world champion. What made her swim even more remarkable is that her final split time, of 28.93, was 0.17 quicker than that of Ryan Lochte in the men’s 400m medley earlier that evening. John Leonard, the executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association since 1989, said that the coaches he represents on the whole felt the swim was “unbelievable”. “I use that word in its precise meaning,” he said. “At this point it is not believable to many people.”

We might not win a medal but at least we got here
28 Jul 2012
Leonard and his organization have been at the forefront of fighting doping in the sport for the last two decades. In the Monday morning heat, Ye had delivered another remarkable performance. She comfortably beat a field containing Olympic champion Rice, Olympic silver medalist Kirsty Coventry and Britain’s Hannah Miley and even appeared to slow up on her freestyle leg — which was slower than the final 50m she had pulled out at the end of the 400m individual medley. Her winning time of 2:08.90 was the same as she had recorded in winning the World Championships as a 15 year-old last year. Even without swimming in hard in the earlier preliminary heat, she was only 0.45 outside Rice’s Olympic record of 2:08.45, a time that was recorded before the ban on high-tech polyurethane suits. Still, that time is significantly short of Ariana Kukors’s world record of 2:06.15, which was recorded at the World Championships in Rome in 2009. Ye’s brilliant performances were branded “disturbing” by Leonard, who said that her performances brought back “a lot of awful memories” of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith’s winning performance in the 400m medley at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Smith, who married Erik de Bruin, the Dutch shot-putter who in 1993 was banned for four years for doping, was also banned for four years in 1998 after failing a drugs test. Leonard said that Ye “looks like superwoman. Any time someone has looked like superwoman in the history of our sport they have later been found guilty of doping”. Ye defended herself against those claiming her results were too good to be true. “The Chinese team keep very firmly to the anti-doping policies, so there is absolutely no problem,” Ye said. “We want to be very careful about calling it doping,” Leonard said. “The one thing I will say is that history in our sport will tell you that every time we see something, and I will put quotation marks around this, ’unbelievable’, history shows us that it turns out later on there was doping involved. "That last 100m was reminiscent of some old East German swimmers, for people who have been around a while. It was reminiscent of 400m individual medley by a young Irish woman in Atlanta.”
Leonard made the point that Ye’s final 100m freestyle leg of the 400m medley was quicker than any woman had gone in the second 100m of a 200m freestyle race. "I have heard commentators saying ’well she is 16, and at that age amazing things happen,'” he said. London 2012
