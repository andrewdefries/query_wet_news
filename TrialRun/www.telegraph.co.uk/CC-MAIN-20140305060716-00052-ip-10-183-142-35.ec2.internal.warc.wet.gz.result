Digital literacy 'as important as reading and writing'
Considering the importance placed on digital literacy in many career roles, the new 2014 curriculum seems a step in the right direction – but does more still need to be done? Open access social media in schools can of course have its downsides – but this is yet another area where an emphasis on digital literacy can help young people. Photo: Alamy	By Josie Gurney-Read

When I was at school, ICT was labelled, rightly or wrongly, as the “doss lesson”. Unlike English, maths and science, ICT was not tested and, as such, was universally thought of as an hour of either surfing the internet, or falling asleep over yet another lesson in Microsoft Office. Considering the importance placed on digital literacy in many career roles, the new 2014 curriculum, announced in July by Michael Gove the Education Secretary, seems a step in the right direction. >> Teaching our children to code: a quiet revolution With the focus shifting from general ICT skills towards computer science, there has been debate over whether teaching children as young as 5 the basics in computer programming is really necessary in the curriculum? Mark Surman, Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation, argues that skills such as these are as important as learning to read and write. Related Articles

“Becoming literate in how the technical world works is equivalent to reading, writing and maths. We need to look at this fourth literacy as mainstream,” he says. “Not just at the level of the very basics of operating a computer but actually understanding how the code and mechanics behind it work. In the same way that if all you had was oral communication and you didn’t have writing, you really wouldn’t understand the logic of our society.” After-school, volunteer led projects such as Code Club are taking steps to introduce coding into schools, and by the end of 2015 the club hopes to be in 25 per cent of primary schools across the UK. Working up from the first programme ‘Scratch’, learners progress through four terms of work until they begin learning programming language, Python – starting out with basic concepts to create animations and games. However, whilst progression in the standard of digital literacy in schools is slowly improving, Jodie Lopez, Champion Schools Coordinator at Pearson thinks that more needs to be done to embed these advances across the whole curriculum. “I think there is still a big gap to be narrowed between the schools that are and the schools that aren’t incorporating digital literacy into the whole curriculum,” she says. “I was made ICT coordinator in 2009 at the school I previously taught at and it was very much my vision that ICT shouldn’t be seen as a stand alone subject.” “I set up gettingintoliteracy.com because I wanted to focus on using ICT in literacy, but ideally these skills would be implemented across other subjects as well. "In art, for example, the curriculum states that children should be able to use paint, pencil and clay, but nothing about digital, and yet, most art jobs that you would go into now, would involve a huge element of digital. That is where more changes need to happen.” Embedding digital literacy lessons and, furthermore, social media across the curriculum certainly opens up a variety of educational tools for teachers. In a recent survey conducted by Pearson, figures suggest that around one in six 15 year olds use social media for careers advice, while only 1 per cent of 15 year olds prioritise information from careers books. Open access social media in schools can of course have its downsides – but this is yet another area where an emphasis on digital literacy can help young people. “If you want your kids to be smart and safe in the digital world – whether that is in school or out of school – having them understand how the technology works, how copyright works, how identity works, is way more important than whether they have access to information or not” says Mark. “The focus of a lot of schools seems to be blocking them off, which is always going to be somewhere between ineffective and useless,” he continues. “Kids live in a digital world, so if we can teach them about what’s going on and how to protect themselves and think critically, then we will be in a much better situation.” “We need to remember that it’s early days for the education market and social media,” says Tom Hall, VP of Education Technology Partnerships at Pearson. “Openness and trust of students is important, but we have to be careful. One theme which came out of Pearson’s Social Media Week discussion was the need to ‘educate’ kids on their social behaviour – children don’t always think about the audience they are projecting to.” Training teachers in the concepts of digital literacy will be one of the biggest challenges ahead, Mark tells me. There are many teachers who want to incorporate digital technology in lessons but who need to upgrade their skills to do so. However, on the other side of the coin, there are skilled teachers who are looking for an opportunity to use digital technology creatively. “I would hope that in five years time, we are no longer talking about computer science versus ICT,” says Mark. “But that we are actually talking about the fact that understanding how the digital world works, is as important as reading, writing and maths for every student. “If you don’t really understand how the digital world functions you’re really living in a world where you don’t have the creative and innovation skills that are going to be needed in the future economy. “The ability to embed learning digital skills inside what we might think of as traditional skills, across the whole curriculum, is certainly something to think about.” Education Opinion

Millions told they will have to work longer or cut spending to pay the mortgage
Millions of homeowners have been warned they will have to work longer hours, or cut spending, to be able to pay the mortgage when interest rates start to rise. A quarter of the estimated 11.2 million mortgage holders in the country is on interest only deals Photo: PA	By Steve Hawkes

In a bleak warning, the Bank of England warned that just a small rise in rates from the current 0.5 to 1.5 per cent could cause significant levels of "borrower distress" and yet more bank losses. A rise to 2.5 per cent could force households holding 20 per cent of Britain's £1.3 trillion of mortgage debt to take some kind of action to keep up with repayments. This could include "cutting essential spending, earning more income or changing mortgage". The Bank's comments came in its latest Financial Stability Report, which said that last year, almost a fifth of mortgage holders had less than £200 of disposable income a month. A one per cent increase in interest rates would push repayments on a £100,000 mortgage up by more than £60 a month. Related Articles

The BoE's warning came a day after outgoing Governor Sir Mervyn King said large numbers of households could be affected when rates return to "normal". Interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009 after the Bank of England slashed the cost of borrowing to prevent an even bigger recession at the height of the credit crisis. There are an estimated 11.2 million mortgage holders in the country - with around a quarter on interest only deals. Experts tonight said it may still be 2015 before the BoE feels confident enough in the recovery to push up interest rates. But they warned that banks and building societies may be forced to increase mortgage prices before that point because of increases in their own costs. Matt Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said the BoE's warning would fuel concerns the housing market was over-valued. He added that people rushing to pick up cheap mortgages under the Chancellor's Help to Buy and New Buy schemes could suffer as markets move against them in the coming years. He told the Daily Telegraph: "We don't think rates are going to go up any time soon but this shows why schemes such as Help to Buy could be a bad idea."
Ray Boulger of mortgage advisor John Charcol added: "The problem for me is not how much rates will go up by but how quickly. If they go up a long way too quickly people will really feel it, particularly those on interest only deals."

Thailand coup fears as Prime Minister orders security crackdown
Tens of thousands of police have been ordered out onto the streets of Bangkok tomorrow after the Thai Prime Minister warned that a planned opposition rally was in fact a demonstration aimed at overthrowing the government.

3:05PM GMT 23 Nov 2012
Yingluck Shinawatra went on TV to say that Saturday's rally by the opposition Protect Siam group is a threat to Thailand's security and that she would be invoking the Internal Security Act (ISA) in three districts of central Bangkok in response to the perceived threat.
The special law gives the security forces wider powers of arrest and enables them to impose curfews, ban public gatherings and block off areas of the city.
Political analysts said that the use of the ISA was an attempt by Ms Yingluck to ensure the loyalty of the army, who ousted her elder brother and exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a coup in 2006. "By invoking the ISA, Yingluck is forcing the army to back her," said Professor of political science Pitch Pongsawat of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.
The timing of the rally is significant, coming just one day before the start of a three day censure debate in parliament called by the opposition Democrat Party, in response to what they allege is Ms Yingluck's incompetent handling of government affairs.

Organisers of the rally expect half a million people to gather in Bangkok's Royal Plaza. While police anticipate a turnout of no more than 100,000, the protest will re-expose the deep divisions within Thai society that led to deadly clashes between Thaksin supporters known as red shirts and the conservative, pro-Royalist yellow shirts in Bangkok in 2010.
Tida Tawornseth, the chairwoman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), the red shirt political organisation, told the Daily Telegraph that the UDD were opposed to the demonstration going ahead. "It's not right in principle because the current government was rightfully-elected by a majority of the people," she said. Mrs Tida said red shirts would stay away from the rally but would be on standby if there was any sign of an attempted coup.
Protect Siam is the latest umbrella grouping of the opponents of Ms Yingluck's government. While its leader retired General Boonlert Kaewprasit has denied calling for a coup, he does want to "freeze" what he says are corrupt politicians from serving in Ms Yingluck's government, which he claims is merely a proxy for the former Thaksin regime.
With a large majority in the Thai Parliament, Ms Yingluck has outmanoeuvred the Democrat Party recently, promoting several former Thaksin loyalists to the cabinet in the last month. Her own personal status has been bolstered by last week's meeting with both Queen Elizabeth and President Obama, who pointedly referred to her as the democratically-elected leader of Thailand.

Heineken Cup talks in deadlock as top English clubs consider alternative competitions
England’s leading clubs are set to consider a number of radical alternatives to the Heineken Cup at a board meeting next month that could shape the future of the European game, Telegraph Sport can disclose.

Up for discussion are a world club championship, a fourth England Test match every autumn and an expanded Premiership. An enhanced and expanded Anglo-Welsh competition, including a new sevens tournament, is also expected to come under consideration as an alternative to the nine European weekends in the current season. It is understood Premiership Rugby is to put the proposals to club owners and shareholders amid increasing frustration at the lack of progress on negotiations with its fellow European Rugby Cup stakeholders over the future structure of the current European competitions. The English and French clubs served the necessary two years’ notice to leave the current accord that governs the Heineken and Amlin Challenge Cup more than nine months ago. The English clubs, along with their French counterparts, are demanding reform of the Heineken Cup, including a reduction of the number of clubs from 24 to 20, a strengthening of the Amlin Challenge Cup and the introduction of a third tier competition.

While it would still prefer to strike a deal with its ERC stakeholders and make new European competitions work, Premiership Rugby is not prepared to accept the status quo, which guarantees all four Italian and Scottish Pro12 clubs places in the Heineken Cup. After four stakeholder meetings, there is still no sign of any agreement being reached. With no further meetings planned – and it is understood the issue was not raised at the regular ERC board meeting last week ahead of this weekend’s quarter-finals – there is a growing sense of urgency in the English game to consider real alternatives for the 2014-15 season when, in the absence of agreement, the Heineken Cup will cease to exist. Premiership Rugby has already presented a compromise over its original demand that only the top six of the Pro12 clubs should qualify for the Heineken Cup, suggesting that the top four Pro12 sides would qualify, with the final two qualifiers based on geography to ensure every country was represented in the tournament. That has not been accepted by the other ERC stakeholders. Parallel to its search for a European solution, Premiership Rugby is understood to have held exploratory talks with the Super Rugby clubs in the southern hemisphere as well as the Welsh regions. It is understood the possibility of a world club championship, staged every two years and involving the champions of the leagues in the northern and southern hemisphere including Super Rugby, is one concept expected to be put forward for further consideration by the English club owners. A Premiership expanded from 12 to 14 sides would also give clubs an extra two home games and four extra rounds, and their financial position is strengthened by the controversial new television deal with BT Vision, which for Premiership games alone will almost cover current income from both the Premiership and European competitions. That deal caused widespread anger in the Celtic unions and led to ERC also announcing on the same day last September an extension of the current agreement with Sky Sports. Premiership Rugby is also likely to present a proposal for consideration to extend its current deal of releasing its players to the Rugby Football Union once every two years for a fourth Test match outside the International Rugby Board autumn window. A fourth Test every year would be worth at least £3 million in extra revenue to the Premiership clubs, who currently receive around £8.5 million for their participation in the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup. Reform of the distribution of central ERC revenue is also one of the main demands of the English and French clubs. Currently the Pro12 clubs receive 52 per cent of funding with the English and French receiving 24 per cent each. That format has meant the Pro12 clubs have benefited to the tune of €30 million (£25.5 million) over the last five years, according to Premiership Rugby’s calculations. The English and French clubs both want an equal three-way split in funding between the three leagues. Exploratory talks with the four regions in Wales last month are unlikely to lead to Welsh clubs joining the Premiership despite the fallout between the Cardiff Blues, Scarlets, Ospreys and Newport Gwent Dragons over funding and player contracts. However, Premiership Rugby believes the commercial value of the LV Cup has not been maximised. The potential for increased revenues as part of the Premiership’s BT Vision deal for European games could also tempt the Welsh regions to consider a new European competition if the dispute over the Heineken Cup is not resolved. How clubs could fill their vacant European weekends
Plan A
A world club championship, held every two years, could run over two or three weekends, bringing together the champions of leagues from both hemispheres including Super Rugby clubs. Talks have already been held with SANZAR clubs, and the likes of Natal Sharks would be a huge draw in England.
Plan B
A Premiership expanded from 12 to 14 clubs would give each club two more guaranteed home games – they presently host three in the European competition – and four extra rounds. An enhanced Anglo-Welsh tournament would also help fill the nine European weekends.
Plan C
Allowing the release of their players for a fourth England Test match outside of the International Rugby Board window every autumn – currently they are released only once every two years – could net the Premiership clubs an extra £3million per game. Their present annual share of ERC revenue is £8.5million.
