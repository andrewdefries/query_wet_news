Trader loses £30m bonus over 'rigging’ at Deutsche
A Deutsche Bank trader has lost more than £30m in bonuses after being fired for allegedly trying to manipulate interest rates.

8:00PM GMT 25 Jan 2013
Follow Christian Bittar, one of the bank’s best-paid traders, has had the scheduled payout “clawed back” by his former employer.
Deutsche Bank dismissed Mr Bittar in 2011 for allegedly colluding with a Barclays trader to fix benchmark interest rates in his favour in order to boost the value of his trades.
The lender said the $53m (£34m) bonuses it has withheld were “unvested compensation”, meaning that Mr Bittar earned them in the years before 2011 but they had yet to pay out.
Deutsche Bank is conducting an investigation into its workers’ involvement in rigging benchmark interest rates. Mr Bittar’s alleged attempts to manipulate Euribor, the eurozone’s version of Libor, and similar alleged efforts by derivatives trader Guillaume Adolph over yen-dominated Libor are the focus of the probe.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said: “Upon discovering that a limited number of employees acted inappropriately, we have sanctioned or dismissed employees, clawed back the unvested compensation of employees, and will continue to do so as we complete our investigation.”

He added that the lender had found “no link between the inappropriate conduct of a limited number of employees and the profits generated by these trades”.
The bank has previously said that its review indicates that no “current or former member of the management board had any inappropriate involvement in the interbank offered rates matters under review”.
Mr Adolph was dismissed by Deutsche Bank in 2011, reportedly for inappropriate communications with UBS AG trader Thomas Hayes. Mr Hayes has since been charged by US prosecutors over the manipulation of interest rates.
Mr Bittar, who now works for hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management, has not been charged with any crime.
Since most banks had a three-year deferred bonus policy when Mr Bittar was working at Deutsche Bank, the clawed back bonuses may relate to work he did as long ago as 2008. Under a standard three-year deferral programme, two thirds of deferred 2008 bonuses would have already vested, suggesting his original bonuses may have been considerably larger. Deutsche did not comment on the level of Mr Bittar’s bonuses.
More than a dozen banks around the world are under investigation for manipulating global interest rates.

Zimbabwe's Anglicans forced to worship in pubs Tens of thousands of Zimbabwe's Anglicans are being forced to worship in pubs, tents and private schools while their churches stand empty, shuttered by a controversial bishop loyal to President Robert Mugabe. Zimbabwe Anglicans worshipping at Borrowdale racecourse By Peta Thornycroft, Harare and Aislinn Laing in Johannesburg
6:29PM GMT 25 Mar 2011
About 40 per cent of the country's Anglican churches are now in the hands of Nolbert Kunonga, who was unfrocked as Bishop of Harare in 2007 after he split from the Anglican province of Central Africa in protest at the introduction of homosexual priests.
When worshippers chose to follow the official church's newly-appointed Bishop of Harare, Chad Gandiya, they were chased out of Harare's cathedral and tear-gassed by police.
Many churches are now only unlocked for services for a handful of stalwarts of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Followers of Mr Kunonga have torn down the cathedral's colonial artefacts, broken up pews bearing memorial plaques, taken over church buildings including a ten-storey city centre office block and rented out the Bishop's residence.
Mr Kunonga, who swore Mr Mugabe into office in June 2008, was given a white-owned farm north of Harare following the land seizures in 2000. Anglican bishops are now awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court which they hope will restore church property. For now, they are leading services in any facility open to them.

'Zimbabwe faces anarchy in months'
19 Aug 2007
Last Sunday, 150 worshippers packed into the Stewards lounge of the Mashonaland Turf Club above Zimbabwe's only racecourse.
They took communion among the bar stools and sang hymns in the majority Shona language accompanied by drums.
One of the lay preachers, Mary Nyandoro, told the congregation: "God expects us to live a full life regardless of what we are going through, like worshipping in a pub. We built a house in which to worship but must now pray here."
In central Harare, 27 Zanu-PF supporters worshipped in the 1,000-seater St Mary and All Saints Cathedral and sang, unaccompanied, "Onward Christian soldiers" in English. Bishop Gandiya said 30 churches in Harare alone were now out of bounds to his flock, including those with large congregations in the high-density suburbs. "These congregations are so determined to continue worshipping within the Anglican community that they have all found alternative places," he said.
Julius Makoni, Bishop of the Manicaland diocese in eastern Zimbabwe, said Mr Kunonga has also taken over St John's Cathedral in provincial capital, Mutare. "We worship in the Mutare Sports Club," Bishop Makoni said. Religion

Time-lapse: Mars Rover's nine-month mission condensed into 60 seconds
YouTube user Karl Sanford has assembled thousands of still images taken over nine months of Curiosity's mission to date on the red planet into a single video. 5:22PM BST 28 May 2013
Comments
This video is compiled from still images taken by Curiosity's Front Hazard Avoidance Cameras, which allow the rover's operators to see obstacles in its path. Karl Sanford built the timelapse using pictures taken from Sol 0 – Sol, being one complete day on Mars – to Sol 281.
In the video, which he uploaded to YouTube, viewers can see the rover’s 7-foot robotic arm sweeping over the Martian landscape as it gathers samples during its hunt for evidence of microbes on the surface of the planet. The project is Nasa's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes of the 1970s, and the landing came as a much-welcome success for a space agency beleaguered by budget cuts and the recent cancellation of its 30-year-old space shuttle programme.

Udinese v Liverpool: Brendan Rodgers banks on Luis Suarez in Europa League decider
Luis Suárez will make his first European appearance away from Anfield for Liverpool against Udinese on Thursday with manager Brendan Rodgers ready to field a full-strength team for the club’s Europa League decider.

Liverpool, who are second in Group A, travel to Italy knowing they must match the result gained by Swiss club Young Boys against Guus Hiddink’s Anzhi Makhachkala to progress to the knockout stages. And having rested Suárez for Liverpool’s trips to face Young Boys in Bern and Anzhi in Moscow, Rodgers has told the Uruguayan forward that he will be required against the group’s bottom club. Suárez, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer this season with 13 goals in all competitions, will miss Sunday’s Premier League game against West Ham at Upton Park because of suspension, thereby nullifying the need to be rested again in Europe. Meanwhile, Liverpool defender Daniel Agger claims that the team will travel to Udine with confidence returning to the club under Rodgers. “Confidence is a big thing here and we have it,” Agger said. “We are brave on the ball, we want to go forward. We aren’t just playing it around. That’s a big difference from last season. There is more control and we are creating more chances than last season. Related Articles
