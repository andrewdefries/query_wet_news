The Monday interview: Santander UK chief Ana Botin
Having run a dotcom start-up, Santander UK chief Ana Botin knows just how tough life can be for entrepreneurs

Ana Botin is just reaching the crux of a speech to small businessmen when the fire alarm goes off. For 30 seconds or so the most senior woman in British banking remains at the lectern but, as the audience rises to its feet, she bows to the inevitable and joins the queue for the exit. Ten minutes later, and now back inside Oxford University’s Said Business School, the Santander UK chief executive appears unperturbed by the disruption, though owing to her schedule, which involves lunching with the university’s vice chancellor, giving a lecture to business students, and meeting with the students union, she will not get to finish her speech. Never mind, her audience of local businessmen has probably got the point: Santander likes small businesses. Among the ranks of Britain’s banking establishment, Ms Botin is perhaps unique for having run a small business herself during the white heat of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. The experience was not an entirely happy one. Web consulting firm Prolink SA, later renamed Razona, rode the highs and lows of the period before being bought out in 2002. That left Ms Botin to end her self-imposed exile from banking and return to the family business, Santander, which is still chaired by her father, Emilio. Related Articles

However, the lessons learned from the experience have informed her approach to banking ever since. “The thing that really sticks, and when you talk to entrepreneurs they say the same, is just thinking about the next day, the next week. If you don’t get the contract you might not survive. It’s that sense that I might not be here in a few days or a few weeks if I cannot achieve this new sale or this new contract,” she says. “My God, that was something else.”
Harder than her nine years working on the notoriously tough trading floor of JP Morgan in New York? “Oh, much tougher, yes. Anybody who has run a small company has gone through such a hard time . . . I mean, attracting people. I have always built businesses – even back at Santander in the early 90s I was helping to build the Latin American bank, creating new groups of people, hiring people – but it [running your own business] was a totally different story.”
As the head of one Britain’s largest high street banks, with 1,300 branches across the country, Ms Botin is determined to demonstrate that she has not forgotten those hard-learned lessons . At Banesto – the medium-sized Spanish lender controlled by Santander, into which she was parachuted by her father to run, when she returned to banking 10 years ago – Ms Botin became well-known for travelling the country with a key message. She would preach to small businesses a mantra of technological modernisation and the need to embrace globalisation. Today at Santander UK she is bringing the same message to British businesses as part of a concerted strategy to become the “UK’s SME bank of choice”. “We are the most British of Britain’s banks” says Ms Botin, to laughter from the floor during her disrupted speech. “This always gets a chuckle, I don’t why,” she deadpans in reply. In part, the strategic pivot towards SMEs is born of necessity. Last month, Ms Botin and the Santander UK board made the controversial decision to scrap the planned purchase of 316 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland after a long period of delays. Withdrawing from the deal left the bank with a bill of about £50m but also with more than £2bn of equity capital that had been allocated to fund the purchase burning a hole in its pocket. Using this spare capital, Ms Botin says she will be “accelerating” the expansion of the bank’s small business lending, which has already grown by 20pc every year since 2009 to more than £10bn of gross outstanding loans. “This is net new lending,” she says. “People who are banking with us are switching from other banks. Without us there would be less credit available today.”
Unsurprisingly, Santander has been an enthusiastic supporter of the government’s Funding for Lending scheme launched in July, and has already drawn down £1bn of the £9.4bn of cheap funds for which it is eligible. On Thursday the bank announced it would be providing £500m of asset financing to help small businesses purchase new equipment. These moves have endeared Ms Botin and Santander UK to the authorities and even the most senior officials privately repeat the line that the bank is the most British of the country’s banks. However, despite wrapping itself in the Union Jack, the bank is still a long way from achieving its core aim of floating its UK business. Before Ms Botin joined Santander UK late in 2010 – in the wake of Antonio Horta-Osorio’s move to become chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group – the flotation of the business had seemed imminent. Since then the deadline for the float, like the aborted takeover of the RBS branches, has receded into the distance and at present is assumed to be off the agenda entirely. “Neither the markets nor the regulations would have allowed us to do an IPO,” says Ms Botin. “We need the other UK banks to rise in value before we can float. We are not going to float at the current depressed valuations.”
The incoming structural reforms recommended by the Vickers Commission are likely to impact Santander the least of the major banks but are likely to act as a continued brake on the price investors are willing to pay for British bank stocks, admits Ms Botin. “We need the banks to be attractive to investors again. If you look at where investors could put their money at the moment, it is clear that banks are not that attractive,” she says. However, she is quick to head off any speculation that Santander will cut and run from a business that has become the bank’s second largest after its Brazilian operations. “We are here to stay,” she insists. Ms Botin points out that Santander should by all rights be considered “one of the largest foreign investors in Britain”, having spent more than £16bn over the past decade building up its business in the UK. On her watch alone, the bank has ploughed its way through about £500m on improvements to its IT systems and £1.7bn since making its first move into the British market with the takeover of Abbey National in 2004. The spending is intended to reduce customer complaints that had seen Santander become a byword on consumer forums for poor customer services and the most complained about bank on the high street. The big investment is having its intended effect and in its first-half results Santander made a big point of reminding investors it was the only bank to record a year-on-year fall in complaints. As SMEs struggle to stay afloat in an ailing UK economy, Ms Botin might well be a businesswoman worth listening to. Banks and Finance

New Audi A8 revealed for 2014
The updated Audi A8 luxury saloon gets a new look and more efficient engines for its Frankfurt motor show debut.
The facelifted Audi A8 has a range of cosmetic and engine upgrades By Chris Knapman

The 2014 Audi A8 has been unveiled ahead of its official debut at the Frankfurt motor show next month. The facelifted luxury saloon has a range of cosmetic and engine upgrades and goes on sale in January 2014. With Audi scrapping the 201bhp front-wheel drive 3.0-litre TDI, all A8s aside from the hybrid model will feature Quattro all-wheel drive. Revisions to the seven available engines have resulted in more power and lower emissions for all units. The line-up includes a 3.0 TDI with 251bhp (up from 247bhp), a 4.2-litre TDI V8 with 380bhp (a 35bhp increase), a 3.0-litre TFSI petrol with 306bhp (up 20bhp) and a 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbo petrol unit gaining 15bhp, to take its tally to 429bhp.

The flagship of the A8 range will be the 6.3-litre W12, complete with “cylinder on demand” technology which, at low loads, allows it to run on just six of its 12 cylinders in order to save fuel. All are mated to an eight-speed automatic gearbox. The A8 Hybrid meanwhile combines a 2.0-litre petrol engine and electric motor to give 242bhp, 44.8mpg on the EU Combined cycle and 147g/km of CO2. The Hybrid also has an electric-only range of 1.9 miles. Other technical highlights include Active Noise Cancellation inside the cabin (available on the 4.0 TFSI, W12 and hybrid models), active engine mounts to dampen vibrations and MatrixBeam headlights, each of which has 25 individual LEDs that can be switched on and off or dimmed independently to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic. Audi hasn’t announced prices, but they are likely to start at about £54,000. Audi

David Miliband
The Environment Secretary has turned down suggestions that he should challenge Brown after he was offered the chance to lead a new enlargened environmental department. He has declared Brown "an excellent Prime Minister in waiting". John Reid

Poster accuses Brown over lost pensions
11 Apr 2007
John Reid, the Home Secretary, is prepared to act as a "standard bearer" for a Blairite challenge by Miliband. As this looks more unlikely, it is possible that he could stand himself as a last resort, such is his perceived strength of feeling against Brown.
John McDonnell
Leading left-winger John McDonnell has launched his campaign for the Labour leadership although bookies have him down as an outside bet. He insists Labour has lost its way and "systematically alienated" its supporters. Michael Meacher
The former environment minister launched a Left-wing challenge to Gordon Brown for the Labour leadership although many colleagues doubt he will receive the 44 MPs' nominations needed. He has called for a return to traditional Labour policies.
Alan Johnson
Alan Johnson, the Education Secretary, once refused to rule out standing against Brown. Rated highly by Blairite MPs, he now says he wants to contest the deputy leadership. Peter Hain
The Northern Ireland Secretary is on record as saying he would like to be 'loyal deputy' to the Chancellor. Has challenged Brown critics to 'put up or shut up'. Charles Clarke
The former home secretary has spoken of Brown having "psychological" issues and has been so desperate that he not become the country's next leader that he launched a policy website called "The 20:20 vision". Hilary Benn
The International Development Secretary is undeclared, but thought by colleagues to be certain to plump for Brown in the end. 'Talked up' by friends of the Chancellor. Currently leading the race for deputy by a wide margin.
Alan Milburn
The former health secretary and long-time opponent of Mr Brown was jointly behind the new website where he insisted that the aim was not to thwart Mr Brown but to develop modern policy ideas for New Labour. Geoff Hoon
The Minister for Europe was humiliatingly demoted by Blair in botched reshuffle of May 2006. Considered resigning but switched to Brown camp instead. Member of Brown's campaign team. Harriet Harman The Constitutional Affairs Minister is running for deputy and has been described as Gordon Brown's feminine conscience, on a crusade for women.
Hazel Blears
The Labour party chairman is a contender for deputy following pressure from union barons and modernisers but is not seriously in the running. John Hutton
The Work and Pensions Secretary is assumed to have been the nameless minister who claimed Brown would be a 'f***ing awful PM'. Attempts by Brown to effect a rapprochement may not work. UK News

Prince Harry balks at London Marathon challenge
Prince Harry tries to come up with excuses for members of the Royal Family not running the London Marathon, while speaking to volunteers along the Mall. 5:14PM BST 21 Apr 2013
Undaunted by the Boston Marathon bombings, big crowds lined the route of London's mass road race on Sunday to cheer on around 36,000 runners, many of who wore black ribbons to honour the dead and wounded. Prince Harry, present to hand out medals to the winners, chatted with volunteers along the Mall, who asked him why he had not challenged his brother to running the London Marathon. "She's pregnant, he's getting old, it's impossible," replied the Prince ruefully. Before the start of the men's elite and mass races, official commentator Geoff Wightman led the crowd in a tribute to Boston. The packed ranks of competitors bowed their heads and stood silently for 30 seconds, then clapped and cheered when a second whistle marked the end of the tribute. Related Articles

Moments later, the world's elite runners led off the race. Behind them came thousands of competitors chasing personal goals or raising money for charity, many running in fancy dress. Unusual outfits included a two-person camel costume, a giant beer bottle, a rhino, two male brides and Admiral Lord Nelson. Kenya's Priscah Jeptoo won the women's race by a long distance while Ethiopia's Tsegaye Kebede snatched victory from Kenyan rival Emmanuel Mutai in the final kilometre, to huge cheers from Londoners packed along the majestic tree-lined Mall. The organisers will donate 2 pounds per finisher to The One Fund Boston, set up to raise money for the victims. They estimate around 35,500 people will cross the line, meaning they are likely to raise at least £70,000. Prince Harry

The library/dressing-room The top floor of the house, where the ceilings are almost cathedral-like in height, is used as both library and dressing-room; they each have their own wardrobe. (Warn’s, pictured, came from a dealer in Greenwich and once lived in the Brighton Pavilion. It is lined with blue-and-cream-striped silk.) ‘My whole flat where I lived before was the size of this room,’ Burakowski says. ‘It’s lovely up here, this is where we’ve got all the books – tons of books. I come up here and draw.’
