Almost Human, Fox US, premiere, review
Is this RoboCop-like sci-fi series from the JJ Abrams production line too mechanical for its own good? 2

CONTAINS SPOILERS The future doesn’t look good. The streets are awash in drugs and weapons supplied by an elusive but ruthlessly efficient criminal organisation with corporate ties. The crime rate has ballooned by 400%. The police are undermanned to the extent they need to turn to technology for help. Enter the advanced combat model android. That’s the set-up for Robocop, the 1987 Paul Verhoeven film whose widely un-anticipated reboot appears early next year. By an amazing coincidence, it’s also the foundation on which Almost Human, the new man-and-machine buddy cop TV series from JJ Abrams’ genre assembly line, is built. Beyond introducing a world where the pairing of human and robot law enforcement officers is mandatory, Almost Human quickly stops gnawing on the flesh of Robocop. It then starts raiding the corpse of Alien Nation, the 1988 movie teaming James Caan’s hard-ass lawman with a prosthetic-swamped Mandy Patinkin as his chatty, oversensitive partner from another planet. Filling Caan’s shoes is Karl Urban, whose Jon Kennex is a walking compendium of cop cliches. He’s a grouchy, brooding, gravel-voiced, pill-popping mess. Back in his renegade glory days, against the advice of his android partners, he lead his human team into an ambush, from which only he was able to crawl away, albeit minus most of a leg. He spent the subsequent two years wallowing in self-hate and and survivor’s guilt - much of which, since he was fitted with a synthetic leg, is directed at his own body. He hates his leg! Within seconds of returning to duty, Kennex’s anti-robot prejudice surfaces - ”A human partner was good enough for my father and it’s good enough for me!”- and he shoves his new cyborg buddy out of a moving car where it’s smashed to bits by oncoming traffic. His sympathetic boss (a baleful-looking Lili Taylor) orders him to shape up. Kennex consults the weird squirrely man who toils down in the basement of the robotics department (The Office’s Mackenzie Crook). The weird man unwraps Dorian (Michael Ealy), a discontinued model, an early brand of robot cop put on ice for being too emotional, too unpredictable, too human. And there’s the show: the flesh and blood guy is all repressed anger and inability to deal with his issues; the synthetic one is happy to declare, “I was made to feel.” The robot-as-race-metaphor is gingerly addressed with Ealy, a black actor, recoiling from his partner’s derisive description of him as “synthetic”. When Kennex, impressed by the android’s deductive skills, warms up to him enough to say, “You’re not like the rest of them,” Ealy’s Dorian replies, “I know you think I’m supposed to take that as a compliment.”

I feel like I know exactly where Almost Human is headed. It’s headed to a rain-soaked Kennex cradling malfunctioning components of Dorian in his lap and screaming, “Don’t you die on me, you mechanical bastard, you’re the best goddamn partner I ever had!” Which is to say, this show might be a bit too mechanical for me.

Flood crisis: councils 'reluctant to accept Army help', says defence secretary
Philip Hammond claims military had to 'push itself' on council leaders during flood crisis
By Matthew Holehouse, Political Correspondent
11:22AM GMT 16 Feb 2014
Follow Councils were reluctant to accept help from the Army during the floods, the defence secretary has said. Philip Hammond said the military had to “push” itself on council leaders. He admitted a new policy of having Army officers supporting civilian leaders was the direct result of his public admonishment by a furious flood warden in the flooded village of Wraysbury. Members of the armed forces place sandbags outside a residential property in Wraysbury (BLOOMBERG)
“We offered troops quite a long while ago to civil authorities that wanted them. What we’ve done over the past ten days is push them a bit more aggressively,” he said. “We needed to push ourselves a bit more on the civilian authorities.”

In future crises military officers would be embedded in the ‘gold command’ response headquarters at an earlier stage, he said. He defended ministers who visited flood-stricken areas in wellington boots from accusations of flood tourism. The public rebuke he received from Su Burrows, a furious flood warden in Wraysbury, led to him asking the Government’s COBRA crisis committee to deploy the Army differently. “There’s been a lot of talk of politicians doing flood tourism, but encouraging us to stay in Whitehall rather than getting out on the ground would be a very, very bad idea,” he said. “There’s been a lot of criticism of politicians in wellies, but it’s only because I went to Wraysbury and listened to what people were saying that we were able to develop this new approach of using the Army in this community support role.”
Troops being withdrawn from Afghanistan and Germany will be deployed on more ‘homeland resilience’ operations in future, he said. Some 3,000 troops have been deployed to build flood defences, and 5,000 are on standby, Mr Hammond said. Mr Hammond said Ed Miliband was not “saying anything new” by calling for climate change to be treated as an issue of national security. It is already classified as a “strategic threat” by the National Security Committee, Mr Hammond said. “It is a national security issue,” he said. Climate change had contributed to recent flooding, he said: “Climate change is clearly happening. It’s clearly a factor in the weather patterns that we’re seeing.”
He refused to rule out building on flood plains in future, after it emerged council are planning to put houses on areas that are currently submerged, saying flood defence must be balanced with economic growth and “maintaining people’s standard of living.” Weather
