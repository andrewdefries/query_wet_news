Restaurant review: The Art Kitchen, Warwick Haphazard Thai cooking in a faux-gallery – Warwick's Art Gallery is a strange affair. 2.5

Comments
As Ingrid Bergman learned when Charles Boyer dragged her to the brink of insanity by fiddling with the eponymous flame in Gaslight, sometimes it is the most seemingly trivial of curiosities that do you in. It seems unlikely that the owners of The Art Kitchen in Warwick mean to induce madness in their customers; so we may cite their decision to deploy the specials board in the only part of a long, narrow dining room where nobody bar the barman – could see it as evidence of slapdashery rather than CIA-style Psy Ops or malice aforethought. But it didn't half drive us potty all the same. "Why would they do that?" muttered a friend on returning from his fourth jaunt. He was visibly tiring now: physically, from the exercise; and mentally, from repeated – and hitherto unsuccessful – attempts to memorise the dishes inscribed thereon. "You know who you should have brought? Leslie Welch."
If only my Guild of Restaurant Critics Guide to Professional Etiquette didn't categorically insist that recruiting a cadaver as "companion" is a touch déclassé. Since Mr Welch died in 1980, younger readers may wish to YouTube his unforgettable turn as the Memory Man in The 39 Steps, the Hitchcock classic made the year before Gaslight, in 1935. In Les's absence, our journeys to and fro between our table and the specials board continued, until it resembled one of those Greek myths about torturous futility. "That's it," puffed the Sisyphus of the West Midlands after the ninth outing. "I've done the tempura, and that will bloody well have to do. I've had it with this."
This was by no means the lone peculiarity about a venture opened in 2004 by a couple who supply art works to the hotel and leisure industry, who initially took the site as a gallery, to flog their artistic surplus, and then had the afterthought of adding a restaurant. Related Articles

Review: Outlaw's at the Capital
20 Feb 2013
I not only know nothing about art, I don't even know what I like; so I shall refrain from critiquing the objets on show (a jigsaw-style painting of postage stamps, photographs of owls, and so on); though they struck my more cultured friends as unlikely to have Charles Saatchi racing up the M40. The haphazard cooking makes it no more a destination joint for the gourmet than the aesthete. The balance of yin and yang is a feature of Far Eastern cuisines, of course, but seeking that harmony by alternating between good and bad dishes takes it too far. Baby squid tempura arrived, and promptly mocked our heroic achievement in having memorised it, the batter being spongy, and a wasabi mayonnaise too meek to offset the blandness of the squid. On the other hand, prawn and coriander dumplings, served lollipop-style on sticks, were deep-fried to perfection and bursting with juicy merriment. The other starters – "one bytes" as these are inexplicably known on the menu (the main courses are "bigger bytes"; if they introduce an all-you-can-eat buffet, this will be the "gigabyte") underlined the inconsistency. A grilled lamb roll was overcooked and tasteless (in a blind tasting I'd have gone for beef) and swamped by an indistinct mint sauce. But rolls of chicken, prawn and shredded vegetables in rice paper were crunchy and impeccably fresh. The bigger bytes arrived within moments of the one-byte plates departing, despite the menu's warning: "All our food is freshly prepared… Please let us know if you have any time constraints." Precisely when slices of grey and desiccated duck, flavoured with star anise and cinnamon and resting flaccidly on a bed of vermicelli, had been prepared, is hard to be sure. It might have been while Yul Brynner was on the throne of Siam. Yet Panaeng Nua, beef curried with chilli, lime leaf, sweet basil and peanut, came in a subtle and delectable creamy sauce – though this time, in a blind tasting the fiver would have been on lamb. Kra Prao, wok-fried chicken – "minced" according to this wildly unreliable menu, but in fact shredded – came in a sharp and fiery chilli sauce, and was outstanding. Pad Thai noodles with king prawns were too sweet, but side dishes of pak choi and mushrooms, both in oyster sauce, were spot on. The final peculiarity was that the hiatus before the puddings, in contrast to the 25-second wait for the bigger bytes, was 25 minutes. A fruit spring roll was stodgy but delicious, a pandam leaf pancake stodgy but comforting, and a lemongrass crème brûlée the ideal melding of an atrocious idea (the flavours were at Def Con 2 with one another) with wretched execution (the "crust", a stranger to the blowtorch, had the same texture as the interior). "I can't make head nor tail of it," said Mrs Sisyphus as we glanced crossly at the specials board for the last time, and I knew how she felt. Ambitious –sometimes impressive and sometimes hopeless – Thai cooking in a faux-gallery paying not the remotest lip service to Thailand on the walls… this place puts the art into not knowing if one is Arthur or Martha. Until it makes up its mind, my advice for anyone passing the door while in the mood for a byte is to heed the words of Warwick the Hitmaker, as opposed to Warwick the Kingmaker: walk on by.

Sporting fails: the worst penalty, dive, celebration, homecoming and collective Olympic disasters from 2012
We've all had about enough of lauding 2012 as the greatest year of anything, ever. Let's re-calibrate by watching lots of sportspeople do lots of things badly. It's far more fun. By Telegraph Sport

You've seen the worst, now enjoy the best: the most outrageous moments of sporting skill in 2012
Homecoming Of The Year
After becoming the first Venezuelan ever to win a F1 race, Pastor Maldonado returned home to a hero's welcome and what should have been one long victory lap around Caracas, but ended up being a shorter spin than he had planned. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Penalty Of The Year
Red Bull Salzburg's Jonathan Soriano narrowly beats Flock of Seagulls tribute act Neymar to a gong that was harder to call this year than the BBC Sports Personality of the Year was. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Throw-in Of The Year
Alexander Tettey of Norwich City offers his on-pitch resignation from ever taking over throw-in duties for any club at any time for the rest of his career: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Early Celebration Of The Year
Pride comes before a fall. Never truer than in the case of Bath's Sam Vesty, whose premature raise of the arm went some way to costing his side a Heineken Cup place: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Free Kick Of The Year
Evanildo Rodrigues of El Jaish, one of Qatar's top-flight teams, does his bit to convince the rest of us that all the critics of the country hosting a World Cup probably, you know, may have a bit of a point: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Miss Of The Year
This year's keenly contested 'Ronny Rosenthal award for services to missing from an impossibly short distance' goes to a man once, but no longer, known as 'The Leo Messi of the Adriatic', Lorenzo Insigne of Pescara. All together now, 'My Mum/my Grandmother/Emile Heskey (pre-Australia) could have scored from there!' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Delivery Of The Year
When Jonathan Trott smacked this sub-dolly of a ball to the boundary in the fourth Test of England's victorious tour of India the locals weren't pleased with his lack of sportsmanship. The lack of sporting ability, however, from Ravindra Jadeja was undoubtedly worse. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stop Of The Year
In a World T20 match that produced a masterclass in the art of the dropped catch one man stood head, shoulders and butter-fingers above the rest. Step forward Pakistan's Sohail Tanvir: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reverse Belly Flop Of The Year
Germany's Stephan Feck came last in the preliminary round of the men's three-meter springboard diving contest at London 2012. Here's why: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Liu Xiang's Olympics, Vol. 2
Lui Xiang suffered heartbreak in Beijing when injury forced him out of his home Games. London gave him a chance to make up for the pain ... but he literally failed to clear the first hurdle. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pole Vault Of The Year
Great Britain's Kate Dennison narrowly missed out on the pole vault final this summer after missing out on clearing 4.40m, by a distance greater than that. What goes up must come down, but in pole vault it's supposed to be somewhere in front of where you started. You've seen the worst, now enjoy the best: the most outrageous moments of sporting skill in 2012

Priced from around £118, collections are updated seasonally, and the latest range features bright animal prints and contrasting tassel details. Related Articles
