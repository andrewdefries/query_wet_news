Thousands of festival goers descend on Glastonbury
Thousands of people have begun to arrive at Britain’s biggest music festival in the last 24 hours, many of whom queued overnight. Jenny Twiss, 31, Genna Mann, 27, run to the entrance at the start of Glastonbury Festival. Pilton, Somerset Photo: Adam Gray/SWNS.com	By Radhika Sanghani and agencies

Music fans slept in their cars as thousands arrived at Glastonbury ready for the gates to open at 8am. People arrived at the site in Somerset with rucksacks, tents and crates of beer, prepared for the five-day music festival. Many fans chose to sleep in their cars or arrive early to queue for the best camping spots. Lauren Sheffield was at the front of the queue at 6am and wrote on Twitter: “Haven't slept, queuing to get in, right near front of queue sipping on Kronenburg.”
The main performances at the event, which had a fallow year in 2012 to coincide with the Olympic and Paralympic Games, will not start until Friday - when Arctic Monkeys will top the bill, followed by The Rolling Stones on Saturday night and Mumford & Sons closing the festival on Sunday.

Thousands of revelers arrive at the start of Glastonbury Festival (SWNS)
That doesn't matter to those setting up camp, with many of the 135,000 ticket holders expected to turn up today. The weather is expected to be warm and mostly dry, quashing fears of another Worthy Farm washout. Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis said he believes the weather, combined with the line-up, means this year's festival will be "unusually good". "The whole thing is fantastic," the 77-year-old farmer said. "There are 1,000 acres of creativity on a massive scale and to a very, very high standard. You won't see anything else like this in the whole world." There is even the promise of improved Glastonbury toilets, with a new system that sees waste go straight into the ground, designed to beat the infamous smell. Mr Eavis has even said that, 43 years since the first Glastonbury, they have finally found "the perfect loo". To mark the resurrection of the festival after a year off, a giant phoenix has been installed on top of the Pyramid stage, designed by Joe Rush, who was behind many of the mechanical vehicles and props used at the Paralympics closing ceremony. One of the props - a steamship on which singer Rihanna performed - can be found at the festival this year. Tickets for this year's festival, which cost £205 each, sold out in a record one hour and 40 minutes. Other highlights fans can expect are appearances from Primal Scream, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Smashing Pumpkins, Elvis Costello, The xx, Public Enemy, Professor Green and Dizzee Rascal. The festival is also offering some more unusual acts alongside the chart toppers - with Sir Bruce Forsyth playing on the Avalon Stage on Sunday, country star Kenny Rogers taking to the Pyramid Stage the same day, and the Dalai Lama's Tibetan monks also making an appearance. Celebrities including Kate Moss are set to be among the festival goers, with Sir Mick Jagger even staying in Somerset to enjoy the weekend's festivities. Glastonbury

Why Murray Perahia turned to Bach
On a quest: Murray Perahia Geoffrey Norris
12:01AM GMT 20 Mar 2008
Comments
Pianist Murray Perahia tells Geoffrey Norris why he developed an obsession with Bach after illness struck It is an unthinkable dilemma for any pianist. What do you do when fate delivers a nasty blow and there is the grim prospect of never being able to play again? This is the situation that Murray Perahia had to face in the Nineties, when an inexplicable and agonising swelling in his right thumb compelled him to put on hold an illustrious career that had been blossoming ever since he won the Leeds Piano Competition in 1972.
For several years, when he was still in his forties, he had to abandon the concert platform, but he did not abandon music. He turned to Bach, studying the scores away from the keyboard, analysing and learning. When he was finally able to resume playing in public, Bach's music had become a key component of his repertoire. "I found I was obsessed with it", he says.
The thumb ailment has returned from time to time, necessitating treatment and concert cancellations. Indeed, he had to pull out of the opening European leg of his world tour, which was due to start in January.
Despite, or perhaps because of, these problems, Perahia has come to be recognised as one of the foremost interpreters of Bach's music, not least through recordings that attest to the depth and joy of expression and the lucidity of thought that his period of enforced study leave gave him. The latest disc, of the solo Partitas Nos 2, 3 and 4, is being released next month by Sony.
Perahia was by no means a Bach novice before he developed his fascination. "I did play Bach as a student," he says, "but not very seriously. In a way, it's a lifelong challenge for me to play Bach on the piano, because, when I was growing up, the wisdom was - and it came from many great pianists, including Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau - that the piano wasn't the right vehicle for Bach. I felt that this had to be wrong, because, first of all, Bach is very important for any pianist, simply from the point of knowing about counterpoint, structure and harmony."
Bach, as Perahia realises, had an impact on music not just in the 18th century, but throughout the Romantic era of the 19th and beyond. "Composers took Bach as their bedrock," he says, "whether it's Beethoven, Mozart, Schumann or Chopin.
"I don't think there was a day when Chopin wasn't playing Bach. When Schumann went into depression, he wrote fugues, and he always told his wife, Clara, to study Bach. It was an important part of their musical make-up."
Perahia's teenage studies at Mannes College of Music in New York gave him a firm foundation for the way he approached Bach, forging a link with the great Austrian theorist Heinrich Schenker, who died in 1935.
"All his former students were teaching there, having escaped the Nazis," Perahia says, "and I'm very much influenced by his thinking. When I was away from the concert platform, I was reading his books, and I felt that I was in touch with something deeper about what music is about. What fascinates me is the structure underneath a piece."
This is structure not in a dry sense, as Perahia explains, but in the understanding of the way harmony, counterpoint and the simple action of one note leading to another contribute to the larger picture.
His need to get to the fundamentals of Bach even led him to play the harpsichord for two years, "learning about articulation, pacing, rhythmic subtleties and other things a harpsichordist has to know".
But Perahia is adamant that the music can be transmitted on an instrument of our day. "I think the pursuit of authenticity is fine," he says. "There's nothing against it, but it's not the only way."
So how do you do it? "It took me many years to find my voice in Bach," he admits. It is crucial "not to imitate a harpsichord, to play freely and yet not romantically, because that's not part of the spirit of the music. If tonal colouring can enlighten the music, it should be used so that the listener gets what's underneath the notes when he's listening to a piece. You can use a certain amount of pedalling - not overdone - because that's part of the piano.
"And the sense of direction is important even in Bach. It has to be demonstrated, it has to be lived. This is an emotional as well as a pianistic thing. Emotions and intellect should work together. You have to live Bach as if it were a narrative. Music of the classical period, say, is much more dramatic, the events are much more contrasting. Bach is more like a meditation."
As Perahia says, his quest is for the "essence of a composition. How does it sustain so many minutes - even an hour - where you feel that each note is inevitable but at the same time a surprise? That's what fascinates me about music."
Perahia's recording of Bach's Partitas Nos 2, 3 and 4 is released on April 7.

Charity takes on wrestlers with $360m compensation claim
By Damian Reece
12:01AM GMT 24 Nov 2002
Comments
The WWF, the conservation charity, has slammed down a massive $360m damages claim against World Wrestling Entertainment, the professional wrestling business. In turn WWE has accused the charity of harassment and extortion. The furious row is the latest round in a long running battle between the two over the use of the WWF name and logo. The charity, formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund, finally established its rights to the WWF name in a House of Lords ruling in July. But the charity, based in Switzerland, has written to WWE demanding compensation for damages caused to its brand which it calculates at $360m. It has offered to accept $90m for a "quick global settlement". If this is rejected, it will pursue WWE through the English courts. The WWF's letter, sent on October 29 by Michael Rogers, the WWF's legal advisor, provoked a furious reaction from the WWE, home to all-American wrestling heroes such as Hulk Hogan and The Rock (above).

MWB improves offer for Business Exchange by 60pc
Hotel and property company MWB Group has bowed to shareholder pressure and improved its offer for part owned subsidiary MWB Business Exchange by almost 60pc. By Jonathan Russell
11:02AM BST 13 Jul 2011
Comments
MWB Group, led by Richard Balfour-Lynn, said it would improve its cash-and-share offer by almost 60pc, valuing Business Exchange at £52m. MWB is bidding for the 28pc of business exchange it does not already own. MWB Group Holdings
However MWB Group said the bid would not proceed until the company had completed its refinancing or achieved a cash injection through a multi-million pound sale and leaseback on its hotel portfolio. The company has already moved its accounting date from December 31 to June 30 in order to give it more time to complete the refinancing. The revised terms of the new bid will give shareholders in Business Exchange 1.75 MWB Group shares and 12.7p cash for each Business Exchange share they currently own. The previous offer, rejected by major shareholder Pyrrho, consisted of 0.9108 shares and 12.7p cash. The bid for Business Exchange was also subject to a counter offer from global serviced office giant Regus. The all cash indicative offer of 92.4p was rejected by both MWB Group and Business Exchange although it valued the company at £60m, higher than either of the MWB Group bids. Related Articles

Why our mongrels are a dying breed
As Crufts allows ill-bred mutts to show for the first time, Jilly Cooper explains why the humble Heinz 57 is her favourite sort of dog

7:00AM GMT 03 Mar 2013
Comments
In Who’s Who, I used to list my recreations as “merry‑making, wild flowers, music, mongrels”. I’ve had many mongrels as pets over the years, so I was delighted to hear that, for the first time in 137 years, Crufts (which starts on Thursday) will have a competition specifically for mongrels and crossbreeds. They will be judged on health and personality, rather than looks. The Best in Show will still be a thoroughbred, but there will be a Top Mongrel, which is great news. Especially since there is so much discrimination against mongrels already: as well as not being allowed in shows, mongrels aren’t allowed in the Army or to be guide dogs. In 1982, I wrote a children’s book, Little Mabel Wins, which was so prophetic it’s ridiculous. It’s about Mabel, a mongrel puppy with a tall, beautiful mother and a scruffy, lecherous father. They were cross about the discrimination at Crufts, so they went along and the father took a choc-drop bomb with him. At the final judging, Dad throws the choc-drop bomb and all the breed dogs go absolutely berserk trying to get at the choc drops. Little Mabel, on the other hand, is frozen with fear and doesn’t move. The judges decide she is the only well-behaved dog – and she wins! Actually, I have been to Crufts before with my mongrels – they were probably the first mongrels ever to go to Crufts. The television presenter Russell Harty did a programme at Crufts in the early Eighties, and he thought he’d shake things up. He invited me and my three mongrels at the time, Fortnum, Mabel and Barbara, to take part in an obedience test. He asked me why I love dogs. I said it was because I am basically very shy, and find dogs easier to communicate with than people. At that exact moment, Barbara stepped forward and goosed Russell. She was always a very sociable dog – mongrels often are. There are some lovely dogs on show at Crufts, but the problem is those bossy lady breeders. Back then it was cut-throat: you would see these beautiful dogs, but they were like zombies because they had been over-bred. Breeding is so incestuous: they are bred for very specific attributes – a long nose, say, or narrow hips. So many dogs have hip problems, but more breed dogs are afflicted than mongrels. That has been corrected a bit now, especially after the documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed revealed some of the cruelty in breeding. Mongrels, on the other hand, are healthy. Vets rarely recommend mongrels as pets, probably because they don’t make good customers. Related Articles

Still, mongrels today are an endangered series. At least breed dogs get bred deliberately, but mongrels have to do it themselves. And the problem is that, these days, almost all dogs are castrated, so mongrels are in grave danger of dying out. I’m talking about proper mongrels here – I certainly don’t regard popular designer cross-breeds such as labradoodles as mongrels. Luckily, mongrels have very strong libidos. It is a case of survival of the fittest, so they have to. One of my mongrels, William, was incredibly lusty. We got him from Battersea Dogs Home – they were in tears when he left because he was so charming. William was a husky/labrador/alsatian mix. He arrived at our home in the Cotswolds and immediately became the village stud, impregnating three labradors in about three months. It was hysterical. He was a lovely dog – he even went to the pub by himself in the morning – but he was quite naughty, and people were quite cross about him. We eventually had him castrated and he did calm down – to a certain extent. Several years later, he went on The One Show with me. Christine Bleakley, the presenter, came down with her chocolate labrador, which was heavily in season. I was being interviewed and they asked, “Where do you get your raunchy ideas, Jilly?” Suddenly I realised that I had lost the attention of the sound man, the cameraman and Christine – they were all looking at William, who was busy bonking Christine’s dog. Another reason I love mongrels is because you always get an individual dog. They are just more individualistic than breed dogs. And they’re so ridiculously loyal, probably because they are so grateful that someone has recognised their worth. Many years ago, I wrote Intelligent and Loyal, a book about mongrels, simply because I love them – and if you love something, you want to know more about them. No one had written a word on mongrels before. I put an advert in the paper asking for any good stories; I had 2,000 replies. And they were wonderful, such amazing stories – all these owners who wanted their dogs to be recognised and appreciated. One woman said to me: “I’ve been married to an unromantic man for 25 years. I get all the love I need from my mongrel dog.”
The title, Intelligent and Loyal, came about because I was having drinks with this nice man and his rather grand wife, and my mongrels were running around the garden. She asked, rather haughtily, what kind of dogs they were. I told her mongrels. She looked on in horror, then said, “Well, they’re supposed to be awfully intelligent and loyal, aren’t they?” And they are indeed very intelligent – scientists have proved that mongrels have better spatial awareness and are better at solving problems than full-bred dogs. William sadly died quite recently, and we currently have two rescue greyhounds, which is why I have now added “greyhound” to my Who’s Who entry. I’d love another mongrel, though.

Exclusive £2.5m island in Poole Harbour sold
Green Island is one of five islands in Poole Harbour 12:36PM BST 03 Jun 2005
An island off one of Britain's most expensive property areas, which was put on the market for £2.5 million, has been sold, the estate agents have said.
The 45-acre Green Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, is a stone's throw from the expensive Sandbanks district, which has seen a big rise in prices in recent years. The island has its own grass helipad and pontoon and is one of five in the harbour.
It has planning permission to replace a bungalow with a 2,000 sq ft three-bedroom house and it also has a Scandinavian A-frame house. The island is a site of special scientific interest and has deer roaming, but no rats or snakes. It was originally part of the lands belonging to Milton Abbey.
When it last went on the market in 1987 it sold for £500,000 to the current seller, Jo Davies. A spokesman for estate agents Lane Fox said a well-known local family, the Iliffes, had agreed to buy the island for an undisclosed sum,thought to be equal or above the asking price. The family of the purchaser, Edward Iliffe, has past links with the area. His great-grandmother, the first Lady Iliffe, bought nearby Furzey Island in 1935 and it remained in the family until 1969 when it was sold by Mr Iliffe's father, the present Lord Iliffe, and his uncle Joe Iliffe. The Iliffe family have had connections in Poole Harbour for the past 70 years and through Marina Developments Ltd, one of their businesses, run Cobb's Quay Marina. Edward Iliffe's mother, Lady Iliffe, has been one of the volunteer helpers assisting the Green Island Holiday Trust which was set up by Mrs Davies 14 years ago to provide, organise and run holidays for the disabled on Green Island each summer. The Green Island Holiday Trust will shortly be moving its holiday base next door to Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour. News

Plans to allow nurseries to look after more children prompt concern
Plans to increase the number of children that nurseries and childminders can look after met with concern from childcare experts.

As part of coalition efforts to cut childcare costs, staff will be able to take charge of six two-year-olds rather than four, while the ratio for under-ones will go up from three to four.
Education minister Liz Truss will outline the changes as part of reforms that will see higher qualifications required of those caring for pre-schoolers. But the changes have been criticised as lowering standards.
Anand Shukla, chief executive of the Daycare Trust, a charity campaigning for quality and affordable childcare, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Any initiatives to increase the qualifications and pay of staff who are low paid in the standards of this country and in comparison to their peers in other countries is all to be welcomed.
“But we’re worried about this trade-off between increasing the qualifications of staff and increasing the number of children you can look after.

Truss: nursery changes 'will benefit children'
29 Jan 2013
“This isn’t a simple question between what the ratios are and what the cost is to parents.”
Allowing nurseries to look after more children would not necessarily mean a lower cost to parents as the extra money could be used instead to increase the pay of staff or the “wafer thin” margins with which the places operate, he said.
Britain has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, meaning many mothers with two or more children find it does not make financial sense to work. Ms Truss will tell an event at the Policy Exchange think-tank that the Government wants to introduce graduate-level Early Years teachers. An Early Years Educator qualification will also be created, requiring practical experience and at least a C grade in English and maths GCSE. But she will insist that better wages are needed to improve the system in England, pointing out that nursery staff only earn £6.60 per hour on average. Hailing the example of France, Ms Truss will say that easing rules on ratios can give nurseries the "headroom to pay higher salaries". "We have learned from other countries that deliver better-value and better-quality childcare," she will say. "We have looked across Europe and beyond. The aim is not to replicate another country's approach but to learn from and apply best practice. "I have been particularly struck by the high status and trust afforded to childcare professionals in continental Europe. In particular, I am impressed by much of what happens in France. "Other European countries have taken a different approach on ratios. They think that the quality of staff is the most important thing. "Whereas in England nursery staff may look after no more than three one-year-olds, in France they can be responsible for five - and there are no limits in Denmark, Germany or Sweden. "That is why we are encouraging nurseries to use their professional judgment and enjoy greater flexibility.” However, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the plans threatened child safety and would not reduce costs. "This Government has created an affordability crisis by cutting support and pushing up costs for parents. Watering down quality is the wrong way to try to deal with the problem they've caused," he said. "Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and won't reduce costs. Parents will be worried.” Politics

Passengers in miracle escape after train derails in remote Scotland
A passenger car was said to be hanging "precariously balanced" over a 50 foot embankment after a train derailment in a remote part of Scotland. Link to this video
By Andrew Hough, and Auslan Cramb
11:36PM BST 06 Jun 2010
Follow The Glasgow to Oban train derailed just before 9pm near the Falls of Cruachan power station in a narrow valley on the edge of Loch Awe, Scotland’s longest loch. Rescuers said all 60 passengers and staff on the 6.20pm service had escaped with only minor injuries. Most of those injured were described as "walking wounded" but nothing to suggest there were any “critical” injuries. It is understood a couple of passengers suffered only minor scratches. Nine people were taken to hospital. The crash sparked a "major deployment" of fire crews after a passenger on the train raised the alarm at 8.53pm. Air ambulance and Ministry of Defence helicopters were also called to the scene because of the remoteness of the area while a triage centre was set up at nearby Loch Awe railway station. An investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the accident. It remained unclear what caused the train to derail. A spokesman for the British Transport Police said the front carriage of the two-carriage train had derailed and caught fire. “There are no reported serious injuries," he said. "The train involved was the 1820 hours Glasgow Queen Street to Oban service. This is a two car train and the leading car has derailed and caught fire. "All passengers have been safely taken off the train but the leading car remains overhanging the road.” A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said the 60 passengers and crew were taken to the nearby Cruachan Power Station close to the scene of the derailment. He said they were alerted to the accident by a passenger on board the train. The call, he added, sparked a "major deployment" of fire crews, with firefighters then working to gain access to the carriages. An ambulance spokesman said one person was taken to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, three to Lorne and Islands District General Hospital near Oban, and five to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead. "Initially it was thought there was about 50 casualties, but it's nowhere near that," he said. "There's quite a lot of walking wounded."
He said a number of crews which were initially sent to the scene were stood down once more details emerged. A spokesman for train operator ScotRail said an investigation was under way into the cause of the incident. “An investigation is already under way into the cause of the incident by appropriate agencies and industry partners," he said.

Two charged over murders of Russian rights lawyer and reporter Two Russian nationalists have been arrested and charged in the high-profile killings of a human rights lawyer and journalist who were gunned down in Moscow in January. 12:11AM GMT 06 Nov 2009
The double murder of Stanislav Markelov, a lawyer who had exposed abuses by the Russian army in Chechnya, and Anastasia Baburova, a reporter at opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, were condemned by the European Union.The arrests this week were cautiously welcomed by human rights groups, who complain that many killings of Russian journalists and activists go unsolved.Russia's investigative committee said a man and a woman, Nikita Tikhonov, born in 1980, and Yevgenia Khasis, born in 1985, had been charged with the killings. Both were said to be Moscow residents."Tikhonov and Khasis were detained on November 3 and 4 in an operation organised by the investigative committee and operatives from the interior ministry and the FSB security service," it said in a statement.FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov said the two had been caught as part of an investigation into an extreme nationalist group, which was amassing weapons and had been implicated in a racist murder.

"A large amount of military firearms was confiscated from this group," he said in a meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev, according to a transcript posted on the Kremlin website."In the course of additional investigations, another murder was solved, which was committed in September on motives of ethnic hatred, and in which this criminal group was involved," Mr Bortnikov added.Khasis was a manager at a company called Bukh Uchyot Torgovlya (Accounting Trade), while Nikita Tikhonov was unemployed, a Moscow court spokeswoman said, without giving more details on the suspects.The pair has been charged with murder by an organised group, a crime that carries a maximum punishment of life in prison.

New Zealand v England, second Test: day two as it happened
Follow over-by-over commentary of the second Test between New Zealand and England at the Basin Reserve, Wellington. Image 1 of 3	Team man: a selfless, attractive 82 from Matt Prior drove England onto a commanding total Photo: PA	Image 1 of 3	Up and under: Kevin Pietersen goes over the rope in what was an otherwise measured and controlled innings Photo: GETTY IMAGES	Image 1 of 3	The wall: Jonathan Trott anchored England's innings on day one in Wellington Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Steve Wilson (morning) and Alan Tyers (the balance)
9:00AM GMT 14 Mar 2013
• Impressive Kiwi bowlers take eight wickets in battling day
• Sensible 73 from KP and then bristling Prior 82 guide England
• Bowled out just before tea for 465
• England a bit lacklustre before Broad takes two in two balls!
CLOSE OF PLAY New Zealand (66/3) trail England (465) by 399 runs An enjoyable day's Test cricket, with both sides justified in feeling at once satisfied and a bit disappointed. England would have been hoping for more than 198 runs for their last eight wickets. On the other hand, 465 is still an imposing total. They then took three wickets, despite bowling a bit too short and generally looking slightly off their best. The Kiwis again bowled their hearts out, but two of their three wickets were down to poor shots. The scoreboard, however, is lee equivocal: New Zealand still 399 behind, the follow on a live danger, and England can get in a match-winning position with a good first session tomorrow. Please join us for it if you can. Cheers. Twitter: Derek Pringle - NZ 66-3 at close 2nd day. England lead by 399 on 1st inns. Good day for Prior, Broad and Bruce Martin.
OVER 32: NZ 66/3 (Williamson 32* Brownlie 8*) Monty to close the day. Bowling it quicker than ever, not really turning it and that's pretty comfortable for Williamson, the match situation not withstanding. A maiden and that's stumps. OVER 32: NZ 66/3 (Williamson 32* Brownlie 8*) Anderson to bowl his last of the day. Single to Williamson and then Brownlie looks very solid to the rest. OVER 31: NZ 65/3 (Williamson 31* Brownlie 8*) Yeah, so Monty. It's all okay stuff as far as it goes. He's not, in truth, looked as good as Martin on today's evidence. Kiwis trail by 400. Still a loooooong way to go. The weather forecast had been for rain on Sunday and loads of rain on Monday, but that has been upgraded to some rain on Monday but the bulk of it after the Test finishes. OVER 30: NZ 65/3 (Williamson 31* Brownlie 8*) Ah, Anderson was just changing ends. Now here he is with the wind at his back. He's getting it to shape back into Brownlie, could that be a first hint of reverse, maybe? Driven down the ground for three but he won't mind seeing that etc etc etc. OVER 29: NZ 62/3 (Williamson 31* Brownlie 5*) Interestingly, just two overs for Jimmy and it's Monty back on. An uncharacteristically sloppy over from the Mont. Drops too short twice, and Williamson gratefully works the ball away for a two and a four. OVER 28: NZ 56/3 (Williamson 25* Brownlie 5*) Williamson drops it to cover and Broad is in the game for a run out, briefly. Nah, they're safe. Finn finds the edge of Brownlie's bat but it's always heading downwards. Anderson fields at third slip. Tim Wilkes writes: "Well done for keeping with it. Still with you from NZ (and still at work, that sucks) but loving the updating, especially for those crucial wickets!" Thanks man. Anyone else reading in New Zealand? OVER 27: NZ 55/3 (Williamson 24* Brownlie 5*) Kiwis clinging on grimly in face of a tough exam from Anderson. Both sides know that a wicket here is going to be huge. Anderson seams one back into Brownlie. Maiden. OVER 26: NZ 55/3 (Williamson 24* Brownlie 5*) Double change and it's Finn back on. There's just one off the over, to Brownlie. OVER 25: NZ 54/3 (Williamson 24* Brownlie 4*) With eight overs to bowl before the close, Cook brings back Anderson, which seems like a good plan to me. Over rate has gotten slow. He's shaping it back into Williamson and it's a solid maiden. Hard yards now for the lone blogger, the coffee flask finished, the lovingly prepared crackers and fruit box eaten. The speedball all mainlined long ago. Can England nick another before the close? Who's with me? OVER 24: NZ 54/3 (Williamson 24* Brownlie 4*) Broad now bowling beautifully, perfect length now, and doing a bit with it. He shapes one back in and it hits Kane Williamson in his gentleman's special area. Bumper to Brownlie. OVER 23: NZ 51/3 (Williamson 23* Brownlie 2*) One off Monty. OVER 22: NZ 50/3 (Williamson 22* Brownlie 2*) Just shows what you can do when you pitch it up! Brownlie comes in and clips the hat-trick ball through midwicket for two runs. Taylor b Broad 0 And now England are ticking! Absolute jaffer from Broad, full, shaping in and then straightening and you can attach no blame to Ross Taylor for playing and missing at that. Okay, maybe his foot movement could have been better but that was a savage delivery to get first ball. He's clean bowled, it's FOW 48/3 and Broad is on a hat-trick Rutherford c Cook b Broad 23 Oooh, sickener from Rutherford. He had done the hard bit, he was starting to look good, and now he has thrown it away. Full ball, across him, Rutherford flashes and thick edges it to Cook. Really poor shot. FOW 48/2
OVER 21: NZ 46/1 (Rutherford 21* Williamson 22*) Really nice shot from Williamson as he drives through point for four. Significantly, Monty now bowls two balls notably slower. And, possibly also significantly, Prior praises him "Good pace Panny". OVER 20: NZ 41/1 (Rutherford 20* Williamson 18*) Yeah, same story from Broad. Short stuff = easy. Pitches it up = batsmen look less confident. England got a man back out on the point boundary. OVER 19: NZ 40/1 (Rutherford 20* Williamson 18*) More darty stuff from Monty, although he gets one to bounce. Now Williamson on drives and Pietersen doesn't cover himself in glory with the fielding. Four. The exact sort of thing that Monty himself often gets grief for from the rest of the team. OVER 18: NZ 36/1 (Rutherford 19* Williamson 14*) David Lloyd makes an interesting point on comm, as Broad bowls another over that is a bit too short. He says that the short stuff draws a "Ooooh yeah" reaction from team-mates and crowd, because it looks all butch and that (I paraphrase), but in fact it's quite easy to play and is maybe misleading the bowler. One to Kane and two to Hamish. OVER 17: NZ 33/1 (Rutherford 17* Williamson 13*) Okay from Monty, bit too darty, not quite as much flight as one would like but hey, Monty has his methods and they have been successful for him. Single to each man and that is drinks. OVER 16: NZ 31/1 (Rutherford 16* Williamson 12*) That's the game, Stuart! He pitches it up and pings Williamson on the pad. Inside edge saves him, but Broad looked much more threatening with the fuller length, has been a bit too short up until now. OVER 15: NZ 30/1 (Rutherford 15* Williamson 12*) Williamson works Monty for two to leg, but now the Bedfordshire Boy gets one to straighten and Williamson gets a leading edge as he tries to repeat the dose. Looking a touch gloomy out there at the moment, I understand. OVER 14: NZ 28/1 (Rutherford 15* Williamson 10*) Broady banging it in to Rutherford, presumably a plan. And it nearly works when the opener fences at the ball, and attacking uppercut shot but that was too high and too quick to try it on with. He's lucky that the ball flies in a gap between slips and gully. Four. OVER 13: NZ 24/1 (Rutherford 11* Williamson 10*) Double change. Monty comes on. Good over, getting some drift into the right handed Williamson. A lot of chatter around the bat from slip, silly point and short leg. Williamson drives one ball out into the offside, bit uppish. Maiden. OVER 12: NZ 24/1 (Rutherford 11* Williamson 10*) First change of the innings as Finn gives way to Broad. Like his colleague, Broad is perhaps a touch too short. Rutherford punches for two. Over in Mohali, the Aussies have finally done something right: Clarke has won the toss and will bat. The whole first day was rained off but it looks glorious there now. Here is the scoreboard.
OVER 11: NZ 22/1 (Rutherford 9* Williamson 10*) Save for one shot that has a hint of inside edge, Rutherford played that Anderson over well. Semi-misfield by Monty and there is a single. A long, long way to go but this young pair looking solid so far. Peter Furey isn't impressed: "Something is wrong in the England set up, not just the team but the backroom staff including Andy Flower have to take a good look at themselves. They should have been well prepared but they were not. Australia are going to give them a run for their money. Score is okay today but thanks to Prior and Finn, Swann is not around and Broad has gone backwards, not sure we can bowl them out twice without a big slice of luck. Michael Clarke if he plays well will be a problem in the summer, England need more consistency in the middle order, Bell and Pietersen need a kick."
OVER 10: NZ 21/1 (Rutherford 8* Williamson 10*) Rare length ball from Finn and it is handsomely driven down the ground through mid off for four by Williamson. A clip to leg gives him two. OVER 9: NZ 15/1 (Rutherford 8* Williamson 4*) Legside from Anderson and Rutherford clips that away for four. Anderson a bit leg-side in this over to the southpaw. OVER 8: NZ 11/1 (Rutherford 4* Williamson 4*) I'm not saying for one second that I would like to face Steve Finn on a pitch with bounce when he's got the wind behind him. I'd like to make that very clear. However, they've just shown a little beehive thing on the TV and pretty much every ball he has bowled so far would have gone over the stumps. Easy to say "leave it on length" sitting here, isn't it? But maybe pitching the odd one full would give the batsmen something else to think about. OVER 7: NZ 10/1 (Rutherford 3* Williamson 4*) Kane Williamson comes in to join Hamish. As Dion Nash says "these guys are the future of New Zealand batting." Cook has five (5) slips for Anderson to Williamson, who is on the way in unconvincing fashion with a four, inside edge to fine leg. A no ball in the over, prior to the wicket. Fulton c Cook b Anderson 1 Anderson has his reward for a fine opening spell, albeit not with an especially good ball. This is short, wider, and Fulton flaps at it with a cross-batted nothing shot. Flies to Cook at first slip, where he takes a sharp chance. That was travelling, although at a nice height and straight at him. Fulton didn't look too comfortable throughout, and that was a poor shot. FOW 6/1 OVER 6: NZ 4/0 (Fulton 1* Rutherford 2*) Fulton gets his first look at Finn, lucky him. Three slips, gully, short leg. Some short stuff from tall man to tall man, but Fulton plays that pretty well. OVER 5: NZ 4/0 (Fulton 1* Rutherford 2*) Marginally more comfortable for Big Peter in that over from Jim and Fulton gets off the mark from his 17th ball, with a single to cover that pinches him the strike. Bit of a fumble from Compton. OVER 4: NZ 3/0 (Fulton 0* Rutherford 2*) A BIG shout from Finn and his mates as he bangs it in. There's some sort of noise as the ball whistles past Rutherford down the legside. Rod Tucker's not having it. England don't review. Finn pushing Rutherford back before searching for the length ball. No ball. Rutherford solidly in behind an aggressive, testing over. Good cricket from two promising young cricketers. OVER 3: NZ 2/0 (Fulton 0* Rutherford 2*) Rutherford takes a single, leaving Fulton to the tender mercies of Anderson. Fulton not properly forward. He gets an edge to gully but it's into the ground. OVER 2: NZ 1/0 (Fulton 0* Rutherford 1*) Finn the perfect foil to the swinging, accurate Anderson. Downwind, straight, properly quick. Nasty stuff for Rutherford, who wears one on the ribs and sniffs the leather of another. A single to him off the last ball of the over. OVER 1: NZ 0/0 (Fulton 0* Rutherford 0*) Classy over from James, as we have come to exepct. Right on the spot from ball one, some nice away swing. One ball goes late and beats Fulton, who is happy just to survive the over. 02.28 Peter Fulton will take strike; Hamish Rutherford is at the other end. 02.26 The England players are out in their huddle. James Anderson has the ball. 33 overs to be bowled. Twitter: Gareth Copley - Sir Geoffrey Boycott just arrived on the grassbank with the Barmy Army, the atmosphere is like when the Beatles played Shay Stadium
TEA ENGLAND 465 all out A really good battling effort from the Kiwi bowlers, never-say-die stuff from them. If I were Kane Williamson, who nicked in with two late wickets, I'd give four-wicket Bruce Martin and the wicketless Southee (32 overs of graft) a wide berth during tea. When Broad was seventh out with the score on 374, New Zealand were getting right back into the game. But an 83-run stand between Prior and Finn has driven England towards a strong position. All in all, they might have been hoping for a bigger total, but there's a bit of cloud, the wind has dropped, there were some hints of turn and this doesn't look like a bad time to be bowling. We'll see how they get on shortly. Enjoyable cricket today, as well, 198 runs in 56.5 overs for eight wickets. Twitter: Derek Pringle - england all out 465, new zealand's day so far but is it enough to claw back opening day, batsmen will now have their say
Panesar c Taylor b Williamson 0 Monty surely has been give licence to have a go, but instead he blocks two and then pokes the third to slip. FOW 465/10 and that is tea. Prior c Wagner b Williamson 82 Ah, shame. No ton today. Prior reverse sweeps Prior and Wagner takes a super, leaping catch at backward point. What a catch that was. Superb effort from the fast bowler. He's in the 125% club this Wagner. FOW 465/9
OVER 146: ENG 465/8 (Prior 82* Anderson 8*) Not sure if Jimmy's pride has been stung by being demoted below Finn, because his first ball he absolutely creams through the offside, no foot movement but loads of timing. He's beaten backing away from a short one, but now he steps away again and skilfully flips the ball over gully for four. England cracking on here and there are maybe two overs before tea. Finn c McCullum b Wagner 24 The skipper Brendon McCullum has really persisted with that man in a short extra, often himself, and it's paid off at last as Finn drives a ball straight at him. FOW 457/8 Finn goes but he's done a good job for his side in an 83-run stand. OVER 145: ENG 457/7 (Prior 82* Finn 24*) Kane Williamson on for an over, he was cannon fodder earlier in the innings. But just a couple in this over. OVER 144: ENG 455/7 (Prior 81* Finn 23*) Good gear from Finny. Well batted. A slog sweep for four, and then a bona fide shot through the covers for another four off the back foot. That was class! England now starting to toy with the idea of a declaration, maybe? OVER 143: ENG 446/7 (Prior 80* Finn 15*) Ooh yeah. Shot, Matthew. Straight back over Wagner's head for a maximum. Good recovery though, one day influence as Prior comes miles across, Wagner sees him and slips in the slower ball. Misses his leg pole by an inch or two. OVER 142: ENG 439/7 (Prior 73* Finn 15*) Martin restores some order. Single to Prior and five dots to Finn. Twitter: Andy Zaltzman - Stephen Finn faces his 300th ball of the series. He's been out twice. Previously in his first-class career: 1327 balls faced, out 61 times.
OVER 141: ENG 438/7 (Prior 72* Finn 15*) Wagner continues, and Prior is on the charge. This partnership, now worth 50 and rising, is starting to hurt the New Zealanders. Finn flicks the ball of his pads and Southee does brilliantly to keep it to three. Prior hooks for four, and then strides down the pitch to launch Wagner for six. A 14-run over and England are back in the driving seat thanks to this stand. OVER 140: ENG 424/7 (Prior 61* Finn 12*) Change of ends for Martin. Single to each man, wonder if Prior can pinch the strike with a single off the last? He can do better than that, he's swept it hard for four. OVER 139: ENG 418/7 (Prior 56* Finn 11*) Wagner on for a spell. Prior takes a single, Finn takes five dot balls. Colin: "It would be interesting to know how often Bell gets himself out (beyond too often) as opposed to good work from the bowler / opposition. I wouldn't drop him as he has done well enough, it's just he could be England's best batsman but not by trying to bat like KP."
OVER 138: ENG 417/7 (Prior 55* Finn 11*) Handy over for England. Southee too wide and Prior carves that away off the front foot for two. That gives him a fifty, yet another well judged and attractive knock from this admirable cricketer. Now Southee overpitches outside off and Prior creams him away. Four. Good bit of fielding by Martin on the boundary saves four when Prior hooks a bumper. OVER 137: ENG 410/7 (Prior 48* Finn 11*) Single to Prior and then a rare bad ball from Finn. Too short, and Finn is onto it sharpish. Big slog sweep for four, well played. OVER 136: ENG 405/7 (Prior 47* Finn 7*) Southee resumes after the break, and it's a maiden to Finn. That's no use to me. OVER 135: ENG 405/7 (Prior 47* Finn 7*) Hard lines for Bruce Martin, he thought he had his five-fer there. Two singles in the over. England going along nicely enough with Prior and Finn, who have put on 31 off 57 balls. Too many wide balls outside off to Prior, but the Kiwis can by and large be very pleased with the day so far It's time for drinks. There looks to be a bit in the pitch, Martin has got a couple to turn and bounce, there's some carry for the seamers. England look like they are just trying to bat for as long as possible in the first dig. REVIEW! Prior sweeps and misses. The ball hits him low on the front pad absolutely bang in front. That's hitting all three, and Asad Rauf gives him right away. With similar alacrity, Prior signals for the review, gesturing that he hit it. Indeed he did. Clear as day on replay, but hard to see for Umpire Rauf. Overturned in a trice, and DRS does its job once again. OVER 134: ENG 403/7 (Prior 46* Finn 6*) Southee again guilty of the cardinal sin against Prior, wide of off stump and McCullum does not favour a third man. Never seems to have one in there. Two wide ones, two fours. One a hack and the other a glide. OVER 133: ENG 394/7 (Prior 37* Finn 6*) Bounce for Martin, thick edge off the shoulder of the Finn bat lands short of gully. OVER 132: ENG 393/7 (Prior 36* Finn 6*) Southee is back on the field and is coming on for a bowl with the wind behind him. Prior prods forward to a good ball and Southee likes him for a nick behind. He's up and shouting, but the keeper and slips don't exactly help matters by staying quiet. No review, no dice. OVER 131: ENG 392/7 (Prior 35* Finn 6*) Shot, sir! Width from Martin, Finn rocks back and cuts that attractively for four. We don't want England to hang around for an hour here and score 20 runs, so nice to see Finny going for some shots. OVER 130: ENG 387/7 (Prior 34* Finn 2*) Prior gets under a bouncer from Boult that is called wide. Mind you, the batsman hardly had to move. Miles over his head. A single. Did you see the news about Graeme Swann? The operation went okay, and recovery prognosis is for a six-to-eight week recovery schedule. Marcus Osborne writes: "I feel sorry for Finn because with only the tail left, he's not going to have the chance to get into his stride."
OVER 129: ENG 385/7 (Prior 33* Finn 2*) Martin has his man at square leg well up, so this top edged sweep from Prior actually lands safe and goes for three. The Wall sees out the rest. Go on The Wall. OVER 128: ENG 382/7 (Prior 30* Finn 2*) Short ball from Boult and Prior pulls it away for four. After a single to MP, Finn is off the way with a cut behind point. Huge Batsman says: "This may be a good Test pitch. Monty bowling in the last dig?!" Yeah, I think these wickets are not the end of the world for England. Try and whack a few, get to 400, 450 dream scenario, then get stuck in. Still a solid first innings effort. OVER 127: ENG 375/7 (Prior 25* Finn 0*) Another tidy over from Martin - just one off it to Prior. OVER 126: ENG 374/7 (Prior 24* Finn 0*) Kiwis in trouble now though: here comes the Watford Wall. NZ have bowled very well indeed, although Root, KP and Bell will be unhappy with how they got out. With the Kiwis having had such a marathon bowl in the last match and the first day of this, and with Soutee off the field sick, this feels like a missed opportunity to bat once in this game... Broad c Watling b Boult 6 Not a lot Broad could do about that, I guess. Left arm over the wicket, straight and quick, pitches and moves away just enough off the seam. Regulation catch at the wicket. FOW 374/4
OVER 125: ENG 372/6 (Prior 23* Broad 6*) Forward short leg, backward short leg, short midwicket and a slip as Martin bowls to Broad, who we once used to speak of as nearly a future all-rounder but who, on the evidence of the last 15 Tests or so, is basically a hit-and-giggle 20-and-out man at best. Prove me wrong, Stu. Second ball, he gets a thick inside edge and it flies past Watling. Very hard chance. Broad gets two for that, and then plays a nice firm shot out through the covers for four. Turn for Martin in that over. Pietersen c Fulton b Martin 73 Well bowled Bruce Martin! Terrific stuff. Floats it up there, nice bit of air, asking Pietersen if he wants to have a go. You bet he does! He tries to go over mid off but the ball isn't really full enough for that shot. And the man at mid off is none other than Two Metre Peter Fulton. You'll not be getting it over that blighter! Caught! England are throwing yesterday's good work away here. FOW 366/6
OVER 124: ENG 366/5 (Prior 23* KP 73*) Man, dear. Maybe Trent Boult hasn't seen Matt Prior bat in Test cricket over the last five years or so. What other explanation could there be for hanging three balls well outside off stump to the England keeper-batsman? The first is driven off the front foot to a fielder. Next too are short and Prior panels them away for a pair of fours. Bang. Bang. OVER 123: ENG 357/5 (Prior 15* KP 72*) Plenty of air in this Martin over and Prior again is taking no liberties. Another maiden. OVER 122: ENG 357/5 (Prior 15* KP 72*) We'd had 11 dot balls since the interval, but then Trent Boult strays too legside to KP. Kevin whips it away for four to fine leg. OVER 121: ENG 353/5 (Prior 15* KP 68*) Bruce Martin resumes to Prior and that's a maiden. Twitter: Henry Blofeld - I hope Nick Compton's doubters are busy eating their words! He has a good technique & a brilliant temperament! DCSC would've been thrilled!
00.05 Just before we get underway - how sad is that about the duck? The star of yesterday's play, the quacky fellow patrolling the cover region. Apparently he was on his own because his mate got hit by a ball the day before -->> Dead duck hammer blow -->> Poor bereaved duck. Anyway. Here come some alive cricketers. One man who is not on the pitch, though, is Tim Southee. He's off the park and is feeling sick, according to the TV. 11.59pm Good evening sports fans and/or insomniacs. Alan Tyers here to take you through the next two sessions. A good session for the Kiwis and, I fancy, a good session for this match. 86 runs for three wickets, Bruce 'Bruce' Martin the pick of the bowlers and Kevin Pietersen doing one of those 'I am an adult after all' responsible knocks that either lead to a wonderful hundred or make the incipient brainless dismissal even more upsetting. Either way, I love watching the man, so long may he continue. The weather for day four is expected to be iffy and the weather for day five awful, so if England want to win this then they need to be knocking over a few Kiwi wickets today, IMHO. Hopefully KP and Prior can move the game along in this session. New Zealand should be proud of how their bowlers ran in today, excellent performance. Tim Wilkes - welcome - has got in touch to answer the above question. Possibly borrowed from the Mitchell Johnson homework that never saw the light of day. 3 point plan to improve *all* of cricket. 1 – free beer at county games 2 – free beer at test matches 3 – free beer at ODIs
Keeping Twenty20 matches for the puritans and the temperate, eh? So something for everyone, then. If you're in need of some lunch-time/midnight feast reading you could do a lot worse than casting your eyes over Nick Hoult's interview with Nick Compton's old man, Richard, who you may have seen on the telly wonderfully enjoying his son's fine century yesterday. After being picked out by the television cameras in tears as Nick scored his first Test hundred last week, Richard tried to stay out of the way at the Basin Reserve, hiding under the Pohutukawa trees which line the ground. But as the hundred neared he stood by the picket fence next to the boundary and punched the air as his son reached his century. OVER 120: ENG 353/5 (Prior 15* KP 68*) Last over before lunch, and it's Wagner to throw it down. Badly. Decent delivery first up, in fairness, but then Prior offered the invitation of a wide one that would be rude to let pass without cutting past point for a punchy boundary. Then even better from Prior, front foot taking on Wagner to smash one through extra cover for a second four of the over. Almost a third, too, but the windmilling swing of the bat to a bouncer didn't quite make a true contact and only earned a single. AND THAT'S LUNCH. OVER 119: ENG 344/5 (Prior 6* KP 68*) Martin and KP stare-off over six balls again. Two nothing balls then Pietersen tries to smash one back down the bowler's throat - but ends up dribbling a half hit shot back to the Kiwi. Martin eventually gives Pietersen a gimme of a ball, flat and straight, Pietersen cutting through the off side for a heart warming four. OVER 118: ENG 340/5 (Prior 6* KP 64*) Wagner to Pietersen who takes the quick single. Prior, looking his usual robust busy self cuts one that could have gone all the way but Fulton down well to stop even a single. Prior hacks at one from back in the crease and does find the gap this time through cover for two. Two more next delivery and Prior is chomping at the bit here. And why not, eh? OVER 117: ENG 335/5 (Prior 2* KP 63*) In the latest installement of KP v Martin out hero gets the upper hand with a fierce shot through cover that sustained itself despite being smashed in to the ground by his blade of fury and justice. A fine boundary from the big man. And single at the end to keep strike. OVER 116: ENG 330/5 (Prior 2* KP 58*) Single for Pietersen off Wagner, who then goes so wide to Prior that the batsman had to pull out of a strange looking down on one and a half knee effort. Right decision that in the end. No more runs in the over. OVER 115: ENG 329/5 (Prior 2* KP 57*) A couple from Prior, and edged two, and a single from Pietersen takes us closer to lunch. Martin finding a bit of turn which is keeping the batsmen honest. In other spinner news, and better spinner news in all respects, Graeme Swann's operation in the US of Stateside has apparently gone well and he will now start 6-8 weeks recovery. Splendid. OVER 114: ENG 326/5 (Prior 0* KP 56*) Wagner back in attack. A touch scattergun and Pietersen fancies some of it but the best of it is a wild slash that gets an inside edge and goes pretty much nowehere and a routine single to bring Prior on strike. Wagner saves his best for the new man but Prior unruffled. OVER 113: ENG 325/5 (Prior 0* KP 55*) Martin strikes again with a fine ball that turns and catches Root's top edge and another England wicket falls.Tourists still on top here but New Zealand making a genuine fist of it today. Pietersen took another single earlier in the over. Root 10 b Martin c Watling Root looks furious with himself but that was more about good delivery from Martin who know has three wickets in this session. He just hung it up and got it to bite off the track, a touch of spin and it did Root all ends up, top edge and easy snaffled for the wicketkeeper. OVER 112: ENG 324/4 ( Root 10* KP 54*) The shackles are off. Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to get fast and furious now. Root means business and smashes Southee for four to move to double figures. But wait, what's this? Southee sets himself again and line and predictable length means he gives nothing more off the over (heavy sigh... the run rate remains below three at 2.89). OVER 111: ENG 320/4 ( Root 6* KP 54*) KP has Martin's number now, a fine four to bring up asteady, yet impressive, patient 50, his 30th career half ton. Well played fella. A dingle before New Zealand try to crowd out Root but he's having none of it and flashes one through cover for three. Eight off the over from England EIGHT!! (8). Now we're cooking. Perhaps even this spectator might start paying attention... OVER 110: ENG 312/4 ( Root 3* KP 49*) Pietersen has to make do with a single to start the over. Southee to Root and not for the first time he sees a fine delivery just beat the edge. He's a yoeman rather than a superstar but Southee has been hitting his lengths all day. Not a lot of fizz and bite in it but the odd bit of movement. Hasn't quite had his rewards just yet. Root picks the one bad ball of the over, mind, for two to see it out. OVER 109: ENG 309/4 ( Root 1* KP 48*) KP ties himself in knots. Comes out of his crease to take on Martin, grounds it between his legs then panics and dives back home, like a ballerina. A drunk ballerina. In pads. But a ballerina nonetheless. Single off the final ball sees KP keep the strike. OVER 108: ENG 308/4 ( Root 1* KP 47*) Root off the mark second ball to Southee. KP picks one again to put the Yorkshireman back on strike. What we've seen of him so far suggests Root doesn't need much babysitting but KP must be ever more midful of taking too much on now and putting his wicket in danger. A sense since drinks he's been itching to get going. OVER 107: ENG 306/4 ( Root 0* KP 46*) Bell throws his wicket away with a mis-timed charge down the track that results in a wayward effort sent skywards. Bah! Pietersen shows his departed team-mate how to handle Martin whipping one to the ropes at ground level for four. Bell 11 b Martin c Fulton Bell does it again. Ahmedabad revisited. Well, almost as bad. He was committed to the shot having come down the track but didn't get close enough and launched one high and looping between cover and mid-off in to the expert hands of Fulton who calls early and makes a fine catch on the dive. After all the patience and steady watchfulness that was poor from the England man. OVER 106: ENG 302/3 (Bell 11* KP 42*) Southee continues to find line and length but Pietersen is up to it at the moment. Interesting tussle developing there. Won't feature on many best of show reels but discipline from both men in the differing causes of their teams. Pietersen wins a point in the battle by picking two runs off the only ball of the over slightly off its intended line. But then Southee ends on top when KP slahes at a bouncer above his head, top edge by the looks of it, but Watling hasn't got the inches to reach it, or he reaches it but can't glove it. Let off for KP that one. Two more runs for England. OVER 105: ENG 298/3 (Bell 11* KP 38*) Martin goes past the outside edge with Pietersen lunging forward. A touch of turn in a pitch that may yet have flickers of life in it. Only flickers mind, but let's clutch those straws people. KP not completely comfortable here, but does manage to get one in to cover for a single off the final ball before DRINKS. OVER 104: ENG 297/3 (Bell 11* KP 37*) Play and a miss from Bell as Southee beats him down off side. Look of anguish on the bowler's face, he knows that was a good one and Bell got slightly lucky there. Best ball of a fine maiden over finds an edge but it doesn't carry through to slip. One of those that looks like a chance but wasn't anything like really. Painful for anyone in the field. OVER 103: ENG 297/3 (Bell 11* KP 37*) Martin in to the attack and immediately takes a bloody nose - KP smacks him for a massive and graceful SIX! That's more like it. A statement of intent, too. Better stuff from Martin for the rest of the over and credit him for not getting spooked by the opening salvo. One ball in particular fools the batsman as it just misses an outside edge on the way through. OVER 102: ENG 291/3 (Bell 11* KP 31*) Southee left sprawled on the floor as KP strikes one arrow straight back down the ground that beats the bowler. Doesn't make it to the rope but two runs that Southee, who has bowled tight ecenomical today, with rue nontheless. Another single from KP and the scoreboard ticks, slowly , along Evan Dunn writes in worried about the run rate, sort of. You say the tempo of England’s approach has been recalibrated since Trott’s dismissal – not slower I hope!
Remarkably, yes. I think if Trott was still in even he would be kicking on with a touch more intent than this pair. Reasonable approach but slow stuff. OVER 101: ENG 288/3 (Bell 11* KP 28*) Fantastic technical drive from Bell for four off the bowling of Wagner. Straight out of a training manual. But still beautiful in its own way. Those deliveries will come and Bell's the man to pick them off. That's it for the over but it was enough and counts as close to aggression from an England batsman as we've seen today. A gentle, precise aggression. OVER 100: ENG 284/3 (Bell 7* KP 28*) Pietersen hooks one at almost head height from Boult but Wagner out in the field is alive to the danger and limits him to a single. Huge cry of NNOOOOOOOOO from Pietersen stops Bell in his tracks after he was turning to run for a second having whipped one off his pads. Responsible and clear thinking from KP there as it wasn't really on and the last thing England need is to lose another wicket before lunch. If this pair can sit up for a while and let loose later when the Kiwis tire in the field, which they almost certainly will, they will still win the day comfortably. OVER 99: ENG 282/3 (Bell 6* KP 27*) KP comes down the track to take on Wagner but for all the flourish it's just a single. Bell leaves one that nips up and flashes across down off before blocking one that swings in at him a touch. Another leave, another block and another steady over all round. OVER 98: ENG 281/3 (Bell 6* KP 26*) Boulter sends down a wild one at Pietersen that the England batsmen watches past with a look of distain. This is a watchful, steady, composed (or possibly but not likely bored) looking KP. Serious and unspectacular. And with Bell only taking on the bad balls, of which there have been less than yesterday, it's all very siftly softly for England this morning. Pietersen scores the only run over the over, flicking it off the pads behind square. OVER 97: ENG 280/3 (Bell 6* KP 25*) First change brings Wagner in to combat. He offered very little yesterday but a full first ball is blocked by Pietersen at his toes. Solid opening from the left-armer until Pietersen picks one up and flicks it down leg for a smart single. Bell wafts at one a bit to end a workmanlike but mostly satifying first over from Wagner. OVER 96: ENG 279/3 (Bell 6* KP 24*) Pietersen pushes one through the off side, between point and mid off, from a full length ball from Boult. Considered and thoughtful play from KP, which, you imagine, will be needed if England are not to lose momentum. That's more like it! Bell given enough width to pick it to perfection and find the ropes. Bread and butter stuff for him that is. OVER 95: ENG 274/3 (Bell 2* KP 23*) Southee's first delivery nips up off the seam. A smile of gentle satisfaction on the bowler's face as he walks back to his mark. Bell not interested in chasing anything that isn't there to be hit, happy to leave as he settles in. And again. And again. And again. Another maiden. The tempo of England's approach he has been recalibrated and then some with Trott's dismissal. OVER 94: ENG 274/3 (Bell 2* KP 23*) New Zealand's bowlers, written off as a bunch of parks chuckers today, are doing a passable impression of a Test level attack so far. Bell works a single off Boult off the hips but the Kiwi gave him pause for thought with a delivery before that flashed through at a fair lick. OVER 93: ENG 273/3 (Bell 1* KP 23*) Southee demands quick reactions and springy knees with a fizzer down his throat. Pietersen perfectly comfortable with that. Decent over again from Southee and another maiden. Twitter: Nick Hoult - KP looking confident. Easing the ball through leg side for four. Timing well his trademark stroke. Could be an interesting couple of hours
OVER 92: ENG 273/3 (Bell 1* KP 23*) Bell gets off the mark with a neat single. Though that's not the big news from this over, obviously. Terrible start for England with Trott feeling for one outside off first ball. Slightest of touches but never in doubt. In better news, Pietersen clipos through the onside for the day's first boundary. Crowded track as Pietersen demands a single and Bell and Boult nearly collide in the shake up. Trott 121 b Boult c Watling Trott edges his first delivery from Boult behind to Watling. New Zealand get the breakthrough they needed. And your correspondent feels slightly like he tempted fate a touch too much with talk of the wall and kicking on and what not etc. Bah! Twitter: Derek Pringle - Trotty has a nibble and Boult is rewarded with his first wicket of the innings - England 267-3
OVER 91: ENG 267/2 (Trott 121* KP 18*) Southee to Pietersen to get us started. KP lets a couple go past as the barmy army finish up their slightly sad sounding Jerusalem. Southee gets some shape on one. It shapes almost wide up it was there. KP blocks and then doesn't quite make full contact with a straight drive. Maiden. 21.25 A lot of chin stroking over the wind at the Basin, with Steven Finn, Monty Panesar and Tim Southee perfroming drills this morning working on combating the worst effects of bowling it to it, apparently. Pretty sure it will be most of the day before that bears any fruit for the England boys, but after being caught cold in the first Test maybe being prepared has become a watchword around the England camp again. Twitter: Michael Vaughan - Finally made it to the ground... Big thanks to George for picking me up at Scorcher Bay.... Lovely chap... #heknewBobAppleyard
21.15 So how is it going to play out in this first session? No desperate need for England to get shifting I suppose but to my mind with Trott well set and Pietersen needing a confidence boost and being presented with the perfect conditions for that - flat pitch, tired bowlers on their fifth new ball in a row without great success - *and* rumours of ill winds and wet weather on the horizon, maybe it's worth kicking on from the outset? No? Geoffrey Boycott, speaking on Test Match Special this morning, thought otherwise, mind, and who am I to argue? "McCullum put England in because he felt England's better bowlers would make inroads into their batting. But it would have taken a high quality bowler to cause a batsman problems on this surface," said Boycott. "[On day two] England have to play sensibly until lunch, then attack them. England want to get 550 if they can, then have a dart at them tomorrow." Steve Harmison is more succinct. How will they play? "Trott will just bat ... he loves batting." You know what he means though. 21.05 Nick Compton has been talking ahead of day two. He is smiling. Broadly. "I was keen to continue the form I had coming in to this match and I feel I even took it on another step ... There's an important year coming up and it's hard to keep that from the front of your mind ... Trott was very good at keeping me from getting to far ahead of myself."
20.50 Good evening all and welcome to what ought to be an opening session where England properly take this Test match away from New Zealand. After Alastair Cook artfully lost the perfect toss, allowing Brendan McCullum to take the prat fall of being the man to utter the words 'we'll have a bowl' instead of England's leader (who admitted he would have done likewise), it has been plain sailing. Twitter: David 'Bumble' Lloyd - Cooler, cloudier day at The Basin
Perhaps laid heavy with guilt and 'there but for the grace of God and all that' empathy, Cook did give the Kiwis the apologetic present of his own wicket, he's a good sort like that, but it did little to spare McCullum's blushes and the hosts' position in the match. Which is at the rear end of back foot already. With Jonathan Trott's latest wall built on foreign fields apparently set with especially durable foundations, and even Kevin Pietersen past his early innings jitters and skittishness, the anchor to England's innings is firmly set while the wind should be in their sails, if you forgive such wilful and carefree mixing of nautical metaphors. If the pitch continues to give New Zealand's limited bowling attack as much assistance as the wearing of a full coat of armour, as it did yesterday, expect runs, a lot of runs, and a healthy declaration about the time British milkmen are hitting the snooze button. While we are waiting for proceedings to start, please take a moment to enjoy surely the best name-visits-name sporting moment since Sean Dundee went to Dundee. And look out for the follow up two-parter - straight out'a Taunton - when Snoop Dog brings his crew to the County Ground for a Twenty20 fixture with Middlesex with predictably hilarious consequences...
