Sherlock facts: 21 things you didn't know
Russian rip-offs, ghost tube stations, and Benedict Cumberbatch as manga hero... As season 3 of the BBC series begins, here are 21 things you may not know about Sherlock Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch (or Peanut and Curly Fu, as they're known to Chinese fans) in season 3 of Sherlock Photo: BBC	By Ross Jones
11:05AM GMT 02 Jan 2014
Comments
1. It all began with a speech
In 2006, well-known Holmes enthusiast Mark Gatiss was asked to address the Sherlock Holmes Society's annual dinner at the Houses of Parliament. Gatiss, who brought along Steven Moffat as his guest, told the audience about a meeting at the BBC to discuss the possibility of resurrecting Arthur Conan Doyle's creation for a Christmas special. He and the Corporation failed to reach an agreement, but as he "raced round the endless circular corridors, frothing at the mouth at what these philistines might be planning", Gatiss bumped into John Simpson, recently returned from Kabul. “As he passed me,” Gatiss explained, “I touched him on the arm and whispered: ‘You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive’.” This gave him the seed of an idea, which he and Moffat subsequently grew into a modern-day Sherlock: "A young army doctor, wounded in Afghanistan finds himself alone and friendless in London," he teased the group. "Short of cash, he bumps into an old medical acquaintance who tells him he knows of someone looking for a flatmate. This bloke’s alright but a little odd..." Gatiss was effectively pitching his and Moffat’s Sherlock to the toughest crowd imaginable, and they approved. 2. There is no abandoned tube station at Sumatra Road Related Articles

(BBC)
The location chosen for the bomb-laden tube carriage meant to blow up Parliament in the season three opener The Empty Hearse is actually in West Hampstead, and isn't the site of a half-finished London Underground station (although the Bull & Bush abandoned station is nearby). It's nowhere near Westminster, but was chosen by Gatiss as a sly reference to The Giant Rat of Sumatra, a Holmes adventure mentioned (but never expanded upon) in The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire. Sherlock's production team couldn't get hold of a real carriage, so mocked up their own District Line replica - despite exterior shots clearly showing a Jubilee Line train. Tube-loving viewers have also been quick to point out other inaccuracies.
3. Not everybody appreciated Irene Adler’s nudity (BBC)
The BBC reportedly received over 100 complaints about actress Lara Pulver’s portrayal of Holmes’s female sparring partner as an upmarket dominatrix who used pre-watershed seminudity to bewitch the detective in A Scandal in Belgravia. But some Sherlock purists objected on different grounds. Irene Adler as conceived by Conan Doyle in A Scandal in Bohemia, it was argued in blog after blog, was a formidable woman of honour, who would never allow herself to become a pawn of Moriarty, or to fall for Holmes after showing him her breasts. Steven Moffat disagreed with the feminists. "In the original,” he told The Guardian, “Irene Adler's victory over Sherlock Holmes was to move house and run away with her husband. That's not a feminist victory." 4. Holmes and Watson are good enough to eat Speedy’s Cafe, the sandwich emporium frequented by Holmes and Watson in the series, is a real café on Gower Street, near Euston – the BBC’s stand-in for 221b Baker Street. (In the Sherlock pilot it was run by Una Stubbs’s character and named Mrs Hudson’s Snax n' Sarnies, but that idea was swiftly dropped.) The fans who flock there from all over the world can now enjoy specially created Sherlock-themed snacks, specifically the Sherlock wrap (chicken, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, peppers, red onion, cucumber, chilli sauce – all "wrapped up as tightly as Sherlock’s personality") or the Watson Wrap (roasted vegetables, spinach, tomatoes, spring onion, Brie, sour cream – "safe, warm, and comforting, like his personality"). A Moriarty sub is reportedly in the works. REVIEW: Sherlock: The Empty Hearse
5. Despite China’s best efforts, Sherlock isn’t gay As amply demonstrated by the kisses in season three’s first episode, The Empty Hearse, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have always enjoyed flirting with the ambiguity of Sherlock’s sexuality. "Everyone recruited him to their perspective, their interpretation," Benedict Cumberbatch once said when asked about Holmes’s sex life. "I’ve had asexuals come up to me and thank me for representing asexuals." But they’re mistaken, according to Moffat: "There's no indication in the original stories that [Holmes] was asexual or gay," he told The Guardian. None of which has stopped millions of Chinese fans from adopting Sherlock as a gay icon, with a vast archive of literature dedicated to his romantic exploits with Watson. There’s a 39-chapter romance novel; a much-viewed video super-cut, above, of Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (or ‘Curly Fu’ and ‘Peanut’, to give them their Chinese nicknames) exchanging longing looks set to slushy music; plus, of course, the inevitable S&M scenarios. All of which may seem like fairly standard fan-fiction fare – until you remember that in China, writing such filth is a crime punishable with a lengthy jail term. 6. Benedict Cumberbatch doesn’t play the violin quite as well as Sherlock (BBC)
In Arthur Conan Doyle’s story The Cardboard Box, it transpires that Sherlock Holmes owns and plays a violin made by Antonio Stradivarius himself. The Sherlock production team, however, uses a different violin for each series (series three’s is a £1,200 Chinese-made Con Fuoco), all on loan from Cardiff Violins. (The shop’s website contains a sweet testimonial from a ‘Mr John H Watson’, thanking the staff for being ‘extremely patient’ with his friend: ‘He would thank you himself; only, well Sherlock doesn’t really do that sort of thing ...’) For season two’s on-screen violin scenes, Cumberbatch was taught how to play and ‘violin act’ by Eos Chater, a member of the classical group Bond. Although the actor played live on set, the playing heard on the soundtrack is by Chater. "Benedict had a week, and made a surprisingly good sound," she wrote of the experience on her blog. "I have no doubt he would be a good violinist if he had the inclination." 7. Yet his pen-catching skills are beyond reproach A scene in The Blind Banker shows John throwing a pen to Sherlock, who catches it without even looking at it. Cumberbatch made the catch on the first take (using a mirror so he could see it coming), but the cameraman was too slow and missed it. He got it again on the third. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH: Is he the greatest ever Holmes?
8. China can’t understand why Sherlock takes so long to make During David Cameron’s official visit to China last December, the Prime Minister allowed Chinese citizens to ask him questions through Sina Weibo, the country’s Twitter-like social network. Among queries about Larry the Downing Street cat, Tom Daley, Visa application forms and Wendi Deng, by far the most popular request was: “Please urge Sherlock crew to be quick! They have had us waiting for two years for every season!” Cameron diplomatically pointed out that “I can’t tell them what to do, as it’s an independent company”, before urging fans to pass the time by reading Conan Doyle’s stories. 9. Sherlock’s staircase would please purists In Conan Doyle's A Scandal in Bohemia, Sherlock asks Watson how many steps lead up to their quarters at 221b Baker Street. Watson hasn't a clue. “I know there are 17 steps, because I have both seen and observed,” Holmes tells him. Because Sherlock fans are similarly observant, there are 17 steps leading to the first floor of the Sherlock Holmes Museum, and another 17 between the hall and front room on the Cardiff set of Sherlock. READ: How Sherlock became a global phenomenon
10. In Japan, he’s a comic book hero Japan has a long tradition of Sherlock-influenced, copyright-avoiding manga or anime: Young Miss Holmes, a manga comic about Sherlock’s niece; Detective Hound, a canine anime series co-created by Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki; the unrelated Detective Dog Sherdock, a comic in which the sleuth is reincarnated as a dog; and the Arthur Conan Doyle-inspired boy crime-solver Detective Conan, whose latest animated adventure trounced Keanu Reeves’s 47 Ronin at the Japanese box-office. But the BBC series recently received the ultimate accolade: completely faithful (ie, free of tentacled creatures and and robots) comic-book adaptations of the episodes A Study in Pink and The Blind Banker in Young Ace magazine. As the above rendering proves, Cumberbatch’s gamine features make him the perfect manga hero. 11. And in South Korea, he’s (almost) a pop star K-pop pretty-boys SHINee paid tribute to the series with their 2012 hit Sherlock, and an accompanying video full of slightly suspect Holmes-ian references (violin, shabby Victoriana decor, an ‘iWatson’ laptop), in which they solve a jewel heist seemingly perpetrated by a ghost: 12. ‘221b Baker Street’ actually looks like this (ZOOPLA.CO.UK)
The 370 sq ft one-bedroom flat above Speedy’s Cafe (see number 4), which is in fact about a mile away from Baker Street but doubles as Sherlock’s home for exterior shots, was available for rent in early 2012 for the price of £330 a week. 13. Sherlock isn’t a sociopath In A Study In Pink, Anderson flippantly calls Holmes a psychopath. "Do your research, Anderson," comes the reply. “I'm a high-functioning sociopath.” Not true, according to psychologist Maria Konnikova, who convincingly argues that Sherlock is altogether too loving, empathetic, and aware of his own faults to be considered a sociopath. 14. But he may be autistic Late last year, autism charity the National Autistic Society cited Sherlock’s single-mindedness, inability to understand social norms such as sarcasm, and incredible feats of recall as evidence that he might be autistic. This, despite Watson making a direct reference to his friend’s Asperger’s in The Hounds of Baskerville. 15. Even the fonts have meaning As typography design experts have noted, the lettering used for Sherlock’s on-screen graphics varies according to the occasion. For text messages, AF Generation Z is used; to show Sherlock deduction process, it’s P22 Johnston Underground (above); Irene Adler’s high-end Vertu phone uses the business-like Verdanda. Johnston Underground is also used as the basis for the series’ custom-made title font. FIRST LOOK: Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing 16. The Russians have their own Sherlock Freud’s Method, a crime drama produced by Russia’s Star Media, bears a striking resemblance to the BBC series. The lead character is Roan Freydin, a "psychologist and professional poker player" working as a "special consultant" to the police, who are infuriated by his "eccentric methods" but impressed by his ability to solve crimes using "psychological science" and "intuition". Even the opening titles look a little familiar, as Mark Gatiss noted with his tweet: "Ha! The sincerest form of flattery". 17. Sherlock is (possibly) responsible for BlackBerry’s woes In 2010, season one of Sherlock showed Holmes using a blazingly fast BlackBerry 9700; come season two, broadcast by the BBC in early 2012, he’d made the switch to an Apple iPhone 4. By the end of January, BlackBerry co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie had stepped down, admitting that the company had failed to compete with Apple. Coincidence? Draw your own conclusions. 18. Matt Smith wanted to be Watson A week before landing the part of Doctor Who, Matt Smith auditioned to play John Watson; Steven Moffat decided he was "too barmy", and that one Sherlock was enough. Martin Freeman, on the other hand, arrived at his audition having had his wallet stolen on the way and was in such a bad mood it was assumed he wasn’t interested. The following week, he returned in a better frame of mind, read with Benedict Cumberbatch, and the part was his. 19. Benedict Cumberbatch hates Sherlock’s hair The actor’s preparations for looking the part of Sherlock include intense Bikram yoga sessions, swimming, and no smoking or drinking during filming. But there’s one thing he especially hates doing: growing his hair. As he told The Times, “I can’t think of a wittier or even accurate comparison, but I just think it makes me look a bit like… a woman.” 20. Mark Gatiss learnt to swim in Moriarty’s pool At the end of season one, Moriarty lures Holmes and Watson to a beautiful public pool in order to kill them. The location used (for both the cliffhanger and the beginning of season two, forcing the crew to return a year later and recreate the signage) is Bristol South Swimming Pool; according to the Sherlockology blog, this is also where a young Mark Gatiss learnt to swim. 21. Sherlock and Mrs Hudson knew each other in a previous life (BBC)
Benedict Cumberbatch has often said that Una Stubbs (above), who plays his screen landlady Mrs Hudson, mothers him on the set of Sherlock. But she has good reason: Stubbs is an acting contemporary of Cumberbatch’s mother Wanda Ventham (who made a surprise appearance in The Empty Hearse as Sherlock's Les Mis-loving mother, alongside the actor's father Timothy Carlton as Holmes senior), and used to live around the corner from her when Cumberbatch was a child. So a four-year-old Benedict would often find himself forced to endure hours of boredom as Stubbs and his mother gossiped on park benches or street corners. Stubbs nonetheless found him “Very polite... A lovely boy.” IN PICTURES: THE 20 GREATEST SHERLOCK HOLMES Follow @Telegraph_TV

Royal wee: Prince Harry reveals Apache toilet break secrets
When you spend hours flying an Apache attack helicopter high above Afghanistan, you soon learn how relieve yourself when nature calls, Prince Harry reveals. 11:31AM GMT 22 Jan 2013
Prince Harry explained that Apache helicopters are fitted with portable lavatory bags called "travel johns," for pilots who have to spend up to four hours in the cockpit at a time. "If I can hold it in, I will," he said. "Once you've been out here for two or three weeks, you master the art of peeing sitting down. "There is no hole in the bottom of the seat, it's literally a bag. Some people blow into it so it makes it easier, other people just open it up." The Prince, who admitted that he first found it difficult to master the art of going to the toilet whilst in the air, has now given the portable bag system the royal seal of approval.

China's new leader Xi Jinping warns Communist Party faces 'severe challenges' Xi Jinping has stepped forward as China's new paramount leader with a remarkable speech that shattered Communist party convention. By Malcolm Moore, Great Hall of the People, Beijing and Tom Phillips
7:48AM GMT 15 Nov 2012
Comments
The 59-year-old son of one of the Party's revolutionary heroes walked out, just before noon on Thursday, onto a red-carpeted dais in the Great Hall of the People, fulfilling a destiny that some had predicted since his youth. He was anointed the head of the Communist party and the head of the military as Hu Jintao relinquished all his roles, and will be rubber-stamped as China's president next March at the annual meeting of the country's parliament. Standing at the head of a slimmed-down, seven-man ruling council, Mr Xi then signalled that his era would be different, breaking with "formalism" and "bureaucracy" to deliver a "better life" for the Chinese people. Appearing entirely at ease in front of hundreds of television cameras, a relaxed Mr Xi was a stark contrast to his predecessor, Hu Jintao, whose final addresses as president were stiff, interminable, and packed with repetitive Soviet-style jargon. Mr Xi's speech was confident and eloquent, without any slogans or the customary hat tips to the leadership and wisdom of Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin or Mr Hu. Related Articles

"Our people love life and yearn for better education, stable jobs, more satisfactory income, greater social security, improved medical and health care, and a more beautiful environment," he said, simply. "We want our children to grow up well and have better jobs and more fulfilling lives. The people's desire for a better life is what we shall fight for. Every bit of happiness in the world is created by hard work," he added. He outlined a vision of a more co-operative China on the world stage. "We will make the Chinese nation stand rock-firm in the family of nations," he said. "China needs to understand the world better, and the world needs to understand China better too."

And while he said the Party had "every reason" to be proud of its "world-renowned achievements", he added that its 82 million members must conduct themselves "honourably". "Our Party faces many severe challenges, and there are also many pressing problems within the Party that need to be resolved, particularly corruption, being divorced from the people, and going through the formalism and bureaucracy caused by some Party officials," he said. "We are well aware that the capability of one individual is limited ... One can only work for a limited period of time, but there is no limit to serving the people with dedication. Our responsibility is weightier than Mount Tai, and our road ahead is a long one," he said. Mr Xi's grand entrance won instant plaudits. "He looks confident, self-composed and the logic of his speech is clear. His wording is unpretentious," said Li Weidong, a liberal former editor of China Reform magazine. "The most impressive thing is that he did not mention Maoism, Marxism and Leninism," said one well-connected commentator in Beijing, who asked not to be named. "He spared us the routine rubbish that the former leaders used to spout, although of course they may have just changed his speech writer."
In an optimistic signed editorial in Caixin, Hu Shuli, a well-connected Chinese journalist, said the Party Congress, which closed on Wednesday, had given "more substance" to hopes of further reforms. "China as a country in transition bears signs of an authoritarian society. This makes it all the more crucial to have clear checks on power," she wrote. However, while many are hopeful that Mr Xi may usher in a fresh era, the line-up of men alongside him in the Politburo Standing Committee appears relatively conservative. China's new Politburo: Leader of China Communist Party Xi Jinping (centre), (clockwise from top left) Zhang Dejiang, Li Keqiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan, Zhang Gaoli (Reuters)
Aside from Li Keqiang, the 57-year-old number two, the other five men on the ruling council are aged between 64 and 67, suggesting they will all have to retire in five years time, according to the Party's rules. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist from Hong Kong's Baptist University, warned that despite Mr Xi's speech, the "rather conservative" Politburo Standing Committee are unlikely to push for major change. "The big question ¨C the big elephant in the room ¨C is the need to revive political reform and I don't see this leadership as united or courageous enough to revive political reform," he said. Instead, Prof. Cabestan said he envisaged the new leadership "muddling through for as long as possible with one-party rule and giving the hot potato to the next [group of leaders]". Standing in matching suits, and all exactly the same height, the new leaders each stepped forward in turn to greet the media. Only one man, 64-year-old Wang Qishan, broke the dress code, wearing a blue rather than a red tie. After Mr Xi spoke, the seven men exited stage left, without taking any questions from the press.

Snape Maltings: a community in tune with its surroundings
The movie Quartet told the story of musicians who retired with like-minded folk. Harry de Quetteville finds a real-life version
at Snape Maltings in Suffolk.
Rich heritage: not only are the views from Snape Maltings inspiring, but the development is full of character with the comforts of modern living By Harry de Quetteville
8:00AM GMT 11 Feb 2013
Comments
Small, tightly knit communities have always been catnip to screenwriters. With everyone living on top of each other, it’s hard not to suspect, and sneakily hope, that love and intrigue lie just beneath the surface. If you are visiting, you just have to cross your fingers and hope that things are more Downton Abbey than EastEnders – or worse, Midsomer Murders. Snape Maltings, in Suffolk, inland from Aldeburgh, is just such a vibrant, energetic community in the making. Here, 65 houses and flats are being wrested from lovely, but crumbling, industrial buildings on a seven-acre site that is also home to the renowned Aldeburgh Festival. Thirty have already been completed, with around half of them occupied by people who have opted to live there full-time. Although the development has not been specifically conceived with retirees in mind, many of the buyers are people who have stopped working and are drawn to this lovely corner of Suffolk. For them, music is one of the main attractions. Indeed, watching the residents of Snape Maltings drift about serenely one wintry morning the thought strikes me: this is not Midsomer (thank God) or Albert Square. I have accidentally stumbled on a real-life version of the Dustin Hoffman-directed movie Quartet. That film, you may remember, stars Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, and Billy Connolly as opera singers who in their dotage have retired to a swish retreat, Beecham House. Old passions and tempests are rekindled as Maggie Smith arrives on the scene and the four principals prepare for a concert to celebrate Verdi’s birthday. Related Articles

Making music key to happy retirement, research says
24 Nov 2011
So often excluded from Hollywood’s depiction of vivacious living, these retirees are shown in full swing, enjoying life to the full. And what’s going on at Snape Maltings proves that such an existence for the over-65s – the chance to retire among like-minded people – needn’t be merely a cinematic fantasy. Around these impressive buildings, it isn’t hard to imagine gossipy intrigue among friends who share the same passions. Many of the first 20 flats that were built, for example, look out on to a charming courtyard. Perfect for a quiet natter with – or preferably about – the neighbours. “We started planning in 2004 and began to finish the first phase in 2007 just as the downturn hit,” explains John Gooderham, whose family have owned the site since 1965. “Even so, it has been a real success. All the first 20 flats sold. Alesha and John Gooderham have established a retreat to offer buyers the chance to live with people who share their interests “Half the buyers have been looking for a second home. The rest are here to stay, retiring to live here full-time. They’ve been able to move into brand-new homes on an old site. So they don’t have to worry about repairs but they can enjoy the heritage.”
Phase two was completed last year. It comprises 10 four-bedroom homes that, unlike the flats, look out on the reeds and marshland of the Alde estuary towards the picturesque St Botolph’s Church at Iken. It’s a stunning view, though not, I have to say, totally unimpeded (by lights and parking). “The whole project should be finished in 2018,” says John. “It really goes to show what private enterprise can do – taking on a big project and making it work in a sympathetic way. Planners know that we’re not here to make a fast buck. They understand that the Gooderham family has been here for years and is here to stay.” The intervention is much needed. Phase three, with 35 flats, will be crafted from the shell of one of the biggest buildings yet to be salvaged. Its condition is evidence of what would have happened to this place if it had been left to drift. Old winches and girders are rusting and imperilled. The hulks of two old cars sit rotting. It’s atmospheric. But not exactly uplifting. And yet, I’m humming. The reason is blowing in the wind. As in Quartet, music is everywhere at Snape Maltings. Just opposite the ruin is a large rehearsal complex for the festival eked from a series of once equally derelict buildings. Around the corner, the main concert hall and opera house sits under a roof sporting distinctive square malthouse vents. And although the annual festival, which this year features such renowned artists as Judith Weir and the Hallé Orchestra, is not staged until June, there’s a busy year-round programme of events. Musicians carrying violins and tubas bustle about, semibreves and quavers linger in the air. When all 65 properties are completed, there are likely to be almost 100 people living here full-time, with double that at busy times. The real-life Beecham House, it seems, has arrived. Except that the composer in question is not Verdi but the festival’s founder Benjamin Britten, who lived in nearby Aldeburgh for 30 years and whose centenary is celebrated this year. The film 'Quartet' is about opera singers who have retired to a swish retreat, Beecham House The other principal difference is that where Beecham (in reality Hedsor House, in Bucks) is a glorious Georgian mansion, Snape Maltings is an industrial relic. No matter. For there is something so evocative about Victorian industrial architecture. It’s the way that individual buildings were plugged into the nation’s infrastructure network to become part of something seamless, something bigger than themselves. The grand planners of that era seem in retrospect like boys dreaming of the layout of their model railway sets – dreamers plotting the carefully synchronised moves of each signal and locomotive. Indeed, the traces of what used to be the railway at Snape are still clear. The branch line opened in 1859, with a daily goods service that hauled the malt to London’s breweries. The locomotive terminated on the site, and rails ran throughout the complex. They went between the malt houses and stores, and down to the quay, where the Alde still broadens in anticipation of the sea just five miles away. What had previously been a remote corner of the countryside, best-suited to smuggling, was suddenly accessible, prosperous even. But the dream of those boys with their train sets faded as it did in so many other places. Gradually the pace and production at these marvellous red-brick buildings slowed. Grand open spaces which had once respired easily with the ambition of the times fell silent and died. And began, in many cases, to crumble. Many such spaces around the country, particularly in city centres, have since been refurbished by upmarket developers. But they have always seemed a touch soulless to me, the stripping away of their grand Victorian purpose removing an essential part of their identity. There is a hopeful sense, however, that things might be different at Snape. For there is a big idea here, one that yokes nature with music and a very definite style of life to bring bustle once again to a corner of the world that was in danger of simply rotting away. This is a project that rings with the best of Victorian-era enlightened entrepreneurialism. The community identity is reinforced by shops which sell everything from aprons to children’s toys to furniture (all in the best possible taste, of course). The food hall is being enlarged and will open soon. “We’ve kept on expanding what’s on offer here on site,” John says. “People can get a lot of what they need on foot.” Shopping and music are not the only activities on the menu. On the day I visited, the on-site Café 1885 was running a course on how to cook game. Elsewhere footpaths lead directly away from the site into a nature reserve. As I strolled towards Iken on a crisp, bright morning, a kingfisher darted through the reeds in front of me, just one of the species that makes this a birdwatchers’ paradise. One resident couple do better than walk – having bought their own boat they can putter out into the estuary, getting closer than ever to the wildlife. Others, no doubt, will prefer the social delights of living cheek-by-jowl with their fellows. For although it must be eminently possible to live a happy life in isolation, surely the point is to get stuck in. Maggie Smith would. After all, as Jane Austen so famously observed in her novel Pride and Prejudice: “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours?” Three-bedroom town house at Snape Maltings starts from £550,000 to £650,000. They are available through Savills (01603 229 229)

Who is at fault: Eden Hazard or Swansea ballboy?
Those who seek to defend Eden Hazard need their eyesight, sanity and moral compass checking. Hazard was a fool who kicked a ballboy, who set fire to the Football Association’s Respect document and dragged Chelsea into another fine mess.

You cannot kick ballboys, whatever the desire to flick a ball loose, whatever the provocation of a self-admiring teenager. Ballboys should be seen and not hurt. Such has been the perfect snowstorm of tribalism, naivety and sanctimony following events 10 minutes from time at the Liberty Stadium on Wednesday that the simple truth is in danger of being clouded. Hazard kicked Charlie Morgan, a ballboy mature in years if immature in behaviour. Hazard risked a criminal charge. And just imagine the headlines of horror and outpouring of outrage on the airwaves and social media had Morgan kicked Hazard. It was disappointing to hear usually sanguine voices like Pat Nevin eviscerating Morgan. Michael Owen, another traditionally rational observer, was also critical. So was Jason Cundy. Hazard himself looked bemused when Chris Foy waved the red card: the impertinence, the indignity, the injustice. What nonsense. Hazard had to go and faces an extension to the three-match ban if the FA’s charred Respect edict is to have any credibility. His argument that he was kicking the ball is irrelevant; he made contact with Morgan. Related Articles

Hazard shamed his club and his sport. He is a professional sportsman paid handsomely to be disciplined. He is a role model who exploits his appeal to impressionable youth financially through a boot deal with Nike. He is bright enough to know that tangling with ballboys is wrong. Chelsea, to their eventual credit, admitted Hazard erred and made him issue a partial mea culpa. Frank Lampard’s compassion towards Morgan reflected that the midfielder, a true leader, realised that this was another PR disaster for a club who have endured a few. Lampard’s fine behaviour was another reason why Chelsea are mad not to keep this soulful, responsible ambassador. Still, Chelsea will be represented by Hazard, the scourge of ballboys who will now be targeted by opposition fans. Where Hazard supporters like Nevin, Owen, Cundy and company suffer most from myopia is in not seeing the harm to the sport they love. To the footballing agnostic (about half the country if broadcasters are to be believed), Hazard’s kick was another sign of the arrogance of the modern millionaire footballer. The alienation from the modern game continues. Hazard deserves all the opprobrium from right-minded onlookers and whatever additional spell on the naughty step decreed by the FA beaks. It is also to be hoped that Martin Morgan, a director of the club, has a word with his time-wasting, limelight-seeking son whose self-aggrandising tendencies are seen in his twitter account handle boasting a rather presumptuous “TM” trademark logo. If Morgan wanted fame, he has certainly got it. Infamy in many eyes. He embarrassed his father and the club. Pity. The Liberty is one of the friendliest grounds to visit: Swansea City’s staff are chatty and helpful while fans stroll up before kick-off to engage in a natter about the game. The players and the manager, Michael Laudrup, represent the club well. The full-back Àngel Rangel modestly admitted to passing round food for the homeless. Morgan’s unwillingness to release the ball to Hazard contrasted with the intrinsically classy nature of Swansea City Football Club. Morgan also distracted from one of the most special nights in Swansea’s history. People should have been talking about defender Ashley Williams. Afterwards, Laudrup was besieged with questions about ballboys and belligerent Belgians. But it was the briefing with Rafael Benítez that was really the all-ticket affair. Benítez, sensibly, agreed that Hazard was culpable, then added that Morgan was to blame and so was society. Press conferences with Benítez usually meander through such territory as Lampard’s future, Fernando Torres’s body language, and the interim first-team manager’s relationship with Chelsea’s fans and the club’s owner Roman Abramovich. Here it hurtled into Desmond Morris country. At one point, as Benítez argued that Morgan was effectively a product of a “Big Brother culture”, discreet inquiries were made over whether the Spaniard was referring to George Orwell or Jade Goody. Benítez had a legitimate point, though, about youngsters’ obsession with becoming celebrities. Note to Morgan. Read up on Icarus. In truth, Benítez should really raise a quiet glass of Rioja to Morgan and Hazard. The spotlight on the ballboy tore the focus away from Chelsea’s largely limp display and Benítez’s own guilt in not changing the system and personnel earlier. Benítez’s meek surrender let down those many Chelsea fans who slalomed and skidded west and east along the snow-strewn M4. Hazard let them down even more. You do not kick ballboys. Chelsea

Manchester City reveal how they plan to eclipse United and become the best in the world
Manuel Pellegrini, the incoming manager at Manchester City, will be set the target of winning five trophies in five years, including the Champions League, as chief executive Ferran Soriano sets out the club's plans to eclipse United and rule the world. Looking to the future: Manchester City stars model the club's new kit for next season By Mark Ogden, New York

Sacking Mancini
Ferran Soriano, the man charged with making Manchester City the best football club in the world, has disclosed that the lack of “good football” as well as failing to meet expectations was behind the sacking of Roberto Mancini. City’s chief executive, speaking in depth for the first time about his blueprint for success, said that new manager Manuel Pellegrini would be set the target of winning five trophies in the next five years, including the Champions League, and that he believed the club could eclipse Manchester United off the field, as well as on it. Soriano, formerly a Barcelona executive, said that a lack of aesthetic progress on the pitch sealed Mancini’s fate and that even success in the FA Cup final would not have altered the club’s thinking. “This is a long-term decision taken with a lot of careful analysis,” Soriano said. “We would never fire or change a manager for one or two results. Once you go down the path of change, you have to be very sure. Related Articles

“Roberto Mancini did very good for the club. He changed the mentality, he changed it from a club that was not winning to a winning club and that is very hard. That is all good, but we are now looking for several things. We are looking to play good football and to win and I said that in the right order. “In the last year, I think it’s fair to say that our football did not progress or evolve as we hoped. If you play good football you will win and we believe we have a fantastic squad. It would be very hard for us to change the players for any others in the UK and that includes the champions of the league.” Mancini’s dismissal, despite winning the Premier League and FA Cup at City, was met with opposition by supporters and disdain by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson but Soriano believes that it is becoming less likely for managers to remain at clubs for longer than four years. “In football, teams have cycles and you can have managers who go through several cycles and managers who go through one cycle,” Soriano said. “Obviously, we want the next manager to stay for a number of years, but I think it would not be wise to speculate on the next manager being there for 26 years. “Players need another way, another excitement, and managers also want to move, but I think this is normal. Barcelona had two managers in eight years with Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola and were arguably the most successful club in that time.”
-----
Keeping close to Guardiola
Soriano insists that no move was made to hire former Barcelona coach Guardiola before he accepted the role at Bayern Munich last December but the chief executive claims the Spaniard will work in the Premier League eventually and that City would have pursued him had he been available now. “I know Pep and Txiki [Begiristain] knows Pep,” Soriano said. “So we don’t need to be in the market for Pep. If Pep decided to come to England, I think he would have called us, right? "But at the time, we had our own manager and we were not in the market. Pep is going to a big club, but I also think he is very young – he is 41 now – and after Germany he probably will come to England to coach somewhere.” Were Guardiola still available City would be trying to hire him now? “We would because we are actively looking for a manager,” Soriano said. “But at the time, it was not the time. With Pep, the conversation is not about us chasing him or him chasing us. Pep and Txiki speak regularly, maybe weekly, so that would have been an easy one.” -----
Hiring Pellegrini
Malaga coach Pellegrini is due to be announced as Mancini’s replacement shortly and Txiki Begiristain, the City sporting director, has been leading the recruitment process. “What we asked Txiki to do was look at several criteria, the candidates in the market and come back with a recommendation,” Soriano said. “This recommendation has to go through me and the chairman, who will present to the owner and, collectively, we will decide who the new manager is. “But the starting point is a technical analysis, it’s not emotion, it’s not about somebody you know, it’s a technical analysis of what we need. It might well be that there are candidates who, on the surface, don’t look as attractive as they are once you have done the work on them and also speaking to the players who have played under them, which is a fantastic source of information.” Having worked alongside Soriano at Barcelona as director of football, Begiristain has been charged with overseeing football operations at City, but Soriano insists that the former Spain winger will work with the new manager, not above him. “It’s not a relationship of one reporting to the other, it’s a relationship of collaboration,” Soriano said. “It’s impossible for Txiki to develop a squad and a concept of football that’s not in line with what the manager wants. The manager is maybe the most important employee of the club. “We have a board and then there’s a chief executive, which is me, and the whole organisation reports to me. That means Txiki and whoever else. The difference in role between Txiki and the manager is that the director of football has, and has to have, a long-term view. “So what we are asking him to do is build a squad, but also football concepts, and a way of working that will last for the next 10 years. The manager has a shorter span. “We are asking the manager to win this season, next season and every Sunday. The manager should tend to look at the short-term, and the football director the long-term, but they have to work together and I have seen it work.” -----
Becoming Europe’s kings
Manchester City will set Pellegrini the target of winning five trophies in five years, including the Champions League. Under Mancini, City failed to progress beyond the group stage of the competition in each of their two campaigns. “In the grand scheme of things, if we look at the next five years and I could plan now, I would say I want to win five trophies in the next five years,” Soriano said. “That may mean we win no trophies one year and two in another, but on average, I want one trophy or title a year. That includes the Champions League, the Premier League or the Cup. Is it a realistic aim? I think it is, yes. But I am talking about five years. “If next year we don’t win, but progress our football and get to the semi-finals of the Champions League, finish second in the Premier League and lose the FA Cup final again, that will be fine.” Soriano claims that City’s squad should have delivered the Premier League title last season, despite Manchester United’s double-figure winning points margin. “The squad we have is a squad capable of winning the Premier League and is not a squad that should be kicked out at the first group stage of the Champions League. You know, these things can happen – this is football and we all understand football. But we have better players than that.” -----
Keep and buy the best
Sergio Agüero will not be sold by City this summer, with Soriano insisting no offers have been received for the Argentine and, significantly, that the player has not expressed a desire to leave due to the break-up of his marriage to wife Giannina. The split has led to Agüero’s son, Benjamin, moving out of the country. “He is not leaving,” Soriano said. “This speculation has gone on and on and on, but we have had discussions with Sergio and his agent about several things and he has never expressed a willingness to go. We have never had an offer and even if we had an offer, we would say no.” There be will high-profile arrivals and departures this summer. City are pursuing Napoli’s Edinson Cavani, Malaga winger Isco, Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fernandinho and others. “There will be changes and this is not something that starts today in the transfer window,” he said. “We have been working on this for the whole year so we know what the positions are that we want to improve. "You have to bring extra competition, so I think you will find at least two or three new players every year, but we cannot change seven players every year. "We have been analysing the positions we want to improve and the market since the start of November. We are at the closing phase with several of them [targets], but the closing phase can take one week or three months.” -----
Easing the tensions
Training-ground fights, Mancini’s public criticisms of his players and the fractious nature of his relationship with the squad ensured that City were never far from negative headlines under the Italian. Soriano says the new manager must ease tensions and bring harmony to the club. “What we want is not the image of unity,” Soriano said. “We want the unity. I have seen dressing rooms with tensions before and those tensions come from the competition and that fact that all the men in that dressing room want to win all the time. "Having said that, with the new manager, we are asking him that the dressing room has as much harmony as possible, knowing total harmony is impossible. “With the kind of squad we have, we want a senior manager at this point. We want a manager who knows about football, but we want somebody who knows about man-management and this is something we are convinced about – that it is impossible for us to win, win the Champions League in the end, if we don’t have a group that behaves like a family.” Soriano admits that the family image craved by City’s hierarchy was dented by Mancini’s training-ground spat with Mario Balotelli in January. “I am not an Italian, I am Catalan, but I am closer to that culture, so I knew from the first minute I saw the photos that there was nothing to worry about,” Soriano said. “It was just a typical thing, typical behaviour. But, yes, I was worried about the image we were giving to the world.” -----
Creating a ‘City style’
Manchester City are not aiming to model their style of play on Barcelona, but Soriano admits that winning with style is a priority and central to the club’s blueprint. “The only way to win is to play good football,” Soriano said. “You can win one year playing not so good football, being lucky and having two extraordinary players, but that’s not sustainable. "It’s impossible to be sustainable if every year we have to go to the market for five or six players. That’s not to say we won’t be signing expensive players. We will. But the objective – the vision – is to have a team where there will be at least half of the players will be City players. “Let me explain what I mean. A ‘City’ player will be like Joe Hart who has been there a while. They love the club and can be the core of the squad. "When a young boy or a marquee signing comes, he knows there are some people who are going to tell him ‘this is City, this is how we play, this is how we behave’. “They are the core of the team. So, the vision is that we will have at least half of the team at this core and we will be adding players every year. We have a fantastic squad and we will ask the new manager to use this squad to deliver good football and, if he does that, we will win and we will support him.” -----
Beating Manchester United
Manchester City’s partnership with the New York Yankees to run the New York City FC MLS team will open new doors commercially for the club. Soriano helped inspire Barcelona’s rapid commercial rise 10 years ago and believes his club can match Manchester United and the Spanish champions in terms of generating off-field revenue. “We are catching up very fast. In the last few months, we have totally changed the commercial organisation. We have an office in London now and we are very successful. “United have been very successful in the past but we are catching up and I am very confident. When I started in another club [Barcelona] in 2003, our revenue was £123 million and United’s was £251 million. After three years our revenue was higher than United. “Our revenues will increase and we are not worried about Financial Fair Play at all. We will compete with United and others in the market, commercially. We have humility, we are humble and we will take our time, but look at the record – already City is number seven in the rankings. “However, it all starts on the pitch – football is not about marketing, it’s about playing and winning so if we don’t win on the pitch, there’s no good marketing strategy that is going to take us where the others are.” Manchester City
