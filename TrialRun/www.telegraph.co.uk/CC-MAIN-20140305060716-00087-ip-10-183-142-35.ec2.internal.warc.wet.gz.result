Track T800-CDi review

The diesel Track T800's Smart engine ensures the machine is no slouch

My grandfather taught motorcycle dispatch riders in the Artists Rifles during the Second World War and I could feel his spirit as I climbed on the Track T800. It’s a cold day, so wait for the glow plugs, then thumb the starter – “dakka, dakka”, the engine turns over slowly and catches. “Diesel!” I could almost hear my grandfather explode. “What sort of motorcycle is that?”
You wouldn’t know it from the exhaust pipe, which remains impressively smoke free, but the vibration from this three-cylinder turbodiesel (out of Mercedes-Benz’s Smart car), shakes the handmade trail bike’s windscreen in a dozen different directions. Not that you feel it on the foot pegs or the bars. Only your ears get assaulted on this Dutch-built machine – it sounds like a coffee grinder. With a belt-driven, continuously variable transmission and a centrifugal clutch, you simply turn the throttle and pull away, although with a seat height of 2ft 11in, the sheer loftiness of the T800 leaves shorter riders scrabbling. Be bold with the throttle and getaways are remarkably smooth, but with a dry weight of almost 500lb, you need to balance the centrifugal clutch against the back brake for stability in low-speed manoeuvres. Jez Hermer, the ex-Royal Marine boss of Ovik, which imports the T800, confesses that he struggles to touch the ground and has managed to drop the machine while testing. “We are working on a lower seat,” he says with a grin.

Diesel motorcycles are not new, of course. Remember the cement-mixer-engined Royal Enfield Taurus, capable of 200mpg, but with performance measured on a calendar and retina-detaching vibration? The Hayes Diversified Technologies M1030M1 diesel is no longer in production, but this Kawasaki-based machine showed enough promise to tempt the US Marine Corps. And it is the prize of potential military sales that causes so many to tilt at the diesel-bike windmill. Nato forces have operated a single-fuel policy (diesel) since the mid-Eighties, but nobody has yet come up with a truly successful diesel motorbike. The quest has become something of a cottage industry; there’s even a highly regarded Triumph Tiger conversion using the same Smart 800cc turbodiesel, by Belfast engineer Neil Laughlin. The Track is the brainchild of talented engineer Erik Vegt, of EVA Products in Holland. He and his small team have painstakingly engineered the machine using the last word in components, including a chrome-molybdenum-alloy-steel tubular frame, specially built to accommodate the Smart diesel and its bespoke transmission. “We say this is a half-million-mile driveline, which gives problems for the rest of the machine; the components have to be top quality as well,” says Hermer. And they are: WP spring/dampers, Brembo brakes, Excel wheels and a BMW-inspired shaft drive should last the course and can be individually serviced. Hermer is currently developing a new Kevlar drivebelt that should be good for 18,000 miles and that would be the limiting factor for the service intervals. The T800-CDi is not fast in the current idiom of super trail bikes, but twist the throttle and it moves along deceptively quickly, although you are in no danger of lifting the front wheel, which many might regard as a safety factor. “I’d also like to see anti-lock brakes as standard,” says Hermer. Above 80mph the aerodynamics start to take a toll on performance, but you can make rapid progress on the T800. Top speed is quoted at 102mph, with fuel consumption above 80mpg which, with a 4.2-gallon tank, gives a range exceeding 340 miles. The weight discourages rapid changes in direction and means you have to tug the machine down into a series of bends, but it corners well, with supple damping that allows you to accurately place it in corners. Hermer thinks the damping needs tweaking and it is certainly soft on the initial inch of travel, but after that it feels quite firm and I wouldn’t want much more rebound dialled in. The comfort is exemplary and you could ride this bike all day, helped by the effective MRA windscreen, hand shields and heated grips. And when you want to stop, the brakes are beautifully weighted and powerful. Issues? While the all-up weight is well short of that of a Honda Pan-European touring bike, the seat height makes it tricky at very low speeds and I also found the back brake pedal slightly obscured by the transmission casing. In spite of his vast experience developing specialised military vehicles, Hermer knows that military sales are going to be difficult. “I think UK forces have largely given up on motorcycles,” he says. “The last of the old MT350 Harley-Davidsons and Pan-Europeans have been sold off.”
The forces also seem to have lost the nerve that was so implicit in the image of the lone dispatch rider getting through against all the odds. The late Alan Coren once wrote in Punch about how, when the balloon went up, he would like to be astride a BSA, in a long dispatch rider’s coat, with a hip flask full of cherry brandy and a slab of Bendicks Sporting and Military chocolate. Yet two years ago, the RAF was all aflutter about suffering more injuries to personnel riding motorbikes in their leisure than it was in Iraq. So Hermer is trying to interest the emergency services, the AA and RAC, the blood transfusion and organ transfer services. “We’re in a difficult period of development,” he admits. “The price needs to come down.”
You need to do a lot of miles to make a machine like this pay, but that’s exactly what it has been built to do. On beautiful West Country roads, I probably looked more like the dispatch rider from the Monty Python sketch delivering the funniest joke in the world than one of my grandfather’s intrepid pupils, but the T800 looked the part and seems to have more than enough vim. THE FACTS Track T800-CDi Price/on sale: £15,995/now Power/torque: 50bhp @ 3,000rpm/74bhp @ 1,800rpm Top speed: 102mph Fuel tank/range: 4.2 gallons/320 miles Verdict: The best-ever oil-burning bike, but it’s still too expensive Telegraph rating: Four out of five stars For more information visit the Ovik Special Vehicles website.

Ricky Ponting retires: Australia's former captain calls time on distinguised career after 17 years
Even the lure of an eighth Ashes series could not prevent Ricky Ponting from calling time on his distinguished international career once he’d felt his own high standards had been compromised. By Derek Pringle

A batsman and captain whose natural instinct was to attack, whatever the situation, he leaves the game as one of its greats and arguably its toughest competitor. He will play the last of his 168 Tests where it all began back in 1995, at the WACA, the announcement coming earlier today at a press conference attended by the entire Australian team and their teary captain, Michael Clarke. Sports teams generally like to do their grieving in private but Ponting is held in such high regard by players of all generations in Australia, that a public display was felt more appropriate. There were tributes from opponents too and Kevin Pietersen, enjoying a short break with England in Mumbai, tweeted: “Ricky Ponting - one of the greats. I always got excited playing Australia so I could watch him bat up close. Well done Punter. Legend.”
Opinion about him wasn’t always that complimentary. As one of the most talented teenage batsmen Rod Marsh had ever seen pass through Australia’s Academy, Ponting was picked for his first Test at the age of 20. Whether solely a case of too much too young, he struggled to cope with the attention and hit the bottle, a decision that saw him involved in several unseemly incidents including a brawl in the famous Bourbon and Beefsteak bar in Sydney’s sleazy King’s Cross area.

Cricket Australia came down hard and to his credit he turned away from that life, finding fulfilment in nurturing his substantial talent further to contribute to Australia’s greatest ever era under Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh. Two years ago he beat Shane Warne’s total of Test match wins to become the only man in history to be involved in 100 Test victories. Controversy never really left him though and it resurfaced in another guise when he inherited the captaincy from Waugh. Twitter: Brian Lara - " I know i've given my all," "It's been life for 20 yrs. Not much more I can give" Ponting said. Ricky u will go down as one of the greats!
Transferring the ruthless, uncompromising streak that had fired his batting to maintaining Australia’s dominance of world cricket, saw him and his team involved in several unsavoury incidents as aggression spilled over into naked animosity. One series against India was close to being called off, so high did feelings run, that several commentators in the Australia media called for him to be sacked. Once again Ponting adjusted, ameliorating his win at any cost policy - some say to his and Australia’s detriment after they lost the 2005 Ashes series, their first defeat to England for 19 years. His captaincy certainly came under scrutiny in that series, especially his decision at Edgbaston where he bowled first after winning the toss despite losing Glenn McGrath just minutes earlier when he sprained his ankle treading on a cricket ball. Yet Australia came within two runs of winning, so it was hardly the catastrophic error many claimed it to be. That Ashes defeat was the first of three he suffered as the team’s leader, the most by an Australian captain. He also won one, 5-0, in 2006/7 which had only been done once before, so there was one almighty feast among the famine. Nevertheless, he led Australia to 47 Test victories and 34 consecutive wins in World Cup matches, an incredible record, and all those who played under him speak of a leader they would follow without hesitation. His batting is what those outside the dressing-room will remember most. Blessed with preternatural hand-eye co-ordination, Ponting could destroy just about any attack when the mood took him. His habit of going at the ball hard gave him problems early in his career against spin, especially on slow pitches, but he overcame that to become the complete batsman and form one third of that generation’s sainted trio of stroke-makers alongside Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar. Twitter: Shane Warne - Congrats to Ricky Ponting on an amazing career, well done Punter...Enjoy your last match in Perth buddy, was a pleasure playing with you !!!
When Ponting's eye was in his high backlift allowed him to pull and drive with equal facility, a combination that left the bowler with no option but to persuade his captain to try someone else. His 41 Test hundreds and 30 one-day hundreds, make him second behind Tendulkar’s combined total of 100 centuries, though the Little Master did have a six-year start on him. His 196 against England at Brisbane is his highest Ashes century but his 156 in the last innings to save the match at Old Trafford in 2005 is one of his favourites. England looked likely winners there to take a 2-1 lead but Ponting enabled his team to maintain a level footing, the innings pressing all the pleasure centres his brain being against the Poms and made under extreme pressure. Unlike Tendulkar, he always relished getting into opponents faces while in the field. While Tendulkar likes to be with his own thoughts on the boundary at third man or fine leg, Ponting always wanted to mix it with opponents and intimidate them from cover point where his brilliant ground fielding brought about more than the occasional run-out. At 37, he could have played for a few more years, his fitness not being an issue. His Test average since handing over to Clarke 18 months ago is decet enough too being 41.7 from 25 Test innings. But, as he said today, he’d been “falling at the big moments in games” and that, for a man who always prided himself at staring down trouble, was unacceptable. With retirement looming another decision beckons. Will he become another former captain squeezing into Channel Nine’s commentary box, or will he be like Steve Waugh and head off in other directions? Cricket has driven his life since the age of 16 but Ponting has always been resourceful and prepared to change, characteristics that should enable him to flourish once more as he embarks on the second great adventure of his life.
