Half the Kingdom by Lore Segal, review
Benjamin Evans enjoys a mischief-making satire on the way we treat the elderly

Comments
In a season in which Donna Tartt and Eleanor Catton have delivered doorstoppers, a slender novel such as Half the Kingdom risks seeming unambitious. Crammed with an unwieldy cast of elderly invalids and peppered with asides to “the reader”, Lore Segal’s latest could hardly seem less fashionable. However, it’s fairly safe to venture that Segal, her literary career spanning half a century, wouldn’t give a hoot. In fact, such is the heedless eccentricity of this dark comedy that it practically loops back towards plausibility again. The story is set in and around a Manhattan hospital as it gets to grips with a baffling epidemic. Every old person who sets foot inside the emergency room, even those just visiting relatives, starts to exhibit sudden-onset Alzheimer’s symptoms. This prompts Joe Bernstine, a terminally ill patient obsessed with the apocalyptic since his retirement from a think tank, to dispatch a posse of undercover researchers on to the wards to find out if his far-fetched theories about terrorism hold any water. Not so much a cohesive narrative as an interconnected series of vignettes, many of Segal’s characters are reeling from the quotidian blows of old age: regret, loneliness, estrangement, miscommunication and declining lucidity. Yet her tonal poise continually offsets the sadness with razor-sharp ironies and gleeful wisecracks. Within its mesh of storylines, perhaps the most deliciously mischievous is that of Lucy Friedgold, a 75-year-old writer whose latest “short-short” has been ignored by her publisher. Tasked with investigating the dementia epidemic by Bernstine, Lucy winds up cornered by orderlies in the hospital café, where she is found brandishing a mobile phone and ceaselessly reciting her “best ever” story to anyone who picks up. Segal’s story technique may be disjointed but the novel hangs together as a satire about how we treat the elderly. Her cast of hospital-bound OAPs, faced with nonsensical bureaucracy and judgmental younger relatives, slip into delusion and despair. Their incident-packed pasts now count for little. It seems many of us prefer to avoid contemplating old age until we suddenly arrive there, but this remarkable novel leads us deftly into the heart of that twilight kingdom. Related Articles

Roger Bootle: Economy may well recover strongly, but it's too soon to put out the bunting
So the economy is recovering. At long last. But where has this recovery come from? And, allied to that, can we have confidence in it?

Comments
The Chancellor seems to think so. He has recently declared victory in the battle over economic policy. He has some solid support from recent data across a pretty broad front. But his declaration is essentially political. Even after the recent upbeat numbers, according to the official data, GDP remains 3.2% below the peak registered at the beginning of 2008. After such a recession, there should be a good recovery at some point. Doubts that it is finally here are themselves proof of the deflation of expectations that has taken place during this downturn. People have become inordinately gloomy about the future because the recent history has been so grim. Over the last five years, in real terms, average earnings have fallen by 7%. That is the second worst performance since 1860. But some people went over the top in their pessimism. They believed that recovery would never come, or at least not in the foreseeable future. Some economists also believed that growth prospects were much worse over the long term, so that there wasn’t even much to look forward to after the period of recovery. And, of course, to the extent that people believed that, they would restrain their spending. So it could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Related Articles

We can’t wave goodbye to the euro crisis just yet

Yet in the modern economy, economic growth has been the norm. Accordingly, it is always dangerous to be very gloomy because the economy has a natural way of bouncing back - unless its natural buoyancy has been permanently flattened by the experience of the last few years, which I don’t believe. So what has been holding the economy back? Apart from the squeeze on real incomes, the answer, of course, is the overhang from the previous period of excessive credit growth and the associated weakness of the banks, allied to fiscal tightening. It is normal for recessions that are caused by the collapse of asset price and credit booms to be especially serious, with recoveries weak and protracted. Even so, given that growth is the norm, the mere passage of time tends to make a big difference. While the economy is depressed, technological progress still continues and business opportunities build up. In normal conditions these would lead to increased spending. But if spending is put off then there is scope for it to pick up later. Time is also the key ingredient to allow adjustments to take place. Here in the UK, for instance, consumers have made some progress in lowering their debt burdens in relation to income. Not that they have reduced the absolute amount of debt, but incomes have crept up. At the peak the ratio of debt to income was 170%. It is now down to 145%. Banks have also made some adjustments, although much less here than in the United States. Meanwhile, by and large, big companies have been in pretty good order. This has meant that they have been in a good position to respond when conditions improve, which they now are. This contrasts with some periods in our history when the corporate sector was in a really bad way. Economic policy has made a contribution to recovery as well. Although fiscal policy has been tightening, the continuing very low interest rates and bond yields have helped, not least by underpinning the price of assets, including commercial property. And the Government has done all it could to boost the housing market. Recently, its efforts have borne fruit. House prices have been rising. It has been common in the past for recoveries in the housing market to be associated with rises in consumer confidence, which have then helped to sustain increased consumer spending. This has probably been at work this time as well. Certainly increased consumer spending has been one of the leading forces behind the recovery. So this is in danger of looking like a traditional consumer- and housing-led recovery which then ends up badly. But the good news isn’t only about consumers. Corporate spending seems to be rising and construction is picking up. Although the recent figures for UK exports were pretty weak, the more timely and forward looking data on export orders have been strong. Yet, despite the recent good news, there are several reasons to be cautious about the likely pace of recovery in the next couple of years. Consumers have increased their spending over the last two years despite the fact that their real wages have been falling. True, some of the reason for this is that employment has been rising so that overall consumer incomes have managed to creep up a bit. (And the labour market data were strong again last week.) Nevertheless, the saving ratio has fallen to about 4%. Admittedly, by early next year, as price inflation falls back, real incomes should be rising again. But with saving that low and consumer balance sheets still stretched, it is unlikely that consumers will be willing or able to increase spending by a substantial amount. Moreover, the flipside of the resilience of employment during the recent period of economic weakness is that there is not much scope for employment to rise when the economy recovers – unless productivity growth remains very weak for an extended period, which would not be good news anyway, not least for the prospects for the growth of real wages. Furthermore, at some point, policy is going to be tightened. Admittedly, interest rates probably won’t rise for some time but the markets are already factoring in the time when they do. And the Governor of the Bank of England has made it clear that if the housing recovery gets out of hand the Bank will respond by raising the capital requirements on mortgage lenders. The international environment is mixed. In most of the emerging markets, growth looks likely to be slower. But recovery is solid in the US and Europe is showing some signs of life. In much of the euro-zone, though, growth remains feeble, and the structural and existential issues have not gone away. Economists need to be prepared to be surprised. We may all be amazed by how strong the recovery proves to be. I am prepared for it. But recognising that this economy still looks unbalanced, and bearing in mind the continuing weakness of banks, consumers and the public finances, it is far too soon to be putting out the bunting.

Dragons' Den teenagers sell 79pc stake in RKA Records
Dragon Duncan Bannatyne backs passion of two Leicester-based 18 year olds and takes a majority stake in their fledgling record label RKA Record's Ryan Ashmore, left, and Liam Webb with Duncan Bannatyne (centre) By Richard Tyler

One of the founders of Dragons’ Den’s RKA Records has said the knowledge they were being offered a life-changing deal meant they willingly accepted Duncan Bannatyne’s demand for a “very, very high stake” in their fledgling venture. Leicester-based Ryan Ashmore and his business partner Liam Webb, both 18, sold 79pc of their business in return for £50,000 in cash and access to the leisure industry entrepreneur’s little black contacts book. Mr Ashmore said the terms of the deal – thought to be the highest amount of equity ever demanded by an investor on the long running BBC TWO show – had initially come as a shock. But as RKA announces its first signing since appearing in the ‘Den’ – Britain’s Got Talent boy band ‘Connected’, who have reformed as ‘Reconnected’ – the pair believe they made the right decision. Ashmore and Webb went into the Den offering only 15pc for £50,000 and prepared to sell 40 to 50pc “at the most.”

“The other four [Dragons] went out pretty quick. At that point we thought never mind, we have tried our best,” said Leicester-based Mr Ashmore. “So it was a bit surprising when he [Bannatyne] said 79pc. We couldn’t try to negotiate because the other four Dragons went out. We said to each other, ‘We have to do this’, although it was for a very, very high stake in the company. I just thought it was so surreal.”
Mr Ashmore, who ran a successful mobile disco from the age of 12, said he thought the pair had won Mr Bannatyne over because of their attitude and potential. “We are so young we think he thought they have to be given a chance. He has seen how driven we are and how determined we are too work,” he said. Mr Ashmore studied music at A-level before leaving his studies after the first year and launching RKA Records said Mr Bannatyne had “opened doors” for RKA at major record labels like EMI, Atlantic and Sony. “With Duncan on board we can walk straight through,” he said. He said having a Dragon as an investor had also helped the PR side of RKA’s sales pitch to potential bands. “It’s played a part. [Connected] are young guys themselves and they have seen what Duncan has seen. We are willing to work 24 hours a day if necessary.”
Mr Ashmore said the £50,000 had been set aside to fund a targeted marketing campaign for Reconnected. “Fifty thousand pounds is not of money if you are going to be stupid with it but we plan to be smart with the money,” he said. He added: “It’s definitely going to be hard. It’s going to get harder before it gets easier. But we are will to give it a go.”
Mr Bannatyne said: “I saw something in Ryan and Liam that caught my imagination. For the past year they have been serving an entrepreneurs’ apprenticeship learning about how to run a business and break into a tough industry. Now, with my investment and hands-on involvement, we can really take the business forward and achieve Ryan and Liam’s ambitions.”

This is the first year Britain's monarch has featured in the table, which was topped last year by fellow royal Zara Phillips.The Queen beat fashionistas Madonna and Victoria Beckham, who appeared in fourth and fifth places respectively.The Countess of Wessex took third place in the chart, which is produced by promotional consortium Luton First with the town's famous millinery and hat-making industry.Topping the table for the men is Australian heart-throb Hugh Jackman, who beat Sir Sean Connery, Daniel Day Lewis, Jonny Depp, and Peter Andre to the title.

31 May 2009
Philip Wright, of Luton milliners Walter Wright, said celebrities were continuing to set international trends, wearing "statement" hats.He said: "Carla Bruni's neat, chic, pill box hat was a supreme example of classic simplicity at its best - a stylish understatement which captured the attention of the world's media."Hugh Jackman's outback hat, worn in the film Australia, not only achieved instant fame on the big screen but also popularised the look for men's casual wear generally."Mr Jackman has also been seen sporting some stylish trilby and pork pie hats off screen."The Queen, with her second-place title, was noticed for her fur-look style hat worn to the unveiling of the memorial statue of the Queen Mother in February."It was in marked contrast to her usual, more formal, choice in hats and a welcome break with tradition," Mr Wright added."Victoria Beckham clearly remains a hat fan with her third appearance in the annual lists."She demonstrates a tendency towards the more masculine peaked caps, trilby and fedora styles, while the Countess of Wessex opts for more feminine styles, including a particularly eye catching one with feather trim."Madonna's 'winged' hat, co-ordinating with her turquoise dress, raised a few eye brows when she wore it this year but it was adventurous and fun and deserves recognition."Headwear currently enjoys an increasing popularity in all walks of life thanks to celebrities sometimes throwing caution to the wind and taking fashion risks."In this year's men's list, Sir Sean won second position with a number of stylish hats, including a classic Panama hat.He was followed by Day Lewis in third place, 2007-winner Depp in fourth, and Andre in fifth.The pop star, who hit the headlines in May following his split from Katie Price, has regularly been spotted in a variety of different styles, including an array of casual caps.David Beckham, who has appeared somewhere in the table in the past five years, did not find a place in this year's chart.Patricia Murchie, from Luton First, said: "Luton is justifiably proud of its 400-year-old hat-making history and the town's manufacturers and designers continue to be a significant influence on style trends both here and abroad and on the hats worn by international celebrities."
