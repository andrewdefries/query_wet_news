Speak after the tone
Talking to a machine is rarely a fulfilling experience.
The personal touch: smiling operators in 1936 Photo: GETTY	By Telegraph View
8:53PM BST 23 Aug 2011
Comments
When Brian Evans rang his hospital in Devon for an appointment, he found himself talking to a machine. It is a sadly normal experience. The machine asked which department he wanted. On requesting the eye clinic, he was put through to a strange woman called Sheila in a department of quite a different kind. Mr Evans blames his rich Devonian accent, but he need not, for it is the common lot of phone-plagued mankind. Try to buy a cinema ticket, and the machine asks: “Which cinema would you like to book?” “Wimbledon.” “You would like to book a ticket in [pause] Chelsea.” Once it is convinced that you want two tickets, not nine, in Row H, not Row A, and you have logged your card number, on the third attempt, one fence remains to be jumped: your name. There you fail, to be cheerily transferred to a permanent queue for the unheard-of real person.

Households cut food waste in age of austerity
Households have managed to cut food waste by a more than a quarter of a million tonnes over the last years thanks to a 'common sense' campaign that asked people to use up leftovers. By Louise Gray, Environment Correspondent
7:00AM BST 23 Sep 2010

The Love Food Hate Waste campaign asked people to make shopping lists so that they do not buy too much food, eat certain foods a few days after the best before date and be inventive with left overs. At the same time people are more aware of the amount of food they are throwing away because of the use of slop buckets, as an increasing amount of councils collect food waste separately. WRAP, the Government agency in charge of cutting waste, said the campaign has led to a reduction in food waste going to landfill of 270,000 tonnes. Collectively, this avoided waste could have filled 128,000 standard refuse trucks, which bumper to bumper would stretch from Truro to Inverness. Liz Goodwin, the chief executive of WRAP, said that people are treating food with more care in the age of austerity. Related Articles

“The evidence shows that more people are now aware that food waste is an issue, and are choosing to do something about it, " she said. "More people are checking their cupboards before they shop, making lists and date labels are better understood. All of this helps UK shoppers make the most of the food they buy, waste less and save money.” Sorella le Var, of the Women's Institute, that helped to run the campaign, said people are going back to the ‘common sense’ approach of their mothers. She also said people are saving money by learning how to make food last longer. “Before it was all buy, buy, buy,” she said. “It became unfashionable to save money and use things up. But buying less and using up left overs is common sense, it is nothing to be ashamed of.” However Gary Porter, Chairman of the LGA Environment Board, said there is still too much food going to waste. “A shocking eight million tonnes of food waste is still being thrown away each year – that is the equivalent of well over two thousand dumper trucks full every single day,” he said. "The environmental and financial cost of this waste is clear but when hundreds of millions of people in the world go hungry, as a nation we should be ashamed."
The WRAP figures also showed a four per cent reduction in the amount of packaging waste per item of food as supermarkets cut paper and plastic. However supermarkets have failed to reduce the overall amount of packaging from food waste every year because of an increase in grocery sales. WRAP director of retail Richard Swannell said supermarkets need to follow consumers in reducing waste. “ Retailers have reduced packaging by 4 per cent, But taking into account a 6.4 per cent increase in sales, it's not been enough to meet our targets to reduce overall packaging waste. "People are buying more things. It's a constant challenge to keep working on packaging." Earth News

Record rise in pupils using 'sob stories' for extra marks
Campaigners called for an investigation into the practice of awarding extra marks for GCSE and A-level "excuses" after approvals soared to a new high this year
Figures from Ofqual show that the number of pupils given 'special consideration' in exams jumped by 10 per cent this year. Photo: Alamy	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor

Comments
Record numbers of schoolchildren are using excuses such as a headache, hay fever or noise in the exam hall to gain extra marks in GCSEs and A-levels, it emerged today. Figures published by Ofqual, the exams regulator, show a 10 per cent rise in the number of pupils given “special consideration” this summer after making pleas to examiners for exceptional circumstances to be taken into account. In all, 374,700 requests requests for extra marks were approved. Under current rules, students can claim up to five per cent extra marks in GCSEs and A-levels because of an illness, injury or incident that impacted on their ability to concentrate in the exam hall. The extent to which papers are marked up depends on the severity of the incident, with pupils gaining one per cent for a headache or “minor upset”, two per cent for hay fever and concussion and five per cent for the recent death of a close family member.

But today’s figures prompted claims that the system was seen as a “racket” by some pupils and parents to enable them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers. The overall number of children given extra marks has now soared by a fifth in just five years, despite a drop in the total number of exams being sat. Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: “Of course there are going to be genuine reasons why some people need help, but the sort of increase we’ve seen in the last few years suggests to me that the system is being abused. It is a bit of a racket. “I think we have to have a thorough investigation into this because exams need to be fair to all children and you can’t have a situation where a few benefit while others don’t.”
According to figures, 415,200 requests for special consideration were made in GCSEs and A-levels this summer – up by 13 per cent in 12 months. Of those, 90 per cent were approved compared with 93 per cent in 2012. It meant that a total of 374,700 papers were approved to have marks adjusted, representing almost three per cent of the total number of exams taken. Under existing guidelines, students have a week after their last test in a particular subject to apply for exceptional circumstances to be taken into account. Pupils are only eligible for special consideration if they were fully prepared for an exam and covered the whole course. They can gain between one and five per cent extra marks depending on the seriousness of the incident or illness. Guidance from examiners says pupils can gain: • One per cent for continuous noise during the exam, illness suffered by another candidate that caused disruption, minor ailments, headaches or a “minor upset arising from administrative problems” in the exam hall; • Two per cent for a broken limb on the mend, concussion, hay fever on the day of the exam and extreme stress; • Three per cent for recent death of a close friend or distant relative, recently broken limbs, flare-up of congenital conditions such as epilepsy, physical trauma before an exam, domestic crisis and witnessing a “distressing event” on the day of the exam; • Four per cent for life-threatening illness, major surgery near the exam, car accident and recent death of an extended family member; • Five per cent for terminal illness of the pupil or their parent; recent death in the immediate family and a serious domestic crisis. Separate figures were published relating to “access arrangements” that are put in place in the exam hall to aid pupils with disabilities or writing impairments. This includes up to 25 per cent additional time, early opening of question papers and the use of a scribe. In all, 209,916 requests were approved, but this was down sharply on the 236,895 given help a year earlier. The drop followed a crackdown on the practice by exam boards, with schools now required to provide more evidence that help special arrangements are needed. Education News

Shell to cut 2,000 jobs in 'urgent' action plan
By Malcolm Moore
12:01AM BST 02 Aug 2002
Comments
Royal Dutch/Shell said yesterday that its results were "frankly not as good as we expected" as it unveiled a 40pc plunge in interim pre-tax income to $8.01 billion (£5.13 billion). "We have taken significant action to fix underperformance," said chairman Philip Watts. "But we need to do so more urgently." Shell shares fell 30.5p to 405.5p. The oil giant plans to cut 2,000 jobs globally, including more than 250 in London, to try to save roughly $550m this year. The redundancies from the UK will come as a result of Shell's acquisition of Enterprise Oil. "The Enterprise head office in London has already been closed, less than two months after the deal," the company said.

02 Aug 2002
The world's third-largest oil company also posted a slight fall in pre-tax income from the first quarter, dropping from $4.01 billion to $3.99 billion. Shell blamed the weak performance on poor oil and gas prices, a 49pc reduction in refining margins and the closure of several refineries. Unlike BP, which was able to post a healthy 5.5pc growth in its volumes earlier this week, Shell revealed that it had only managed 1pc organic growth, leading to analyst speculation that the future growth of the company would be more reliant on acquisitions. After Nigeria announced that it was minded to stay within the oil cartel, Opec, Shell backed calls for production in the country to be stepped up, but insisted that its heavy investment in two oilfields there would not be mothballed. Nigeria has curbed its output to as little as 1.85m barrels a day, well below its capacity of 2.2m-2.3m barrels. "We have two world-class oilfields in Nigeria," said Mr Watts, "and it is very important, and I know that Nigeria takes the same view in terms of continued investment, that these projects deliver. "I do not think it is necessary to be going into contingency plans. They will get their fair share of the Opec quota for Nigeria." Mr Watts also hit out at Gordon Brown's North Sea oil tax, which the company will include in its third-quarter results under American accounting rules. "We have, in the North Sea, a case of arresting decline and this is not a good time to put in investment," he said. The North Sea tax will cost Shell a one-off charge of $320m in the next quarter and about $40m a quarter going forward. Despite posting results below analysts' expectations, the interim dividend of Shell Transport and Trading was raised 0.1p, or 1.7pc, to 5.95p a share. The dividend will be paid on September 18. The company also made clear that it was "surprised and disappointed" by its removal from the Standard & Poor's 500 index, and said the move had resulted in a fall in its share price. Separately, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, Exxon Mobil, reported a 41pc drop in its second-quarter net income from $4.46 billion to $2.64 billion. Exxon Mobil chairman Lee Raymond blamed "significantly weaker refining margins", which were down 70pc, for the fall. Finance

A dying star is throwing a cosmic tantrum in this combined image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. In death, the star's dusty outer layers are unravelling into space, glowing from the intense ultraviolet radiation being pumped out by the hot stellar core. This object called the Helix nebula, lies 650 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.Picture: NASA/AP

Did Tony Blair know of John Prescott's bulimia?
John Prescott hid his illness even from his wife By Richard Alleyne
12:01AM BST 21 Apr 2008
Tony Blair is facing questions over whether he was aware of John Prescott's battle with bulimia when he left the former deputy prime minister in charge of the country.
Bulimia: Q&A
'Bingeing is a drug and it is very addictive'
After Mr Prescott's admission that he has been secretly battling with the eating disorder throughout his political career, it emerged that he had confided in Alastair Campbell about the problem years before Labour was elected.
Mr Prescott, then opposition spokesman for employment, told Mr Campbell in 1993 during a dinner with Mr Campbell's editor at the Daily Mirror, David Banks.
Mr Banks decided to suppress the story and Mr Campbell, who became the Labour government's chief spin doctor, claimed never to have spoken about it again with Mr Blair or anyone else.
But critics demanded to know whether senior government colleagues were informed given that Mr Prescott was in charge of the country when Mr Blair was abroad.
Mark Wallace, the campaign director for the TaxPayers' Alliance, said he should have disclosed his condition, especially as he had claimed £4,000 in food expenses a year.

Bulimia: Q&A
21 Apr 2008
Bingeing is a drug and it is very addictive
21 Apr 2008
A spokesman for Tony Blair said last night that the former prime minister would not comment because it was a private matter.
Mr Campbell said: "It was not something that came up when I was working with Tony. It vaguely rings a bell but to be honest I forgot all about it until recently."
Mr Prescott said he kept the condition secret for years before even close friends and family found out.
He said eating became his "main pleasure" and that at times of stress he would seek comfort in gorging on vast quantities of food and then vomiting to purge his body.
Mr Prescott, 69, said up until a year ago he would "stuff his face" with digestive biscuits, trifles and fish and chips - and wash it down with condensed milk. When the pressure really got to him, he would drink bottles of vodka. On trips to his local Chinese restaurant, the China Palace in his Hull constituency, he said he could eat his way through the entire menu.
Despite a series of revelations about his private life while he was in the Cabinet, he managed to keep the illness secret from all but his closest friends and family and the doctors from whom he sought help.
But, as he admits, he is not an obvious candidate for the disease.
"People normally associate it with anorexic girls, models trying to keep their weight down," he writes in his autobiography, Prezza, Pulling No Punches. "With my weight, people wouldn't suspect it. I wasn't a very successful bulimic, in that my weight didn't really drop."

Weapons stolen from Australian navy patrol boat A balaclava-wearing intruder has stolen a cache of weapons from an Australian navy patrol boat. Photo: AFP	10:43AM GMT 30 Nov 2012
The Australian Department of Defence said the infiltrator "overwhelmed a duty member on-board a patrol boat" which was moored at HMAS Coonawarra, a naval base in the northern city of Darwin in a night raid.
"The intruder overpowered the duty member, accessed the vessel's armoury and removed a number of weapons," it said in a statement.
"The person then departed the vessel with the weapons."
Police said two pump-action shotguns and 12 pistols were stolen by the intruder, who was wearing a balaclava and military-style clothing and who they said "appeared to have good knowledge of the vessel".
Police Commander Richard Bryson said the raider overpowered and restrained the leading seaman who was on watch on the HMAS Bathurst patrol boat, but it was not known whether he accessed the boat from land or by sea.

The seaman, who suffered only minor injuries, was able to eventually remove the cable ties he was bound with and raise the alarm.
Commander Bryson said while 14 weapons had been stolen, the magazines that matched the guns were not taken.
"Unless there's been some further assistance or intervention we're confident that the weapons are not capable of being utilised at this point in time," he told a press conference in Darwin.
Navy chief Vice Admiral Ray Griggs ordered an investigation into security on all naval ships and bases in the wake of the incident, which was also being probed by the Australian Federal Police.
"It's certainly a breach of security and it's a very concerning one for me," Griggs told Fairfax radio, adding that it was the first breach of its type on an Australian navy vessel.
He said the assaulted crew member had his life threatened but was recovering well.
HMAS Coonawarra, where the Royal Australian Navy bases most of its 14 Armidale Class patrol boats, was placed in lockdown Friday, with police searching all vehicles leaving the base.
Darwin is a vital navy port and the centre from which Australia conducts border control operations, with about 600 naval personnel in the area, many working at sea in border protection.
The HMAS Bathurst is one of 14 patrol boats that provide the navy's principal contribution to the nation's fisheries protection, immigration, customs and drug law enforcement operations.
In the event of war the highly capable and versatile warships would be tasked with controlling waters close to the Australian mainland.
Tropical Darwin is a key defence hub for Australia, with rotating US Marines based in barracks outside the city since April this year as Washington looks to deepen its presence in Asia.

Vatican City and Holy See
Vatican admits secretly bugging its own clergy The Vatican admitted on Thursday that it had secretly bugged clergy within the Holy See as part of the investigation into the Vatileaks scandal, which resulted in the Pope's butler being imprisoned for stealing confidential pontifical documents. Paolo Gabriele's scandal rocked the Catholic Church and reportedly contributed to Benedict's decision to resign Photo: AFP	By Nick Squires, Rome
5:31PM GMT 28 Feb 2013
Like much of the rest of his papacy, Benedict's last day in office was overshadowed by claims of secrecy and intrigue. An Italian news magazine, Panorama, claimed that Vatican authorities had conducted, and are still conducting, an extensive covert surveillance programme, tapping the phone calls and intercepting the emails of cardinals and bishops in the Curia, the governing body of the Catholic Church. The surveillance operation was to weed out Vatican insiders who may have helped Paolo Gabriele, the butler, steal and leak to the press compromising papal documents, in a scandal that rocked the Catholic Church and reportedly contributed to Benedict's decision to resign. The Vatican confirmed that secret surveillance had indeed taken place, but on a far smaller scale than that portrayed by Panorama. In response to a question by The Daily Telegraph at a press briefing, Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said surveillance had taken place but "not of the dimensions described".

"In the context of Vatileaks, some intercepts and checks were authorised by the Vatican magistracy," he said. It was investigators from the Vatican magistracy who led the prosecution against Mr Gabriele in a lightning-fast trial which resulted in his conviction for aggravated theft. He was sentenced to 18 months behind bars but spent only a few weeks in a Vatican "secure room" before receiving a pardon from Benedict just before Christmas. Father Lombardi said the secret surveillance operation involved the wiretapping of "two or three" telephone lines, but did not specify who they belonged to. The Vatileaks scandal exploded last year when it emerged that the Pope's personal valet had been stealing documents from the papal apartments and leaking them to journalists in what he said was an attempt to expose "evil and corruption" within the Church. Benedict personally appointed three elderly cardinals, including a prominent member of Opus Dei, to investigate the leaks, amid suspicions that the butler had not acted alone. Many of the documents damaged the standing of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who as Secretary of State is equivalent to the Vatican's prime minister and is second in authority only to the Pope. Federico Lombardi said surveillance had taken place but 'not of the dimensions described' (Getty)
Panorama claimed it was he who authorised the secret bugging operation but that was denied by Father Lombardi. The surveillance operation was carried out by the Vatican Gendarmerie, the papal police force, which is headed by Domenico Giani, a former officer in the Italian intelligence services. "For more than a year, emails, telephone conversations, meetings and discussions were meticulously placed under observation by the Gendarmerie," said Panorama's Vatican expert, Ignazio Ingrao, in what amounted to "a sort of Vatican Big Brother" operation. "Everyone was spied on in the Vatican. In the shadow of the cupola of St Peter's Basilica, the biggest and most detailed wiretapping operation ever conducted in the sacred palaces was conducted," the magazine said. "Even the email accounts of bishops and cardinals were sifted through and their phone lines placed under scrutiny." The three cardinals delivered the results of their investigation to the Pope in December, but the hunt for moles within the Holy See was still going on, Panorama claimed. Father Lombardi has previously said that the investigation is still formally open. Vatican City and Holy See

Host a music festival in your home
Caroline McGhie uncovers homes where owners, in harmony with their grounds, create noteworthy summer events

Comments
On a hot summer Sunday afternoon, Jonathan and June Harrison’s garden fills with villagers in straw boaters. Picnic rugs are spread out, hampers are opened, wine glasses tinkle and June starts dispensing hot dogs in the barn. Then the members of the Chicago Jazz Band tune up their instruments and away they go, foot-tapping to big-hitting show songs, crooning through old pre-war favourites. The house lends itself to musical jollity. It is a pretty three-bedroom period farmhouse called Arnold Yoke in the village of Leeds in Kent, known for its picturesque moated castle. It has a one-bedroom cottage too, but the party backdrop is provided by the beautiful gardens, paddock and barn. “We can always go into the barn if it rains but it isn’t always used as people come and put up their own gazebos, and when the rain comes down the umbrellas go up. This summer we had a beautiful sunny day,” says June. “We have lived in the area since we got married three decades ago and over time we have raised money for local hospices and village causes with our musical events. We started with safari suppers so lots of people got to know each other,” says June. “I do hot dogs, home-made cakes and cups of tea. One year a local dramatic group came and did a version of ’Allo ’Allo. We have raised £40,000 over the years.” And the summer jazz concert has become a village tradition. The house, priced at £1.15m by Knight Frank (01732 744477) has just gone under offer but to June’s joy the buyers look likely to continue the musical tradition. “They are known to do things for their parish, the wife is very musical and the husband is a passionate gardener,” she says. “A property can be charming in itself but the owner’s interest adds to the atmosphere,” says George Berry, the selling agent, who confesses that he played the part of Lieutenant Gruber in the local production of ’Allo ’Allo. “A property takes on the personality of its owners and attracts like-minded buyers.”

This is music festival season. Away from the hurly-burly of big public events, others take place privately, organised by home owners who have the right kind of showcase houses. Sometimes the combination of talent and setting is just too good to resist. Ellie Philp’s 18-year-old daughter Darcie has played the harp since she was nine. Each year Darcie is one of 10 harpists who gather in the hall of Netherton House, near Newton Abbot, as the Exeter Harp Orchestra prepare for the Devon Performing Arts Festival in Exeter. “People always say they make the sound of angels,” says Ellie. The classic wisteria-clad house is full of quiet grandeur, with six bedrooms, servants’ quarters converted into two flats, a swimming pool, and a charming timber chalet in the gardens which run down to the River Teign. A little jetty is rented from the Crown Estate and along the bank you can walk all the way to Coombe-in-Teignhead. “It is lucky we have a lot of space. There is room for the harps in the hall which is extremely large,” Ellie adds. She is now selling at £1.75m through Fulfords (01392 660007) and Savills (01392 455745) because it is just too large for the two of them and Darcie is about to leave home for university. They even have a “harp car”, a Mondeo estate (without wheel arches or boot lip so that it can swallow the harp easily), to transport the instrument to the concerts, balls and weddings at which Darcie plays. Setting is everything. At Pump Bottom Farm in Appledram near Chichester, Julian and Kathleen Moores are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their Blues On The Farm annual June weekend, voted Best British Blues Festival 2010. “It started with a private party. We had a little marquee and friends, including Gary Brooker from the band Procul Harum, and he said this is a fantastic setting for music. People would pay to come. We thought why not?” says Kathleen. It was the early Nineties. The couple were apple growers wanting to diversify so they began to produce cider and apple juice and got into the music scene at the same time. “It just clicked. We could sell our cider to the festival goers,” she says. At first they had to persuade the musicians to come and play. Now the likes of Georgie Fame, Long John Baldry, Bill Wyman and Jools Holland, as well as Brooker, are keen to perform. This year they hosted 8,000 people over the festival weekend, including many campers. Local suppliers of curries, hog roasts, fish and chips and burgers come to sell their wares. Pump Bottom Farm also hosts corporate events and weddings for those who want less formality and more of a good party. The Moores want to retire so they are selling the festival as a business, with 38 acres, their Cider House restaurant, farm building and four newly built oak frame holiday cottages for £3m through Chesterton Humberts (01243 531010). “If we had to sell the house as well we would – it would be selfish not to – but we hope to spend a year or two in it first,” says Kathleen. Opera or operetta
Access to tickets to dress rehearsals of Garsington Opera’s 2012 season come with this brick-and-flint cottage with four bedrooms, three bathrooms and walks in the grounds including the lake and deer park on the Wormsley Estate in Buckinghamshire. Garsington moved its shows to the estate, home of the Gettys, this year. A beautiful kabuki inspired opera pavilion is to be built every summer to house the singers, the orchestra, the stage and the terraces. The cottage is available on a long let at £3,495 per month through John D Wood (01865 311522). Riverbank House at Ferry Lane, Shepperton in Surrey, was rented by Arthur Sullivan while he and his librettist W S Gilbert were preparing their shows for D’Oyly Carte who built the Savoy Theatre to show their work. It witnessed many parties and informal rehearsals and Sullivan would retire here after having temper tantrums with Richard D’Oyly Carte whose house was on a neighbouring private island. Shepperton Studios’ proximity has attracted many showbiz personalities – Frank Finlay, Edward Woodward, Bernard Braden and Barbara Kelly have all lived here. John D Wood (01932 842323) is selling at £1.1m. Property

Roy Hodgson will give West Bromwich Albion inside information to help stop Liverpool threat
I am sure Roy Hodgson would take a great deal of satisfaction out of beating Liverpool, the club who sacked him in January after only six months in charge. Arsenal sandwich: Abdoulaye Méïté (left) and Steven Reid (right) block Arsenal's Robin van Persie Photo: EPA	By Alan Smith

For West Bromwich Albion's new manager, however, that is not the main issue on Saturday. It is more about gaining points in the fight against relegation by building on the good start he has enjoyed at the Hawthorns. Unbeaten in his first four games, a run that has included a 3-1 win at Birmingham and leading Arsenal 2-0 before getting pegged back, Hodgson has had an immediate effect on the team, especially in defence, where they have tightened up no end. So what has he done to turn the tide? And how will he cope with Liverpool's threat? On the first point, Hodgson immediately made a couple of changes in the back four. Fortunately, Steven Reid had just returned from injury, so the experienced Republic of Ireland international replaced Gonzalo Jara at right-back. The other decision was a little more risky, seeing as Abdoulaye Méïté had not kicked a Premier League ball all season. But Hodgson knew he had to change things, so gave Méïté a chance next to Jonas Olsson. Related Articles

The result has been a more solid rearguard that, crucially, is getting protected much better by the players in front. Thanks to continual drills on the training ground, the attack, midfield and defence are more in touch with each other in terms of how they gel. As part of this, Hodgson changed the way the team close down the opposition. Under his predecessor, Roberto Di Matteo, the rule was to show the player in possession outside i.e towards the touchline; to position your body so as to direct him that way. Yet Hodgson has always preferred the other way, much like my old manager, George Graham, did at Arsenal. So when the likes of Dirk Kuyt and Raul Meireles receive the ball this afternoon, they can expect Chris Brunt and Jerome Thomas to steer them inside towards Paul Scharner and Youssuf Mulumbu, the holding midfielders. In fairness, Kuyt and Meireles would probably head that way anyhow, seeing as neither is an orthodox winger who likes to raid down the flank and swing in crosses. While that restricts the service to Andy Carroll, it also means that Liverpool will see plenty of the ball in the middle of the park. For Hodgson, it was a similar story against Arsenal. He accepted that Arsène Wenger’s side would boss possession, so concentrated on defending a little closer to goal. And having watched the DVD on Thursday with his players, Hodgson felt that the team kept their shape fairly well. They will have to do that again here, the only difference being that, with Carroll to think about, they cannot afford to sink too deep towards Scott Carson’s goal. It is important for Carson to keep his box clear, otherwise Carroll’s height and power could cause chaos. In addition, Méïté and Olsson must decide how to handle the big man when it comes to jumping with him in the air. For me, they’ve got to be cute by not always trying to win the header. One tactic, as the ball is played up, is to let Carroll know you are there by getting touch-tight, before dropping off at the last second to let him flick the ball on unchallenged. By doing that, you’re leaving less room for Luis Suárez to get in behind. You cannot try it every time because Carroll will wise up, but by playing cat and mouse you keep the striker thinking. Rocastle Remembered
If it weren’t for commentating commitments at West Ham on Saturday, I would have gone to the Emirates, where Arsenal are marking the 10th anniversary of David Rocastle’s death. Quite understandably, you always hear people speak well of the dead, talk about their lives in glowing terms. Sometimes it is accurate, other times not. With Rocky, however, we really are talking about a gem, a very special person you could not help but love. Not only that, he was an amazing footballer at his peak, blessed with bullish strength to back up those silky skills. It has been nearly 19 years since Rocky left Arsenal, yet the crowd still sing his name with genuine love. That is how much he meant. As a close friend, I still miss him now. West Bromwich Albion
