Clench for the memory
A new behavioural theory might explain the ability of taxi drivers to retain their knowledge of street patterns
Taxi drivers should have little trouble memorising information, since they clench and unclench their hands constantly in the infuriating traffic Photo: Alamy	By Telegraph View

If you want to memorise something, scientists have suddenly discovered, clench your right fist. Then, to recall it, clench your left. This could make you look a bit aggressive at a drinks party, when trying to remember the names of fellow guests, but it may be worth it. The new theory might explain the ability of taxi drivers to retain their knowledge of street patterns, since they must clench and unclench their hands at the wheel constantly in the infuriating traffic. Boxers, too, should be masterminds, unless the loss of brain cells counteracts the mnemonic effect of all that clenching. In former ages, parents did the clenching and the children felt the benefit, as in the celebrated story of the young Benvenuto Cellini, thwacked by his father to make him remember the marvellous sight of a salamander in the fire. But perhaps it was the salamander that made the clip on the ear memorable. Related Articles

Compulsory cycling lessons in schools 'would make for fitter, happier, safer children'
Cycling should be placed on the National Curriculum to combat the obesity crisis and improve levels of road safety, according to a powerful coalition of transport and health experts. By Gregg Morgan
6:00AM BST 24 Apr 2013
Follow Comments
Pupils from the age of five upwards should be given lessons in riding a bike and negotiating traffic amid fears too many children are failing to take up the “essential life skill” on a daily basis, it is claimed. In a letter to The Daily Telegraph, organisations including the AA, the Road Haulage Association, British Cycling and the UK Health Forum claim that cycling should have the same status in the physical education curriculum as swimming. The call is made a week after the Government closed a major consultation into a proposed overhaul of the lessons for five to 14-year-olds in England. Speaking outside Look Mum No Hands cycle café in central London, David Dansky, one of the letter's signatories, told the Telegraph that the compulsory training would not only give children the necessary skills to ride to school but would give parents more confidence to allow them in the first place. "Kids should cycle, not sit in the back of a people carrier," said the Association of Bikeability Schemes director. Related Articles

Boris Johnson: taxing mansions while Google pays nothing is 'absurd'
Boris Johnson branded Vince Cable's plans for a mansion tax 'absurd' when companies like Google are paying nothing. By Rowena Mason
3:07PM GMT 19 Nov 2012
Follow Comments
The Mayor of London said the Coalition should collect more money from companies like Google instead of considering “absurd” plans for a mansion tax on individuals. Vince Cable claimed plans for higher council tax bands for homes worth more than £1 million would be included in the autumn statement on December 5. But in a speech to the CBI Mr Johnson said many Londoners living in seemingly expensive homes actually had little disposable income. "We should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash poor people who happen to inhabit expensive houses in London when firms like Google are paying zero," he said. "Neither arrangement strikes me as being fair and so Google and co face a very clear choice - they can either change their tax arrangements or do much more to serve our society by visibly taking on 18 to 24-year-olds who are out of work."

The Mayor also urged the Coalition to call an end to the age of austerity. This is likely to be seen as a challenge to George Osborne, the Chancellor, who is focused on bringing down Britain's deficit. "I think the [age of austerity] should end, because if this country is to grow, we need to move to a new age of enterprise," the Mayor told the conference. He had planned to call on ministers to stop forcing businesses to "drink their own urine" but omitted this line from the speech he delivered to the CBI.
"We need to abandon the rhetoric of austerity because if you endlessly tell business to tighten their belts and eat nut cutlets and drink their own urine then you will be putting a big downer on growth and enterprise," his pre-released comments said.
His speech comes after David Cameron promised to sweep away rules, reviews and checks that are holding business back. Mr Johnson urged the Government to go further in its efforts to support an "Age of Enterprise" by cutting personal tax rates and exempting new homes from stamp duty. He said the current high rate of personal taxes means Andy Murray pays one of the highest rates of to the taxpayer on his earnings. "I am afraid that high rates of personal taxation are likely to make us less competitive," he will say. "In the 19th century London became the biggest and richest city on earth because of its openness to trade and to talent."
"I am worried that we are losing some of that openness at a critical time."
The Coalition is still considering Liberal Democrat proposals for higher taxes on the wealthy. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, insisted it is being taken seriously at the highest levels of the Government. "I know these areas are under discussion and the devil will be in the detail but it is right that we do tax wealth and property is the obvious place to go," Dr Cable said. "One reason that it is fairer is that it cannot run off to Monaco and Liechtenstein. When trying to deal with abuse of the tax system, it is the best way of doing it." Politics

Socialite accused of lying in court to win record settlement
When a judge ordered her former fiancé to pay her a record £27,000 a month in child support, Annabelle Bond no doubt celebrated in style.

7:12PM BST 25 Apr 2013
Follow The socialite daughter of former HSBC chairman Sir John Bond could not have predicted that she would subsequently become caught up in a bitter legal battle, accused of lying to the court about her financial means in order to “achieve a higher windfall”. Warren Lichtenstein, a US hedge fund manager and the father of her five-year-old daughter, has demanded substantial damages after claiming that Miss Bond conspired with her new boyfriend in order to win the largest child support settlement awarded in Hong Kong’s legal history. He has accused the 44-year-old of issuing the court with “misleading and inaccurate statements” in an attempt to “improve upon her already extraordinary life of leisure, luxury, privilege and modest fame”. In a lawsuit filed this week in New York, Mr Lichtenstein accused his “embittered former girlfriend” of falsely telling the court that £2.2 million given to her by her boyfriend, Andrew Cader, 54, was a loan that she had to repay. Lawyers for Miss Bond said the allegations made by Mr Lichtenstein in his US Complaint and referred to in this article are "utterly denied".

He claimed she had also lied about the £16,000 a month lease on the luxury home the couple share in a wealthy district of Hong Kong by stating that it was also a loan. As a result, he argued that she did not require such a large amount of child support. Mr Lichtenstein accused Miss Bond of moving from “one millionaire lover to another to support her lavish lifestyle”. He said she spent millions of dollars of their money “before moving on to her next wealthy lover or lovers to support her and finance her litigation efforts”. To illustrate her allegedly excessive spending, he claimed that she had spent £400,000 furnishing her Hong Kong home and another £62,000 on a Range Rover. The lawsuit lifts the lid on the bitterness that has consumed what was previously thought to have been an amicable separation. It accuses Miss Bond and Mr Cader, whose brokerage firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg was purchased by Goldman Sachs for £4.8 billion, of “scheming” to manipulate the legal process by making the socialite appear less wealthy than she really was. “Their conduct manifests not only a gross abuse of process and a plain and simple act of injustice - but also, actionable fraud,” it states. (PA)
Mr Lichtenstein, 46, and Miss Bond, who was the fourth British woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, split up in 2007 on what was then good terms. However, the financier, who runs hedge fund Steel Partners and is said to be worth £630 million, was furious when she moved to Hong Kong against his wishes. To compound his misery, a judge then ordered him to pay £27,000 in monthly child support, a sum three times greater than that originally ordered by a British court. He filed his lawsuit, seeking at least £120,000 in damages, against Mr Cader as he is a resident of New York City and can be sued in the US courts. The documents also allege that Sir John, who was described as “the corporate genius who turned HSBC into a banking colossus” during his 45 years with the firm, “conspired” with his daughter and made false statements that he could no longer provide her with monthly £1,600 payments. Miss Bond, who seven years ago became the fastest woman to climb the Earth's highest peaks, did not respond to a request for comment via her website and phone calls to Mr Cader's Manhattan apartment went unanswered. A request for comment was passed on to Sir John, 70, through Swiss mining company Xstrata for which he is currently chairman. Law and Order

Libyan may settle 'torture' case for £3
A Libyan politician suing the British Government after being kidnapped and tortured has offered to settle the case for £3, as long as he also receives an unreserved apology.
Mr Belhaj was an opponent of Col Gaddafi Photo: AP	By Telegraph Reporters
6:15AM GMT 04 Mar 2013
Follow Abdel Hakim Belhaj, leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, was held with his wife by American intelligence officers at Bangkok airport after an alleged tip-off by MI6.
The couple were then flown to Tripoli, where Mr Belhaj, who opposed the opposed Libyan dictator, Col Muammar Gaddafi, was tortured during his six years in jail. His wife, who was five months’ pregnant, was chained to a wall at a secret prison at the airport, it was reported. He launched legal action against the government, after secret documents found in Tripoli showed Sir Mark Allen, former head of counter-terrorism at MI6 had written to Musa Kusa, Col Gaddafi’s then intelligence chief, claiming credit for the tip-off. Last night it emerged that Mr Belhaj, a leading figure in the rebel forces before the dictator was killed,he has written to David Cameron saying he would settle his case for a “token compensation” of one pound each from the government, Jack Straw, the former Foreign Secretary and Sir Mark.

Tonight, Mr Belhaj's supporters at Reprieve, the human rights group, confirmed he would drop the legal case in exchange for the payment from each respondent as well as an apology and admission of liability.
In a letter sent to the Prime Minister, Mr Straw, and Sir Mark, and seen by the Guardian, Mr Belhaj said: "I am making an open offer to settle our litigation.
"My wife and I are willing to end our case against the UK Government and Messrs Straw and Allen in exchange for a token compensation of a British pound from each defendant, an apology and an admission of liability for what was done to us."
"Various media reports I have seen suggest that our motive for bringing this case is to enrich ourselves. I wish to lay this misconception to rest."
He added: "It is certainly true that my wife and I suffered deeply during our kidnap and in Libya.
"But we have come to court in Britain because we believe your courts can deliver justice."
Reprieve legal director Cori Crider said: "What our clients want from the Government is an admission, an apology and an explanation of how this was allowed to happen.
"It is time to put the ghosts of Tony Blair's toxic 'deal in the desert' with Gaddafi to rest, and this is the perfect opportunity for David Cameron to do so.
"Fatima Boudchar and Abdul-Hakim Belhaj are asking for justice - and the token 'payment' will cost the PM the price of his latte."
He added: "The next time the Government repeats its mantra that secret courts will save the public purse, remember: this family was willing to walk away for £3." Libya News

Redecorating ideas: out with the beige, in with the burnt orange At last, we're ditching neutral beige tones and opting for bold, bright shades of paint, says Caroline McGhie.
Image 1 of 2	Jewel-like: Stephen and Assia Webster's vivid Kent home is for sale through Stutt and Parker Image 1 of 2	Study in plum: 'Colour is important because it is one of the first things people notice when they visit a house' By Caroline McGhie
7:00AM GMT 28 Jan 2010
Comments
Stephen and Assia Webster habitually wrap themselves in jewels and colour. Why wouldn't they? He is the rock-and-roll jeweller to the stars, she is a Russian exotic. A man who creates for Kate Moss an articulated lobster made of brown diamonds and coral, and a woman who is completely comfortable in fuchsia fishnets, could do no other.
Enter the front door of their town house in Kent and you are enveloped in dark purple.
The sitting room then opens out into a rich Italian red, furnished with sofas and chairs in dark red, pepper and aubergine. The large cowhide on the floor is the kind of thing you find in ski lodges high in the Alps. Upstairs they have a bedroom in red and black, and a guest room which is more neutral. "It is a soft lime because we didn't want to shock our guests," says Assia. One child's room is lilac and red, another has a blue wall with white clouds dancing across it. But their decision to sell the six-bedroom Georgian house in Walmer raised questions about the decoration.
"We were asked by the estate agents to tone it down," says Assia. "But if someone really likes the house they can do what they like with it. And this certainly gives it more character. My husband absolutely loves colour, and this is like a jewellery casket filled with precious stones. It is a reflection of his work." Stephen's jewellery is loved by glitterati including Madonna, Johnny Depp and Cameron Diaz, and Victoria Beckham proudly sported the mosquito ring (white gold, white diamond wings, silver diamond tail) he had designed in aid of malaria prevention. The house is for sale through Strutt & Parker (01227 451123) at £475,000.
Stephen and Assia may be international glamour gipsies, but theirs is a dilemma we all face. Should we decorate before selling? If we do, then should we pursue the wild and exotic or go for the creams and whites that estate agents recommend? "If a house is a bit tired we always try to get people to redecorate the key rooms," says Charlie Willis of Strutt & Parker. "It is worth spending £5,000 to £6,000 because it makes a sale go through quickly and maxes the price." Related Articles

But does it really count for so much? "It makes it more saleable," he says. "And if a house doesn't sell quickly then it affects the price because buyers think they can get it for less. A spot of colour is good but neutral is best because it doesn't put people off. I sold a house owned by a woman who painted the side of the bath pink to go with the bathroom curtains. That had to go." In playing safe, however, estate agents are out of step with changing trends. Crown Paints says the big colour of the past decade was Chocolate Comtesse, a sort of mushroom soup colour hovering somewhere between mauve and brown. The company predicts that we will become bolder in the next 10 years, opting for stripes and blocks of different colours, and our taste will become hotter, leading us to choose "synthetic purples, burnt oranges and deep greys".
At the Paint & Paper Library, where paint expert David Oliver has perfected 240 colours, many of them based on historic houses and their needs, tastes are moving in the same direction. Top sellers include Sugared Violet, Rhubarb, Very Well Read (think crushed library) and Hot Earth. David is both imaginative and scientific in his approach. Half the colours are "architectural", which means they are arranged in tonal families with five in each so that you can paint the doors, windows, ceilings and walls, and know they will all go together.
"Colour is important because it is one of the first things people notice when they visit a house and it is what they remember when they have left it. We use it as a memory tool," he says. "And people are definitely going for more colour now. There is a huge move away from the taupe and white which all the television shows were advocating two years ago, thinking only of the property resale value. People now think that if they have to stay put they will have the colours they want. They will express their personalities." Are we getting off-white fatigue? "People have got tired of walking in and seeing a flat-screen television and a B & Q Italia sofa. They knew the price of everything and the value of nothing. Now they are rediscovering how to use furniture, art, how to upholster a bed base." What shall it be then? Blackcurrant Crush or Gazelle Grey?
Contrasts Dazzle with white: Chelsea town house in Manresa Road with four bedrooms at £4.5m through Strutt & Parker (020 7225 3866).
Titillate with colour: Marine Palms, Torquay, Devon, with two bedrooms, bay views and decorated with a "theatrical or mildly erotic theme", according to agents Fulfords (01392 660007), who are asking £499,950.
Reassure with country cosy: Bank House, Ascott, in the Cotswolds, with seven bedrooms, sitting rooms of primrose yellow and wisteria blue, at £1.1m through Strutt & Parker (01608 650502). DECADES IN COLOUR (Source: Crown Paints)
Sixties: psychedelia and bolds (influence: pop culture)
Seventies: pastels and sprigs (think Laura Ashley)
Eighties: neon, monochrome (power dressing)
Nineties: Mediterranean brights and neutrals (all that foreign travel)
Noughties: naturals and warms (the new eco awareness)
PAINT KNOW-HOW (Source: Paint and Paper Library)
1. Use everyday possessions as a starting point – a dress, jewellery or painting.
2. Colours that most attract you first will be the easiest to live with.
3. Light dramatically affects the way colours appear; look in daylight and under artificial light.
4. Paint the inside of a shoebox first.
5. Always work from actual samples of paint. Interiors and Shopping

Honey and thyme turkey with glazed root vegetables recipe
4:42PM GMT 20 Nov 2012
Serves 4 Ingredients 500g British turkey mince 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 clove of garlic, chopped 175ml red wine 400g can chopped plum tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato purée a pinch of sugar 5-6 basil leaves, torn, plus extra to serve 6 sheets of dried lasagne 150g Taleggio cheese, diced 50g Parmesan cheese, grated for the béchamel sauce
25g butter 25g plain flour 500ml milk Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Heat the oil in a large frying-pan and sauté the onion for about five minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Turn the heat up and add the turkey mince, and fry until lightly browned. Pour in the wine and boil rapidly to allow the alcohol to evaporate and the wine to reduce a little. Add the tomatoes and tomato purée, sugar, basil and some seasoning, stirring well. Turn the heat to low and continue to cook for about 20 minutes until thick. Set aside. To make the béchamel sauce, melt the butter and add the flour. Stir well with a wooden spoon and cook for two minutes. Pour in the milk a little at a time, whisking continuously until thickened. Simmer gently for five to 10 minutes until you have a creamy sauce. Season to taste. To assemble the lasagne, spread a thin layer of meat sauce in a gratin dish or shallow casserole dish. Add a layer of lasagne sheets, avoiding any overlap and breaking them, if necessary, to fit. Pour a layer of white sauce evenly on top and a layer of meat sauce on top of this. Add another layer of pasta, followed by the last of the meat sauce and then finish with white sauce. Arrange the Taleggio and Parmesan on top and bake for about 40 minutes until cooked and golden-brown. Serve in individual dishes, sprinkled with extra basil if desired.
