Cheryl Cole denies lip-synching on The Voice
Singer Cheryl Cole bats away criticism of her singing on The Voice and at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert, while users take to Twitter to give their opinions. Gary Barlow and Cheryl Cole sing a duet Photo: Paul Grover	By James Lachno

Speaking in an interview with the BBC, Cole refuted claims that she was miming when she performed new track Call My Name on The Voice last month. The singer, 28, said: "If you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy. I take it as a compliment."
However, users on Twitter have continued to post negative reactions to her performances on The Voice, and at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert earlier this week. One wrote: Twitter: WD Jackson - A bag of cats being sat on by a drug addled elephant would sound better than Cheryl Cole singing Need You Now #shouldhavemimedagain

Another took a similar view: Twitter: Heather D - Why on earth would anyone think Cheryl Cole was miming when the singing was so bad?! #jubileeconcert
Another, from satirical account @Queen_UK, has proved popular since being posted yesterday: Twitter: Elizabeth Windsor - Just visited the DoE. He says all things considered he's rather glad he missed Cheryl Cole screeching her way through Monday's concert.
Cole, however, admitted that Twitter gives her an outlet to target criticism, and has pledged to fight back using the social networking site: "I don't know what I was doing before Twitter, I really don't. Burying my head in the sand," she told the BBC "I never answer back unprovoked... But I'm always answering something back. I don't have any middle-men now. I've got my voice back."
Cole rose to fame as part of girl group Girls Aloud, who won ITV talent show Popstars The Rivals in 2002. The band are currently on hiatus, and Cole has launched a succesful solo career. Her third solo album, A Million Lights, will be released on 18 June. Follow Telegraph Music on Twitter

London 2012 stuntman's partner speaks lovingly of the man whose death has left a 'void' that can't be filled
The grieving partner of the London 2012 stuntman killed in a skydiving accident has spoken lovingly of the man who brought “joy and laughter to millions” and whose death has left a “void” that cannot be filled. Miss Homewood published a cherished photograph of her and Mr Sutton embracing on top of Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa, above an unbroken sea of cloud. Photo: FACEBOOK	By Henry Samuel, in Chamonix and Gordon Rayner
10:00PM BST 16 Aug 2013
Victoria Homewood said the memory of Mark Sutton, who parachuted into the opening ceremony of the Games last year as Daniel Craig’s James Bond stunt double, “will live on to inspire us all”. Miss Homewood, 39, is being comforted by members of Mr Sutton’s family, including his brother Steve, in the French mountain resort of Chamonix, where the couple were staying when Mr Sutton was killed a few miles over the Swiss border on Wednesday. In a statement released to The Telegraph, Miss Homewood said: “My handsome ‘007’ brought joy and laughter to millions during last year’s London Olympic Games opening ceremony. For those few moments in the media spotlight the world saw the immensely gifted, professional and brilliant man who has been tragically snatched away from us. “Mark was the most loving and loyal man, utterly selfless in all he did. His patience and kindness touched many people’s lives. “He was passionate about life, nature, the mountains and the sky. We sorely miss him. His passion, spirit, bravery and love will live on to inspire us all. Related Articles

“For us nothing will ever fill the void left by Mark’s untimely passing, I hope you will respect our right to grieve in peace and grant Mark’s close family and friends time and space to mourn our loss with dignity.”
Miss Homewood also published a cherished photograph on her Facebook page of her and Mr Sutton embracing on top of Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa, above an unbroken sea of cloud. Mr Sutton, 42, a former Army officer who worked in the City, was killed instantly when he hit a mountain at 155mph just 20 seconds after he jumped from 10,800ft wearing a wingsuit designed to help him glide during his descent. His father, Air Marshal Sir John Sutton, who was the RAF’s head of logistics in the 1980s, said the family was “very proud” of Mr Sutton, who had “a great life, a great 42 years”. His mother, Lady Angela Sutton, said: “He was a marvellous person who excelled at everything he did. As a family we are completely devastated.”
Tony Uragallo, who jumped out of the helicopter seconds after Mr Sutton and was gliding behind him at the time of the accident, said Mr Sutton and Miss Homewood, who works for a teacher training company, were “very much in love”. Mr Uragallo, who makes wingsuits, and Mr Sutton were among 20 of the world’s best wingsuit fliers invited to a non-competitive skydiving event being filmed by the French internet channel Epic TV. Mr Uragallo said: “I was going to follow him as he’s a way better jumper than me. He climbed out of the helicopter, I followed him and was up close. But he just took off really fast and took a really aggressive line. “We were all going to go a bit conservative on the first jump, but he was pretty aggressive. He went to the left side of the mountain right down to a flat area, and was flying really low to the ground in that flat area. The ground then rose up and he didn’t quite raise up as much as the ground did. He clipped the rise in the mountain and he tumbled. “He was a very good flyer. He always flew real close to the rocks, but on this day he flew a bit too close. “He wasn’t used to that jump and was a little bit aggressive for such a new jump. Usually we know the area, we know the mountain. He didn’t know the mountain at all. “We looked at it from the helicopter above and we were going to follow everybody else’s line but he chose a slightly different line, and he just didn’t manage it quite right.”
Mr Uragallo did not do any more jumps on Wednesday or Thursday out of respect for his friend of five years, but on Friday he was back in the sky. He explained: “You just get back into life, you get back on your horse.”
Gary Connery, who parachuted into the Olympic Stadium dressed as the Queen alongside his close friend Mr Sutton, said: “Mark Sutton was without doubt the best, No.1 Bond ever, style, panache, and looks to match, and he did his own stunts. Love you and miss you, my wingman forever.”

Liverpool midfielder Joe Cole to rejoin West Ham with £3m pay-off
Joe Cole was on the verge of rejoining West Ham on Wednesday night after agreeing a £3 million pay-off to end his stay at Liverpool. Cole headed to Upton Park for a medical yesterday after his boyhood club agreed a permanent deal for the 31 year-old.

Liverpool will release Cole on a free transfer, approving a lucrative package to terminate his contract. The former England midfielder initially appeared to be heading for a reunion with former manager Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers, but the lure of a return to Upton Park was too strong to resist. West Ham were unable to make a loan offer for their former player because they already have Andy Carroll on a temporary basis from Liverpool. Premier League do not allow clubs to loan two players from the same side. That forced West Ham manager Sam Allardyce’s hand, with the key obstacle being the finances of a ­permanent transfer. Liverpool knew they would have to agree a severance with the player they signed in the summer of 2010. Cole’s four-year contract on Merseyside is worth £92,000 a week, which West Ham cannot match.

Liverpool said they will save about £4 million by paying Cole to leave now, given that the last 18 months of his deal is worth about £7 million. However, that still equates to a considerable bill to move him off the payroll. For his part, Cole is desperate to play regular football again, recognising he has no future at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers. In fact, he has been a bit-part player under three successive Liverpool managers. Roy Hodgson never fancied him, Kenny Dalglish sent Cole on loan to Lille in the summer of 2011, and Rodgers made it clear from day one that he was free to join another club. The attraction of Upton Park, the club where he made his name as a schoolboy international and teenage prodigy, is clearly sentimental as much as professional. Cole scored the equaliser in Liverpool’s 3-2 win against West Ham last month, but tellingly refused to celebrate the goal. Once West Ham had declared an interest, they were inevitably his first choice, despite his affection for Redknapp. It will be an emotional moment when Cole wears the West Ham shirt again, his career having gone full circle, but there remains a sense of unfulfilled promise about a player who was once regarded the exciting future of English football. Now he finds his career in need of resuscitation at the club where it all began. When Cole was only 16 and courting attention in the West Ham youth team, Manchester United were believed to be prepared to pay £10 million for him. He made his debut in an FA Cup tie 14 years ago this month, aged 17, and was named the club captain when he was only 21. After West Ham’s relegation in 2003 – having played more than 100 games in five years – he joined Chelsea, where he won three Premier League titles and two FA Cups. His career has stalled since his last season at Stamford Bridge, when he struggled to recover from injury and was sidelined by manager Carlo Ancelotti. Liverpool signed him at tumultuous period in their history, in the summer of 2010 when the club were for sale and looking for a new manager, while players such as Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres and Pepe Reina were considering their future. It was hoped that the Bosman signing of Cole would send a message that the club retained their ambition to buy players of pedigree. He became one of the club’s top earners. Instead, his move to Anfield began appallingly when he was sent off on his Premier League debut against Arsenal. After that, one setback followed another as he was unable to get a run in the side. The new owners, Fenway Sports Group, then used Cole as an example of ill-advised recruitment policies of the previous regime. With Liverpool still in the process of trying to move out big earners to relocate funds, they will welcome Cole’s exit. He is unlikely to be the only departure from Anfield this month. Nuri Sahin – signed on loan amid a degree of fanfare from Real Madrid last August – is also free to end his spell prematurely. The Turkish midfielder has struggled to adapt to English football and has been relegated to the bench. Fulham have joined the chase to take him on loan, with former club Borussia Dortmund and Inter Milan also showing interest. As with Cole, ending Sahin’s spell at Anfield will enable Rodgers to divert resources towards players he wants to recruit, rather than those inherited or thrust upon him. West Ham

Young Harry Edwards-Brady rides into the Horse of the Year Show record books
The youngest competitor in the show's history is sitting tall in the saddle at the age of three
'I’ve never been nervous,' says Harry's mother, Emma, 'not even when he’s wanted to sit on top of my 16.2 hands-high horse' Photo: SWNS	By Victoria Lambert

"It’s the paparazzi!” shouts Harry. Dressed in a favourite Newmarket-stripe fleece top, trendy red jeans, and plum-coloured jodhpurs boots, he is haring off in the opposite direction. For the past three days, while the international press has called, emailed, texted and photographed him, this young man has been holed up in a horsebox. Although unfailingly courteous, his patience is beginning to wear thin. Don’t get confused, though – this is not Prince Harry. While just as charming, and just as popular with the girls, Harry Edwards-Brady from Hatherleigh, in Devon, is only three years old. He’s more of a hot chocolate-with-marshmallows than a Mahiki-nightclub-and-cocktails kind of a guy. Yet, on Wednesday, he stole his royal rival’s crown as the nation’s Prince of Hearts. As he rode Moortown Divine, his 11 hands-high Dartmoor pony, to seventh place in the mountain and moorland lead rein class, at the same time, he rode into the history books as the youngest-ever competitor at Britain’s most prestigious riding event, the Horse of the Year Show (HOYS). Despite his triumph, his mother Emma, 37, is more stunned at the public recognition of her son than his achievement as one of the youngest rosette winners ever. “Calls are coming in from all over the world,” she says to me, as we hunker down in the cosy living area of the family’s horse lorry.

“We’ve had scores of press wanting to meet him: TV crews from Russia and Germany, and an email from China, wanting Harry to go out there in January to launch the Year of the Horse in Beijing. Chris Evans has mentioned us on his Radio 2 show every day this week. It’s unreal.”
His father, Sean, 44, a former captain in the Rifles turned consultant, is on his way home from Afghanistan so doesn’t even know of his son’s fame yet. But he shouldn’t be too surprised. Harry has horses in his blood. “My grandfather kept shire horses on his farm, and my mother rode point-to-point,” Emma explains. “I was on a pony as soon as I could stand up, and competed at the Devon County Show at three.”
While pregnant with Harry, Emma carried on riding – “I must have been about four or five months pregnant when I was training for a judging qualification. I rode 60 horses that day” – and, after her son was born, she popped him on horseback at a few weeks old. “It felt right,” she says, smiling at the thought. “Then I bought him a basket saddle, which holds you in – the sort I had started out in – so that when he was a year old he could be led around on my old 13 hands-high pony, Prince William, who is now 30. “By 18 months, Harry could sit up unaided, and had begun to master rising trot.” She adds: “I’ve never been nervous; not even when he’s wanted to sit on top of my 16.2 hands-high horse.”
The family run a 70-acre farm where they keep about 18 horses and ponies, breeding ponies for showing, and selling them on as youngsters. With Emma’s brother and mother, they also run the successful Brickyard farm shop in Hatherleigh, especially known for its award-winning sausages. It’s a hard-working life, not a glamorous one, by the sound of it. Emma admits: “I had to make quite a few hundred pounds of sausages before I left for HOYS.”
Still, this is not her first trip to the show, held at the Birmingham NEC. Like all pony-mad girls, Emma had aimed to compete as a girl, but qualification for any of the classes is fiercely contested. “It took me until I was about 20,” she admits, laughing again at her son’s meteoric rise. This is no novelty act. Harry is, without doubt, a natural talent: poised, perfectly balanced, and – his Camarthen-based riding teacher Debbie Thomas tells me – he has great empathy with all animals. I don’t think Debbie would waste her time with just any child: she is one of the UK’s premier producers of show ponies and demands high standards from their young riders (her past pupils include the Olympic gold medal-winning Charlotte Dujardin). “He’s a good young rider,” Debbie says. “But he also has something else – confidence. He’s a natural performer; he goes into the ring and he shines.” And every show rider must, of course, look the part. Show wear for mother and son includes matching tweed jackets (Harry’s tiny one cost about £150, but jodphurs and boots tend to be hand-me-downs). Tomorrow, the pair will be dressed up again, for the finals of the lead rein pony of hunter type class, when Harry will ride five-year-old Gryngallt Page Too, 12 hands high and known as Little Billy at home. Will he win? “He has a good chance”, is all Emma will venture. Could he be a future adult champion? “It would be nice. I’m just happy he’s enjoying it.”
Indeed, though Harry is itching to canter, and eyeing up the jumps already, his mum won’t take unnecessary chances and is making him wait (“I’ve always felt safe, though, and he’s never fallen off”). In the winter, she will take him hunting on Little Billy – albeit only for an hour, and definitely on the lead rein. Despite his prowess, riding lessons for Harry still don’t last much more than 10 minutes at a time; like any three-year-old, he likes playing best. While the man of the hour is a little shy when faced with the press, sources tell me his current favourite toys are miniature John Deere tractors and combine harvesters. He also loves his Red Arrows Teddy bear and going swimming with his dad. Harry enjoys pre-school and, when not riding at a show, can be found looking at the big tractors, if he’s not being spoiled by all the young girls (aged three to 13) who dote on his big smile and cheeky laugh. He particularly likes them to read him Fireman Sam, Tractor Ted, or The Amazing Aeroplane. And – luckily, considering the family business – sausages are his favourite food. A winning personality on a winning streak: no wonder we’re all wild about Harry. Equestrianism
