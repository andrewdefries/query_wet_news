Secondary education: learning Latin for literacy The OECD report has ranked the UK 23rd out of 65 in reading, perhaps it is time to rethink our attitudes towards education and start teaching Latin, says Rozina Sabur

At a time when the OECD report has ranked the UK as 23rd out of 65 countries for reading, perhaps it is time to rethink our attitudes towards education. If the classicists are to be believed, learning Latin can improve literacy levels. Given that England is the only country in the developed world in which 55-65 year olds out perform 16 – 24 year olds in literacy and numeracy, a return to teaching the classics could provide part of the solution. Classicists are often called upon to defend their subject, but it has been proved that the benefits extend to other subjects as well. However, despite this, Latin is only taught in 13 per cent of state schools and just 12,000 take Latin GCSE each year. But should Classics be the preserve of the elite? Studying Latin and Greek offers numerous rewards, improving analytical skills and logical reasoning – but, perhaps most importantly, access to great literature. Peter Jones is often asked how he finds inspiration for his Spectator column, Ancient & Modern. “It’s easy,” he says, “when I can tap into a wealth of Classical literature.” Related Articles

Can you pass the good grammar test?
15 Apr 2013
Having studied both Latin and English literature for my degree, I can attest to the benefits of a Classical background in understanding English literature. I was able to study Latin at university, as I had previously enrolled on a gifted and talented evening scheme – my state school didn't, at that stage, offer it. Jones stressed the employability factor, quoting a YouGov survey in which 83 per cent of those asked supported the classical languages being taught in secondary schools, while 28 per cent said that Classics should be included on the curriculum. Furthermore, 51 per cent of those responsible for staff, said the study of Classics was either useful or very useful. Classics for All, a charitable scheme into its third year, funds teaching and resources in state schools. At a funding event, 'Classics in the City', I spoke to David Hogg, from Kelmscott School in Walthamstow, who completed his GCSE in Latin and taught it through the scheme; he intends to stay ahead of his pupils, who are currently a few steps behind. He suggested the literature added a whole new layer of teaching to English Literature: “It’s a revelation,” he says. “Atticus suddenly became a shining light projecting his philosophy onto Maycomb.” “I’ve been teaching these books for years; suddenly I’m seeing them in a whole new light. It’s made me a better teacher of my own subject.” “I’m very annoyed it isn’t taught to all children – even though I’m an English teacher, those with Classics can reference Byron and Keats better.” Reading these texts in translation, simply doesn’t have the same potency. The nuances of the language, the word play and the effect of metre cannot be translated. It's a shame most students should be deprived of this. Historian, Bettany Hughes, says she studied Latin and Greek “not because I went to a posh school but because I had a wonderful teacher.” She is currently a patron of Classics For All, along with Boris Johnson and Mary Beard. Bettany said the benefits of studying these languages are manifold, not least because, as a historian looking at Syria and similar situations, this learning “gives us a much firmer understanding of contemporary politics”. “What we’re speaking now is Greco-Roman," she says. "It comes from the greatest literature ever written. When you read it, you feel humility looking at things over time and space” Trustee, Nicolas Barber, argues that “the national scandal at the moment is literacy.” He says that teaching Latin is a good way to tackle literacy rates as studies done abroad suggest that learning Latin can actually help improve literacy levels of young people. Jules Mann, Executive Director of the charity highlighted the inclusivity of the scheme, not aimed solely at students who wanted to study Classics further. She stressed that one of the organisation's most important messages was that the scheme could have a huge impact in schools with "so little" funding. She highlighted Kelmscott School in Walthamstow as a case in point: "Kelmscott received £5,000 in funded tutoring. They are now teaching Latin in school and other teachers are coming forward wanting to be involved." She added: "We need to raise well over £100,000 p.a. to provide classes in 100 schools a year".

Petro Vlahos
Petro Vlahos, who has died aged 96, developed the blue- and green-screen technique that made memorable visual effects possible on films such as Mary Poppins and Ben Hur.

Comments
While others had grappled before with so-called “composite photography”, overlaying shots of separately-filmed actors on background sets, the results were never totally convincing, with actors often appearing to glow in a halo of light that spoiled the effect.
Vlahos moved the process forward, first for the spectacular chariot race in William Wyler’s 1959 remake of the epic Ben Hur, and later for the charming penguin dance in the Disney musical Mary Poppins (1964). For the song Jolly Holiday, Walt Disney had decided that one of the choruses should be sung by animated penguins dressed as waiters. Although Disney had spent $250,000 buying the rights to Vlahos’s blue-screen process — “chicken feed”, he called the money — technicians had to accommodate the animation with live footage that had already been shot, which meant major revisions. That did not prevent Vlahos working with the Disney studio on The Love Bug (1969) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), both of which also relied on special effects.
The techniques that Vlahos perfected in such pictures were applied in many subsequent science-fiction and fantasy films, including the first Star Wars trilogy between 1977 and 1983. Unfortunately, shooting for some of the special effects in Star Wars took place during the hottest British summer for many years. The blue-screen process required giant arc lights, making the sets stiflingly hot: electricians fainted, and the actor playing Chewbacca, clad in a body suit of angora wool and yak hair, collapsed from heat exhaustion and dehydration.
Vlahos and his collaborators won an Academy Award for their composite processes in 1965, and with his son, Paul, he shared another Oscar in 1995 for the blue-screen advances made by Ultimatte, the company he founded in 1976.
His original concepts and innovations have been enhanced and expanded over the years, making possible entirely seamless composites which preserve fine details such as hair, smoke, mist, motion blur and shadows while automatically suppressing “blue spill” (whereby light from the blue screen behind washes across the foreground subject).
Refinements of Vlahos’s pioneering technique were used to make many of the blockbuster films of the 1990s, notably Titanic (1997), in which scenes that had hitherto been too dangerous, expensive or difficult to film were finally possible. Special effects triumphs in contemporary films like Avatar (2009), in which blue-skinned Na’vi dwell among floating mountains, and Life of Pi (2012), in which the tiger, the ocean, and sometimes even the boy Pi himself are digital creations, also derive from Vlahos’s work. Petro Vlahos was born on August 20 1916 at Raton, New Mexico. After graduating in Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1941, he became a designer at Douglas Aircraft during the Second World War.
After working as a radar engineer at Bell Laboratories, he joined the Motion Picture Research Council, spending six months devising a complex laboratory process that separated blues, greens and reds before recombining them. The result — his patented “colour-difference system travelling matte scheme” — created the breathtaking visual effects in Ben-Hur . Having minimised the unwanted “halo” side-effect that had dogged earlier attempts, he modified the technique to work on green screens as well as blue.
On television, technology based on Vlahos’s work was regularly seen in episodes of Doctor Who, and made it possible for weather presenters to point at sun and rain symbols that only their viewers can see.
In all Vlahos held more than 35 patents for film-related gadgetry, and in 1978 received an Emmy for his work.
Petro Vlahos is survived by his wife, Virginia, their son and daughter and two stepchildren.
Petro Vlahos, born August 20 1916, died February 10 2013

Philip, the one constant through her life
By Caroline Davies
12:01AM BST 20 Apr 2006
When a young Prince Philip of Greece sought the hand of Britain's Princess Elizabeth, many obstacles lay between the young couple and Westminster Abbey, and as many challenges lay beyond.
That they celebrate their diamond wedding anniversary next year is proof that the Queen, with much of her public life dictated by duty and destiny, chose wisely in making this most crucial of personal decisions.
Prime ministers and private secretaries have come and gone. Each passing year steals further friends and confidantes. Her mother and sister are dead, and her children, though close, are forging their own lives.
The one constant throughout is the Duke of Edinburgh, still loyally, and lovingly, at her side. It has been an outstanding working partnership, and, judging from the Queen's touching tribute to her husband in her 1997 golden wedding speech at London's Guildhall, a personal triumph too.
"He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments," she said, giving a rare insight into their relationship, "but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know." Princess Elizabeth first really noticed her future husband at the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth where 18-year-old Philip of Greece was studying. She was 13, and visiting with Princess Margaret. But as the royal yacht sailed into the Dart estuary, news was received aboard that several of the naval cadets had succumbed to chickenpox.
To prevent the risk of contagion, plans for the young princesses to attend morning chapel were shelved and they remained, instead, at the house of the Captain of the College. Prince Philip, a third cousin and who had previously met the princesses on a couple of formal family occasions, was sent to entertain them, no doubt hauled out of church and dispatched by his fiercely ambitious "uncle Dickie", later Lord Mountbatten, who was desperate for a love match.
Princess Elizabeth obligingly played her part, finding herself deeply impressed with Philip's handsome features, friendly demeanour and the way he vaulted over the tennis nets.
He has stressed several times that thoughts of marriage did not occur until 1946.
George VI and Queen Elizabeth were initially reluctant. They feared their daughter "too young" and were dismayed she wanted to marry the first man she had met. Politicians were anxious how a union with a man, dismissed as "a German" by the people and dubbed "the Hun" by Queen Elizabeth, would go down in Britain, or in republican Greece, where it could be seen as support for royalists at a politically fragile time. He had no money and no nationality. But the Princess persisted. And uncle Dickie's spin-doctoring skills ensured favourable media coverage and smoothed the way to his nephew's naturalisation. He even donated his name to the young suitor, who arrived at the altar as Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten.
Giving up his successful naval career and deprived of any chance of utilising his sharp brain in commercial venture, the early years following his wife's Coronation were hard on Prince Philip. The Queen was seen as passive, cautious and conventional, while the Duke was certainly more adventurous, tempestuous and active. Their partnership was a traditional one - the Queen grew up in a world where it was the man who was in charge behind closed doors.
But from being master in his own home in their early years at Clarence House, the move to Buckingham Palace somewhat initially emasculated him. Opinionated, proactive, ebullient, sometimes irascible and always questioning, he often found himself at odds with courtiers. He was furious too that an earlier declaration forced on the Queen meant he could not even pass his own name - albeit an adopted name - on to his children.
The Queen did her best to include him, beginning so many speeches "My husband and I" that it became a national joke.
In 1960, with the birth of Prince Andrew imminent and aware of his frustration, she took the major step of declaring she was changing the rules and that her descendants - other than her children, those entitled to use HRH and descendants of females who marry - would bear the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.
Whatever their early difficulties, they appear to have come to an excellent accommodation.
In matters of the family, the Queen defers to him, such as in the choice of schooling for their children. On matters of state, he plays no part. On public duty he is either at her side or one step behind her, whichever protocol dictates. In their early years, observers noted some timidity towards him on her part. Lord Mountbatten used fondly to recount how one day, while Prince Philip was driving the Queen and him to Cowdray Park, her husband's excessive speed caused the Queen to tense herself and draw in breath at critical moments. Eventually, Prince Philip exploded: "If you do that once more, I shall put you out of the car." She stopped. "But you were right - why didn't you protest?" Mountbatten later asked her. "But you heard what he said," she replied, puzzled.
She does, however, take him on, unembarrassed by the presence of staff. "I am not going to come out of my cabin until he's in a better temper," one former aide recalls her saying aboard HMY Britannia during an official visit. The late Lord Charteris, the Queen's private secretary until 1977, once told royal biographer Gyles Brandreth: "Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. I think she values that. "And, of course, it is not unknown for the Queen to tell the Duke to shut up."
The Duke's naturally flirtatious manner has led to gossip of affairs, but there has never been anything resembling proof. There must have been huge amounts of give and take, given their exceptional circumstances. As Prince Philip himself admitted in his golden wedding tribute to his wife: "I think the main lesson we have learned is that tolerance is the one essential ingredient of any happy marriage. You can take it from me that the Queen has the quality of tolerance in abundance."

15-year-olds to be added to Scottish independence electoral roll
A separate and confidential electoral register that includes children aged as young as 15 will be drawn up for the Scottish independence referendum, under legislation published today. 16 and 17-year-olds will vote in the independence referendum Photo: PA	By Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor
12:09PM GMT 12 Mar 2013
Comments
All households north of the Border will receive a form asking parents to identify teenagers who will reach 16 by the time of the referendum, which is due to be staged in autumn next year. Their details will be held on a separate Register of Young Voters (RYV), which will be used to give 16 and 17-year-olds a ballot in the referendum.
Amid concern about gathering the personal details of minors, including their dates of birth and addresses, the information will not be made public so it cannot be used by the likes of marketing companies.
The two main referendum campaigns will be given access but the RYV names will be mixed in with the main electoral register so they cannot tell who is a minor.
The Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Bill gives British and EU citizens resident in Scotland the right to vote along with armed forces personnel serving elsewhere who are registered for a ballot north of the Border. Related Articles

However, prisoners are to be denied a vote despite the UK Government asking a committee to consider rulings by Europe that a blanket ban on inmates taking part in elections breaches their human rights. Despite the SNP’s enthusiasm for extending the franchise, elections experts have predicted the change will make little difference to support for independence, which has haemorrhaged at around 30 per cent. Unveiling the legislation, Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister, said: “No one has a bigger stake in the future of our country than today's young people and it is only right that they are able to have a say in the most important vote to be held in Scotland for three centuries. “At 16, young people can marry, have children and pay taxes and it is therefore correct that they are given the right to vote on the future of the country in which they live. In modern Scotland, giving the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds is the right thing to do.” The Bill applies only to the referendum, the date of which will be announced by Alex Salmond this month, and the voting age will revert to 18 in the 2015 general election and the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. MSPs are expected to overwhelmingly approve the change, with the SNP enjoying a parliamentary majority at Holyrood and it also being supported by the Liberal Democrats. The legislation places a duty on local electoral registration officers (EROS) to compile a list of children who will reach the age of 16 by the time of the referendum. A canvass of households will take place between autumn this year and spring 2014, although eligible teenagers will be able to add their names to the electoral roll until 11 days before the vote. A form will be sent to all Scottish households and its return “will be required if there is any young person resident at the address who will be eligible to vote in the referendum.” It is expected that all young voters will be at least 15 at the time their details are captured. Each entry on the RYV must include the individual‘s name, date of birth, qualifying address and voter number. The Scottish Government estimates the cost of the new register will be £358,000, including £240,000 for the necessary computer software and around £50,000 for the forms. Scotland

Michael Owen: why I love the madness and exhilaration of transfer deadline day
It can be mad, exhilarating - and not always glamorous - but last-minute scramble is an essential part of football

There are those who see transfer deadline day as a bit of circus. Full of hype, manufactured drama and creating an unseemly spectacle as players are herded around like cattle.
Critics should get off their pedestal, take a step back and enjoy it for what it is – one of the most entertaining and theatrical dates in our football calendar. The manner in which supporters have become so engaged in the transfer process is healthy for the sport.
Only our passion for football can prompt us to spend a Friday night sitting on the sofa diligently watching a yellow ticker go across our television set, or constantly update our Twitter feed to see whether that much coveted striker has finally signed on loan (usually with a view to a permanent deal).
Yes it is a bit irrational and you can ask yourself why you have spent hours staring at your screen when, in essence, not a lot has happened, but we’re all football fans and we all love digesting every bit of gossip that comes our way.
I have sat in the pubs with friends watching the deadline day coverage as if we were enjoying the match itself and it will be same across the country as we debate the best deals, arguing as to whether each club has bought the right player.

Moyes: We won't sign anyone else
31 Jan 2014
Deadline day condenses months of speculation into a few hours and the media coverage is increasingly like a General Election, reporters dispatched across the country awaiting news of a possible medical in the way we used to wait for the first exit polls from the constituencies.
Personally, I love it and I am as absorbed as anyone by the hype. If it is ‘manufactured’ for a TV audience it is entirely by accident and due to the clubs themselves who, for their own reasons, decide to wait until the last minute of the last day to pursue their targets. If the clubs conducted their business in a less frenzied way we could all congratulate them on their organisation but it would not be so much fun.
The nature of sport being as it is, it wouldn’t matter if the transfer window was open for one month or six, you will end up with a panicky wave of activity in the last few hours.
Tough negotiators will always take it to the brink, playing on the desperation of the buying or selling club. You can imagine the battle of egos between chief executives trying to get that extra few million from their rival.
Caught in the middle are the players, most of whom involved in Friday’s transfers will have spent the day in a car, in some cases trying to avoid being spotted by a camera.
I speak from experience. I enjoyed the full glamour of deadline day when I signed for Stoke in September 2012.
It was approaching 4pm, the window about to close, and I was sitting in my car at a service station on the M6, waiting for the call to head to the training ground to complete the formalities of a free transfer.
Technically, I could have joined a club at any time because I was not under contract but the squad submissions needed to be sent to the Premier League so I was caught up in the mania.
I could not drive into the city for fear of being spotted, knowing if the deal did not go ahead people would be looking at me in the same way as Peter Odemwingie with his aborted move to Queens Park Rangers.
Fortunately, the call was made and the deal went through, but this is how Friday would have been for many footballers, hanging around, trying to maintain a veil of secrecy until such time the contracts can be signed.
I had a similar but not quite so time-sensitive experience seven years earlier when I moved to Newcastle from Real Madrid. This time the now infamous helicopter came into play as I headed to St James’ Park 24 hours before the transfer window closed.
As someone who did not make too many transfers during his career, I can’t say I particularly embraced the uncertainty of moving from one club to another. For a player, there can be no more anxious time as you have an eye on the clock and you are staring at your phone waiting for that significant call. For other players who are desperate to get away for a fresh challenge, the countdown to January may begin early in the season.
I don’t agree with the complaints about the timing of the transfer windows and believe it is essential for the integrity of the league to keep one in midseason.
The wealthiest clubs will always be in a position to target the best players, but ensuring they have a limited time to do so is fair to everyone.
You can’t go back to a situation where clubs have until March to secure deals, especially now we’re in an era where bids of £50 million have become common. The more vulnerable clubs would simply live in fear of having their most prized assets being lured away for virtually the whole season, often when they are at their most vulnerable. The old system could be too easily exploited.
Equally, it is interesting how most of the transfer activity in January is at the lower end of the division, those in the most trouble taking the opportunity to correct the flaws in their squad and give themselves a realistic chance of survival.
Everyone is abiding by the same rules, aware of when they can buy and how long they have to make it happen. It is as fair as it can be.
That so many deals make it to the 11th hour is a peculiarity of football. No doubt the most qualified business minds shake their head in incredulity at the madness of it all. Maybe the transfer system does defy logic, but it makes for brilliant television twice a season.
