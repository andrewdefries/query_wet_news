M&S kitted out to fight new wave of rivals
Marks & Spencer chief Marc Bolland tells Graham Ruddick how he plans to transform the high street business into an "international multi–channel" retailer.

With Marks & Spencer profits down 10pc and like–for–like clothing sales 4.3pc lower, is this a sign that the retailer's once–dominant grip on the British clothing market is well and truly over? Britain may have spent most of 2012 in recession but, on the same day M&S reported a sharp decline, Primark said its sales rose 15pc. Primark's annual revenues have now cleared £3.5bn for the first time, more than double what they were five years ago. The rise of Primark and its low–cost clothing illustrates the changing face of British high streets and the fierce competition M&S faces, particularly in womenswear. Walk down Oxford Street in London and challengers to M&S are everywhere, from traditional rivals such as Next, Debenhams and John Lewis, to the strengthening cheap and cheerful competitors such as Primark and the foreign retailers which have arrived over the past decade, such as H&M, Uniqlo and the impressive Zara, financed by Inditex, the biggest clothing retailer in the world. Consumers now have more options than ever, and they are not afraid to take them. In the face of such competition and global economic uncertainty, M&S clothing – particularly in womenswear – has left consumers underwhelmed and often bemoaning its quality. Related Articles

M&S 'real women ads have no wobbly bits'

In 2012, these complaints – no doubt exacerbated by the range of alternatives on the high street – have been compounded by stock management mistakes, which left the company short of its most popular items. However, M&S chief executive Marc Bolland is fighting back. In the past three months, the retailer has been "better aligning" its buying and marketing team. So, for example, M&S bought five times more of the products it has advertised and "bought deeper into trends". This has led to the sale of 44,000 military–style coats. With a longer–term perspective, Mr Bolland has overhauled the management of general merchandise. John Dixon has moved from head of food to lead general merchandise, replacing Asos–bound Kate Bostock, while the former boss of Debenhams and Jaeger, Belinda Earl, has been hired as M&S's first style director. To bring more of a cutting edge to womenswear, Mr Bolland has turned to lingerie. He has promoted M&S's director of lingerie and beauty, Frances Russell, to director of womenswear and hired the chief creative officer of Victoria's Secret, the luxury lingerie brand, as her replacement. These changes are designed to revitalise M&S's clothing, with results emerging in time for the autumn/winter season this time next year. Mr Bolland said the priorities for the new team are "style, trends, and best–inclass quality" as well as value, "real choice, not proliferation", and an "instore and online shopping experience". He added: "We are on trend but we are not suddenly going to be a trendy brand. We are not fast fashion but we follow fashion trends. This is about finding the right styles and bringing them out with confidence."
As well as fighting high street rivals today, Mr Bolland is also setting up the company to battle against the rivals of tomorrow. Slowly, he is turning M&S from a traditional high street business into what he calls an "international multichannel" retailer. With the help of Laura Wade–Gery, a big–name recruit from Tesco last year who has become executive director for multi–channel e–commerce, M&S is investing in cutting–edge technology that it hopes will position it as a leading internet, smartphone and tablet retailer. It has spent £2.4bn on its online offering, an investment that includes a new distribution centre in Castle Donington, new websites and applications and in–store technology such as iPads for customer assistants. According to Mr Bolland, this is already making an impact. Its new store at Cheshire Oaks in the North West, which is equipped with all the latest technology, is performing 30pc ahead of expectations. Perhaps more startling, however, is that over a third of dresses and one–in–five suits are now bought online. Britain's affection for the business founded in the 19th century in Leeds appears to be intact. M&S and Bolland are now working hard to turn this support into 21st century sales.

Mini completes first ever succesful backflip
Stunt driver Guerlain Chicherit undertakes the daredevil challenge in the ski resort of Tignes in the French Alps. 1:14PM GMT 18 Feb 2013
Comments
Set amongst the backdrop of the beautiful snowy mountains in Tignes, France, Chicherit drove up a static ramp and launched his Mini Countryman at just the right speed to allow him to fully rotate his vehicle before landing on a bank of snow. According Mini it was the first successful completion of such a stunt. A team from Redbull attempted a similar feat in 2008 but failed to make a clean landing. Mini said the jump was unassisted. Previous attempts at a backflip in a car have used special enhanced ramps to boost the vehicle's rotational movement. Related Articles
