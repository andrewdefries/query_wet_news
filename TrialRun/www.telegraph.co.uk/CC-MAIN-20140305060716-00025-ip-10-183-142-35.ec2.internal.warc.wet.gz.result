Minister 'misleads' over fracking
Energy Minister John Hayes has been accused of misrepresenting a Durham University study after he claimed it concluded fracking could not contaminate drinking water.

The Government recently gave the go ahead for companies to use the controversial drilling technique to extract shale gas around Britain. But communities fear fracking, that blasts liquid into rocks to force the gas out, will lead to dangerous gases also leaking into the water table. In an interview on Radio 5 Live, Mr Hayes, said “the idea that that water will get into the main water table has been categorically denied”. “The claim that the water used in fracking gets into the aquifer was categorically refuted by the Durham University study earlier this year,” he said. However Prof Richard Davies, who led the study, said the water table can be contaminated if the drilling is too close to the water table. Related Articles

"We have not proved it could not happen, what we have shown is the safety distance,” he said. The study published in the journal Marine and Petroleum Geology found the chance of a fracture extending more than 600 metres upwards, so that gas could travel upwards into the aquifer, was exceptionally low. Prof Davis therefore said the safety limit should be around double that, at around 1.2km. "Like anything there are safety limits and if you play rough and ready there could be an incident,” he added. It is estimated there could be trillions of barrels of shale gas under the UK. The most easy to access, where companies hope to drill next year, is around Blackpool although they have also registered interest in sites across Scotland, the home counties and south Wales. Prof Davies also pointed out that most leaks are from wells rather than fractures in the earth. "When things have gone wrong it is usually due to poor cementing," he said. "Fracking is a bit of a distraction." Vanessa Vine of BIFF! (Britain & Ireland Frack Free) said the minister was failing to give all the details. "Mr Hayes is giving selective information specific to Lancashire boreholes of 5,000ft. In Balcombe, West Sussex, where the bore is half a mile from the River Ouse and three quarters of a mile from the Ardingly reservoir, Cuadrilla intend to drill at around half that depth, which would bring acid, biocides, radioactive isotopes etc., back to within 720ft of the surface and in close proximity to the aquifers. Water finds water. "Such selective omissions by Ministers make it manifestly clear that such authorities are not fit to regulate this dangerous industry."
Andrew West of Frack Off agreed that the minister was misleading. He said communities are at risk both from leaks and shale gas reservoirs that are closer to aquifers. A spokesman for the Deparment for Energy and Climate Change insisted Mr Hayes was referring to the risk in the Lancashire shale, which is well below the aquifer. "The study shows the probabilities of ‘rogue' fractures, induced in fracking operations for shale gas extraction, extending beyond 0.6 kilometres from the injection source is exceptionally low. The probability of fractures extending beyond 350 metres was found to be one per cent," he said. "With this in mind we can be confident that the fractures in Lancashire will not propagate into the aquifer."

David Cameron risking 'livelihood and safety' by questioning EU membership, Nick Clegg says David Cameron is risking the "livelihood and safety" of millions of British people by raising questions over the UK's European Union membership, Nick Clegg has said. Mr Cameron is preparing to give a major speech about Britain's future in Europe, which could pave the way for a referendum on EU membership.

Comments
The Deputy Prime Minister warned that "playing politics" with the issue could jeopardise British jobs and hamper international police operations. "When you have one in 10 jobs in this country, 3 million people, whose jobs are dependent on our position as a leading member of the world's biggest borderless single market, you play with that status at your peril – these are jobs at stake, livelihoods," Mr Clegg told reporters at Westminster. Mr Cameron is preparing to give a major speech about Britain's future in Europe, which could pave the way for a referendum on EU membership. Some Conservatives say Britain should leave if other members do not agree to much looser ties. However, Mr Clegg said EU membership also had critical implications for law enforcement and public safety. "You are dealing with the safety of our communities and our families," he added.

"Speak to any police officer and they will tell you there is no way you can keep people safe from cross border crime, money laundering, child trafficking, unless you work together with other people."
There is growing international resistance to the prospect of a British exit from the Union, with the US having publicly warned this week against such a move. On Wednesday, Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary responsible for European affairs, said London's "voice" within the EU was "critical to the United States". Germany yesterday also voiced its concern when a senior ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel accused Britain of trying to "blackmail" the rest of Europe and suggested that a referendum could isolate the UK. "You cannot create a political future if you are blackmailing other states. That will not help Britain. It needs a Europe that is stable. It needs markets that are functioning," said Gunther Kirchbaum, the chair of Germany's European affairs committee. The Daily Telegraph understands that Chancellor Merkel has told Mr Cameron that she has no intention of opening an EU treaty negotiation in order to provide a new settlement that can be put to a referendum in Britain. The German leader is currently convinced that the existing Lisbon Treaty gives the EU enough powers to tackle the eurozone crisis and that change will not be needed until well after the next general election. She has also been clear in her view, say sources, that if treaty change is needed at some point in the future, towards the end of the decade, then Germany will block any attempt by Britain to cherry pick or repatriate powers from the EU. José Manuel Barroso, European Commission President, yesterday said Britain should "avoid" turning inwards at a moment when British support was needed within the EU. "We believe it is very much in the interests of the EU to have Britain at the centre of the European project," he said. "I favour, a position where we have a very active Britain working with its partners in the EU, because we also need an open Europe to the world. We cannot in times of crisis close ourselves to the world. We have a very important global agenda to pursue including trade where Britain is traditionally a strong supporter of open trade."
Downing Street yesterday responded to the US warning over Europe by insisting that Mr Cameron had received private assurances from Barack Obama that the US backed his EU policy. No 10 insisted that Mr Obama was "supportive" of Mr Cameron's approach to the European Union during a telephone conversation in December. Mr Cameron is due to give his Europe speech in the Netherlands. Mr Clegg, a fluent Dutch speaker, mocked the Prime Minister over his European policy, joking that he should attend the event "to translate it from double Dutch into ordinary Dutch."

Oradour-sur-Glane, France: moments of Nazi massacre frozen in time
Anthony Peregrine finds a visit to Oradour-sur-Glane a confronting experience, just as the German president did earlier this week. The abandoned town of Oradour-sur-Glane Photo: EPA	By Anthony Peregrine

Comments
It is inconceivable that any images of Oradour-sur-Glane – the French village wiped out by the Waffen SS in June 1944 – could be anything other than moving. But those from Wednesday this week were notably significant. German President Joachim Gauck – the first German leader to visit the scene of the Nazis’ worst atrocity in western Europe – stood hand in hand with French President François Hollande in the roofless village church where 240 women and 205 children were massacred. They listened as Robert Hébras – one of only six people to survive the slaughter, one of two still alive – explained how the womenfolk and young had been variously asphyxiated, machine-gunned and burnt alive. They certainly saw the flattened pushchair, left in place where it had been found before the altar. Then they took 88-year-old Hébras by the shoulder and hand, turned and walked away, with undertakers’ solemnity. As they made clear beforehand, the present-day families of the victims weren’t looking for apologies – just the recognition and regret that President Gauck brought with him. Afterwards, the other living survivor, Jean-Marcel Darthout, said: “I’ve only got one thing to say – bravo, thank you, and at last.”
Oradour had been waiting for this moment, frozen in time for 69 years. After the war, it was decided neither to demolish nor rebuild the village 15 miles north west of Limoges. It was to be left as it was after a unit of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich roared through, killing and torching. Seven decades on, the jagged ruins still cry the desperation of a little rural spot violated beyond belief. Here, deep in the Limousin countryside of amenable hills, lakes, forests and pastures full of russet cattle, a peaceful community lived, farmed, went fishing, drank in 12 cafés and were as unaffected by the war as a village could be.

Then, at two o’clock on the warm Saturday afternoon of June 10 1944, the war showed up with scarcely believable savagery; 642 villagers were massacred. Since 1999, a stunningly effective Centre de la Mémoire has been trying to explain how things came to this. Set back from the devastated village, it slots into a warp in the landscape, its glass reflecting surrounding bucolic tranquillity, the peace ruptured by slashes of steel plate tearing the air at the entry. Within, brilliantly presented films, testimonials, exhibits and texts interweave Oradour’s story with that of Nazism and the war in general. The three collided in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. Based in south-west France, the elite Das Reich division was among German forces ordered north to Normandy. En route, they were to clear up Resistance forces who, pumped up by the landings, were growing increasingly audacious. The Das Reich troops had recently arrived in France from the Eastern Front – and had brought Eastern Front methods with them. On June 9, they hanged 99 Resistants from buildings in Tulle (coincidentally, François Hollande’s electoral fief). Similar exactions were perpetrated in nearby towns and villages. Then, on June 10, 200 of them encircled Oradour. No one yet knows why this unassuming settlement was chosen for the ultimate horror. Theories that it was in reprisal for the shooting of a popular SS officer, or that the Nazis were fearful for gold they’d looted in Russia, remain controversial. The most likely explanation is that Das Reich was keen to make an example of a French community – and Oradour was the next one along. In any event, most historians agree that this was a premeditated action, rather than in-the-heat-of-battle fury. Oradour villagers were rounded up to the Champ de Foire main square, convinced they were going to be subject to a simple ID check. The men were separated from women and children, and taken to six barns. “We were laughing,” says survivor Darthout. “We weren’t afraid. We were thinking of the next day’s soccer match.” Then they were machine-gunned, and the masses of bodies – many still alive – were set alight. Darthout, and four others, survived by covering themselves with the corpses of their neighbours. Meanwhile, women and children were herded into the church, into which the Germans threw incendiary grenades. Only one woman survived. The attackers then fired the entire village. Oradour now stands as it did when the Nazi blaze went out. It looks appallingly like a 20th-century Pompeii. Crumbling façades, their windows like sightless eyes, front wrecked shops and homes – rendered unbearably poignant by the rusting detail. In houses there are fire-twisted lamps, sewing machines and pans. Pipes and wires still hang, ruptured, ripped and useless. Tram tracks run everywhere and, now, nowhere. The car from which the village mayor was hauled and shot slumps in the road. The butcher’s shop retains more pans, scales and meathooks. And in the church there is that pushchair. It is the accumulation of both destruction and survivals of very ordinary existence that smacks the senses. There are streets full of both. Stop, listen and you may hear the echoes of life. Here was a functioning village like thousands of others – with its butchers, cobblers and bakery (see the plaques) – and it was obliterated. Signs, all the more effective for being Fifties originals, point out spots where killings happened. They also bid, a bit superfluously, “Silence!” and “Remember!” Some people have likened contemporary Oradour to a film set, but it would only look like that if you arrived quite ignorant of the story. The site is intolerably real, and the feelings generated go beyond words. Though, of course, Oradour still generates words by the million. The involvement of Alsacien soldiers enrolled in the German Army against their wishes – the Malgré Nous – continues to cause ill feeling within France. Meanwhile, German authorities are considering reopening cases against six surviving ex-SS men allegedly present at Oradour. The release of Stasi files brought to the fore fresh evidence against them. And there rumbles on a revisionist claim that Resistance men had their share of the blame for the atrocity. But that’s what you learn afterwards. While there, you stagger from the site, stunned. The modern little town of Oradour – built next door in a neat, anonymous Fifties manner – will provide you with coffee or lunch. You may, though, need to get farther away. So head north for the Monts de Blond hills. The tiny road snakes up densely wooded slopes, past dark lagoons and through hamlets alive with flowers. By the time you arrive in Mortemart, a lovely, Cotswold-style village, your spirits may be stilled. Against the odds, there is some good in the world. Read more:
