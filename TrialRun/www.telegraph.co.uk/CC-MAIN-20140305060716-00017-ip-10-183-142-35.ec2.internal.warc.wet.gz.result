Thailand hunts for killer tiger Terrified Thai villagers were on Tuesday hunting a tiger suspected of killing two people in less than a week after a woman was mauled to death in a rubber plantation near the site of an earlier attack. Fewer than 300 tigers remain in the wild in Thailand, according to wildlife group WWF Photo: Fr dy Mercay/WWF/PA	9:47AM GMT 04 Dec 2012
Comments
Pranee Mahasuk, 43, was slashed on the face and back in front of her husband as the pair tapped rubber shortly before midnight on Monday, said Urupong Chanakul, deputy chief of Betong district in Thailand's southern Yala province.
He said the woman's husband had tried to help her by shooting at the big cat, but had been forced to climb a tree for safety.
"He spent the whole night up the tree. He said the tiger came back to eat his wife after he shot at it, so he fired at it again and it ran off," Urupong told AFP.
Last week the footprints of an adult and young tiger were seen near where 44-year-old Hyaya Seng was found headless with deep scratches across his body at another plantation in Yala near the border with Malaysia.
"It is likely that the same tiger killed the victim last week," Urupong said, adding the latest incident was 10 kilometres (six miles) away from the previous one.

He said authorities and about 200 villagers had launched a search for the tiger, adding that the aim was to push the creature further into the remote mountainous border area rather than kill it.
Thailand, a hub of international wildlife smuggling, is one of just 13 countries hosting fragile tiger populations. Fewer than 300 tigers remain in the wild in Thailand, according to wildlife group WWF.

Simon Cowell calls Michael Gove 'stupid’ in war of words over learning
X Factor creator Simon Cowell hits back at Education Secretary Michael Gove amid growing row over school qualifications

Simon Cowell, the creator of The X Factor television talent show, has accused Michael Gove of being “stupid” and “crazy” amid a growing row between the pair over school qualifications.
The Education Secretary last month described Cowell as “stupid and irresponsible” for suggesting that young people do not need to bother with education and can instead rely on getting “lucky”.
The media mogul had jokingly claimed in an interview that youngsters did not need to get good results at school.
“I didn’t work hard when I was at school,” Cowell said. “I left at 16 and didn’t have any qualifications. I was useless. The secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky.”
Speaking to LBC radio, Cowell has now hit back, claiming that Mr Gove “didn’t want” to hear his side of the story.

“He didn’t bother to call, he didn’t want to hear my side of the story and, stupidly, he didn’t see the positive side of what I was trying to say,” Cowell said in the interview, which will be broadcast in full on Boxing Day. “Not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications, or maybe they just don’t have that kind of brain.
“But that doesn’t mean that they should be ruled out, or not given a chance, because I don’t run a company where I hire people based on their qualifications, or have they gone to university.
“We hire people from the age of 16 up, 17, whatever it is, who want to work hard and want to make a career for themselves.
“So, if anything, I thought he was irresponsible, because he was basically saying, if you’re not qualified we’re not going to back you, and it’s like, how crazy are you for saying that?”
Cowell attended Dover College, a private school in Kent, before going on to Windsor Technical College.
After his original comments, Mr Gove accused the celebrity of “rubbishing” education.
“Teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning, hard work and discipline,” Mr Gove said. “Simon Cowell’s comments undermine their efforts.
“The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky. For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school. Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it.”
A spokesman for Mr Gove said: “Michael was criticising Cowell’s view that 'the secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky’. Obviously qualifications aren’t everything, but we think celebrities should encourage kids to work hard at school and achieve as much as they can. Not everyone gets lucky like Simon Cowell.”

Ryanair’s Michael O'Leary fields questions - and abuse - on Twitter
Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s outspoken chief executive, has taken control of the airline’s Twitter account to answer questions from travellers. Michael O'Leary has endured the toughest year of his career at Ryanair By Oliver Smith
5:54PM BST 21 Oct 2013
Follow Comments
In what must be considered a brave move considering the no-frills airline’s divisive reputation, and the barrage of criticism British Gas faced with its #askBG campaign last week, travellers were provided with a one-hour window to challenge the airline boss over issues such as poor customer service and extortionate fees. Following a few early hiccups – he initially forgot to use the designated hashtag #grillMOL in his early replies – Mr O’Leary fielded dozens of questions for over an hour while apparently dressed as a leprechaun. The questions ranged from the amusing – “Is it true that you intend to remove at least one engine from all your aircraft to save fuel?” - to the offensive - “Were you born an a******* or has it progressed throughout your life?” – while many quizzed him on perennial issues such as charging passengers who forget to print their boarding passes, the possibility of a fee to use the on-board toilet, and plans to launch transatlantic flights.

Users gave Mr O’Leary credit for going on Twitter, and supplying what were candid answers, but many will likely be left disappointed by his failure to address a number of issues. For example, questions about the “manipulative” travel insurance opt-outs that fliers must dodge when booking a flight and “unjustified” charges – such as its £2.50 per person EU Regulation 261 levy (introduced to cover compensation payments for delayed flights) – were ignored. He was also accused of sexism after he praised one woman’s profile picture with the comment: “Nice pic. Phwoaaarr!”
Twitter: Donna Parsons - Will you consider adding some swimsuit clad men to your profile pic @Ryanair ?#grillMOL #letshavesomeequality
Twitter: Ryanair - @don_the_don Sadly d ladies are too smart to buy swimsuit clad men so wouldn't raise any money for charity #GrillMOL
He did find time to offer the following responses: Q: Do you want Boris Island to become a reality? Would you back his campaign? A. No. Crazy plan. London needs 3 more runways, 1 each at Heathrow, Gatwick & Stansted. Q. Do you overstate flight durations so you can claim a better early/on-time records? A. No. All flight durations are set by flight times from previous season. We don't puff flight times Q: Can you explain the justification for charging 40GBP to reprint a boarding card? A: Cos we want u to print it off before arriving at airport. Wud u show up w'out passport? Q: why do you not fly to Russia or Ukraine and any plans to do so? Russian market is huge A: Cos can only fly there from Ireland as outside EU, and Irish market tiny #GrillMOL Q: Do you have a message for the ejits in Granada who wouldn't cross your palm with dosh to keep flying to the great city? A: Adios Q: any chance of introducing #frequentflier benefits in near future? A: Coming shortly to a favourite airline near you Q: If you are serious about social media why not encourage us to use it for customer contact - not premium rate phone no's A: Working on it. Customer service already replies online Q: Will fares out of Dublin come down when the depature tax is abolished? What new routes out of Dublin are you planning this winter? A: Yes, announcements coming Q: Do your planes HAVE to play that Dukes of Hazard-inspired jingle whenever they land on time?”
A: Looking at varying the on time arrival music. Better always to hear the fanfare than arrive late Q: How can you justify the cattle mart that is boarding a Ryanair flight in Budapest? A: Budapest not our best preboarding area, but we working with airport to try to improve it. Watch this space. Twitter: Andrew Riddell - @Ryanair #GrillMOL When are you considering charging fat people more? Just so I know when to diet for!
Twitter: Ryanair - @Ridler83 Have always opposed charging fat people more, and am also against giving skinny discounts. We welcome all #GrillMOL
He also backtracked on a previous statement that overweight fliers should be charged more (“Have always opposed charging fat people more, and am also against giving skinny discounts”), and said Ryanair had no plans to introduce allocated seating, as low-cost rival EasyJet recently has, and said mobile boarding passes were being developed. Twitter: David Simpson - @Ryanair #GrillMOL Any chance of complete seat assignments any time soon?
Twitter: Ryanair - @David_P_Simpson Worried that allocated seating will delay our industry leading punctuality. Wud u prefer delays? #GrillMOL
The stunt was the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at improving Ryanair’s reputation regarding customer service. Last week it placed a “suggestion form” on its website, encouraging fliers to tell it what changes they want to see. Mr O’Leary added a note of explanation. “Over the past 29 years Ryanair has grown from carrying 200,000 to over 81 million customers annually,” he says. “But we want to keep improving our services, which is where you can help me. Please send me your suggestions as to how Ryanair can further improve our industry leading customer service. All suggestions will be gratefully acknowledged by me. I’m looking forward to hearing from you.”
He signed off playfully as “Da Boss” – alongside a smiley face emoticon. It has also recently hired a new marketing manager, made its app free to download, and announced plans to redesign its website. Those changes came after Mr O’Leary told shareholders it should scrap its “macho” image and eliminate things that “unnecessarily p*** people off”. The airline is regularly criticised for being slow to respond to customer complaints and for forcing passengers to opt-out of various offers – for extras such as car hire and travel insurance – when booking a flight. A study by Telegraph Travel in July found that around 20 clicks of a mouse are required to get to the payment screen when booking with Ryanair – more than any other major carrier. It has also been denounced for charging passengers high fees for hold luggage and in-flight food and drink, and huge amounts – up to £70 per person – if they forget to print their own boarding pass or if their hand luggage is overweight. Traditionally, Mr O’Leary has been notoriously dismissive of customers who complain about the airline. Last year he described a British woman who was charged €300 (£236) after she forgot to print out five boarding passes on a flight from Alicante to Bristol as an “idiot”. His other notable quotes include: “People say the customer is always right, but you know what - they're not. Sometimes they are wrong and they need to be told so” and “You're not getting a refund so **** off. We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?”
