Pakistani trio Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif face jail as cricket corruption is exposed
Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir could face jail terms of up to seven years after being convicted of spot-fixing at a trial that laid bare a culture of corruption at the heart of international cricket.

Akmal and Riaz may face inquest

9:00AM GMT 02 Nov 2011
Follow The convictions deal a huge blow to the reputation of the game and the trial could lead to further damaging revelations. The International Cricket Council may launch an investigation into corruption allegations heard in court against two other members of the Pakistan touring squad, Kamran Akmal and Wahab Riaz. Following the four-week trial at Southwark Crown Court, Butt and Asif were each found guilty of conspiracy to accept corrupt payments and conspiracy to cheat, offences that carry a maximum jail term of seven years. Amir, 19, pleaded guilty to the same offences at a pre-trial hearing two weeks before the case began, a fact not revealed to the jury until they had returned verdicts on his senior colleagues on Tuesday afternoon after more than 17 hours of deliberation. At the pre-trial hearing Ben Emerson, QC representing Amir, said the player had been subject to “extreme pressure” from senior colleagues: “Amir wants to make it clear he wants to take full responsibility for what he did by deliberately bowling two no balls. "This vulnerable 18-year-old boy, as he was then, was subjected to extreme pressure from those upon whom he should have been able to rely. He recognised the damage he has caused Pakistan cricket and he wants to do his best to put this right.” Related Articles

Amir will face questions about his guilty plea from trial judge Mr Justice Cooke in court on Wednesday and will be sentenced alongside Butt and Asif on Thursday. The convictions mean the trio become the first sportsmen convicted for on-field corruption in a UK court since the 1960s, when three footballers, including two from Sheffield Wednesday, were jailed for throwing matches. A dramatic day in court began with news that Butt’s wife, Gul, had given birth to his second child, a son, at home in Lahore. News reached Butt just an hour before he stood in the dock to hear the verdicts. Butt’s father, Zulfiqar, said his son would fight the convictions. “It is a mixed day for us. We are sad and shocked [at the verdict handed out to Butt], but we are also happy at the birth of the son,” he said. “My son is innocent of these charges and we will fight to the end.” The court heard that all three players were part of a conspiracy to bowl no-balls during the Lord’s Test against England last year, originally revealed by the News of the World. Undercover journalist Mazher Mahmood filmed Butt’s agent Mazhar Majeed, described in court as a conspirator, accepting £140,000 to ensure the no-balls were delivered. The case represents a victory from beyond the grave for the newspaper, which was closed earlier this year following the phone-hacking scandal. Butt, Asif and Amir were banned earlier this year by the ICC for terms of between five and 10 years, and the governing body will now consider launching a fresh investigation into Akmal and Riaz. Both players were linked in court to betting scams allegedly organised by Majeed. Akmal’s name also came up in correspondence between Majeed and his contacts around the world in evidence collated by police from the early stages of Pakistan’s fateful tour of England. Prosecuting counsel Aftab Jafferjee QC said in court that Akmal had led a “charmed life” to escape investigation. He also said the roles of Riaz and Akmal “raise deep, deep suspicions”. Akmal has not played for Pakistan since the World Cup although Riaz is in the squad currently playing in Abu Dhabi against Sri Lanka. Pakistan play England in the United Arab Emirates in January, with the sides set to contest three Tests, four one-day internationals and three Twenty20s. Detective Superintendent Matthew Horne, who led the investigation for the Metropolitan Police, said he would co-operate with any ICC investigation and was willing to share evidence that until now has been withheld.“We have been in constant co-operation with the ICC throughout and we will offer them any assistance should they ask for it,” he said. The ICC chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, said he hoped the convictions would act as a deterrent and said all allegations of corruption would be investigated. “I would reiterate that the ICC has a zero-tolerance attitude towards corruption and that we will use everything within our power to ensure that any suggestion of corrupt activity within our game is comprehensively investigated and, where appropriate, robustly prosecuted,” he said.

Calls for internet game Billy Suicide to be removed Billy Suicide, an internet game where players have to keep a depressed man from killing himself has been criticised by campaigners amid fears it could drive young, vulnerable people to suicide. 8:08AM GMT 13 Nov 2008
Comments
Online users playing the free game have to help a male character throughout his day by giving him fixes of caffeine, alcohol and antidepressants. The mental and financial health levels of the man can also be maintained by watching TV, internet porn and listening to heavy metal music.If Billy's 'mental health' levels fall below a certain level the character commits suicide in a number of ways - from hanging to shooting himself in the head.Now there have been calls to remove the game, after mother-of-one Lisa Dalton, 25, became the 24th suicide victim in the Welsh town of Bridgend.A spokesperson for Samaritans, said: "Suicide is not a light-hearted subject and is should always be taken seriously."Certain types of suicide portrayal can act as a catalyst to influence the behaviour of people who are already vulnerable, particularly young people, and result in an overall increase in suicide and/ or an increase in uses of particular methods."Our vision is that fewer people die by suicide and anyone who in any way initiates that they are experiencing a high level of emotional distress or suicidal feelings should be taken seriously and given vital support."Paul Kelly, internet safety campaigner for the charity PAPYRUS -(Prevention of Young Suicide) said: "This game is completely irresponsible and the people who made the game should realise the damage that it can incur in the terms of somebody taking their own life."We would urge them to think twice about what they are doing because we have seen clear cases where vulnerable young people can be influenced by online content."I would guess the people who put this game online don't realise the possible consequences of their actions - it's extremely concerning."

Webchat: Put your career questions on how to get promoted to leading entrepreneur Dessi Bell and business woman Heather Jackson
After five years of financial crisis, the jobs market is fiendishly competitive and employers are reluctant to offer pay rises and give promotions. Two members of the Telegraph's Wonder Women business panel, Dessi Bell and Heather Jackson, answer your questions on how to get ahead, whether it's a career change, a promotion or pay rise. Careers advice: Women in business

Women are notoriously bad at negotiating pay rises or putting themselves forward for promotion. In this tough economic climate, employers are more reluctant than ever to award increases – but opportunities are still there. It's knowing how to 'play the game' and demonstrate that you are a capable worker worthy of a reward. Dessi Bell, a former City banker who quit her job to start Zaggora, a fitness sportswear company will join Heather Jackson, who runs The Womens Business Forum, a networking group to answer your questions on how to get ahead at work – despite the uncertain times. Submit your career questions to wonderwomen@telegraph.co.uk
Are you ready for a career change? Are you hoping to switch jobs soon? Or, perhaps you'd like to make the most of your current role – how do you show your boss you're worthy of promotion and what tools do you need to get a pay rise? All the twists and turns of the labour market over the last few years have been observed by both Dessi and Heather, who can give real, hands-on, practical advice on what it's like to be in – and get ahead – business.
