Record book sales over Christmas signal fightback against digital world
The sale of print books over Christmas was the strongest in over three years, signalling a fightback against digital 'ebooks'.

Celebrity titles were particularly popular, helping sales of physical books break through the £75m mark, the strongest weekly performance since Christmas 2009. The week's sales were 20 per cent up on the previous one, and £1.4m higher than the year before. Authors and publishers have hailed the boost in sales as proof there is still room in the crowded market, where the growing popularity of digital ereaders like the Kindle and tablet computers like the iPad have eaten into book sales. It comes after digital fiction sales almost trippled during the first half of 2012 while physical books fell away. Similarly children's books and non-fiction digital titles enjoyed a massive increase in sales. Amazon also reported in Autumn this year that it was now selling more Kindle ebooks than printed books.

Pride and Prejudice: a love story centuries old, but eternally fresh
29 Dec 2012
However, it seems consumers have not totally abandoned old fashioned paper. Jamie Oliver's cookbook 15-Minute Meals was the best-selling book over the Christmas week shifting 140,155 copies in the seven days to December 22. Comic Miranda Hart's biography Is It Just Me?, and Bradley Wiggins's account of his road to Tour de France and Olympic glory were the next best sellers. Antony Beevor, whose books include The Second World War and Stalingrad, told The Guardian that the figures were, tentatively, good news for an industry that is having to compete against the digital age. "This looks to be positive in many ways but the question is, what are the figures for sales of serious fiction," he said. "I would fear they are down quite considerably, and that is probably true of serious books across the board." Shoppers rushing to fill their stockings with last minute presents put Guinness World Records 2013 in fourth place, while Peter Jackson's new cinematic treatment of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit helped sell 72,900 copies and bring it up to fifth place. Yann Martel's Life of Pi was another novel to enjoy a big-screen sales boost. Sales of the Man Booker winner jumped 62 per cent to 39,140 copies sold across all print editions. However, Philip Downer, a books industry consultant, said that it was too early to predict the comeback of the paperback. He pointed to industry data from Nielsen BookScan that shows physical book sales in the UK have declined every year since hitting a peak of £1.8bn in 2007 – the year the final Harry Potter instalment landed in bookshops. In the first 10 months of 2012, printed book sales were down 3.5 per cent year on year in volume terms and 5.5 per cent by value. Retailers reported that tablets were reportedly selling at a rate of one per second in the run-up to Christmas, e-readers such as the Kindle, the Kobo and the Nook were the most popular gifts. Books

2013 predictions - Telegraph writers on the events and stars set to light up the year
Our team of writers reveal what they are looking forward to over the next 12 months and who will be making a name for themselves in 2013

ATHLETICS
Simon Hart - day I'm most looking forward to: Aug 16. World Championships, day 6 The pinnacle of the summer is the World Championships in Moscow, where Olympic heroes Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford can revive memories of ‘Super Saturday’ when they go for gold in the 5,000 metres and long jump during the same evening session. Throw in a possible medal for the British men’s 4x400m relay team and it could be a ‘Fantastic Friday’ in the same stadium where Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe won Olympic golds in 1980.
-----
CRICKET
Derek Pringle - day I'm most looking forward to: July 10. First day of the Ashes This day always possesses a delicious excitement but there will be an extra frisson with it being at Trent Bridge. Apart from its good looks and knowledgeable crowd, the view from the press box is arguably the best in cricket, with the feeling you are right on top of the game. The last time England played Australia there, in 2005, Michael Vaughan’s team won by three wickets in a thrilling match. The opening day often sets the tone for the rest of the series so a good day for England could mean a third successive Ashes win, a feat that has been accomplished only once since the Second World War.
-----
FORMULA ONE
Tom Cary - day I'm most looking forward to: March 17. Australian GP Formula One’s 2013 opening race in Melbourne should be fascinating. After a few years of stagnation in terms of driver movement at the top teams, Lewis Hamilton’s switch from McLaren to Mercedes has shaken things up. Can he make Mercedes competitive? Will he at least get the better of Nico Rosberg? And how will Jenson Button handle the pressure of being de facto team leader at McLaren?
----- HORSE RACING Jim McGrath - day I'm most looking forward to: March 15. Cheltenham Gold Cup day. It will be a changing of the guard in the top chasing ranks in the New Year. With Kauto Star retired, and last year’s Gold Cup winner Synchronised sadly no longer with us, a new generation of stars is set to emerge. Many names have been thrown in the ring but I expected Bobs Worth and Silviniaco Conti to be the two fighting out the finish of Cheltenham’s feature race.
-----
RUGBY UNION
Mick Cleary - day I'm most looking forward to: June 22. First Test between Australia and the Lions The roar as the Lions ran out at the Gabba for the opening Test of the 2001 tour, the last time they were in Australia, has barely died on the Brisbane air 12 years later. The Lions have grown in appeal and stature. But even they agree that it is high time they won a series for the first time in 16 years.
----- GOLF
James Corrigan - day I'm most looking forward to: April 14. Final day of the Masters The Sunday of Augusta rarely fails to entertain. The hope this year is that Rory McIlroy will be in contention and the world will be able to see how far the 23 year-old has come in his rise to world No 1.
-----
BOXING
Gareth A Davies - day I'm most looking forward to: Carl Froch v Mikkel Kessler (TBA) Two warriors meet again. Froch will fight Kessler at a major UK arena probably in April or May, and it will be an immense occasion. Kessler, of course, has the history of losing to Joe Calzaghe, against whom many measure Froch’s achievements. Froch faces a nemesis who beat him on points in 2010 in Denmark, though the Nottingham fighter had gone there on a private jet through the volcanic ash cloud, and with concerns about his son being born. Victory second time around would set Froch apart as Britain’s leading world champion.
-----
FOOTBALL
Henry Winter - day I'm most looking forward to: May 25. Champions League final, Wembley. An occasion when modest maestro Lionel Messi could grace the most famous stadium in the world, or phenomenal showman Cristiano Ronaldo could be back on English soil. It could even bring the effervescent, well-run German clubs to town too. Either way, it will definitely be a centrepiece of the FA’s 150th birthday party, and a polite reminder to a sceptical world of who invented the game, shaped its laws and still tries to be its conscience.
-----
CYCLING
Brendan Gallagher - day I'm most looking forward to: May 11. Stage eight of the Giro d’Itali
If Bradley Wiggins is to have any chance of realising his dream of winning the Giro d’Italia the 34.5 mile time trial between Gabicce Mare and Saltara – stage eight of the race – is key. Wiggins needs to produce the ride of his life on the undulating course and put three minutes into his closest rivals to give him a safety cushion for the summit finishes which litter the final week. A seriously tough day at the office.
-----
TENNIS
Simon Briggs - day I'm most looking forward to: July 7. Wimbledon final It is a predictable one, but it has to be the men’s singles final at Wimbledon. In terms of pure tennis genius, Roger Federer’s comeback against Andy Murray was my high point of 2012. And who is to say that Murray won’t go one better next year? His career stats suggest that grass is his best surface, with a winning ratio of 81 per cent, as opposed to 78 per cent on hard courts and 61 per cent on clay.

Arsenal majority shareholder Stan Kroenke must decide if money or silverware is his passion following takeover talk
Would Stan Kroenke sell his 66.83 per cent stake in Arsenal to the Middle East consortium? Money matters: Stan Kroenke has always said he's in for the long haul Photo: AFP	By Ben Harrington, Mergers and Acquisitions Reporter

American owners of British football clubs have tended to sell out either to make money or avoid financial disaster. Take, for example, Tom Hicks, a specialist private equity investor from Texas, and George Gillett, an entrepreneur who made money from financing deals with junk bonds.
Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool in 2007 from the Moores family.
The Americans looked to emulate the Glazer family’s acquisition of Manchester United and financed a takeover deal of more than £200 million using a vast amount of debt provided by Royal Bank of Scotland.
Once the pair of entrepreneurs failed to refinance the £237.4 million loan from RBS, Hicks and Gillett were forced to sell the club by the bank.
Even the Glazer family, who bought Manchester United in 2005 for £800 million using more than £500 million of loans, have sold some of their shareholding in the club to service the club’s expensive debt pile.

Arsenal must seize chance to avoid falling behind
02 Mar 2013
Last year the Glazers floated Manchester United on the New York Stock Exchange. The listing raised $233 million and some of the proceeds were used for debt repayments.
Kroenke, though, does not appear to be in the same financial position as Hicks, Gillett and the Glazers. This is because he has just bought equity – City parlance for shares – in Arsenal. Unless he has pledged his shares to a bank as collateral for loans, Kroenke will not be under immediate pressure to sell from lenders.
So, Kroenke’s decision to sell his Arsenal shareholding boils down to whether he is purely a financial investor interested in a great return on his original investment, or whether he wants to be a long-term owner willing to pour millions of his own money into a British football team just to see them pick up a Champions League trophy.
Kroenke certainly could do that if he wanted to. According to Forbes magazine, his net worth was estimated to be $4bn in 2012.
However, Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith, who sold her Arsenal stake to Kroenke in 2011, accused him of “having no passion” for Arsenal, suggesting he is just a financial investor.

Sacked caddie Steve Williams vents fury at Tiger Woods
Tiger Woods provoked a furious reaction from Steve Williams on Wednesday night after sacking his caddie despite more than 12 years of loyal service. 6:39PM BST 21 Jul 2011
Comments
The New Zealander claimed to be “shocked and disappointed” at the decision, having remained resolutely tight-lipped throughout the sex scandal that engulfed Woods late in 2009. Williams, who had worked with Woods since March 1999, was personally informed by his employer earlier this month, following the AT&T National in Pennsylvania. Together, the pair savoured 13 of Woods’s major championship victories. In an impassioned parting shot on Wednesday night, Williams indicated that his loyalty had been betrayed. “I am no longer caddying for Tiger after he informed me he needed to make a change,” the 47 year-old said. “After 13 years of loyal service, needless to say this came as a shock. Given the circumstances of the past 18 months working through Tiger’s coach, a new coach and with it a major swing change, I am very disappointed to end our very successful partnership at this time.” During Woods’s absence from the game, which began when he aggravated knee ligament damage at the Masters, Williams caddied three times for Australia’s Adam Scott. After confirmation of the split, that partnership is to be permanent. Woods, who did not name an immediate replacement for Williams, said: “I want to express my deepest gratitude to Stevie for all his help, but I think it’s time for a change. Stevie is an outstanding caddie and has been instrumental in many of my accomplishments. I wish him great success for the future.” Woods has reached a moment of crisis in his career. He has not contested a tournament since pulling out of the Players Championship in May, when he played the first nine holes in 42, and has fallen to No 20 in the world rankings having once held the top spot for a record 281 weeks. Without a win to his name since Nov 2009, Woods’s dispensing of Williams represents a conscious break with the past. Related Articles

Red Bull help Austria Grand Prix seal a Formula One return in an increasingly packed 2014 schedule
The Austrian Grand Prix will return to Formula One next year in what looks to be an incredibly congested 2014 calendar, which could feature a record 22 races.

A July 6 date was confirmed on Tuesday by Red Bull, the energy drinks company founded by Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, which owns the eponymous Red Bull Formula One team and also the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg in the Styrian Alps.
Mateschitz is a close friend of F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone.
The Red Bull statement simply said: “Dietrich Mateschitz [Red Bull owner] and Bernie Ecclestone have reached agreement to the effect that Formula 1 will come back to Styria next year.”
The Red Bull Ring, formerly known as the A1-Ring, was mooted as a possible venue to fill the gap left vacant in this calendar by the withdrawal of the New Jersey GP.
Although in the end no deal was struck, Mateschitz has made no secret of his desire to see Formula One return to the circuit. The deal will be taken as a sign of his increasing power and influence.

A beautiful venue, its remote location and lack of infrastructure has counted against it, although Red Bull motorsport advisor Helmut Marko was adamant last winter that such concerns were “nonsense”, arguing that it “managed well enough in the 1970s and 1980s”. It hosted its last race in 2003 before Red Bull revamped it.
The July 6 date has already caused plenty of speculation about what the knock-on effect might be on the rest of the calendar.
With the governing body ruling out a clash with Le Mans 24 Hours (June 14-15) from now onwards, there are plenty of races and few spare weekends. Russia and New Jersey are both due to join the calendar, which could make 22 in total if all 19 from this season survive.
Added to the return of in-season testing, and winter testing starting earlier than usual due to the advent of the 1.6-litre turbo engines, 2014 looks like being the longest and busiest season in Formula One history.
