A healthy outcome
Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, must be brave, bold and radical in appointing Sir David Nicholson's successor at the NHS Sir David Nicholson, who has become embroiled in the Mid Staffs care scandal, will step down next year as chief executive of NHS England - and not before time By Telegraph View
7:44PM BST 21 May 2013
Comments
The news that Sir David Nicholson will step down next year as chief executive of NHS England has been greeted with the kind of tributes reserved for a deceased member of the Politburo – rather appropriately, given his prior association with the Communist Party of Great Britain. “Thanks to Sir David’s leadership,” effused Professor Malcolm Grant, the NHS’s chairman, “we are now in as good a position as we could be to take on the challenges that lie ahead.” Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, paid tribute to his “relentless focus on what makes a difference on the NHS front line”.
The friends and family of the patients who died at Stafford Hospital would dispute that assertion, since the trust in question came under Sir David’s purview. There was also something alarming about ministers’ repeated insistence that Sir David must be retained despite that scandal, since he was the only person who could make the NHS’s unwieldy superstructure work efficiently. Our health service must be in a sorry state if it requires such a superman to keep it running.
This newspaper had hoped that Sir David would do the decent thing some time ago – but now that he is to retire, Mr Hunt is faced with the biggest decision of his career. As culture secretary, he had the chance to appoint the head of the BBC Trust (alighting on the familiar figure of Lord Patten). But now, under the NHS’s new, devolved structure, he must approve whichever candidate is selected by Prof Grant and his board to guide the health service through a period of wrenching change. The blueprint here must be the search for the Governor of the Bank of England, which eschewed the obvious and comfortable choices in favour of scouring the world for a top-class figure. Mr Hunt and Prof Grant must be brave, bold and radical – as must their appointee.

The potential prize from fracking is huge
There is bound to be some disruption, but shale gas could cut energy bills and fuel economic recovery Anti-fracking protesters in Balcombe. Ministers say they will only allow fracking if it is safe and fully protects the environment Photo: AFP/Getty Images	By Michael Fallon
7:48PM BST 31 Jul 2013
Comments
North, south, east and west, shale gas represents an exciting new potential resource for Britain that could contribute to our energy security, growth and jobs. We only have to look across the Atlantic to see how it has reinvigorated the US economy: gas prices have halved, cutting costs for industry and consumers, and creating thousands of jobs and billions in new investment. Countries from India to Australia have looked on in envy at this boom – and are now joining in. For its part, this Government is serious about shale. We are encouraging industry to find out how much is recoverable in all parts of the country. Given increasingly volatile international gas and oil prices, and our commitment to helping hard-pressed families with their bills, it would be irresponsible to ignore a new energy source right underneath our feet. There’s nothing new about onshore oil and gas production in Britain. The first well was drilled in Derbyshire in 1919. Since then, more than 2,100 conventional wells have been sunk – including about 200 that have been fracked – at sites ranging from the South of England to the North and Scotland. So we have nearly a century of experience of oil and gas production. And we have also put in place robust regulation to ensure drilling is safe for people and for the environment. We now want to sink exploration wells, to establish the scale of the shale opportunity across the UK. The North has been ahead of the rest of the country in recognising that potential, but the South East, as well as other areas, could also have considerable quantities of gas. Related Articles

Time for Cameron to come clean on carbon
20 Apr 2012
From the days of the Industrial Revolution, the North of England has a strong heritage in powering this country’s growth. As a former MP for Darlington, I appreciate that proud history – but also the modern industries based there in which Britain is world-leading, including cars, chemicals and energy. Last month, we published estimates showing that there is 1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bowland shale, which stretches across 11 northern counties. In the South, we will have a better understanding of the amount of shale when we publish an estimate for the Weald basin, running from Dorset to Kent, in March next year. Claims that exploration involves ruining the countryside are nonsense. A typical shale gas pad is expected to be little larger than a cricket ground. I recently visited a conventional onshore site tucked away in the South Downs National Park, which shows how oil and gas operations can work even in the most sensitive environment. If it is commercially successful, shale gas could provide a great boost for jobs, skills, the business supply chain and innovation, right across the country. But successful extraction will only come if development is carried out in partnership with the communities that host shale operations. First, those communities must be engaged earlier, before planning and permits are applied for. Second, all of us in government and industry need to work much harder to deal with the myths about shale. In fact, today I’m publishing “Shale: 70 Questions and Answers” on the gov.uk website – straightforward factual information. For example, residents understandably want reassurances that their water will not be contaminated. The facts are that around 2.5 million wells have now been fracked worldwide, more than 27,000 of them in the US in 2011. There is no evidence from America of fracking causing any groundwater contamination. Second, the UK has robust construction standards in place for wells – and the Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency have all the powers they need to stop drilling if there is any evidence suggesting a risk of pollution. As with any development, there will of course be some disruption. That’s why local residents will be properly compensated, at the rate of £100,000 for each exploratory well site, and one per cent of revenues at the production stage. That could be as much as £10 million during production – money that can help with household bills, building sports halls or financing regeneration schemes. Oil and gas have been successfully extracted from the North Sea. Both will continue to be a key part of our energy mix for decades to come. The Government believes that shale gas could play a similarly important role. But we will only allow fracking if it is safe and fully protects the environment. We have robust regulation in place. Yet we must also work to engage people with clear, evidence-based information so they have the hard facts to make an informed decision. The potential prize is huge: cheaper bills for everybody, and a reduced dependence on expensively imported gas and oil from the rest of the world. Michael Fallon is MP for Sevenoaks and Minister for Energy and Business

There's no bubble in technology shares
The best mid-cap shares and funds We ask the experts to choose their favourite ways to invest in 'mid-caps', including funds, trusts and a drugs stock. BTG is a mid-cap share in Neptune's portfolio By Emma Wall
3:25PM GMT 11 Jan 2013
Follow Comments
Searching for the perfect balance between risk and reward? Fans of mid-cap equities say the sector offers just that. We asked financial professionals their preferred ways to get exposure to the mid-cap story. Investors should remember, however, that past performance is no indicator of future gains and that the value of investments – in particular share holdings – can go down as well as up. Shares Redrow Neptune mid-cap manager Mark Martin holds this house builder in his fund. He said the stock was well placed to benefit from increasing numbers of first-time buyers helped onto the property ladder by government-backed schemes. "Redrow's chairman and founder is Steve Morgan. Better known in some circles for his role as chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Mr Morgan has been driving an impressive turnaround at Redrow," Mr Martin said. "The house building sector generally has benefited from expanding margins as builders start selling houses built on land bought at the bottom of the cycle. Morgan recently tried to take back control of Redrow with an opportunistic offer for the company. Although the offer has been rebuffed by shareholders, his interest is a clear signal of confidence in the fundamental value of the company."

The company is currently trading at 170p a share and has not paid a dividend since 2008. EnQuest
Another stock in Mr Martin's portfolio is EnQuest, an oil production company focused on the North Sea. "It was formed in April 2010 when Petrofac span off some of its North Sea oilfields and the assets were combined with Lundin Petroleum oilfields," he said. "Senior management have long, successful experience from Petrofac days and the company is benefiting from the Government's desire to incentivise investment in the North Sea."
The company is currently trading at 126p a share and does not pay a dividend. BTG BTG is a health care company developing some promising new drugs – including one for prostate cancer, which was the most successful oral oncology launch ever – and a revolutionary drug for varicose veins. It will also be a beneficiary of a government scheme called the "Patent Box", due to be phased in from April, which will enable companies to apply a lower rate of corporation tax to profits earned from patented inventions. "The Government is incentivising science, and research and development," said Mr Martin. "I think this will be an interesting investment theme for 2013 and beyond."
The company's shares currently trade at 341p but it does not pay a dividend. Funds Old Mutual UK Select Mid Cap This fund has returned 32.4pc over the past 12 months and 49pc over the past three years. "Richard Watts, the manager, is focusing on areas that can grow despite weakness in the wider economy," said Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown. "One current theme is the technology sector, where the fund has large positions in Telecity and Aveva. This fund remains a good choice for exposure to mid-cap stocks." It has a yield of 0.5pc and an annual charge of 1.5pc. Throgmorton Trust John Newlands of Brewin Dolphin tipped this investment trust, which is substantially exposed to mid-cap companies despite being in the industry's UK Smaller Companies sector. "Managed by BlackRock's Mike Prentis and Richard Plackett, the trust stands on a useful discount of around 13pc to net asset value and has produced a total return of more than 90pc over the past three years," Mr Newlands said. It has a yield of 1.48pc and an annual charge of 0.7pc, on top of which there is a performance fee. Standard Life UK Smaller Companies "This is one of my strongest recommendations on a medium or longer-term view. Again it has a significant proportion of its holdings in the FTSE 250, as well as in smaller cap and Aim stocks," said Mr Newlands. "Run by Harry Nimmo, I consider this trust worth buying even though it is trading on a premium." The investment trust has a yield of 1.5pc and an annual charge of 1.6pc. Schroder UK Mid Cap investment trust This Schroder fund is currently trading at a discount, although it has limited gearing and a highly capable manager. It has returned 46pc in the past 12 months, outperforming the top unit trust in the sector. Investors who bought three years ago would have seen returns of 82pc. It is heavily exposed to the industrial companies sector, with house builders and pharmaceuticals featuring in the top 10 holdings. Wealth manager Philippa Gee tipped the fund, but warned about its performance fee – equivalent to 0.1pc for every 1pc rise – so don't use this for a low-cost play. HSBC FTSE 250 Index Tracker For a cheap option, Ms Gee recommended the HSBC FTSE 250 Index Tracker fund, which offers exposure to the entire mid-cap index and has a total annual charge of 0.27pc.

Divorcing partners 'take out anger on each other using the courts'
Divorcing couples are taking out their anger on their former partner using the courts, a watchdog warned, as it said setting realistic objectives could cut legal fees from £50,000 to £10,000.
Nearly one in five of the 7,500 complaints resolved last year were about divorce or family law-related cases Photo: ALAMY	By Wesley Johnson, Home Affairs Correspondent
6:00AM GMT 28 Feb 2013
One unemployed mother was charged £4,000 for photocopying alone by her divorce lawyer while other bills exceeded divorcees' expectations by more than £30,000, a study of legal complaints found.
Time spent by lawyers “lending a supportive ear and corresponding with the other side soon mounts up”, the report said.
Adam Sampson, the chief legal ombudsman, said: "Some customers also create their own problems by letting emotions take over in the divorce process.”
The report, the Price of Separation, found: “One of the reasons why costs can spiral out of control lies in the emotional rawness of many of those going through divorce proceedings.
“Divorce is often a lonely time, where someone is facing very real uncertainties and taking important decisions, yet in a state of deep emotion. Related Articles

“In those circumstances, it is common for people to become inflexible or change their minds (and thus their instructions) during the divorce process. “It is also common for them to rely heavily on the one individual who is both an expert in how to negotiate the process and who is seen to be on their side: their lawyer.”
It added: “As hard as it must be to keep emotions in check, the lessons from this report all point towards the necessity for divorcing couples to try.”
In one of the most “standout” cases, a mother-of-one, who had been made redundant, asked her lawyers to halt proceedings but they continued regardless and hit her with a £15,000 bill. The woman - known as Miss A - brought her complaint to the Ombudsman, which agreed the firm should waive the final bill and ordered it to do so. The study revealed that nearly one in five of the 7,500 complaints resolved last year were about divorce or family law-related cases, making it the most complained about area of law in England and Wales.

The real reason why girls don't do maths A-level
Schoolgirls have bundles of confidence to study maths and physics at A-level. They just don't want to, says recent school leaver Emma Pearce

Young girls are not struggling with their confidence levels. In my experience, when it comes to choosing which subjects they wish to study at A-level, girls know what they are interested in and they do it. The reason I think many girls are put off studying maths and physics is simply because they're not inspired enough. In my school, which I left last year, these subjects were largely male-dominated and many of us girls found it hard to relate. Yesterday education and child care minister Liz Truss claimed that the gender-gap among boys and girls studying maths and physics at A level comes down to girls' lack of confidence. A report by the Institute of Physics showed that between 2010 and 2012, two thirds of pupils taking A-level maths were male. Four times more boys than girls studied physics. But there are a number of reasons why young people choose different A-level subjects, and it's usually not down to self-belief (or lacking it). In some cases, young girls may already have their sights on a particular job or industry. Others may just have grown up with certain interests. Related Articles

Why Shanghai pupils are so special
04 Dec 2013
A friend of mine who grew up in a bilingual household took three languages at A level because she was inspired by the language school that we both went to and had an obvious natural talent for them. Another friend has been an impressive piano player since she was five and has only ever been concerned with studying music. For me, my A-level subjects were influenced somewhat by my teachers. I studied history, politics, French and drama. My history teacher invested so much in the subject and inspired me greatly to study more essay-based subjects at A level. Same goes for my politics teacher. Drama was already a natural interest of mine. French – I had to do it; I went to an international school which celebrated languages, but I enjoyed it and it gave me a real life skill. I never thought to do science or maths, purely because the subjects didn't thrill me and the teachers didn't convince me they were worth studying. It wasn't because I wasn't good at them, I just couldn't see the career path or why they were relevant to me. Of course, career paths aren’t so obvious these days and there aren't many well-known women in science/ maths that our generation can look up to in the field and say, “I want to be like her.” Off the top of my head, I can only really think of men in these fields (e.g. Professor Brian Cox, Stephen Hawking) but struggle to think of modern women equivalents. Science subjects did feature to an extent among my friends – some studied biology but never considered physics or maths. Again, mainly because they didn't find it compelling. Many of them knew what kind of job they wanted after A-levels or what they wanted to study at university and none of those routes required hard maths skills. Looking at my female mates around me, I don't get the impression they're a group too nervous or unsure to embark upon the so-called "macho" subjects pf physics and maths, but instead a group of determined young women who know what direction they want to head in. The question still stands why wasn’t that direction linked to either maths or physics? The greater task for schools and society at large is to step away from these gender-stereotypes. Why is it that many of us still think of maths and physics as being "boys' subjects", but the arts courses are largely seen as a girls' domain? We need to steer away from an obsession with gender because it’s really not something schoolgirls (or boys) are thinking about. Teachers should be equipped to let pupils know that they are capable to do anything they want to do and go in any direction they want regardless of their gender. Teachers are the ones on the front line talking to pupils everyday, and it should be their job to tell young people where a physics or maths degree can take you and why that place is worth going to. It is also about creating role models who are really excited about the field of study and can bring it alive for students. But crucially it is about making the study of physics and maths more exciting and relevant to their lives. Some university technical colleges already exist to teach science and maths in a really practical, engaging way and these seem to be working to inspire a new generation of engineers, physicists and scientists. Perhaps we need more of these? Interestingly, research from the Girls’ Schools Association (which represents girls' only schools) shows that girls are 75 per cent more likely to take maths and two and a half times as likely to take physics than at mixed schools. President of the GSA, Hilary French, attributes this to the fact that “in a girls’ school, the pressure to opt for the subjects which are perceived as more ‘feminine’ just doesn’t exist and so the potentially talented female scientists and mathematicians are able to pursue their interests and achieve their full potential.” Coming from a mixed, state school the reality is, however, that these figures can differ drastically in state schools. What is of real concern is the way in which we encourage young people to make the important life decision of what career they want to go down at the age of just 16. We’ve decided for them that they can’t vote, they can’t drink but they can limit themselves to up as many as four areas of study that may dictate the direction the rest of their professional life will go in. If the Government is really serious about tackling the gender divide between certain subjects at school, then it should think more broadly about the choices young people are forced to make from such an early age – which may, in truth, be nothing to do with their gender, and more to do with the barriers of the system they are working under. Many young British girls today are full of confidence and self-belief when it comes to their abilities in the classroom. What they need is a more flexible and engaging education system rather than being bound by outdated stereotypes. Emma Pearce is a second year politics student at the University of Nottingham.
