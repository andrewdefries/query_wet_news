Russia planning 'near-total surveillance' of visitors, athletes at Sochi Winter Olympics
Security measures at the Sochi winter Olympics will include such extensive electronic eavesdropping and surveillance that the US State Department has advised Americans headed to Russia to leave smart phones and laptops at home, an investigation has revealed.

10:02PM BST 06 Oct 2013
Research by Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, two Russian investigative journalists who specialise in covering the security services, reveals a picture of near-total surveillance, Soldatov said.
The Russian authorities have gone to great lengths to lay on the best communications support any Olympic event has seen at the February games, including 4G coverage and free WiFi throughout the city of Sochi.
But Soldatov and Borogan's research indicates that the internet, telephone and other communications providers involved are obliged to build networks in such a way that the security services have full and unimpeded access.
“There is an element of meta-data gathering, but Russian security services are not so interested in meta-data. This is about content,” Soldatov told The Telegraph, citing an “information security concept” document laying out these measures. “The idea seems to be to make communications in Sochi totally transparent for the Russian authorities.”
The monitoring programme, which is run by the Federal Security Service, Russia’s internal security agency and the main successor to the KGB, is aided by software that helps identify key words and phrases of interest being used in electronic communications. “It is a very useful way of knowing who in a given region is talking about Navalny, for example,” said Soldatov, referring to a Russian opposition leader.

An FSB statement and other documents also revealed that the FSB and the Russian interior ministry have both acquired two kinds of drones for surveillance during the games, he added, as well as a vast network of closed circuit television in the city.
While the measures bear some resemblance to security at the Beijing Olympics, Soldatov said that taken together it is probably the most comprehensive surveillance in Olympic history. Drones had been considered for surveillance at the London Olympics, but were not used in the event.
Soldatov said the depth of surveillance was so comprehensive that the US State Department has advised its citizens “that it would be better to forget your laptop or smart phone in your home country, because it will be intercepted.”
The measures are ostensibly aimed at securing Sochi against possible terrorist attacks during the games. Sochi neighbours Russia’s turbulent North Caucasus, where federal forces are fighting a long-running Islamist separatist insurgency. Doku Umarov, a rebel leader who has claimed responsibility for a number of suicide bombings in Moscow in recent years, has called on his followers to attack the games.
In August Vladimir Putin signed a decree establishing restricted zones around the city and banning public demonstrations for the duration of the game.
Earlier this week an FSB spokesman told reporters that security would be unintrusive compared to the London Olympics.
But Soldatov said the nature of the measures and key personnel appointments suggested other priorities.
The chief of Olympic Security, for example, is Oleg Syromolotov, the head of FSB Counter Intelligence – a spy catcher rather than a counter terrorism expert.
“Taken together, it looks to me like these people still see the main threat to the Olympics coming not from the North Caucasus, but from outside the country,” said Soldatov.
The research, part of a joint investigation with the Guardian newspaper, is part of a wider project looking at Russian surveillance practices.
The research is not yet complete and the full report has yet to be published, Soldatov said.
No one at the FSB was immediately available to comment on Sunday evening. Russia

Floyd Mayweather defeats Saul Alvarez by majority decision to claim WBC and WBA world titles in Las Vegas
Floyd Mayweather claimed the WBC light middleweight and WBA super world light middleweight titles here on Saturday night, producing a masterclass against the young Mexican star Saul Alvarez.

It was awarded as a 12-round majority decision by the judges, although universally seen as a shutout from media to boxing veterans to aficionados.
The great champion showed that he is 'The One', as the promotion was called, and remains boxing's No 1 pound for pound fighter, par excellence. After the weigh-in, at 152lbs, Alvarez entered the ring at 165lbs. Mayweather, who looked nothing like his 36 years against a man 13 years his junior, commanded the entire championship bout against the bigger man, in spite of judge CJ Ross scoring the unification bout even, as the master extend his unbeaten professional record to 45 fights.
There was universal derision to the score of 114-114 from the female judge CJ Ross, although afterwards, Mayweather was not overly critical, in spite of the one-sided performance. Related Articles

Clearly, however, the $8,500 dollars Ross was paid for this contest was not worth it. In the real world, in a fight set to potentially gross $150 million dollars, working people get sacked for such misjudgements.
It was so crass a decision that it dominated the line of questioning afterwards.
"From what I found out, this is the same judge who scored the fight for Timothy Bradley over Manny Pacquiao. The Nevada State Athletic Commission is the best commission in the world, and if they feel it is right for the lady to judge, then that is fine by me. Things happen."
Asked if he thought the scores of 117-111 and 116-112 were just, Mayweather added. "Canelo fought hard in there. He fought hard in there."
I had it 119-110 for Mayweather, having given Alvarez the eighth round, in which he came out with more zest. Listening to a withdrawn Alvarez afterwards, it was clear he felt he was shut out by Mayweather's sublime boxing skills. "He's very fast, very accurate," he said. "His punches were not strong, but he scores points with them. It is what it is. He took me out of my game plan. And I had no answer for it."
Mayweather added: "This young man will carry the torch. He has everything to go on and be a legend in this sport. It was just my night tonight. I always say it, every day, it's about hard work and dedication. We did it again.
"I just took my time, and took advantages of opportunities when they came. It would not say it wasmy best performance. I still have four fights left on the Showtime deal." The highly rated 23-year-old Alvarez headed into the bout having built an unbeaten record of 42-0-1, and was regarded by many as the biggest threat yet to Mayweather, based on his youth, power, and explosive combinations.
But the American always looked in control, his fast hands doing enough to edge most rounds, however much the Mexcian tried to impose himself. Time and again, Alvarez was left hitting air. This was a chess match, and the sweet science belonged to Mayweather. It was a sweet, poetic masterclass.
Overall, Alvarez was unable to live up to the hype as Mayweather, who earned a basic purse of US dollars 41.5million (£26.1m), controlled Alvarez with the jab, movement and technique from the first to the last round.
The Michigan man imposed himself early in the fight, landing a fast jab and showing that his reflexes, four years short of 40, were still razor sharp. He landed right hooks, moreover, and opened up more aggressively than usual. "My father encouraged me to do that. He said I looked a bit tight...." explained Mayweather.
For round after round, changing levels, moving as was his want from the ropes to the centre of the ring, Mayweather landed a faster crisper jab, the straight right and right cross, and in the final third of the fight, a beautiful short right uppercut through Canelo's gloves. Precision, poise, poetry. Mayweather does not have power; nor does he need it. All Alvarez could do was attack in bursts, but then few punches landed, Mayweather countering with as many of his own. Alvarez mustered, in the penultimate round, a wild right hand which connected only with the ropes and out, much to Mayweather's amusement. The champion paused, looked out through the ropes and gesticulated, as if to say, 'Where was that punch going...'
There was audible laughter in the crowd. But there was nothing funny about this performance. It was boxing class, pure and simple. Mayweather exposed his great experience, greater technique, and growing greatness. It is still his time. He remains 'The One'.
