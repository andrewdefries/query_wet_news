IMF upgrades UK growth as its cuts rest of the world
The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for UK growth this year in the face of sharp cuts to world, US, eurozone and emerging market predictions as it warned that “downside risks to global prospects still dominate”.

In what will be seen at the Treasury as a vindication of its decision to ignore the IMF’s recent call for a Plan B, the Bretton Woods institution lifted its forecast for GDP growth this year from 0.7pc to 0.9pc. Its outlook for 2014 was held at 1.5pc.
The forecasts for Britain now stand head and shoulders above its major European peers, with Germany the closest at 0.3pc growth this year and 1.3pc next. The eurozone as a whole is expected to shrink 0.6pc in 2013, compared with a forecast decline of 0.3pc in April.
Underlining the improving UK outlook, the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimated that the economy grew 0.6pc in the three months to June – even after weak manufacturing figures for May published yesterday.

The IMF appeared to target the UK at its Spring economic outlook, when chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned George Osborne that he was “playing with fire” and should “consider adjustment to the original fiscal plans”. The following month, the fund urged the Government to abandon austerity for a year and borrow as much as £10bn extra for infrastructure spending.

The Chancellor rejected the recommendation, since when the economic data have picked up markedly. Growth in the first quarter beat forecasts at 0.3pc and, according to NIESR, is on course to top expectations again. The think-tank’s prediction was made despite a surprise 0.8pc dip in manufacturing output in May, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, conceded that the latest official figures “cast a bit of a cloud over the positive run of industry data in recent months”. However, official trade figures released yesterday showed that exports of goods rose in the three months to May, aiding hopes for a “rebalancing”. Importantly, the rise was dominated by non-EU exports, which increased by 4.6pc to a record £39bn for the three months.
Overall, the deficit in goods was slightly worse than expected at £8.49bn as imports also rose. Including the surplus in services, the overall deficit was £2.4bn in May compared with £2.1bn in April.
Surveys this week have signalled that the housing market is roaring back to life and that consumers are feeling confident enough to spend more at the shops. Raising the prospect of greater private sector investment, company finance directors are currently more comfortable taking risk onto their balance sheet than at any time since 2007, according to a survey by Deloitte.
Although better than April, the IMF’s outlook for the UK is still worse than in January when the IMF was forecasting 1pc growth this year. At 0.9pc, it has simply drawn its outlook into line with consensus to reflect the better-than-expected 0.3pc growth of the first three months and expected 0.5pc expansion in the second quarter.
Thomas Helbling, division chief for the IMF’s world economic studies, doused any renewed sense of optimism in the UK, though, claiming that 0.2pc is a “usual revision” at this stage in the year and explaining that it merely reflected the better than expected data already released.
Asked whether the upgrade had any implications for the IMF’s recommendation for the UK, he said: “I don’t think it changes the big picture for the UK – namely that the recovery is weak and that policymakers should ensure that the recovery is improved.”
In its outlook statement, the IMF stuck to its position that governments should spend more now to entrench growth while setting out a clear “medium term” road map to get the public finances in order.
“Key advanced economies should pursue a policy mix that supports near-term growth, anchored by credible plans for medium-term public debt sustainability. This would also allow for more gradual near-term fiscal adjustment,” it said.
The broader picture from the IMF was disappointing, however. It cut its global outlook by 0.2 percentage points both this year and next, to 3.1pc and 3.8pc respectively. The downgrade reflected a slowdown in the US from 1.9pc to 1.7pc this year and from 3pc to 2.7pc next year, as well as a 0.3 percentage point cut in emerging markets’ growth for both years, to 5pc and 5.4pc respectively. The IMF said that countering the worsening headwinds “will require additional policy action” and further “do-what-it-takes” interventions in the eurozone to “keep [risks] at bay”.
“Downside risks, old and new, still dominate the outlook,” it said. “Although imminent tail risks in advanced economies have diminished, additional measures will be needed to keep them at bay, including timely increases in the US debt ceiling and continued ‘do-what-it-takes’ action by the authorities of the euro area to mitigate and reverse financial fragmentation.”
In what appeared to be a recommendation targeted at the US, where the latest quantitative easing programme (QE) is expected to be slowly wound down from September, the IMF said: “With low inflation and sizable economic slack, monetary policy stimulus should continue until the recovery is well established.”
However, Mr Blanchard remained sanguine about the recent market turmoil following the QE “tapering” threat, claiming it was “a repricing episode” that should now settle down, though he was careful to say “one can not rule out further attacks of the nerves”.
To calm markets, policymakers should set out “clear” exit strategies from QE and deal with any bubbles through banking supervision. “Potential adverse side effects should be contained with regulatory and macroprudential policies,” the IMF said. “Clear communication on the eventual exit from monetary stimulus will help reduce volatility in global financial markets.”
In an apparent endorsement of the UK’s recent efforts to identify the bad assets on UK bank balance sheets and force lenders to recapitalise, the IMF said: “In the euro area, a bank asset review should identify problem assets and quantify capital needs, supported by European Stability Mechanism direct recapitalisation where appropriate.”
The eurozone is expected to perform so poorly in part because European governments are allowing “delays in policy implementation”. In an alarming comment, Mr Blanchard also warned that “somethng else” may be going on. “A general lack of confidence in the future may be self-fulfilling, which is worrisome,” he said.
A Treasury spokesman said: “The IMF has confirmed that the UK economy is moving from rescue to recovery, revising up its growth forecast for this year. But the IMF again warns of the continued risks to the global economy, showing that the recovery cannot be taken for granted.”
Ed Balls, Shadow Chancellor, said: “These forecasts confirm that, after three years of flatlining, the IMF believes Britain’s economic recovery will remain weak. While this year’s figure has been revised up, it is disappointing that this is still a lower forecast than the IMF was making at the start of this year.”

Cancer patients face drugs funding 'cliff edge' warn MPs
Cancer patients could be denied drugs paid for by a special £200 million-a-year fund, when it expires at the end of the year, MPs warn today (Wed).

They face a “cliff edge” situation when the Cancer Drugs Fund ceases to operate, said members of the Health Select Committee. To date some 25,000 people have benefitted from the fund, David Cameron’s personal brainchild, since it was introduced in 2010. It enables them to apply for treatment with drugs that have either not yet been given the green light for NHS prescription by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), or have been turned down on cost grounds. Chris Skidmore, a Conservative select committee member, said: “The Coalition has put a lot aside for the Cancer Drugs Fund and in doing so has raised significantly patient expectations. “I think a significant problem will occur when the public do not recognise that this fund is temporary.

“We could have what effectively is a clinical cliff edge in January 2014, between the end of the Cancer Drugs Fund and the adoption of value based pricing.”
Stephen Dorrell, the Conservative committee chairman, expressed concern that current patients faced the prospect of drugs being taken away from them. Future patients could see drugs that were benefitting today’s patients "simply being withdrawn", he warned. The fund was only ever meant to be temporary. A new system of agreeing drug prices with pharmaceutical firms, called value based pricing, is due to come in next January. Ministers believe this will be more flexible than the current arrangement, doing away for the need for the fund. But select committee members remain unconvinced. In a report about Nice, published today (Wed), they describe value based pricing as a “nebulous concept” which will have only “modest implications”. The Department of Health already negotiates with drugs firms to agree prices, they note. Mr Skidmore said the Government needed to “set out as soon as possible” what the effective replacement for the Cancer Drugs Fund would be. The committee is also concerned that the fund is not being properly assessed. In evidence to the committee, Professor Peter Johnson, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, admitted “we don’t have the data” on how much benefit it had brought. Valerie Vaz, a Labour member, said: “I hope there’s something in the Department of Health where they are measuring whether these drugs have been helpful.”
The committee also asked why cancer had been singled-out for extra drugs cash, recommending that if there was “clear evidence of beneficial outcomes” then something akin to the fund should be “applied to treatments for conditions other than cancer”. A Department of Health spokesman said: "We will ensure arrangements are in place to protect individual patients who are receiving treatment with drugs funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund as the end of the fund approaches. "We will respond fully to the Health Select Committee’s report in due course.”

Apple releases iOS update to fix iPhone 4S performance problems Apple has released an update to iOS, fixing performance problems that led Vodafone to warn iPhone 4S owners against upgrading. An expensive phone, or phones, are mysteriously delivered to the victim’s home By Shane Richmond, Head of Technology (Editorial)
8:43AM GMT 12 Feb 2013
Follow Comments
Vodafone warned iPhone 4S owners about possible 3G performance problems caused by iOS 6.1, the mobile operating system update that Apple released last month. A similar warning was issued by 3 in Austria, according to a customer who quoted the warning on Facebook. Overnight, Apple has released a 6.1.1 update for iOS. The company says: "This update fixes an issue that could impact cellular performance and reliability for iPhone 4S." Released on January 28th, iOS 6.1 included several minor new features for PassBook and for music playback, improvements to Wi-Fi and security fixes, among other tweaks. It is not clear how many people were affected by the 3G problem. Reports suggested it was an intermittent problem that had proved difficult to diagnose. Related Articles

In its statement on Friday, Vodafone said: "While Apple’s investigations continue, we would recommend that anyone who has not yet installed iOS 6.1 on their iPhone 4S should delay doing so until Apple has confirmed that the problem has been fixed." Vodafone has not yet issued an update to its warning but it seems likely that it will now advise its customers to upgrade. Apple
