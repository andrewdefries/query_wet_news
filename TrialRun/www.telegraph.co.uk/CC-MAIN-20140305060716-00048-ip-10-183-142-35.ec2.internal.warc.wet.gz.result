Hay Festival 2013: John Guy and 16th-century gossip

John Guy has a gift for bringing Tudor times to life and those at his talk on his new book, The Children of Henry VIII, were treated to some serious history and 16th-century gossip.
Catherine Parr, queen of England and the last of Henry's six wives, "knew how to torture Henry," Guy said, adding: "She was the Tudor Imelda Marcos, amassing 250 pairs of smart shoes within two years...Jimmy Choo had nothing on her."
Henry VIII, England’s wealthiest and most powerful king who became the subject of the most notorious divorce case of the 16th century, and broke with the Pope, had his marriage to Anne of Cleeves annulled in 1540 on the grounds of non-consummation. She later revealed, said Guy, that "Henry was no good in bed". During a court trial, when Thomas Cromwell was trying to suppress the truth, a note was read out by Anne that said (again, using Guy's colourful shorthand description) that Henry "could not get it up". Henry claimed that this was an affliction only with her. If he had been deemed impotent, he would not have been allowed to marry again.
Guy said that recent American medical research suggests that Henry had a positive blood antigen that would have made it difficult for his children to survive. His first child died after only seven weeks in 1511 but he did father four living children, each by a different mother.
The sections of the talk about his children were engrossing. In 1519 he had Henry Fitzroy - by the glamorous mistress known as Bessie Blount - and Henry provided top tutors from Cambridge for the boy from the age of six. He wasn't fussed about girls and left Catherine of Aragon to teach his daughter to read. It wasn't exactly an age of feminist enlightenment. It was reasonable for a mistress to answer back to a king but not a wife.

Guy talked about Henry's affairs (with Anne Boleyn and her sister) and said Henry rarely saw his children (there were only three occasions when all the surviving children were together) and Guy remarked of the son Edward that "he was Henry VIII without the subtlety." Guy was fascinating on the character similarities between the ruthless, vain and subtle Henry and his children.
There was a lot to roam across in an hour but the long queue for the book signing suggested visitors wanted to find out more about the dysfunctional Tudors. There was just time at the end for a snippet about Lady Jane Grey. The historian said that new information was casting new light on some of the "doctored documents" of the 16th century about her. Sounds like there is another book in it.
