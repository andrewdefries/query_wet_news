Childless couples to get IVF on the NHS after two years instead of three: new guidance
Childless couples will only have to try to conceive for two years before receiving IVF on the NHS, the health service rationing body has said, as fertility treatment is extended to gay couples and women over 40. A standard cycle of IVF treatment can cost between £3,00 and £8,000 Photo: Alamy	By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor

Comments
In the biggest shake-up of fertility guidelines in almost ten years, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, has recommended more people are given fertility treatment on the NHS. Women aged up to 42 will qualify for NHS funded treatment under certain circumstances, along with same sex couples and those with physical disability that make natural conception difficult. The length of time couples will have to try to conceive naturally has been reduced from three years to two, in order to boost their chances of success. Where there is a known fertility problems, couples can be referred immediately for treatment, where as previously they would have to wait up to three years under previous guidance despite knowing their chances of natural conception were almost nil. The guidelines were welcomed by fertility doctors and patients groups, however some warned that because the recommendations were not binding, commissioners may choose to ignore them or stipulate their own restrictions in order to keep costs down.

Fertility treatment waiting times halve after increased payments to donors

A standard cycle of IVF treatment can cost between £3,00 and £8,000. In 2011, four in ten of the 61,000 IVF cycles carried out in Britain were funded by the NHS, which would increase to 93 per cent of cycles if the new guidance were fully implemented. £60.5m on fertility treatment. THe NHS in England currently spends around £60.4m because the original 2004 guidance is not fully implemented everywhere. If the new guideline is fully implemented, it will cost an additional £65.2m, Nice calculated. Some recommendations will save the NHS money including stricter criteria for the use of one embryo at a time in order to reduce the number of twins and triplets born following IVF, and reductions in the use of less effective treatments such as artificial insemination and stimulation drugs. Women aged 23 to 39 will still qualify for three full cycles of IVF on the NHS and now in addition, women aged 40 to 42 will be eligible for one full cycle under certain circumstances. Dr Tim Child, consultant gynaecologist and director of the Oxford Fertility Unit, who helped draw up the guidelines, said: "It is very clear in my daily work that people get stuck at various stages in the system and as time moves on their chances of success both naturally and with assisted conception techniques only goes down. "The 2004 guideline said couples should try naturally for three years which was really too long to make couples wait before moving on to an effective treatment such as IVF. With the new recommendation of two years the outcome will be to prevent people waiting an extra year when their success rate only reduces." Some experts were concerned that due to the financial problems in the NHS the guidelines would not be fully implemented. British Fertility Society spokesman, Dr Sue Avery said: "It is now almost ten years since Nice first published guidelines on fertility treatment and we are still in the untenable position that the majority of Primary Care Trusts have not fully implemented these and patients in many areas of the country are unable to access treatment. "Being denied appropriate fertility treatment can have a devastating consequence on patients’ lives, effectively denying them the right to a family." Clare Lewis-Jones, chief executive of the patient group Infertility Network UK, said that only one in four primary care trusts provide the three full cycles as stipulated in the 2004 guideline, two PCTs do not fund any fertility treatment and the rest fund one or two cycles. Many PCTs place their own 'social criteria' on funding, including denying IVF to a woman whose partner has children from a previous relationship, denying funding to smokers or those with body mass index over a set point. Mrs Lewis-Jones said: “Let’s not forget that infertility is a medical condition and that people with a fertility problem have the same right to be treated by the NHS as anyone else. "It is now nearly 10 years since the guideline was first published yet sadly we are still facing an arbitrary approach to IVF funding around the country. “We know the current system leaves many people unable to access NHS treatment and we need reassurance about the future of NHS fertility treatment as we move towards GP commissioning in 2013."

MPs' expenses
MPs' expenses receipts to stay secret, IPSA rules MPs' expenses receipts should not be shown to the public, Westminster's new standards watchdog has ruled. Sir Peter Viggers' duck house, which became the symbol of the MPs' expenses scandal By Ben Leapman
9:00PM GMT 24 Mar 2012
The decision means that the kind of documents which triggered the 2009 expenses scandal will in future be kept secret. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), created to clean up Parliament in the wake of the scandal, said that publishing receipts would be expensive and was not required by law. The ruling was revealed in a letter turning down a request by The Sunday Telegraph to see three receipts under the Freedom of Information Act. Explaining the decision, Kiran Virdee of IPSA stated: "IPSA will not, as a matter of course, publish images of receipts or invoices supporting claims."
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which oversees the public's right to obtain official documents, will now investigate. Related Articles

MPs order softer expenses regime
03 Dec 2010
A spokesman for the ICO said: "We are happy with IPSA's approach that it doesn't pro-actively publish [MPs' expenses receipts], but if a request comes in, every receipt should be considered on a case-by-case basis so there's no blanket exemption."
Campaigners for open government criticised IPSA's approach. John Mann, the Labour MP, said publication was essential in order to reassure the public that the expenses system was now open and rigorous. He said: "I can't see why, if there's a request for these receipts, they should not be made available. Otherwise we can't move on from this scandal." Martin Bell, the former independent MP, said: "MPs should not make expenses claims that they cannot justify in public. IPSA are in danger of become as much a creature of the House of Commons as the old Fees Office was."
Under the system of parliamentary allowances, MPs must submit receipts for every item of expenditure in order to claim back the money from taxpayers. In 2008, in a case brought by The Sunday Telegraph and other journalists, the High Court ordered that the receipts should be disclosed. The ruling led to the expenses scandal, with the revelation that MPs had claimed for items including a duck house and moat-cleaning. Four MPs were jailed over fraudulent claims. Parliamentary authorities published more than a million receipts in 2009, with sensitive details such as addresses and account numbers "redacted" or blacked out. When responsibility for the expenses system was transferred to IPSA in 2010, Sir Christopher Kelly, the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, recommended that the new body "should continue to publish, at least quarterly, each individual claim for reimbursement made by MPs with accompanying receipts". However, IPSA decided not to publish receipts routinely - saving £750,000, according to Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, its chairman. But it struck a deal with Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, whereby when receipts were requested under the Freedom of Information Act they would be released unless there was a legal reason not to. To test this, The Sunday Telegraph asked IPSA, in Dec 2010, for copies of the receipts relating to three claims made earlier that year: £652.13 claimed by John Bercow, the Speaker, for "website design/production"; £145.70 claimed by George Osborne, the Chancellor, for "headed paper"; and £63.61 claimed by Alan Keen, the Labour MP, who has since died, for "stationery/banner". IPSA sent a response 11 months later, giving more details of the spending but withholding the receipts, and blaming the delay on a clerical error. Following an internal review by IPSA, John Sills, the organisation's director of policy, upheld the decision last week. No further explanation was given. An IPSA spokesman said last night: "We released all the information from the receipts. We don't have a blanket approach to handling FOI requests, we deal with each one as it comes in."
Mr Bercow, who chairs a parliamentary committee which oversees IPSA, last night declined to disclose his website design receipt. The Speaker's spokeman said: "The question of whether receipts are published is a matter for the IPSA and the FOI process. It would be inappropriate for the Speaker to become involved."
The legal case which prompted the MPs' expenses scandal began in 2005, when the Freedom of Information Act came into force and journalists used it to ask parliament to release details of claims. Parliamentary officials declined to release full details of claims. The ICO ruled in 2007 that the receipts should not be published. The case next went to an Information Tribunal, which ruled that the full receipts should be disclosed. In 2008 a High Court panel of judges chaired by Lord Judge, now the Lord Chief Justice, agreed the receipts should be published. The judges ruled: "The expenditure of public money through the payment of MPs' salaries and allowances is a matter of direct and reasonable interest to taxpayers." MPs' expenses

Prince Harry naked: The Sun was right to publish 'cute' pictures, says Murdoch's daughter
Elisabeth Murdoch, the daughter of newspaper tycoon Rupert Murdoch, has endorsed The Sun’s decision to publish naked pictures of Prince Harry, saying the prince was “cute”, as St James's Palace indicated it would not take action against the tabloid.

Follow The News Corporation executive, who yesterday delivered a pointed attack on her brother James, said she “feels bad” for Prince Harry but that newspapers should be able to publish material that is being made widely available online, on websites like TMZ and Twitter. “It would be very sad if we lived in a world where you can’t publish that. Even in my MacTaggart tunnel of the last couple of days, I went online and checked out the pictures,” she said, referring to the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture which she delivered at the Edinburgh Television Festival yesterday evening. “I think he’s cute, and I thought quite sweet. I feel bad for him, I mean, God, take mobile phones away [but] we’ve all seen the pictures online. If newspapers can’t participate in that I think it asks questions about where print and online [meet].”
The Sun this morning became the first British newspaper to publish naked photographs of Prince Harry, a move it claimed was in the public interest and a test of Britain's free press. Had you seen the pictures of Prince Harry before The Sun published them?

In doing so, it defied a request not to publish the photos made by St James's Palace via the press watchdog. However last night, as it emerged the pictures would be published, the Palace indicated it would not take any action against the newspaper. A spokesman said: "We have made our views on Prince Harry's privacy known. Newspapers regulate themselves, so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors to make." He said that there would be no further comment. Prince Harry was photographed frolicking in the nude with an unnamed woman in Las Vegas. The Sun’s publisher, News International, has been has been rocked by allegations that it journalists hacked the phones of scores of people including of members of the Royal Family. The scandal has raised serious questions about the ethics at the heart of the newspaper business, and its parent company, News Corp. Do you believe the pictures of Prince Harry are in the public interest?
Ms Murdoch tried to distance herself from the scandal yesterday, with an impassioned speech about the need for companies to have “purpose” and a “moral language” rather than just chase profit. However, she denied this morning that The Sun’s decision to publish the pictures of Prince Harry demonstrated a lack of regard for ethics. “No, I don’t [think that]. I think there is a public interest argument. [Phone hacking] is very different to some girl with a camera phone sending pictures to TMZ. I don’t know what decision I would have made but I understand their decision,” she said. Prince Harry

India v England: Suresh Raina reprieve was crucial, says England captain Alastair Cook
England captain Alastair Cook was clearly frustrated by the crucial incident during India’s pursuit of England’s 257 for seven when he caught Suresh Raina at slip off Steven Finn, only for the batsman to be reprieved because umpire Steve Davis had called dead ball.

The reason Davis had done so was because Finn had hit the stumps with his knee. It was a habit that caused controversy in the Test series against South Africa last summer, especially in the second Test at Headingley when Graeme Smith was ruled not out by the same umpire. On the field here Cook was clearly unhappy, arguing to Davis that Finn should have received a warning before any ball was called dead. The reason the ball is called dead is because the batsman could have been distracted by the bails being dislodged by Finn’s knee. “There was a little bit of confusion,” said Cook. “Apparently we had been told that because he knocked them over twice in one of the previous games he was a 'serial offender’ and that he was going to get called straight away. “In the heat of the moment I think a few of us might have forgotten that or whether we’d been told that, I was not entirely sure. You’ve got to clarify these things. Related Articles

“I know it’s a tough job for the umpires, but it’s obviously frustrating because, at that time, that wicket would’ve put us in a better situation than we were. So it’s obviously frustrating when those little things don’t go your way.”
It became clear afterwards that Finn had hit the stumps twice during the first one-day international of the series in Rajkot, being warned the first time and then called the second. England coach Ashley Giles and Cook had been told that there would be no further warnings. “I wasn’t totally sure what they had told us before,” said Cook, “He [Finn] did it twice in Rajkot and he was warned there, but I assumed that was just for that game. But I couldn’t remember them [the umpires] telling me as a captain. “To be fair it has been made quite clear to us, I just couldn’t remember the conversation we’d had. “But they are convinced they had it [with us] so I am going to have to take their word for it. But obviously a lot of things go through your head sometimes.”

The best of Just Back

'Don’t stare,” whispers Martin. “He’ll want to fight you.” I’m gaping at an angry puce face when two wild hazel eyes swivel in my direction. I quickly look away. I’ve no intention of confronting the macaque. I’m here to see another battle up ahead. We’re climbing scores of steps through Hong Kong’s Shing Mun Country Park. Their route forms part of the MacLehose Trail, a 62-mile pathway lacing together the pine-cloaked peaks of the New Territories. For the moment, the clamour of Hong Kong Island fades away below us. The calm, however, is soon replaced by squeals of terror as a group of schoolgirls turns and runs after failing to outstare the macaque. “Poor blighter,” sighs Martin. “He gets no peace.”
Peace has been a rare commodity in Shing Mun. Seventy years ago, it lost its serenity to commotion when British and Commonwealth soldiers attempted to fight off a Japanese assault on its hillsides. Subsequently, on December 25 1941, Hong Kong surrendered. Over the next four years, the British colony came under a very different type of foreign administration. Shing Mun suffered in the process. Post-invasion, vast swathes were cut down by the Japanese. Today, Hong Kong’s Country & Marine Parks Authority has replenished its five and a half square miles of Chinese pines. But there still remains a thin streak of bare earth that is faithfully kept as it was by a small group of volunteers, including Martin. He’s keen to show me, so we veer off the path and clamber beneath the splayed legs of an electricity pylon. “Welcome to the Gin Drinker’s Line!”

This bald crest forms part of the “Oriental Maginot”, a defensive line conceived by the British to protect Hong Kong’s northern approaches. Built during the Thirties and named after a former bay, the 11-mile string of trenches and bunkers housed up to 2,500 men. It boasted a redoubt, headquarters, and was linked by a series of tunnels. Lowering himself into one, Martin beckons me down. He disappears through a cloud of dust and I follow. We descend a steep rectangular passageway before Martin abruptly halts. “Did you know that the London Underground had an overseas branch?” Pointing to the concrete wall, Martin nods at a perfectly chiselled arrow pointing the way to Piccadilly. Below that, another one leads off towards Charing Cross. “Who needs the Bakerloo Line when you’re on the Gin Drinker’s, eh?”
The British had named its defensive positions after London landmarks in the hope of helping the troops acclimatise to their far-flung battle stations. The ploy failed to work; the Gin Drinker’s Line collapsed in less than one day. This is illustrated at the shrapnel-scarred exit from Strand Palace Hotel, where Japanese engravings declare the bunker “captured by the Kobayashi Detachment”. As I escape its dank confines, I spot some macaques eyeing me warily. I tread peacefully, but realise we’ve invaded their territory again. Enter the next round
