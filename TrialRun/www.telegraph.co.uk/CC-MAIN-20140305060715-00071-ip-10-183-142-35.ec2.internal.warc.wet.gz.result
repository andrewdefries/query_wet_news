Mid Staffs: MPs put pressure on Sir David Nicholson to quit
MPs are piling pressure on Sir David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, saying that it is “absolutely staggering” that he has not resigned over his role in the Mid Staffs hospital scandal.

Ahead of an appearance by Sir David in front of the Health Select Committee tomorrow, MPs accused politicians of "closing ranks" around the NHS over the scandal at Stafford hospital.
David Cameron has insisted that he has “confidence” in Sir David, despite a growing clamour for him to resign.
Charlotte Leslie, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, has tabled a Commons early day motion calling for Sir David to “face consequences” for the scandal.
It has now been signed by 20 MPs, including 15 Tories.
Sir David is the chief executive of the NHS and was the head of the strategic health authority charged with overseeing the hospitals in Mid Staffordshire. Related Articles

07 Mar 2013
Up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died at Stafford Hospital as a result of poor care, a public inquiry recently concluded.
Despite the report, none of the managers who oversaw the hospital have been sanctioned or punished. Sir David has apologised over the scandal but has resisted pressure from back-bench MPs and relations of the victims for him to resign. The Prime Minister has also repeatedly supported him remaining in position and his official spokesman today said that Mr Cameron believes that “Sir David is doing a very good job in his role as head of the NHS”. The Daily Telegraph last week disclosed that several Cabinet ministers privately believe that Sir David should stand aside. One Cabinet minister said Sir David’s position was “completely unacceptable” and symbolised how the Civil Service did not penalise failure. Several ministers are understood to have raised “very serious concerns” about Sir David but the Prime Minister has been advised by the head of the Civil Service that the NHS would be destabilised by his removal.
Miss Leslie said that it is “becoming more and more clear” that Sir David was “complicit” in the “disaster” at Mid Staffs.
Mark Field, the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said it was “mind-boggling” that Sir David is still in charge of the NHS.
He said: “I am always reluctant to see scapegoating, but given the seriousness of what happened at Mid Staffs it is absolutely staggering that nobody has been held accountable.
“Given how central his role was at the hospital, the public at large will find it extremely serious to see that he is now the chief executive of the entire NHS.
“It is very worrying that politicians of all colours seen to be closing ranks around the NHS over this whole issue.”
Sir David was chief executive of the strategic health authority overseeing Mid Staffs in 2005.

Reg Bailey: parents are complicit in sexualisation of children
Parents are too often complicit in the sexualisation and commercialisation of children, according to the author of a landmark Government review into childhood. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the website, said he wanted to remove the 13-year-old restriction Photo: REUTERS	By Harry Wallop, Consumer Affairs Editor

Too many parents either willingly encourage or turn a blind eye to their children signing up to Facebook, watching adult films or wearing inappropriate clothing, said Reg Bailey, the author of Letting Children be Children. The report, well received by campaigners when it was published earlier this month, was commissioned by the Department for Education. It prompted retailers to promise to stop selling "sexy" underwear to children and Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, to pledge to tighten up its use of the watershed. However, Mr Bailey, speaking to The Daily Telegraph, said that parents were too often "complicit" in the "unthinking drift towards ever greater commercialisation and sexualisation" of children, and that retailers, broadcasters and the Government could not take all of the blame. He said: "I was alarmed at the number of parents who were complicit in buying 18-rated video games for their children. "One father said it was OK that he played Grand Theft Auto with his 13-year-old son because it helped them bond together." He added that there "must be easier ways of bonding" with a child than playing a game that allowed "gangsters to run over prostitutes". Related Articles

"That doesn't seem to be a very healthy balance in a relationship between father and son." He was speaking as further evidence suggested that hundreds of thousands of young children are on Facebook, the social networking site, which has rules in place to stop those under the age of 13 signing up. Karen Fraser, the director of Credos, a think tank which advises the advertising industry, said that in a series of focus groups earlier this month she had discovered that "80 per cent to 90 per cent" of those under 13 were signed up to Facebook. "Parents have told us they don't want their children to miss out. They don't want them to restrict their social life." Last year Ofcom, the media watchdog, said one in five children, between eight and 12 years old use social media sites such as Facebook, Bebo or MySpace. Facebook alone has 988,000 under-12s on the site in Britain, according to the latest figures from the Advertising Association. The Facebook age restriction is in place because of an American federal law, but Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the website, said he wanted to remove the 13-year-old restriction. Earlier this year he said: “My philosophy is that for education you need to start at a really, really young age. Because of the restrictions we haven’t even begun this learning process. If they’re lifted then we’d start to learn what works. We’d take a lot of precautions to make sure that they [younger kids] are safe.” Ms Fraser added that the wide-scale lying about children's ages in order to sign them up to Facebook had serious implications. If an 8-year-old pretends to be 13 to sign up, when they are actually 13 the site will allow advertising from gambling, alcohol and cosmetic surgery companies to be targeted at their page because Facebook will think they are 18. Mr Bailey said parents needed to address the number of under-13s on Facebook and the numbers of youngsters playing adult video games. "I am concerned any parent would ignore these age restrictions. They are there for a reason." He added that he had spoken to retailers that had reported that shop staff had been assaulted by parents who had been challenged when trying to buy an 18-rated DVD for their children, who were with them. "That is an appalling situation, but it is a function of poor parenting." A spokesman for Facebook said it had a robust age-verification process. He added: “However, recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to implement age restrictions on the Internet and that there is no single solution to ensuring younger children don’t circumvent a system or lie about their age. As Mark Zuckerberg recently noted, education is critical to ensuring that people of all ages use the Internet safely and responsibly. We agree with safety experts that communication between parents or guardians and kids about their use of the Internet is vital."

A&E head suspended after he lifts lid on 'nightmare' hospital
By Nick Britten
12:01AM BST 22 Oct 2005
The head of an accident and emergency department has been suspended after attacking the "shocking and inexcusable" conditions at his hospital. Paul Lewis wrote to his managers describing a "nightmare" weekend in his overcrowded department at Grantham Hospital, Lincs, where patients were left on trolleys in corridors because of a shortage of beds. Mr Lewis, a senior nurse who has worked in the NHS for more than 30 years, even left the hospital to treat patients because he did not want them to be admitted. Managers sent him home after accusing him of misconduct for leaving the premises while on duty. In his letter, Mr Lewis described conditions during a 19-hour shift on Saturday, Oct 8. He said: "If you closed your eyes and thought this was happening in a Third World country, you would be very saddened by the events.

Patients put cleanliness above choice

"To realise this is happening in Great Britain, one of the main G8 countries, is shocking and inexcusable." He detailed how he left the hospital to go to a nursing home to treat a patient with a urinary infection in an attempt to avoid his being admitted. Later he travelled to a hospital in Boston in an ambulance with an intensive care patient who had been transferred from Grantham to free a bed for a more seriously ill person. Yesterday colleagues leapt to the defence of Mr Lewis, who has been a vocal campaigner to maintain the quality of service in A&E. Stephen Vogt, a consultant, said: "He is one of Grantham's best hospital nurses. He is a great asset and everybody was shocked when he was suspended. "The trust [United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust] says this is on clinical grounds. I think he behaved in an exemplary fashion and I was disappointed to hear that he was being disciplined for what most people would regard as common sense, humanitarian and showing initiative. "He was acting in the patients' interest and he has not done anything outrageous, unreasonable or that could in any way be criticised. The word 'persecution' has been mentioned to me and many people believe that." Another consultant, who did not want to be named, said staff believed that the intention was to intimidate and humiliate Mr Lewis. He said: "Rather than sending him a thank you note, they have suspended him. Everybody is angry and demoralised." Thousands of people took to the streets of Grantham this month to protest at cuts to critical care services and possible closure of the A&E department. About 2,500 protesters marched to the hospital and cheered staff from A&E when they produced a banner thanking the crowd for their support. The trust has organised "a health summit" to explore areas of concern after board members and staff representatives discussed the difficult circumstances in which staff were operating. It confirmed the suspension while an investigation is carried out but would not comment further Mr Lewis was unable to comment as a condition of his suspension. UK News

Oxford is best place to live, survey finds
Oxford, Reading and Aberdeen are the best cities in Britain to live and work in, according to a new index of well-being by PwC and Demos.
Oxford is the best place to live based on a 'basket' of criteria, PwC and Demos said Photo: GETTY	By James Hall
12:01AM GMT 20 Nov 2012
Follow The firms ranked 36 British cities based on a raft of measures including levels of income and employment, health, transport links, affordability of housing and the amount of time that people spend with their family.
Oxford was found to have the best overall mix of all the criteria.
Britain’s biggest cities including London, Liverpool and Manchester fell into the bottom half of the rankings.
This is because while the cities’ scored highly for their transport links and – in general - levels of income, they scored poorly in terms of housing affordability and the work-life balance or residents.
PwC and Demos said the research shows that quality of life is based on more than purely economic indicators.

“While Britain’s road out of recession is understandably causing policy makers and commentators to focus attention on quarterly GDP figures as the key indicator of our economic health, the analysis shows the UK public is increasingly taking a wider and more personal view of the components of economic success,” the groups said.
