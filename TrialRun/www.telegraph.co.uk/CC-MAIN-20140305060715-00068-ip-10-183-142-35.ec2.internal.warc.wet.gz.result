NatWest says technical glitch is fixed
Natwest owner RBS said its operations had returned to normal after thousands of customers had problems with online banking and debit cards. RBS said its 'online banking is now fully operational and debit card transactions are processing as normal'. Photo: ALAMY	8:07AM BST 27 Jul 2012
Comments
NatWest became the second financial institution to report technical problems on Thursday after up to 2m Nationwide transactions were duplicated. An RBS spokesman said: "Online banking is now fully operational and debit card transactions are processing as normal. We continue to monitor the systems closely and will keep our customers fully informed. We apologise for any inconvenience caused." Earlier in the summer, Natwest suffered a major systems collapse when millions of customers were unable to check their balances, withdraw cash or make payments. NatWest promised that no customers would be left out of pocket as a result of the technology problems. Although it has not yet been revealed what caused the problems at RBS, the Nationwide issue was attributed to "human error" and meant some customers who used their Visa cards on Tuesday had duplicate payments also taken out on Wednesday. The building society recently benefited from a surge in activity from customers looking to switch accounts following NatWest's IT meltdown last month, where customers were left for days without access to cash, and Barclays' Libor-fixing scandal.

Nationwide said 704,426 of the society's four million current account holders had been affected, of which fewer than 50,000 are thought to have been adversely impacted, by wrongly incurring charges or fees. Leigh O'Riordan said that he had paid for his annual rail season ticket from Billericay in Essex to London, at a cost of £3,422, but he found the payment had been taken out twice. "In my case, this means I now do not have access to my money," he told the BBC website. "It took me a while to get through to Nationwide, but they were very good and they apologised." The blunder will come as a blow to a building society which has successfully marked itself out as offering something different from the scandal-hit big banks. Nationwide said earlier this month that it had seen a 45pc increase in people transferring their main account to the society, including branch, online and telephone applications. A statement issued by Nationwide said: "We have identified an issue where some current account card transactions made on July 24 were duplicated on July 25. "This is a one-off isolated incident and is down to human error. The duplicated transactions will be corrected overnight. "We would like to apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and we can assure customers that should they incur any related charges these will be refunded in full." Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer body Which?, said: "This again raises wider questions about how robust banks' systems and safeguards are as consumers bear the brunt of yet another banking glitch."

Nipping a killer in the bud
Risk factor: pioneering trial could save lives Christine Doyle
12:01AM GMT 23 Nov 2004
Comments
Christine Doyle looks at a new screening technique to detect the earliest signs of breast cancer
Diana Quay has known since she was 19, when her mother died from breast cancer, that she is at an increased risk of contracting it herself. The disease also caused the death of her grandmother. Quay has learnt to live with the anxiety of her family inheritance. "You put it out of your mind, but it is like a cloud always hanging over you," she says. For some women, the fear that they might develop breast cancer leads to obsessive self-checking, sometimes to the detriment of their lives. Quay, a former journalist, is fairly unflappable. However, she is now 52, one year older than her mother was when she died. "This concentrates the mind," she says. So she had no hesitation in accepting an invitation to take part in a pioneering trial, at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, of a new technique to detect the very earliest signs of breast cancer. Four weeks ago, a tiny fibre optic telescope - the size of a pinhead - was inserted into each of the six milk ducts in both her breasts. The ducts were examined for signs of minute changes in the lining and a build-up of the tiniest early cluster of malignant cells. "Our aim is to identify when women like Diana move from being at high risk of developing cancer to being at imminent risk," says Mr Gerald Gui, the consultant breast surgeon who is leading the research with Dr Ros Eeles in the Marsden's department of cancer genetics.

"This is a new and exciting field in the early diagnosis of cancer cells, well before they have had a chance to spread. The technique, ductal endoscopy, provides the sharpest glimpse yet into breast tissue. It could also lead to dramatic improvements in treatment. We could, for example, use the approach to treat a tumour directly through the telescope, without surgery as we understand it today." Patients in the study are drawn from women at high or moderately high risk of breast cancer because of a strong family history. Some, like Quay, are already patients at the Royal Marsden. "I am lucky. I have a wonderful GP who has always sent me for regular checks at the Marsden," says Quay. "Each time I go, I have a physical examination, a mammogram and an ultrasound scan. I had four lumps removed. All were benign, thank goodness." As well as the concern about the risks of frequent exposure to radiation, mammography is less accurate in detecting cancer in the denser breast tissue of younger women. This uncertainty leads some women who are at high risk to consider such extreme preventive action as a double mastectomy. Quay does not know whether she possesses a specific gene, so her precise level of risk is not clear. "Genetic tests could not be carried out, as neither my mother nor my grandmother was alive," she says. Women at high risk are sometimes also offered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound scans, but even these tests are not fool-proof. "The advanced technology being developed at the Royal Marsden and in Japan and America could help to save many more lives," says Mr Gui. The first step in the trial involves attaching a syringe to the nipple - rather like using a mechanical pump to express milk after childbirth - and withdrawing a tiny amount of fluid. "We analyse the cells in this fluid for a range of potential cancer markers, such as tumour growth factors. Breast cancer most commonly develops in the lining of the ducts, which is in direct contact with the fluid," he says. "We compare the fluid from each breast. We are also studying the fluid in the unaffected breasts of patients who have had breast cancer and are at heightened subsequent risk of cancer." Quay's first test disclosed some potentially cancerous cells. "I was invited back for the second step, a technique called ductal lavage." This involves inserting tiny catheters into the ducts to draw out a much larger volume of fluid. Again, potentially suspicious changes were found, but no actual malignancy. "I was offered a choice. I could decide on a wait-and-watch approach, or go on to the next step, using the telescope camera. I felt privileged to have the tests, so decided to carry on." Intense scrutiny through the telescope of the lining of the ducts showed that Quay is in no immediate danger. In effect, she is now on a kind of red alert and will be screened again using the telescope in six months. "I just hope this trial will mean more accurate tests for women at high risk - and, perhaps, lead to an improved screening test for all women."

Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge
Catherine Elizabeth "Kate" Middleton, born 9 January 1982, became HRH the Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William.
kate middleton profile »
The Duchess of Cambridge went from being Prince William's flatmate to the future King's wife after their wedding on April 29, 2011. The couple met at St Andrews University where they were both studying history of art, although William later switched to geography. Born on January 9, 1982, Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, known as Kate, is the eldest child of businessman Michael and former air hostess Carole Middleton. She was privately educated at the £15,000-a-year Marlborough College, where she was captain of the school hockey team, a keen netball player and played in the first pair at tennis. One college master described her as an A-grade pupil and an all rounder who was popular throughout the school. Read full Kate Middleton profile

Barack Obama picks Senator Joe Biden as vice president running mate The Democratic Party's presidential candidate has chosen Senator Joe Biden to be his running mate in the election. Link to this video
7:58AM BST 23 Aug 2008
Comments
A party official broke the news late last night, pre-empting a planned announcement by text message to party workers and reporters. The choice of Mr Biden, a veteran of congress with a 30-year history in the Senate, suggested that Mr Obama was keen to balance his own youthful, dynamic image with greater experience. The Delaware senator, a working class Catholic by origin, has a substantial track record in foreign affairs - an area perceived as a weakness for Mr Obama by some political pundits. A native of Pennsylvania, Mr Biden could also bring to the ticket some of the blue collar support that appeared to be slipping from Mr Obama in the later stages of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. However, Mr Biden also carries some potential weaknesses that could upset the campaign over the next two and a half months before November's election. Related Articles

21 Aug 2008
He is known for verbose, gaffe-strewn speeches that have landed him in trouble with rival politicians. On one occasion he was caught lifting lines from a speech by Neil Kinnock, bringing an end to his 1988 bid for the presidency. However, he might also be better able to launch the sort of hostile attacks on the Republican Party candidate Sen John McCain that would appear unseemly coming from Mr Obama. Last night a McCain campaign official launched its first attack on Mr Biden, using comments he made during the presidential primaries. Mr McCain's spokesman Ben Porrit said Mr Biden had "denounced Barack Obama's poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what Americans are quickly realising - that Barack Obama is not ready to be president."
The presidential candidate and his chosen vice presidential partner will campaign together late this evening in Springfield Illinois. Have your say: Is Mr Biden the best choice for Mr Obama's running mate? Barack Obama
