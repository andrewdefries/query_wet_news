Eurozone inflation hits 2.7pc, raises rate rise fears
Eurozone inflation has hit 2.7pc and is above 3pc once Britain and the rest of the EU are included, raising expectations of sharper interest rates rises.
The annual rate of inflation across the 27-state EU as a whole, which also includes Poland as well as Britain, hit 3.1pc in March, up from 2.9pc in February. Photo: ALAMY 11:25AM BST 15 Apr 2011
Comments
A faster-than-forecast acceleration in the annual rate, according to revised European Union data, showed prices shooting upwards right across Europe - fuelled by a spike in energy costs.
The March rate for the 17 states that share the euro currency had initially been pegged at 2.6pc - way above European Central Bank (ECB) hopes for medium-term inflation at below 2pc. A little over a year ago, the figure was just 0.8pc.
Eurostat, the European statistics office, said the biggest upward pressure on the cost of living stemmed from fuel for transport, heating oil and electricity and gas.
Last week the ECB lifted its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly three years - in a signal to markets that price stability, rather than debt worries in Greece, Portugal or Ireland, is its top priority.
The data "increases the risk that the ECB could tighten interest rates more aggressively", said Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight in London.

"We expect the ECB to lift interest rates by a further 25 basis points to 1.5pc around midyear," he said. He sees it hitting 2.5pc by the end of 2012.
Higher rates will raise borrowing costs for debt-laden EU nations Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
The annual rate across the 27-state EU as a whole, which also includes Poland as well as Britain, hit 3.1pc in March, up from 2.9pc in February.
Ireland had the lowest rate of inflation, 1.2pc, and Romania the highest at 8pc. Economics

Freshen up with a carrot salad
Crave something clean and healthy after the excesses of Christmas? Try a crisp carrot salad. Carrots Photo: RUTHLEWISILLUSTRATIONS.COM	By Bee Wilson
3:00PM GMT 09 Jan 2013

After the feasts, the fast. I find myself craving clean healthy flavours, as well as things that don't cost much. Carrot salad fits the bill on all counts. It's cheap, zingy and doesn't taste anything like turkey. It's what I often make at those end-of-the week moments before the next shop.
But what kind to make? As Naomi Duguid writes in a beautiful and original new book, Burma: Rivers of Flavor (Artisan £25), 'carrot salads exist in many culinary traditions'. Duguid claims that her own Mandalay grated-carrot salad 'takes the prize'. She likes it so much, she eats it with rice as a main course 'rather than a side salad'. This piques my interest as a connoisseur of carrot salads. Can a Burmese version really be better than a French carottes râpées, which I think of as the ur-version? The crucial ingredient for carottes râpées is a food processor with a grater attachment, which obliterates the carrots into fine shreds. The carrot becomes so sweet, bathed in its own orange juices, that it needs little dressing. A glug of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, a sprinkle of parsley and you have the perfect accompaniment to a platter of hard-boiled eggs and home-made mayonnaise with crusty bread. Completely different, but no less delicious, are the cooked carrot salads of North Africa and the Middle East. The peeled carrots are boiled whole, so that they don't become watery. Only then are they sliced and mixed with garlic, oil, lemon and perhaps some cumin and green coriander. In some versions, spicy harissa is added. When served at room temperature with hummus, pickles and flatbreads, this makes a frugal meze. Carrot salads seem to be more changeable in mood and form than the classic salad of green leaves. You can dress them up with pumpkin seeds, feta and mint for a healthfood lunch box. Or mix with shredded red cabbage and onion as a pungent coleslaw to go with baked ham. Take batons, steam them, pour over oil, red-wine vinegar, parsley and a smidge of crushed garlic, and wait a few hours, and you have an Italian carrot salad. Should you possess a swivel peeler, you can 'peel' off long ribbons of carrot and give them a Japanese tinge with ginger, soy and lime. Related Articles

Can a Burmese carrot salad really be better than all of these? Until I read Duguid's book, I was woefully ignorant of the cuisine of Burma, this country just emerging 'from a black hole of oppression'. Burma's food, it turns out, has echoes of its neighbours in Thailand and India. The Mandalay carrot salad is salty from fish sauce. (It should have powdered dried shrimp, too, a very Burmese flavour, but I had none.) Peanuts and toasted chickpea flour bring nuttiness. There's chilli for heat, fried shallots for comfort and coriander for herbal vigour. The grated carrots are pounded a little in a mortar with lime juice, before the whole salad is mixed together. The amalgam of flavours is as heady as a Thai green papaya salad, but sweeter. Truly, this is a prince among carrot salads, and one I intend to eat, with simple white rice, tonight.

Osama bin Laden dead: al-Qaeda 'planning to attack trains on 9/11 anniversary'
Computer files seized during the raid on Osama bin Laden's hideout show al-Qaeda were planning a "spectacular" attack on trains in the US on September 11, 2011, the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy.

11:42PM BST 05 May 2011
The terrorist network is thought to have been planning to tamper with tracks so that a train would be derailed while crossing a bridge or valley, potentially killing hundreds of passengers. The plan, developed in February last year, was disclosed by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which issued a warning about it to law enforcement agencies around the US. "We wanted to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting," Matthew Chandler, a DHS spokesman, said on Thursday night. "It is unclear if any further planning has been conducted". The plot is said to have been in the "aspirational", rather than "operational" stages. No specific locations had been selected. But it will intensify long-standing fears that this year's tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks will attract new threats. The DHS said since Sunday's raid it had sent more officers to protect American airports and reviewed "protective measures for all potential terrorist targets", including the entire US transport system.

It is also considering "new targeting rules" to help them identify "the risk of both passengers and cargo coming to the United States," Mr Chandler said. The plot emerged as sources said the CIA could read details of senior al-Qaeda leaders on the so-called "treasure trove" of computer files, because they were not encrypted. Al-Qaeda

Sarah Brown says no to veal meal at G8 In an act of conscience unlikely to endear her to a nation of avid meat-eaters, Sarah Brown twice refused to eat veal during official receptions at the G8 summit in Italy. On both occasions when veal was offered, Mrs Brown turned it down Photo: EPA	By Nick Squires in L'Aquila 7:00AM BST 11 Jul 2009
The Prime Minister's wife has long-standing objections to the way in which calves are reared in crates and kept in the dark to ensure their meat is white.
Veal is a popular dish in Italy and featured twice on menus for the spouses of G8 leaders during the three-day summit in L'Aquila.
Mrs Brown, 45, said yesterday she hoped she would not be offered veal again on the final day of the summit.
Writing on Twitter, she said: "Am hoping that no veal served at lunch again today - have declined it twice this trip as just feel very strongly about it."
Her stance was welcomed by animal welfare organisations.
"What Sarah Brown did was fantastic and it was absolutely the right thing to do," said an RSPCA spokesman.
"We are always happy when any high profile figure makes a statement against the cruel treatment of animals, which is what Sarah did.
"The RSPCA has been campaigning against white, European veal for some time.
"It is a very cruel practice, whereby calves are kept in crates and are fed a diet of milk to keep their flesh white." However, British farming groups pointed out that calves are now raised in much better conditions. They also said there was a big difference between the way veal calves were raised on the Continent and the conditions under which they are kept in Britain.
"Veal produced in the UK is high welfare, commonly known as rosé veal. It is subject to strict regulation on animal welfare," said a spokesman for Eblex, a division of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.
While rejecting veal, Mrs Brown nevertheless tucked into some unusual Italian specialities during the visit, including green pea ice cream, which she pronounced "delicious".
While the Prime Minister was involved with the summit, Mrs Brown had a busy schedule of her own, having a private audience with Pope Benedict XVI and touring L'Aquila, which was badly damaged by April's earthquake.

Could Oviedo be the world's best place to live?
Samantha Chappell, formerly of the Telegraph's Court & Social desk, now lives in Oviedo, Asturias, in northern Spain, and she can't believe her luck. Image 1 of 3	Image 1 of 3	The town hall, Oviedo.

Where I live
Woody Allen said: "Oviedo is delicious, exotic, beautiful, clean, pleasant, peaceful and kind to pedestrians. It's as if it doesn't belong to this world, as if it could not possibly exist ... Oviedo is like a fairy tale." Oviedo is considered to be one of the most beautiful Cities in Northern Spain and its delightful Old Town is no exception. It is close to Calle Uria, the main shopping avenue and centre yet the Old Town remains the heart. Full of pretty plazas and charming narrow streets, the City´s rich artistic and cultural legacy continues in this atmospheric quarter. It is also well served by bars, restaurants and a lively market square. It's clean, safe and compact – everything is easily accessible on foot. Transport links are good and the airport is only a 35 minute bus ride away. What´s available?
The Spanish tend to favour flats (or “pisos”) and you can find spacious accommodation in honey-coloured buildings, with red roof tiles and smart iron clad balconies, some of which are set above beautifully restored colonnaded porticoes. Price range
A 2/3 bed flat costs between €500 and €1,500 – a 1 bed flat between €400 and €800 per month. This usually includes the monthly service charge for cleaning and maintenance of the building. Is it good value?
For less than €500 per month it’s possible to live in the historic Old Town or in the centre. The price of accommodation and transport is very good value, as is the cost of wining and dining. Inside track
Northern Spain has not suffered the same property crisis as the costas. It´s still possible to find some real bargains in Oviedo or the surrounding countryside. If you are relocating, do enlist the help of a local person who can negotiate – but be quick – Oviedo is Spain´s best kept secret. In my dreams
A casa rural or finca on the outskirts, with views of the spectacular landscape. Tell us where you think the world’s best place to live is and automatically enter a prize draw worth £2,000

Nasa release video of spectacular solar eruption
A Nasa satellite has captured spectacular images of a solar flare erupting from the eastern side of the sun. 10:00AM BST 17 Apr 2012
Comments
Judged only to be medium-sized by the US space agency, the powerful flare erupted from the sun on Monday and was caught on camera by Nasa's SDO satellite. The ejections of plasma, known as coronal mass ejections (CME), can cause electrical storms and vivid displays of the aurora borealis phenomena on Earth, but this flare was not fired in our direction according to scientists. The strength of solar flares, caused by the release of magnetic energy stored in the sun's atmosphere, is measured on a letter scale by astronomers The strongest eruptions, which can release as much energy as one billion megatons of TNT, fall into three categories – C, M and X – with X marking the strongest. The latest flare registered as an M1 class, placing it in the middle of the scale. Related Articles

Andrew Flintoff was brave to fight and sensible to call it a day as an undefeated boxer
Andrew Flintoff looks certain to leave the ring like Joe Calzaghe and Rocky Marciano: undefeated.
Unbeaten and retired: Andrew Flintoff has made the right choice Photo: ACTION IMAGES	By Paul Hayward, Chief Sports Writer

His masochistic urge satisfied by victory over America’s Richard Dawson in a four-round bout in Manchester, Flintoff has confirmed only what we already knew: 1. Boxing is dangerous, painful and not to be messed around with. 2. He is braver than most of us. 3. Big Fred is a restless soul forever in need of a “challenge”, usually via an accompanying documentary. Historians of the sweet science will not linger over his contribution, but well done, anyway.

Extracts from the 'Sunrise on the Southbound Sleeper' book of great rail journeys
From Dervla Murphy's brush with death in Cuba to a teach-in on railway science: more extracts from 'Sunrise on the Southbound Sleeper'. Image 1 of 2	The train on the line to Lhasa Image 1 of 2	Bina Junction, on Stephen McClarence's route across India 12:03PM GMT 04 Nov 2011

Anthony Peregrine recalls the highs and lows of a trip along the Riviera
The views are the stuff of arias. Rocks plunge straight to a sea spangled by light so clear that it must have come direct from the Creation. Here and there, they grant beaches and bays. For mile after mile, this seascape remains powerful, elegant and immense. It enters through the eyes and gladdens the whole being. The journey is, in short, coming right. Then it goes wrong. Somewhere around Toulon, the SNCF halts the train for an hour, then two. "Difficulties on the line," we are told. In other words, the problem is that there's a problem. The carriage swells with mutterings and barking into mobile phones. The French demand perfection but anticipate anarchy, and are well-schooled in amplifying it. Related Articles

After two hours, nine minutes, the train starts moving, but backwards. "Perfect," the lady across the way screeches into a phone. "We're going backwards!" Then we stop again. ("We've stopped again!") Wisely, no SNCF representative makes an appearance, for there is a sharp tang of Great Terror in the air. But then, on two hours, 23 minutes, we move forwards – and keep going. ("Here's a novelty – a train that's moving bloody forwards." She must be talking to her husband. Anyone else would have hung up ages ago.) Back on the rails: Sunrise on the Southbound Sleeper: The New Telegraph Book of Great Railway Journeys, edited by Michael Kerr, is published by Aurum Press. Order it from Telegraph Books (0844 871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk) for £20 plus £1.25 p&p. Fionnuala McHugh, en route from Hong Kong to Lhasa, sees the Chinese settle down for the night
I got into my pyjamas, in local fashion, and wandered up and down the corridor, listening to the pre-bedtime chat in Cantonese and Mandarin. There was a six-day-old baby in the compartment next to ours, tightly wrapped in a pink blanket and laid out in the middle of the lower bunk like a delicious offering of dim sum; there was a ring of cardplayers two compartments along, laughing and groaning over piles of yuan; there was a line of teeth-brushers and hawkers and spitters in the washrooms (a sign above the basins said "No sitting or lying"); there were early snorers and late snackers. On a Chinese train, if you look through any open door, someone inside will be eating, and if you grin widely enough and linger long enough – and especially if you're that object of curiosity, a lone foreign woman with a (shamefully) tiny amount of Mandarin – that someone will probably offer you a share of whatever's going. Cuba runs a rum sort of railway, says Dervla Murphy
With rucksack on lap, because I couldn't see where to store it, I leant back in my seat and received a small but painful scalp wound; it oozed enough blood to matt my hair. Where a headrest had been, three sharp metal spikes protruded. My bag contained one tin of Bucanero [beer], for emergencies. I now felt its time had come and quickly drank it – a mistake… In due course those 355ml sought the exit and by the light of a full moon, newly emerged from dispersing clouds, I located the baño – seemingly occupied. Having waited a reasonable time, I tried the door again, pushing hard. It swung open to reveal a vacuum: below was Mother Earth. At a certain point one ceases to believe in the reality of what's happening – it must all be an illusion – yet somehow one has to go along with it. But for the moon, I would have stepped forward to my death – not exactly a premature death but an unpleasant and rather silly way to go. The door bore a prominent notice – DANGER! DO NOT OPEN! – but some more drastic deterrent is required in an unlit train that travels by night. Sandi Toksvig recalls the days of railway glamour
Years ago I worked with Evelyn Laye. I was 23 at the time and each evening after the show was commanded to her dressing room, where the still glamorous actress would dispense anecdotes and champagne in equal measure. She told me about touring the United States by train in the 1930s with Noël Coward. Each of the stars had his or her own railway carriage with name emblazoned on the side, which lit up as they passed through stations. That is glamour. That would be wonderful. Failing that, of course, a little actual beef in the Euston-to-Preston beef sandwiches would be nice. Stephen McClarence crosses India from west to east
Back on the train, at Wankaner Junction, the fourth passenger joins our compartment: Mr Patel. He spends silent hours totting up figures on his two pocket calculators. I spot the words "Coal Cost Comparison" on one of his pads. We also have a few unanticipated travelling companions. A man perches on one side of Mr Vyas, with a young female paediatrician on the other. An older woman has sat down next to Clare and a mother and her son slump in silence on the side berth. Above them, on the top bunk, a fat man with three chunky gold rings sits cross-legged and stares down at us like a predatory eagle. Nine people in a space about 10ft by 6ft. We're in no danger of feeling lonely. Peter Hughes makes a circuit of South Korea
A woman on an electric invalid carriage with a bicycle basket on the front was tracing carefree arabesques on the shining floor. I was so taken with the rapture of her patterns that I failed to spot the mops at either end of her machine. It turned out she was a cleaner. Sometimes we will foreign places to be more foreign than they are. Train number 1621, the 08:25 Mugunghwa to Gyeongju, was waiting at platform seven. It wore Korail's raspberry-and-white livery and seemed to be compressed beneath the large air-conditioning units on its roof. Mugunghwa trains are the stopping expresses that complement the hardly stopping high-speed KTX. They are the cheapest of Korea's cross-country trains and take their name from a hibiscus, sometimes known as rose althea or the Rose of Sharon, which is the national flower of Korea. Mugung in Korean also means eternity, which is not such a good name for a train. Ysenda Maxtone Graham visits a railway research centre
In the little computer room were three brilliant computer scientists. They talked in that mathematical way about n: their n is the smallest number possible to separate all the various conditions in a component's action. They had made a graph of the opening of an automatic door and had discovered that in the opening of a door, there are 15 features that can be separated into 23 fault conditions, plus the faultless condition called "good door". "Peak force in first second," said the graph, at a jagged pinnacle. Then: "positive area under force-time curve until door opens". And doors, of course, are child's play compared with engines. They were a fulfilled and excited bunch in that computer room; they had a sense of humour and a sparkle in their eyes. At five o'clock, everyone went home, many of them by train, and all of them highly sensitive to sounds, bounces, jolts and small time-intervals.
