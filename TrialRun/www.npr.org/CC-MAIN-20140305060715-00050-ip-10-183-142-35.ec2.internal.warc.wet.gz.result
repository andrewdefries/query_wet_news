Food For Thought This Music Is Bananas (Really)
by Audrey Carlsen
February 21, 201312:17 PM

J.Viewz/YouTube
J.Viewz is using a cool little circuit board called the MaKey MaKey (pronounced may-kee may-kee) that allows you to hook almost anything up to a keyboard.

Pronunciamentos: Saying It Right
by Jeffrey A. Dvorkin
November 08, 200512:00 AM
NPR is considered by many to be the standard bearer for Standard American English. Listeners from around the country and around the world say that they find NPR English is the clearest and most comprehensible broadcast English available. They can hear that crisp American English on NPR member stations, on their Web sites, on line at npr.org or on the listeners' shortwave receivers. Visitors to Washington, D.C. may note that upon entering a D.C. taxicab, the car radio is often tuned to one of the two local NPR member stations — WAMU or WETA. The drivers, many of whom hail from Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, tell me that listening to NPR helps improve their English. Language and pronunciation are important to many public radio listeners, possibly because they are (so the audience research tells us) a well-read and information-hungry group. So listeners are quick to point out examples of any perceived lowering of standards. As ombudsman, I receive a regular flow of comments and observations about language on NPR. These are regularly forwarded to the staff and to Kee Malesky, NPR's reference librarian. She keeps track of these comments and issues timely reminders to NPR's on-air staff about correct pronunciations, especially when reporters need prompting about foreign names and places. Over the last few weeks, I have received an unusually large number of comments about NPR pronunciations and uses of grammar, including one from the program director from NPR member station WMUB in Oxford, Ohio: I was listening... at 10 o'clock on Friday, Nov. 4 and I heard the news of violent protests in the capital of Uruguay. I was mortified, however, when I heard the reporter pronounce the name of the capital as "Mont-e-VID-eo" instead of "Monte-vid-AY-o". As a whole, we Americans slaughter most other language pronunciations, but I expected more from... NPR. John Hingsbergen Newscasters often write their copy at the last minute before racing into the studio. But double checking the pronunciation of foreign words with a colleague is always useful on deadline. Accuracy? Or Clarity? A Tough Choice The question of how to pronounce foreign names and places has always been a point of lively discussion among listeners and staff. Should we err on the side of meticulous accuracy? Or unambiguous clarity? Should we say "Pah-REE" instead of Paris? The former is linguistically correct, but that sounds très pretentious to American ears. And perhaps this is an important point not to be lost: NPR is in the business of communicating news and information to a primarily American audience. 'Linguism?' Some who contact me are hearing reporters who pronounce place names in an indigenous manner. This moved listener Peter Hall to ask how NPR decides which foreign words should be pronounced as the locals might and which should be pronounced with an American accent: Why do I hear NPR announcers pronouncing some foreign names (including their own) and place names with a foreign accent, but others without? It's jolting to hear a story that's mostly in broadcast English but peppered with foreign-accented wor
