Correction Nov. 15, 2007
In this story, NPR reported that about a quarter of low-income people who receive Medicare's extra help for drug costs will need to switch drug plans to keep the government subsidy. Actually, they can stay in their current plans and keep the extra help, but they'll have to pay higher premiums to do so. The story below has been revised accordingly.

Copyright ©2007 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MICHELE NORRIS, host: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Michele Norris. ANDREA SEABROOK, host: And I'm Andrea Seabrook. Half a dozen start-up companies are competing to be the first to fly paying passengers to the edge of space on a regular basis. Some of the better-known players are building futuristic-looking spacecraft. Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports one Oklahoma company is taking a different approach. It's modifying an old plane and an uneven older spaceport.
