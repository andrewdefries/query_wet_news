Priscilla Nielsen for NPR
This winter, our independent booksellers have selected books that range in subject from toasters to typeface, odd bookmarks to old Volkswagens, department stores to pasta design. Whether you need a picture book for a toddler, kid lit for a young reader, or quirky nonfiction for the grown-up set, these booksellers have just the thing on their shelves. Sift through top picks below, from Lucia Silva, the book buyer at Portrait of a Bookstore in Studio City, Calif; Rona Brinlee of The BookMark in Neptune Beach, Fla.; and Daniel Goldin of Boswell Book Co. in Milwaukee. Happy reading!

Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?
I was snooping in another great independent bookstore with a big children's section, looking for a Christmas book for my daughter. After flipping through dozens of glossy picture books filled with beribboned gifts, bearded Santas and bucolic mangers, my eyes started to glaze over. I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, but I knew that none of these were it. When I opened A Christmas Tree for Pyn, I sat down on the floor and read the whole thing, and by the time I got to the last word, I was that lady crying in the kids' section. A Christmas Tree for Pyn isn't about Santa or presents or the three wise men, and it's not about cliches like "making do" or "it's the thought that counts." Like Truman Capote's A Christmas Memory, it's about the real emotional core of the holiday — that Christmassy feeling we're all looking for. I can't think of a more lovely gift for a new family than this one — a truly beautiful book that will be enjoyed by young and old for many years to come.

Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?
Easily my favorite book this year, The Toaster Project should be required reading for artists, designers, consumers and anyone who has ever bought or thrown away a toaster. Thomas Thwaites, a graduate student at London's Royal College of Art, sets out to build a toaster from scratch — not just an object that toasts bread, but one that aesthetically and mechanically replicates the ubiquitous $6 drugstore toaster.After dissecting a live toaster to uncover its 400 separate parts, he embarks on a project that takes nine months, thousands of dollars and nearly 2,000 miles of travel. He mines his own iron ore to make into steel (and smelts it in a microwave), pillages an abandoned mica mine, and puzzles out making plastic, copper wire and nickel connectors.Thwaites is a laugh-out-loud-funny but thoughtful guide through his own adventures, touching provocatively on ideas as far-ranging as medieval metallurgy, sustainability, mass production and our "throwaway" consumer culture. You'll buy it as a gift for the title and the concept, but you'll end up keeping it for yourself once you crack the cover — so take my advice and buy two.

Lebanese Kibbe Recipes January 31, 2008  Kibbe is a dish of minced meat with bulgur and spices with many variants, eaten raw or cooked. Regarded as the national dish of Lebanon, there are as many ways to prepare and serve kibbe as there are to spell it.
