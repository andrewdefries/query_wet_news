< Pakistani Televangelist Is Back On Air, Raising Fears August 18, 2012 6:53 AM
Copyright ©2012 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Pakistan has its own version of TV evangelists. They're Islamic preachers who hold call-in shows on cable television. Like some of their Christian counterparts in the United States, they have had their share of scandal. One host fled Pakistan after embezzlement allegations. Others are accused of spewing hate speech. NPR's Lauren Frayer has this profile of Pakistan's most popular televangelist. He's just been rehired despite accusations that he has blood on his hands. (SOUNDBITE OF GEO TV BROADCAST) AAMIR LIAQUAT: (Foreign language spoken) LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Aamir Liaquat is once again the face of Pakistan's biggest and richest private TV station, Geo TV.
