For many voters, religion and politics are deeply intertwined. John Green of the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life and Robert Putnam, author of American Grace, talk about how politics may be changing religion, and which issues voters decide on based on faith.
Copyright Â© 2010 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. NEAL CONAN, host: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. For many of us, religion and politics are deeply and personally intertwined, yet we view some issues through the lens of our faith but not others. A recent Pew survey finds that religion plays a key role in views of abortion and same-sex marriage but very little on some other hot-button issues like immigration and the environment. Why the divide? And what's the effect when churches become more overtly political? Later in the program, what could be a looming crisis over China's claim to all of the South China Sea, but first what political issues do you see through the lens of your faith, and on what issues do your political views and religious convictions diverge? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. In a few moments, Robert Putnam, the co-author of "American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us," joins us, and he says more Americans are adjusting their religious views to fit their politics. But first, John Green, he's a research advisor to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life and a professor of political science at the University of Akron in Ohio, with us now from his office there. John Green, nice of you to be with us today. Professor JOHN GREEN (Political Science, University of Akron): Oh, it's good to be with you. CONAN: And you helped design the Pew survey. I'd like to talk in a moment about the survey itself and what you asked people, but let's start with that finding we mentioned at the top: Religion plays a role in how people view some political issues, primarily social ones, but not others. Do you have a sense of what's driving that divide? Prof. GREEN: Well, it's really pretty interesting because I think most people would not be surprised that religious beliefs would influence opinions on abortion or same-sex marriage really either way, conservative or liberal direction. But given the amount of activism we've seen recently on issues like immigration and the environment on the part of religious organizations and clergy, it was to some people a little bit surprising that those issues seemed to have very little impact on the attitudes that people had. CONAN: It's important to point out this was not specifically a survey about religion. Prof. GREEN: No, it (Technical difficulties) about politics, really, and we were (technical difficulties) various things that might influence people's opinions on a variety of issues. And the way the question was asked was to ask people what the most important influence on their opinion was. So this isn't a comprehensive measure, but it does tell us where people think their religion or their education or their personal experience were the most important impact on their opinion. CONAN: So if you go to the findings, religion ranked as the most important influence on several hot-button issues. You mentioned abortion and same-sex marriage. Those might be issues that people say, wait a minute, these are overtly religious. They're spoken about in the Bible. Prof. GREEN: (Technical difficulties), of course one could also argue that charity towards the poor or being good stewards of the environment are also spoken about in scripture, the Bible or other religious scriptures, as well. So I think what may be going on here is not just what happens to be within a religious tradition but also how those connections happen to be emphasized. We've been talking a lot about abortion and other social issues for about 40 years now. Much of that discussion has been in the context of faith, really on both sides of those arguments. But some of the newer issues, such as immigration, really have not been discussed for very long in a faith-based context. CONAN: And in a faith-based context, most or many religious leaders would argue against the current trend of American public opinion. Prof. GREEN: Yes, indeed, and so it is interesting. I think part of this may just be history. There's another factor here that I think is important: Some issues are easier to connect with religious values, and some are more difficult. And because of the traditional emphasis in many religious institutions on sexual morality, perhaps it is easier for some people to draw a straight-line connection between beliefs and views on sexual matters, such as abortion or homosexuality. It may be when we come to other public policy issues like the environment or welfare payments or immigration that there's not quite as easy a path between religious beliefs and political attitudes. CONAN: Well, is it also possible that people hold a certain set of beliefs, and they're the ones we see reflected in the opinion polls, and when they're in church, they accept the church's teaching on those they agree with the church on, whatever church or synagogue or mosque that may be, and when they - when the teachings of their religious leaders diverge from their opinions, they stick to their opinions? Prof. GREEN: You know, that's entirely possible. Many of us have selective perception of arguments, not just in a religious context but in other contexts, as well. And, you know, it may very well be that people tune out teachings that they really don't want to hear. CONAN: For example, why would they not hear something about charity or, you know, welcoming a poor neighbor? Prof. GREEN: Exactly. It may very well be that there are teachings, and the same survey had some reports on what people were hearing in their congregations, and people were hearing about some of these issues where they didn't report much of a religious connection with their attitudes. So it may be partly people screen out the things that they don't want to hear, but it also could be that they have other opinions. For instance on the issue of immigration, religious values might be one factor in opinion, but issues of national security might be another factor. Or in the case of welfare payments, it may be that arguments for charity are one kind of basis for an opinion, but economic interests might be another argument. And in fact, if we could ask people a lot more questions, we might find that on some of these issues, religion is an influence. It's just the fourth or fifth influence and not the first influence on their opinion. CONAN: Let's bring another voice into the conversation: Robert Putnam, the author of many books, including "Bowling Alone." His latest, co-authored with David Campbell, is "American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us." He's also a professor of public policy at Harvard and joins us today from member station WBUR in Boston. Nice to have you with us today. Professor ROBERT PUTNAM (Public Policy, Harvard University): Good to be back, Neal, and good to be on this show with John Green, who is one of the gurus of religious studies in America. CONAN: Well, I wonder what you make of his latest survey. Prof. PUTNAM: Well, I think it's a really interesting study, and it rhymes with much of the things that we investigated in the course of our research. The one additional point I'd make about it is that it's possible that what people hear, or think they're going to hear, opinions in church, that they personally disagree with, they don't change their opinions, and they don't just tune out, but they actually stop going to church. That is in some sense, it's possible, at least, that people's views on many of these issues, especially the issues of sexuality and family values that John has been talking about, their values are actually most fundamental, and if they come to think that religion is wrong on those issues or that religious preachers or that organized religion is wrong on those issues, they vote with their feet and leave. And indeed, I think one of the things that we've discovered in our work, which this is a - the book "American Grace," that David Campbell and I have written, is a big book, and it covers a lot of topics, but one of the topics that we talk about is the so-called rise of the young nones, that is young people over the last - that's N-O-N-E-S, not N-U-N. CONAN: I was going to say, not Catholic sisters. Prof. PUTNAM: No but the rise of the people who say, when you ask them what religion they have, they say I don't have any religion, I'm just not religious at all. Historically, that figure in America was roughly five percent of Americans said they had no religion, and 95 percent said they had some religion. But among young people, since 1990, among the people who were basically 20-somethings across the country, that figure has now skyrocketed from about five percent to about 25 or 30 percent, a huge increase in detachment from organized religion among America's young people. And that has a number of causes, but we think we have evidence that the most important factor is that for those young people, people who are coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s, for them, looking around, religion seemed to be mostly about sexual morality and, as they would have seen it, intolerance and homophobia and so on, and they had a very -much more tolerant view, especially about homosexuality. And so many of them said, well, if religion is just about being a conservative Republican, that's not for me, and they stopped thinking of themselves as religious at all. CONAN: They may not have been around in church to hear those other messages about charity and immigration. But John Green, I wonder how you - would that comport with some of the things that you're finding, not necessarily in this survey but in others? Prof. GREEN: Oh, I think so. And by the way, it's a great pleasure to be on this program with Bob Putnam, who is really very insightful on these issues. Religion influences politics, but politics can also influence religion. And over time, we may see people sorting themselves into environments where they hear the kinds of messages they find congenial, and they may be absencing themselves entirely. And Neal, your point, which is a useful one, if young people were leaving traditional churches because they were hearing what they regarded as messages of intolerance, they might not be around to hear the messages about charity and being good stewards of the environment. And so in some sense, they are out of the mix, and that may help explain some of our finding. CONAN: Well, let's get a caller in on the conversation. Josh(ph) is calling from Charlotte. JOSH (Caller): Hey, how are you guys doing? CONAN: Very well, thanks. JOSH: So actually, it's a good place for me to jump right in here. You know, I was just - my thoughts listening to all this, well, first of all, I'm 24 years old, a graduate from Liberty University's Helms School of Government, and I used to work for Congressman Joe Wilson. And I am also a former missionary kid. I spent most of my childhood overseas. So I am both very religious and very political. And the thing I think you're going to find, and I think that might have something to do with some of your findings, is that I find that a lot of people my age, well, in general, are people who are sincerely religious, and that is to say they're using, you know, it influences their whole lives, including their politics, tend to take most of their opinions and most of their voting and whatnot to the - at the local level, at the state level, where their influence is more directly felt. I feel like a lot of people, at least people who I talk to that share some of my same beliefs, you know, tend to find that because we respect the separation of church and state, and we find the national stage is not really the place to discuss - what's the word I'm looking - it's not really the place to discuss the - we're not going to force our opinions on the whole nation. However, in my community of people who believe like me, we're going to do the best we can to, you know, to have our communities and whatnot represent us. CONAN: And Josh... JOSH: And so that's why I feel like you might not see a lot of that at the national level. CONAN: Josh, do you also see evidence of what Robert Putnam was talking about, a lot of people being uncomfortable with some of the messages they hear in church and saying, well, might as well just check out? JOSH: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, you see - I absolutely agree with what he's saying. You know, most people my age are absolutely disenfranchised with organized religion. And, you know, and I can understand why to a large degree. I mean, it represents the sort of, you know, archaic, you know, social lifestyle that, you know, a lot of people just don't - people my age just don't relate to. You know, the mood, I mean, the word of the hour is tolerance and, you know - tolerance isn't really the right word. It's more of just socially liberal. You know, our society is socially liberal now, you know, and... CONAN: Josh... JOSH: And I think where really you're seeing the dichotomy with people my age is we're socially liberal, and yet we may be economically conservative, or we may be, because, you know, we're raised in those households seeing those same things that are... CONAN: Josh, thanks very much. We appreciate the phone call. JOSH: No problem. CONAN: All right. Bye-bye. More after a short break. This is NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. Politics is having some surprising effect on religious views in the United States, and vice versa. As we've been listening, a recent Pew survey found religion plays an important role in how people feel about some political debates - mostly social issues like gay marriage - but not others. At the same time, another study shows that many people now shift their religious views to fit their political beliefs. We're talking today about the intersection of faith and politics. Where do your politics and your faith intersect? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Our guest is Robert Putnam, co-author of the book "American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us." There's an excerpt from that book at npr.org if you just click on TALK OF THE NATION. Still with us - just for a few more minutes, he's got another appointment - but John Green, the senior research advisor at the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life. And John Green, while we've got you there, as you investigate this nexus between religion and politics in the Pew Survey and in other contexts, what is surprising you? Prof. GREEN: Well, you know, what's really surprising me right at the moment is the religious aspects of the Tea Party movement, which we've been hearing an awful lot about. In terms of the public statements of Tea Party activists and candidates, it seems to be mostly about economic issues - and I think for a good reason, given the state of the economy. But what we find in our surveys is an awful lot of conservative religious people have also been mobilized by the Tea Party. So it's not surprising that some culturally conservative issues are part of the mix among those people. CONAN: Let's go next to Bob, and Bob's with us from Cleveland. BOB (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. Go ahead, Bob. BOB: Yeah, I had a - I went through kind of an epiphany. I used to be a, you know, a conservative voter, Republican, and then I started to realize like issues on abortion, you know, we'd put Republicans in office like, you know, Ronald Reagan and then the first George Bush, expecting them to appoint justices that would, you know, be against abortion, as much as - but then I began to realize and I began to look at a lot of issues that the Republicans just kind of use these, play religious voters. I mean, if we - if Reagan and Bush and the Republican Party had really wanted to end abortion, they could have done it by now with the chance for appointments they have. I've never seen a justice that a Democrat appoints, you know, change their opinion, you know, like if - and vote against abortion. CONAN: So you feel manipulated. And so - is that an accurate... BOB: Yeah, I felt manipulated, but I also felt they were - you know, they were kind of bending Christian values. Like, you know, you have conservatives referring to homeless as human debris, and that always bothered me as a Christian. But I'd never heard anybody in the Republican say hey - Party, say to these, you know, these very powerful, let's say, political commentators that used words like that, they would never say to them: That's not very Christian. Or at least David Frum did, in a way. But, you know, I found myself becoming much more of - I guess you would say - a Democratic voter now, and, you know, especially after the second Bush, where you had, you know, the debacle at Walter Reed Hospital, where our wounded veterans were, you know, being mistreated. And leading conservatives weren't -you know, just as a Christian thing, you would expect them to say, hey, this is wrong. But it didn't - it, you know, it just seemed like a number of issues, Republicans only seem to talk Christian values. You know, it's just talk. It doesn't really mean anything. So I guess I - it caused me to, you know, kind of change and look for candidates who are really, you know, doing the things they are saying and not just, you know, reciting words that I want to hear. CONAN: Good luck with that, Bob. BOB: Thank you. CONAN: Bye. Appreciate the phone call. Searching for people - you know, I think, Robert Putnam, what Bob was talking about was searching for people who are authentic, who say what they mean. Prof. PUTNAM: Yeah. There was another point that Bob was making that I thought was quite important. You know, the background - we are now all accustomed to thinking of a natural correlation between religion and politics that Republicans are drawn from the more religious end of the spectrum and Democrats from the more secular end. But that's a very recent phenomenon. As recent
