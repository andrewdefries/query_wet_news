The barbershop guys talk about the George Zimmerman trial, and weigh in on Jay-Z's latest album, Magna Carta... Holy Grail. Host Michel Martin talks with law professor Paul Butler, sports writer Pablo Torre, Bostonian Neil Minkoff and culture critic Jimi Izrael.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Now it's time for our weekly visit to the barbershop where the guys talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Sitting in the chairs for a shape-up this week are writer and culture critic Jimi Izrael, with us from Chicago. In Washington D.C., we have Paul Butler. He's a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Pablo Torre is with us from New York. He's a senior writer with ESPN.com. With us from Boston, healthcare consultant and a contributor to the conservative National Review magazine, Neil Minkoff. Take it away, Jimi. JIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Hey fellas, welcome to the shop. How we doing? PAUL BUTLER: What's up? PABLO TORRE: Yo, what's good, man? NEIL MINKOFF: Hey, hey, hey. IZRAEL: Pablo, good to see slumming with us, man. I haven't seen you since yesterday ever since "Around the Horn." It's good to see you're eating well. (LAUGHTER) TORRE: You know, I come back. I can never say no to you guys. You know that. IZRAEL: Okay, bro. Well, let's get things started. The trial of George Zimmerman is wrapping up. We got some tape of those closing arguments, right Michel? MARTIN: We do. And obviously we can only play just a few snippets of what has been a very long, you know, 13-day trial. But the closing arguments have been - are being rendered. Zimmerman, of course, is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. We hear first from Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda for the prosecution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING) BERNIE DE LA RIONDA: He profiled him as a criminal. He assumed certain things, that Trayvon Martin was up to no good and that is what led to his death. MARTIN: Now let's hear from Mark O'Mara for the defense. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING) MARK OMARA: To the extent that there are questions or issues that you don't know about George Zimmerman, we're done with the evidence. You're not getting any more information from the state attorney's office to prove their case against George Zimmerman. Don't assume it. Don't presume it. Don't connect dots. Don't fill in the blanks with anything. IZRAEL: Wow. Okay. Thanks, Michel. MARTIN: You're welcome. IZRAEL: So now it comes down to the jury. Paul Butler, as a former federal prosecutor, you're up first, bro. If you are in the jury box, what's your verdict? BUTLER: That Mr. Zimmerman is not a murderer, but he should be found guilty of manslaughter. He went after Trayvon, not out of malice or hate, but because Zimmerman made a stupid, tragic mistake. He thought that a black kid in a hoodie was up to no good. So under the law, when people kill recklessly they're guilty of manslaughter. So put him under the jail for killing an innocent child, but I think the up to 30 years he could get for manslaughter is sufficient. IZRAEL: Wait, hold on a sec, Paul. Pres-Paul, hold on a second. He got out the car and hunted this young man. Didn't he? BUTLER: He did, but... IZRAEL: ...OK... BUTLER: ...for murder, you have to have hate, you have to have what the law calls a wicked and depraved heart. My brother, I just don't think that standard is met here. IZRAEL: If getting out of the car and hunting a young man down isn't wicked, I don't know what is. Thank you for that, Paul Butler. Neil Minkoff, I know you like to think about the psychology of things. What do you think about this trial? MINKOFF: Well, one of the things that I think is just fascinating about this trial is that it reveals so much about people's preconceptions and, you know, it was interesting to hear that about the wicked and depraved. I think that there's, you know, an assumption. One of the things that I think is just really amazing - there's an assumption on the part of certain people who believe that he was racially motivated or that he clearly - he seems to have been racially motivated, that it makes him automatically guilty of murder. And therefore, there's been a backlash that says, if he wasn't then that should make him innocent. And so, you know, I appreciate the fact that there was a middle ground found because I found the two polarizing opposites to be confusing. IZRAEL: Okay. I'll take that. Pablo... TORRE: ...Yeah... IZRAEL: ...Juror number three, what do you think bro? TORRE: Well, look, once you get past all the silliness that inevitably follows a highly publicized trial like this, in terms of the stuff in the trial too - the knock-knock jokes, people tweeting photos, I mean, I just want - I think the important thing is to remember how serious it is. As you said, a kid was hunted down and killed. But I think there are two conversations that I look at. Number one is this kind of larger moral ethical, societal conversation where intuitively, and firmly incontrovertibly, I would say, killing someone, period, should result in something. And I don't like the - I mean, just the language that's been around this case where George Zimmerman is the victim makes me uncomfortable fundamentally from that kind of ends perspective. Or having a gun at all, I mean, I think gun control needs to be back in this conversation somewhere, especially in the state of Florida. But I got to - you know, Mr. Butler had a great point, I mean, look mens rea, I don't know if they proved that beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden was on the prosecution here and from what I've seen and heard and observed - I am not a lawyer, obviously, but, you know, manslaughter seems reasonable to me. But murder, I mean, that's something that I don't know if the prosecution did the job in terms of proving that incontrovertibly, unequivocally. And that's troubling for the larger ethical conversation I talked about in the first part. MARTIN: Can I ask though, Neil, about this question of a backlash. I mean, it seems to be that the center of gravity and a lot of the conservative media - now, of course, these are not all the major outlets, but a lot of the conservative media that I follow is that it's exactly as you described. But why is that a backlash against the idea that African-Americans aren't allowed to - or the people who are advocating in this area, for law enforcement to take this more seriously than it appeared to, are they wrong to have an opinion that law enforcement was not aggressive about this? I mean i
