Five years ago, Twitter was hardly a blip on the political radar. Now, it's a social media giant. President Obama recently urged college student to take to Twitter and pressure their representatives on student loan interest rates. Host Michel Martin discusses the role of Twitter in politics with NPR's Don Gonyea and SocialFlow's Frank Speiser.
Copyright Â© 2012 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up, we'll hear from some of our youngest listeners from across the country to tell us what's fun about being five. You might have noticed already that in honor of our fifth anniversary on the air, we're reflecting on other people and things that are also five, and we realize that when TELL ME MORE started five years ago, Twitter was just a little baby. Now its voice is heard loudly around the world by letting other people share their thoughts - in 140 characters or less, of course. It's playing a huge role in politics, both here and abroad. Last year, for example, Twitter was credited with helping organizers overthrow long-entrenched governments in North Africa, and just last week, President Barack Obama urged college students to take to Twitter to pressure their congressmen and women about student loan interest rates. Here it is. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Tweet them. We've got a hash tag. Here's the hash tag for you to tweet them. #DontDoubleMyRate. MARTIN: All this tweeting, especially the political kind, has changed the lives of both of our next guests quite a bit. NPR's Don Gonyea is a national political correspondent. He's got thousands of Twitter followers, but it's some of those incoming tweets from places like the White House and political campaigns that he really has to watch out for. We're also joine

Your Health Sleep Experts Answer Your Questions On Teens And Shuteye

After Michelle Trudeau's story The Other Big Deficit: Many Teens Fall Short On Sleep aired on Morning Edition on Monday, we asked listeners to submit questions on teens and sleep. We received dozens of questions and posed some of them to a panel of sleep experts. Their responses, edited for brevity and clarity, are below. Helene Emsellem, neurologist at George Washington University and medical director of the Center for Sleep and Wake Disorders Question from Rowan Rose: I have two teens who have difficulty sleeping, and I worry that they have developed bad sleep habits they might never grow out of. Should they take sleep meds? EMSELLEM: One of most important things to understand is that the changes in biological rhythms are not changeable with a drug. If an adolescent's biological clock says they won't get sleepy until midnight, a sleeping pill may do absolutely nothing. It could also complicate matters by leaving them hung over the next day. The best you can do is regiment a routine and give them a comfortable sleep environment. Melinda Miller: I am a teacher in Indiana who just listened to this piece with a class of seniors. My students are wondering, what are some safe suggestions for them to be more alert and ready to learn at the start of their school day, which is 7:35 a.m.? EMSELLEM: Food, light and exercise are cues to brain that it's morning and it's time to synchronize the clock, so try to get all of those before school starts. But in the end, the real problem is that school starts too early. A start time of 7:35 is incompatible with the sleep-wake schedule and circadian rhythms of adolescents. Amanda Russ Daquelente (high school teacher): Should I punish my students for sleeping in class, or should they just suffer the consequences of missing notes and directions? EMSELLEM: First and second period teachers are always challenged with being incredibly interesting to keep kids engaged. Bit it's very difficult to punish students for falling asleep. They already do pay a price, but punishing kids beyond what they miss is brutal. Jennifer Beaton: In high school I sacrificed sleep in order to stay on top of

February 13, 2011 5:00 AM
Copyright Â©2011 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Audie Cornish. First-time novelist Teju Cole has worked at many jobs, and this list is in no particular order: a gardener, an art history professor, a dishwasher, a medical student and a photographer. But a curious mix of the last two informed the writing of his debut novel, "Open City." It's a story told through the cinematic eye of Julius, a young medical student who spends large parts of his days walking the streets of New York. Mr. TEJU COLE (Author, "Open City"): (Reading) At the corner, the lights of the diner flickered with large neon words: Support Our Troops. The first two letters of troops failed to light. Christmas shoppers stalk the streets, huddled under black cloaks rimmed with fur. As I came to 9th Avenue, there was a silent commotion along the stand of trees just one block to the south on 33rd where I saw pamphlets opposing the war, fluttering i
