On this edition of All Songs Considered, we've got a brand new song from David Bowie, from his first album of new songs in a decade. The French pop group Phoenix also returns with the band's first new song since 2009, called "Entertainment!" Plus Mwahaha, one of Bob's favorite discoveries from last year's South By Southwest music festival; the D.C. rock group Deathfix, featuring Brendan Canty of Fugazi; and Lone Bellow, a new-folk trio with amazing harmonies. Also on the show: Robin Hilton bares his heart and soul only to have co-host Bob Boilen crush it mercilessly. The point of contention? John Denver. The late country singer, who provided the soundtrack to Robin's childhood, is celebrated on a new record called The Music Is You: A Tribute To John Denver. It features, among many other cuts and artists, My Morning Jacket doing "Leaving On A Jet Plane." We close the program with a special premiere from Wavves. The gritty rock group, known for its ramshackle songs about getting stoned, partying and boredom, finds its more reflective side on a new album called Afraid Of Heights.

The Stump Can Bad Campaigners Make Good Presidents? by Scott Neuman
September 24, 2012 2:44 PM
John F. Kennedy once said there was no experience that could have adequately prepared him for the presidency. That presumably included a hard-fought campaign for the job against sitting Vice President Richard Nixon — one of the closest-ever contests. So, why should we assume that presiding over a well-oiled campaign has anything to do with running the White House? Maybe we shouldn't, but that meme is gathering momentum among the pundit class on the heels of a lackluster and occasionally bewildering GOP
