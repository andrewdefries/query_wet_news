Historical novelist Bernard Cornwell is best-known for his book and film series about Napoleonic Wars rifleman Richard Sharpe, but he has also explored other eras in several other series. Death of Kings is the sixth book in his series about Saxon England. Though NPR book critic and novelist Sharon Penman started this one before reading the rest of the series, she says it reads well as a stand-alone novel. "The author works his usual magic. His characters are vividly drawn, betrayals lurk around every corner, the humor is as sharp as the swords, and the action is nonstop," Penman writes. "I've had some experience writing battles over the years (I did 13 of them in Lionheart), and I can say with certainty that I don't think there is anyone who writes better battle scenes than Bernard Cornwell."
