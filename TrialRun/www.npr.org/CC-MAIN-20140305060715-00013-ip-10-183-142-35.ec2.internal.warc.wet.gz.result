< Emmylou Harris And Rodney Crowell: Harmonizing To That 'Old Yellow Moon'
July 04, 201311:00 AM
Copyright ©2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. On this Fourth of July, we're going to hear the interview with Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell that I recorded earlier this year. They're such good solo singers, it's wonderful to hear them together dueting on their album "Old Yellow Moon," which came out in February. "Old Yellow Moon" is their first duo album, although they've known each other for nearly 40 years. In 1975, when Emmylou Harris released album, "Pieces of the Sky," after the death or her singing partner Gram Parsons, she chose a song by a virtually unknown songwriter to open the album. That songwriter was Rodney Crowell, who Harris also recruited to be a guitarist and harmony singer in her backup group The Hot Band. Although they've remained good friends, they've gone their own ways professionally with great success. They've each won Grammys and had records that reached the top of the country chart. Let's start with a song from their new album. This is "Here We Are," written by Rodney Crowell. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HERE WE ARE") RODNEY CROWELL: (Singing) Did you say that you've been searching for a place you'd never been? Well, here it is. Here it is. EMMYLOU HARRIS AND RODNEY CROWELL: (Singing) And you've down there on the bottom and looking out for friends. Here I am, here I am. We've both grown tired of running after rainbows. Here we are, darlin', here we are. GROSS: Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, welcome to FRESH AIR. Welcome back, Rodney. CROWELL: Yeah, thank you, it's good to be back. EMMYLOU HARRIS: It's a great new record. Congratulations on it. Thank you. GROSS: So why did you decide to record together after so many years? I mean you recorded together in the '70s. HARRIS: Well, yeah, I think we decided almost as soon as we started our friendship in 1974 that we were going to do a record, by golly. But, you know, it just - that time passes, and you're busy doing your own careers, and it, you know, just all of a sudden it seemed - it occurred to me that if we were going to do this record, which I knew we both wanted to do, that we were going to have to just get our schedules, you know, concurrent and do it. And that's really all it took, but I think Rodney and I agree that we feel that we're really glad that we waited. I think this particular collaboration of a long friendship, the longer the friendship, kind of the more there was to bring to the record. CROWELL: True, and it's a culmination of a conversation that started a long time ago. GROSS: The song we just heard is a song that you wrote, Rodney Crowell, that you never recorded before. Why did it take you this long to record it? CROWELL: Well, when I first wrote the song many years ago, Emmy heard it, and she said oh, I'm going to do this thing with George Jones, and I want to do that song, you know. So I danced around the living room. Emmy had recorded my songs, and no offense to Emmy, but I was going George Jones is singing one of my songs. (LAUGHTER) CROWELL: I called everybody I knew, you know. So, you know, that lasted about 35 years, you know, before it wore off. And actually it is Emmy who prodded me toward agreeing to record the song. I wasn't sure that I wanted to take a swing at something that George Jones had already put his stamp on. But Emmy, you know, when Emmy explained to me that was then, this is now, and it's a different conversation. HARRIS: Yeah, and it's - it was so right for this project, I mean almost too right. You know, here we are, we could almost call the album "Here We Are," which would have been a little too obvious. But, you know, I love Rodney's voice, and it never occurred to me that it was any kind of competition going on between - in Rodney's mind of, oh well, you know, George did the male part of this song because I just love how, you know, Rodney and I sound together. And in the context of what this project was, of two friends singing together, the fact that it was Rodney's song was important to me, but what the song said, you know, about the two of us and our journey, you know, through this world, all the separate paths we've taken and the times our friendship has - you know, has always been there. CROWELL: Well, you know, I should go on record now and say I now prefer our version to yours and George's. HARRIS: Me, too. No offense, George. We love George. CROWELL: None. GROSS: So tell us the story of how you first met in the '70s and Rodney how you joined Emmy's band. CROWELL: OK. HARRIS: OK, well, I guess that's me. CROWELL: You go first. HARRIS: I go first. OK, well, I had been signed to Warner/Reprise. They brought a great team together of a very, very successful producer, Brian Ahern, who had all those great Anne Murray records. And I was, you know, a fledgling artist. Basically I was signed because I had gotten a bit of notoriety singing on two Gram Parsons records, Gram who had died in 1973, and I was signed in '74. And so, you know, everyone's concerned, you know, we've got to get the material, got to get it right. So I went up to Toronto where Brian lived and to listen to material and pick material. And I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I found out right away that I knew what I didn't like. And Brian played me a whole day's worth. We went a whole day through a pile of cassettes, few people remember cassettes, of material that just did not do anything for me. And he kind of smiled, and he said, well, he said, I've got one more thing, and I haven't listened to this yet. It's been sent to me, a writer that I've signed who I've not heard but on the recommendation of someone whose opinion I respect. So for the first time Brian Ahern and I listened to the voice and the songs of Rodney Crowell. And the first song that was on the tape was "Bluebird Wine." And I just knew that we had struck gold, that there was just something in his voice, in the music and the energy that was there. GROSS: So Rodney Crowell, who were you at that moment? CROWELL: Well, I had moved to Austin, Texas. And I had been in Nashville for a couple of years and been schooled on the discipline and the craft of songwriting. And I said, well, I'm going to go live in Austin for the rest of my days. And Emmy had recorded her record. I knew "Bluebird Wine" was on there. And so she was playing at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin and came through with her band and knew I was there so invited me down, come sit in, you know, sing. So we sang, and I played a couple songs with her and her band, and then after the show - and Emmy didn't remember this until I reminded her. HARRIS: I don't. CROWELL: She said: Hey, I'm going to L.A. tomorrow, and I got an extra ticket. You want to go? And, you know, this is in the days when you could travel on somebody else's ticket, you know. And I said I'm in, I'm going to go. Just let me figure out what - how to take care of my dog, and I'll be ready to go tomorrow. So I got somebody to - you know, we worked out how to get my dog sent out to Los Angeles. And I went out and stayed seven years. GROSS: So, you know, Rodney Crowell, when you and Emmylou Harris joined together in her band, was the music you wanted to play and the music she wanted to play similar, or did you have to kind of find a way to get on the same page? CROWELL: No, it was an instinctive thing with Emmylou and I, and it still is today, which really requires very little intellectual analysis of what we're doing. It's very much - it very much comes from the very center of us. I, coming from a family, a background, of sharecrop farm - my mother and father were sharecrop farm kids, and in the part of East Houston where I grew up, the culture just thrived on the country music that came, you know, with Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. It was the soundtrack of that culture. So when I met up with Emmy, and we started working together, and she had had her conversion to country music, I was just there, and the conversation just picked up right there. And it's where I came from. And it was a perfect meeting at the perfect time. And we never had to really discuss how to approach it. It was just like, what song do you want to do? It was that simple. HARRIS: Yeah, we would - while we were waiting for who were to become the full members of the Hot Band, you know, the James Burtons and Glen D. Hardins... GROSS: This was your band in the '70s. HARRIS: This was the Hot Band that Rodney and I, you know, went out and toured for a couple years, '75, '76 and '77. You know, we spent the time sitting, I think I had a notebook with, you know, it was my teaching, homeschooling myself with all these lyrics to things like Don Gibson's "Sweet Dreams," et cetera. And we'd have two acoustic guitars, and we would just sort of sit on the floor, and one of us would start singing, and the other one would jump in, and we would just - OK, and what are we going to do next - just because we enjoyed the singing. But, you know, every generation has to reinvent itself poetically in some way. You have to bring something new, but it has to be something very real. And I think collaboration is a way a lot of times that that happens. GROSS: So you mentioned Don Gibson's song "Sweet Dreams," and you actually have a live recording, Emmylou Harris, with Rodney Crowell backing you up on it. So why don't we hear that live recording? HARRIS: And also that's actually the original Hot Band. That's James Burton on guitar and Emory Gordy and Glen D. Hardin, Hank DeVito and Bill Payne. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SWEET DREAMS") HARRIS: (Singing) Sweet dreams of you every night I go through. Why can't I forget you and start my life anew instead of having sweet dreams about you. You don't love me, it's plain. I should have known you'd never wear my ring. I know I should hate you the whole night through instead of having sweet dreams about you. GROSS: That's Rodney Crowell and Emmylou Harris recorded in 1975. They have a new album called "Old Yellow Moon." We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guests are Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell, and they have a new album together called "Old Yellow Moon." When you first were in a band together, and this was in the mid-'70s, was the band, like, living in the same house, as many bands did then? HARRIS: Oh no. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: No? OK. HARRIS: Well, Rodney and I - Rodney, you were staying at the... CROWELL: We were living in the same house. HARRIS: Yeah, we were. Brian, our producer, had rented this crazy sort of 1950s Esther Williams swimming pool house up off of Coldwater Canyon. It was rented so that he could park his mobile recording truck, called the Enactron Truck. So... CROWELL: I slept on the floor. (LAUGHTER) HARRIS: And actually at that point I was in a relationship with Brian, who I eventually married, and we had a daughter together. Now we're grandparents. GROSS: I should mention he produced the new album. HARRIS: Yes, and he produced the new album. So we survived divorce. Life's too long to hold a grudge. And we actually - you know, some marriages just come to an end. GROSS: So when the three of you were living together for a while, and Rodney, you were sleeping on the floor... (LAUGHTER) CROWELL: Poor me. HARRIS: We had some other Canadians. Let's see, we had some Canadian engineers, and he brought his wife and two young babies down. And yeah, I guess we were like a strange hippie commune except... CROWELL: Interesting that we sort of had this hippie commune in the Bel Air Hills. (LAUGHTER) CROWELL: And we started touring, going on tour with, you know, Elvis Presley's band. When Elvis wasn't working, James Burton and Glen Hardin and Emory Gordy would come and work with us. So we were, you know, these hippie kids working with these really high-price musicians, you know, because Warner Brothers Records had... HARRIS: They had decided to bankroll it. They decided to take a chance on that first record. And it was a great investment. I don't know whether record companies do that anymore, but, you know, it was - I mean, I paid them back with record royalties, but they could have lost a lot of money. GROSS: Now I know we've been talking about duets and country music. I feel like I can't wait any longer to play another track from "Old Yellow Moon," and this is a song that maybe doesn't quite fit what we were talking about, but it's so beautiful. It's called "Spanish Dancer," and it's a song by Patti Scialfa, who's from the E Street Band and is married to Bruce Springsteen. And the way you sing it, Emmy, is so - I just get chills when you sing it. It's so emotional. Just like the song is about a young woman under the spell of love who gives herself to a man who knows he may not feel as deeply toward her as she does toward him. And there's a sense of vulnerability and potential ruin in the song. And can you tell us why you chose it? HARRIS: You know, I became a fan of Patti Scialfa's album that this song is from, it's called "Rumble Doll," and I believe it might be as old as 20 years. The album just absolutely floored me. Patti's voice, not all harmony, great harmony singers, which she is, are good solo singers, but she definitely is. She is an exquisite writer. She writes about the female heart, the poetry of being female, in a way that it just - every singer-songwriter female artist that I know loves this record. It never got the attention it should have. I suppose she will always be overshadowed because she's, you know, Bruce Springsteen's wife. But it doesn't take away from the art, you know, her artistry. I love every song on the record. This particular song has been on my wish list to record ever since I first heard it. And I don't know, I just put it off and put it off. It didn't seem right for the project. And after a while, I admit I thought, well, how can I at the age of, you know, 65 sing oh mama, you know, talking to my mother, which actually is a reality in my case because my mother is still very much alive. But it's universal. You know, it's that vulnerability that you feel when you know that you could fall, and you know how vulnerable, to quote you, that you are. But it's something that you cannot resist, and she just puts it in a way that is so beautiful, and the melody, too. And I actually really love - I love Rodney's harmony on it. GROSS: I do too, yeah. Let's hear it. So this is Emmylou Harris with Rodney Crowell on the new album that they have together, "Old Yellow Moon." And this is the Patti Scialfa written song "Spanish Dancer." (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SPANISH DANCER") HARRIS: (Singing) Oh mama there's this Spanish dancer whose steps I follow when he comes near. The red dress of temptation over a long black slip of fear. Will I fall beneath the shadow of some broken cross, my arms emptied and all my treasures lost? Still like that Spanish dancer I throw my roses down for him across these beds of darkness. He opens his arms and gathers them in. (Singing) Oh mama the bridges were burning over a river black and cold, but I walked when love commanded me up to the edges of his soul. But I'm still frightened of that dark divide. Will I gain entrance or be denied? Still like that Spanish dancer I throw my roses down for him across these beds of darkness. He opens his arms and gathers them in. GROSS: Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell will be back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. On this 4th of July, we're listening to an interview I recorded earlier this year with Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell. They've been friends for nearly 40 years, going back to when
