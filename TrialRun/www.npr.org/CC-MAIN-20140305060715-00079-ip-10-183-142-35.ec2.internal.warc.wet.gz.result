Is There A Sarah Palin Effect?

In Alaska, a young upstart, Joe Miller, is close to unseating incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Former Gov. Sarah Palin has endorsed Miller, a Tea Party favorite. Political analyst Tom Rath, political reporter Michael Barone, Alaska Public Radio's Libby Casey and NPR's Ken Rudin discuss Palin's influence on the GOP nationally.
Copyright © 2010 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. NEAL CONAN, host: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. An outsider upset in Florida; an out-of-the-blue, too-close-to-call in Alaska; and in Arizona, Quayle spells victory. It's Wednesday, and time for another holy-moley edition of the Political Junkie. President RONALD REAGAN: There you go again. Vice President WALTER MONDALE: When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad. Where's the beef? Senator BARRY GOLDWATER (Republican, Arizona): Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Senator LLOYD BENTSEN (Democrat, Texas): Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy. President RICHARD NIXON: You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore. Former Governor SARAH PALIN (Republican, Alaska): Lipstick. President GEORGE W. BUSH: But I'm the decider. (Soundbite of scream) CONAN: Every Wednesday, NPR political editor Ken Rudin joins us to review the week in politics. Two wealthy outsiders shook up primaries in Florida this year. One triumphed yesterday; one didn't. Incumbent Senators John McCain and Pat Leahy sailed to re-nomination, but the shocker of the day remains undecided. Upstart Joe Miller leads Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, with absentee ballots yet to be counted. Much more on that later, as we focus on the Palin effect. But first, Political Junkie Ken Rudin joins us here in Studio 3A. And as usual, we begin with a trivia question. KEN RUDIN: You said holy moley. Absolutely, what a day yesterday with primary results and shockers. Okay, trivia question. Dan Quayle's son, Ben Quayle, won the Republican nomination for Congress from an Arizona district yesterday. Other than Quayle, who were the last vice presidents whose children - son or daughter - ran for the House, or ran for the Senate. CONAN: Got to get them both. RUDIN: Got to get them both. CONAN: That's a real hot potato. If you think... RUDIN: How do you spell potato? CONAN: With great difficulty. If you think you know the answer to our trivia question other than Quayle, who was the last vice president whose children, son or daughter, ran for the House and ran for the Senate. One each. RUDIN: Two different people. CONAN: Two different people. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Got to get them both. And let's go straight to Florida, Ken, and two well-heeled outsiders made the primaries pretty interesting yesterday. In the race for the Democratic Senate nomination, congressman Kendrick Meek faced billionaire Jeff Greene. RUDIN: Yes, and for a long time we thought that Jeff Greene had a good shot at it. He spent millions and millions of dollars. Kendrick Meek, an African-American congressman from Miami, whose situation with his mother, his mother former congresswoman... CONAN: Almost left him that seat. RUDIN: Not only left him that seat, but also became an issue in the campaign. There is a developer who did favors for Corrine(ph) Meek not Corrine Meek. What's her name? CONAN: Now you've made me forget RUDIN: I can't remember her name. Okay, Carrie Meek. CONAN: Carrie Meek. RUDIN: Carrie Meek - Carrie Meek back to Old Virginny. Right, and she became an issue in the campaign, but Jeff Greene... CONAN: So did Jeff Greene's yacht. RUDIN: Exactly, Jeff Greene's yacht, Jeff Greene's past, and the Democratic establishment basically backed by Bill Clinton, Kendrick Meek won a resounding victory, and it's now a three-way race for the Senate. Charlie Crist left the Republican Party because he had no chance of beating Marco Rubio in the primary. Charlie Crist is an independent. Rubio is the Republican nominee. CONAN: And last night, congressman Meek acknowledged the fact that he is, at least at this point, in third place. Representative KENDRICK MEEK (Democratic Senatorial Candidate, Florida): I may not be Goliath before November 2nd, but when November 2nd gets here, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to still be comfortable playing David. CONAN: And good - citing biblical passages to provide him hope. Republican primary was - well, at one time thought to be a barn-burner. It turned out to be a yawner. RUDIN: For the Senate, exactly. Marco Rubio is the Republican nominee. And a lot of people are saying that now with Kendrick Meek as the Democratic nominee, African-Americans staying home in the Democratic primary, that may not be good news for Charlie Crist, and it could help Rubio win the Senate race. CONAN: Rubio spoke yesterday. He's the former speaker of the Florida House, the Tea Party favorite, and he got 85 percent of the vote against two other candidates. Mr. MARCO RUBIO (Republican Senatorial Candidate, Florida): This election is nothing less than a referendum on our identity as a people and as a nation, and that's what's at stake these next 70 days. CONAN: And that's Marco Rubio and of course, some people suggest that maybe the guy who won yesterday was a guy who wasn't running, and that's Charlie Crist. He is the former Republican and current governor. Governor CHARLIE CRIST (Independent Senatorial Candidate, Florida): If you want somebody that's on the hard right, you have a candidate now. If you want somebody on the hard left, you have a candidate. You have an alternative, and that's what we offer in this race, and I'm excited about it, and I look forward to it. CONAN: And that's in an interview yesterday because he didn't have a primary to celebrate or bemoan. RUDIN: You also have a three-way race, a three-way contest in the race for governor, and in that race you also had a millionaire outsider, Rick Scott, who was not supposed to win the primary. The party establishment had rallied behind Bill McCollum, but the Florida Republicans had a lot of problems. Jim Greer, the former state chairman, has been indicted. Of course, Charlie Crist was forced out of the party because of ideology. CONAN: Forced himself out of the party. RUDIN: Well, also his own ideology, and his dare to embrace President Obama when he came down to Florida for the stimulus really turned off a lot of conservatives. But so Bill McCollum was this, you know, establishment figure, state attorney general, former congressman, ran twice for the Senate. But Rick Scott, who is, again, a millionaire, spent about $50 million of his own money there's a lot of money being spent in gubernatorial races this year, as Meg Whitman will tell you in California and - but Rick Scott has his own problems. He was a CEO of a hospital chain that was - paid $1.7 billion in fines because of Medicare fraud. And this could help the Democratic nominee, Alex Sink. She'd be the first female governor of Florida. But as in the Senate race, there was a third candidate running - Lawton Chiles, the last Democratic governor of Florida. His son, Lawton III - or Bud Chiles, as we call him - is running as an independent, and that could hurt the Democrats. CONAN: So we'll have to see how that works out. Quickly to Arizona, before we get to people who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question. And in Arizona, thought for the Republican gubernatorial bid, well, that might have been a contest earlier. It turned out not to be: Jan Brewer. RUDIN: Right. Jan Brewer won big. Once she signed the 1070, the controversial anti-illegal-immigration law, the Republican opposition to her basically disappeared, and she is now the clear favorite in November against Terry Goddard, the state attorney general, son of a former governor. CONAN: And she outlined some of her campaign platform last night in her victory speech. Governor JAN BREWER (Republican, Arizona): This general election is going to be about very simple choices. Either you are embraced and supported by organizations who boycott our state, or you work for the people of Arizona and the right for the truth to be heard. CONAN: And that, of course, referring to the boycotts of Arizona that have been sponsored by some, and of course if you're opposing her, that means you're supporting - anyway, you get the picture. It looks like this could be a tough race. RUDIN: It could be, and obviously illegal immigration, or immigration, will be a key issue, as it usually is in Arizona. And of course, you have the Senate race now, which is basically, the whole issue was whether John McCain would be vulnerable or not. It turned out he was not. He beat J.D. Hayworth, the first challenge of McCain's long Senate career, beat him easily in the primary. And of course there's some congressional races as well. Ben Quayle, the son of Dan Quayle, won the nomination in Arizona's Third Congressional District. Very important race in Arizona's First Congressional District. Paul Gosar is a dentist, a wealthy dentist who won the Republican nomination. I understand he had to take a leave of abscess to run for Congress. CONAN: Oh, Nehemiah. You pulled that joke on us at this point. Now, let's see if we can get some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question. Again, we've just mentioned Dan Quayle's son, Ben, won his primary. Who were the children of who were the vice presidents whose children last ran for Congress and for Senate? RUDIN: House and Senate, right. CONAN: Two different former vice presidents; 800-989-8255 for the right to wear the coveted Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt. Let's see if we can go first to Guy(ph). Guy's with us from Miami. GUY (Caller): Yes, hi. CONAN: Hi, go ahead, please. GUY: Well, I just realized I told your screener something that was impossible because I thought about your question some more. So I guess I don't have both of them. I do believe that one of them was the son of George Herbert Walker Bush. Our last president was the son and he initially did run for Congress but was defeated, I believe. CONAN: Ken? RUDIN: That is correct. George W. Bush ran for Congress in Texas in 1978. He lost to Kent Hance. And actually, nobody's heard from George W. Bush since. CONAN: Kent N. Hance(ph). That was his middle initial. RUDIN: Exactly. But that is half of a T-shirt. We now need to know the name of the last vice president whose son ran for the Senate. CONAN: Let's see if we can go to another answer. Let's go next to this is Andrew(ph), Andrew with us from Richfield in Minnesota. ANDREW (Caller): Yeah, hi. I think Vice President Humphrey's son, Skip, ran for Senate in Minnesota. RUDIN: And that is correct. CONAN: Ding, ding, ding. RUDIN: In 1988, against David Durenberger. He was the Democratic nominee. So it was Bush and Humphrey - those two vice presidents. CONAN: Two for two: Two callers, two correct answers. Andrew, hang on, we'll get your particulars and send you a no-prize T-shirt in return for your promise to take your picture and digitally mail it to us so we can post it on our Wall of Shame. In the meantime, Ken I didn't think we'd have an answer that quickly. In the meantime, Ken, there were some other primaries yesterday. In Vermont, no big surprise on the Democratic senatorial side. Patrick Leahy sailed to re-nomination, no big surprise there. But a tight race there for the gubernatorial nomination. RUDIN: One quick thing about Pat Leahy. It was interesting. When he was first elected to the Senate in 1974, he was the first Democrat ever elected to the Senate from Vermont. Now he's seeking his seventh term. It's just amazing how things in politics have changed over the decades in Vermont. In the gubernatorial race, the Republican governor, Jim Douglas, is not running again. His lieutenant governor, Brian Dubie, is running again, is running for governor. But there in a five-way race... CONAN: There's a pun - it couldn't be dumpy(ph). RUDIN: No, it's Dubie. And you know, there's a song - I think Frank Sinatra had a song about him. CONAN: Did. RUDIN: Dubie, Dubie, do. CONAN: Exactly, yes, it's his campaign theme. RUDIN: Exactly. Peter Shumlin, who is the president of the state senate, leads by 182 votes over the second-place finisher, Doug Racine. And the third-place finisher, Deb Markowitz, is down by 738 votes. Anytime you want to know whether your vote counts, it certainly did yesterday in Vermont's Democratic primary. CONAN: And I think Shumlin has declared victory. The others have yet to concede. RUDIN: That is correct. CONAN: So it looks like there may be a recount. When we get back, we're going to be back to what could be a lengthy recount, and that is in the state of Alaska. But briefly, Ken, that is going to be one of the stunning political events of the primary season. RUDIN: You know, I mean, we talked from the beginning; there's this guy, Joe Miller. Nobody ever heard of him. He was a Gulf War veteran - he is a Gulf War veteran, Tea Party favorite. Sarah Palin endorsed him. But again, Lisa Murkowski had the money, had the establishment, and basically the feeling in Alaska was what we the fact that we get so much more largesse from the federal government than we give in, that's the way Ted Ted Williams... (Soundbite of laughter) RUDIN: Ted Stevens did it. That's the way Murkowski did it. That's the way we like it. And nobody thought that Joe Miller had a shot. And right now, he's leading by 1,960 votes. CONAN: More on that in a minute, but here's an interview, a clip from an interview that Miller gave, obviously before the election. Nobody's spoken after because nobody's declaring or conceding. But he is talking about the importance of the endorsement by the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Mr. JOE MILLER (Republican Senatorial Candidate, Alaska): Well, it's absolutely definite that her endorsement of this campaign has helped us. It's certainly given us national recognition. Really, in Alaska, what makes campaigns work, though, is the sweat equity that people put into the volunteer networks. CONAN: That - Joe Miller, who may be the Republican senatorial candidate from the state of Alaska. More with Political Junkie Ken Rudin in a moment.

We want to use the rest of our time today to talk about a key player for the Republicans, Sarah Palin and the Tea Party. Love her or hate her, she's had quite an influence on the GOP nationally. But while she was able to deliver a string of victories early, then there was a string of -well, not so good though overall, she had a really great day yesterday.

Libby Casey, the Washington correspondent for Alaska Public Radio, has given this some thought, and she joins us here in Studio 3. Nice of you to come in, Libby. Ms. LIBBY CASEY (Washington Correspondent, Alaska Public Radio): Good to be here. Thank you. CONAN: And this, Joe Miller. Who is Joe Miller? Ms. CASEY: Who is Joe Miller? This is the question of the day. He, as Ken mentioned earlier, is a Gulf War veteran. He went to West Point. He has a Yale law degree. He has a degree in economics from the University of Alaska, so some hometown representation there, and he's a Tea Party guy. He doesn't call himself, though. He calls himself a constitutional conservative. And he has tried to corner this vote in Alaska of the right wing, the - we don't want the government money, we need to solve the fiscal crisis. We're headed down a bad road, and I am the guy who can change this. And he attacked Lisa Murkowski on the earmarks, on the big Washington thing. And even though it didn't seem like Alaskans had pegged Murkowski, necessarily, with the big Washington identity, he managed to paint her with that brush, and he has succeeded. Whether or not he wins, he has succeeded in framing the debate in Alaska. Senator Murkowski just did not go on the attack. She was put on the defensive, and even though Miller didn't have a lot of money going into this race, he managed to use what he had to go onto conservative talk radio, to blanket the airwaves with the message of: I am the conservative guy. CONAN: And Lisa Murkowski, of course, the scion of a political dynasty in Alaska. Ms. CASEY: Absolutely, daughter of Frank Murkowski, who was a senator. When he left the Senate to become governor, he gave her the job of senator, and Alaskans really were upset about that, initially. But Lisa Murkowski faced a tough race a couple years ago in the last campaign, six years back - won. And it seemed to show people, no, she's here. You know, she's been elected on her own merits, and she we describe her as sort of a new kind of Alaskan Republican, not this bluster and intensity of Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski. And she was really carving out her own identity. She's the only woman on the Republican Senate leadership team, and she is amassing some power: top Republican on the Energy Committee; she's on Appropriations. And those mean something in Alaska. That says a lot of power. CONAN: Ken? RUDIN: And remind listeners what happened to Frank Murkowski. Ms. CASEY: Oh, now Frank Murkowski was running for his second term when a little lady called Sarah Palin entered the scene. She challenged him as a fellow Republican - which is kind of a no-no, you know, attacking your own party. She beat him in the primary. That left some bad blood between the Murkowskis and the Palins, and when Governor Palin stepped down from her job as governor last year, Senator Murkowski came out. She's been very reticent to talk about Sarah Palin, but she basically said that Sarah Palin abandoned her job, and abandoned the people of Alaska. That bad blood has continued. CONAN: Nevertheless, when she first declared that she would run again, who popped up on the donor list but Sarah Palin. Ms. CASEY: A lot of people thought that Palin might throw her name into the Senate race and actually run against Murkowski. Palin put that aside and said, no, in fact, I'm going to support her. And then Joe Miller came along. And back in June, Sarah Palin endorsed him on Facebook, did a big push. She hasn't talked publicly about it, but she did some robocalls in the last minute, had some kind of attack-oriented messages on Facebook in the past week, saying that he is the true conservative choice, vote for him over Murkowski, watch these debates from public TV last week, and you'll see who the real ch
