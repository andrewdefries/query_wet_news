Book Summary
When the body of a young woman is found on the grounds of a Louisiana plantation named Belle Vie, manager Caren Gray launches her own investigation into the estate's history. A century-spanning story of two murders unfolds as Gray delves deeper into a mystery involving the plantation's slave quarters — and her own past. In this historical thriller, novelist Attica Locke examines the troubled racial past of a United States that, according to her, remains in its "adolescent phase."
