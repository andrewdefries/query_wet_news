International In Libya: 'Biggest Fear' Is Gadhafi Disappearing, Continuing To Fight
by Mark Memmott
August 30, 2011 8:35 AM
The news that ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's wife and three of his children have fled to Algeria underscores "the biggest fear" for many Libyans, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro reports from Tripoli — that Gadhafi will elude capture and that his forces will continue to battle for weeks, months or perhaps years. On Morning Edition, Lourdes told host Steve Inskeep that leaders of the transitional government say they're urgently searching for Gadhafi and his older sons "because ... he can continue to cause problems [and] people don't feel safe with him at large." Where is Gadhafi? "The south of the country is still very much in [Gadhafi] loyalist hands," Lourdes says. He might be there or in his home town of Sirte, where the opposition forces are gathering and hopes to soon take control.

America Federal Agents Accuse Two Of Plotting Deadly X-Ray Weapon
by Bill Chappell
June 19, 2013 6:14 PM
Two men in upstate New York have been arrested for planning to build a "radiation particle weapon" that could be mounted on a vehicle and used to target people, according to a report by the Albany Times-Union Wednesday. The men allegedly planned to sell the device to either the Ku Klux Klan or Jewish groups. Citing a federal complaint that was unsealed today, the Times-Union says the man at the center of the alleged plot is Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, whom it identifies as a mechanic for General Electric. He was arrested Tuesday. The complaint, which is available online, accuses Crawford of planning to build "a truck-borne, industrial-grade x-ray system, thus weaponizing that system and allowing it to be turned on and off from a distance and without detection." Also arrested was Eric J. Feight, 54, who officials believe intended to build the weapon's electronic control system. The two men were in federal court Wednesday on charges that they conspired to provide material support to terrorists, including use of a weapon of mass destruction. An affidavit filed with the complaint says the suspects did not acquire a radiation source for the weapon officials say they were working on, but that they finished building a remote control that w

GOP Drafting Bill To Ease Flood Insurance Hikes
by The Associated Press
February 20, 2014 5:21 PM
WASHINGTON (AP) — House GOP leaders are putting the final touches on legislation that would significantly weaken a recently enacted overhaul of the much criticized federal flood insurance program, easing many premium increases and allowing below-market rates to be passed on to people buying homes with taxpayer-subsidized policies. The new law was enacted in 2012 and was aimed at weaning hundreds of thousands of homeowners off of subsidized rates and required extensive updating of the flood maps used to set premiums, but its implementation has stirred anxiety among many homeowners along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and in flood plains, many of whom are threatened with unaffordable rate increases. GOP aides say the measure would also repeal a provision that threatens hundreds of thousands of homeowners with huge premium increases under new and updated government flood maps. Those homeowners currently benefit from below-market rates that are subsidized by other policyholders and the new legislation would preserve their "grandfathered" status. The aides required anonymity because the measure is still being finalized and hasn't been publicly released. The aides reques
