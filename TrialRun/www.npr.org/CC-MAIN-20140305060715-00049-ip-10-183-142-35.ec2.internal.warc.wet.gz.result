Lost & Found Sound
Lost And Found Sound: <I>The Mother Ship</I> June 30, 2000  In today's installment of "Lost and Found Sound," we hear a story from writer Tracy Johnston about a sound she collected years ago while traveling in Africa. She was visiting northern Nigeria with a friend who was returning to his grandfathers' village. And she was struck by the greetings people exchanged. It was not just what people had to say, asking about every member of the family, the cattle and all your possessions, but also how it was delivered. There was a joy and love in their expressions -- something she listens to every once in a while to once again feel that sense of connectedness. (6:15) The music used as part of the piece was the following, Miriam Makeba - "SANGOMA" (South African) (Warner Bros. Records) CUT 17 - "UMAM' UYAJABULA" ("Mama is Happy") The music that followed the piece is listed below. Real Media

Lost & Found Sound
Lost and Found Sound: Manicurists April 28, 2000  The Kitchen Sisters, Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, with Laura Folger present a sonic montage that allows Vietnamese immigrant women to tell about their experiences in coming to the United States. Many Vietnamese women work as manicurists; quite a few in the San Francisco area. We hear how the pop music of America trickled into their lives while they were still in their homeland, and how that formed part of there sense of what America would be One woman heard what she called California Dreaming -- (it was really If You're Going to San Francisco) -- and she wanted to be there with "flowers in my hair" We present voices of Vietnamese immigrants in an impressionist manner without narration and mixed with the sound of an English-language instruction tape for Vietnamese speakers that comments on the mood. We also hear the music and sounds that shape these women's lives. Part two of the Kitchen Sisters' sonic montage of Vietnamese immigrant women telling about their experiences in coming to the United States.

Lost & Found Sound
Lost and Found Sound March 24, 2000  In our latest installment of our occasional Lost and Found Sound series, producer Yair Reiner presents Jack Foley: Feet to the Stars. Jack Foley is a Hollywood legend---he did his job best by not letting anyone know he existed. But Foley's legacy lives on in every film and television program we watch---it's there in the footsteps of the star walking down a street, in the rustle of a dress, in the pounding of horse-hoofs. Foley made these sounds and many more on his stage at Universal studios. Foley was there on the studio's maiden voyage into sound pictures. At first, he and his team of sound men had only one chance to get all the sound right. Foley figured out that by projecting the film and recording the sound effects in sync, he would get the best effect---and he would do each effect one at a time, till the various sounds were all put together with the film--a method today called Foley. Foley's stage looked more like a garage than a recording studio---dirt, gravel, and lots of junk everywhere. These were the tools of his trade. Foley's voice was never recorded and there are no pictures of him at his work---but he is remembered by those who worked with him.

Lost & Found Sound
Lost and Found Sound: <I>The House of Night</I> February 25, 2000  This year we're continuing our Lost and Found Sound series on an occasional basis. Today's installment, "The House of Night," is the story of the Mojave Indians, their language and their songs and one man who tried to preserve both for future generations. Beginning in the mid-1960's Guy Tyler began making recordings of the Mojave language and of their 525 song cycle, called the Creation Song. This 13 hour song is a map of the tribe's origins. The songs describe celestial cycles, the positions of stars, planets, and elaborate descriptions of migratory birds.

Study Points to Emergency Room Bias Against Blacks

A new study from Harvard suggests that racial bias affects the treatment that many African-American patients receive in hospital emergency rooms. Two authors of the study discuss the research and its implications.
Copyright © 2007 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. CHERYL CORLEY, host: I'm Cheryl Corley. This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. Coming up: a police scandal rocks Puerto Rico, a son keeps his promise, and tracking used clothing. But first, it's safe to say that most of us expect fair treatment and an accurate diagnosis when we have to pay a visit to our doctors or, God forbid, find ourselves in an emergency room. But what happens when our ethnicity plays a role on the type of treatment we receive? A new study published this month in the Journal of General Internal Medicine says some medical professionals actually do have subconscious biases about race or gender that influence how they diagnose and treat patients. Well, joining us now are two of the study's authors. From Boston, Dr. Alexander Green of Massachusetts General Hospital, and with us from Seattle is Dr. Mahzarin Banaji. She helped design the study measuring bias. Thanks for joining us. Dr. ALEXANDER GREEN (Senior Scientist, Institute for Health Policy, Massachusetts General Hospital): Thank you. Dr. MAHZARIN BANAJI (Social Psychologist, Harvard Medical School): Thank you. CORLEY: Dr. Green, let's start with you, with an overview, perhaps, of this subject. Can you explain how biases about race or gender might influence the ways that doctors or nurses diagnose or even treat certain patients? Dr. GREEN: Well, we have a very serious problem in health care today. The problem of racial and ethnic disparities in care - that is that the quality of care that minority patients get in this country is not as good as the quality of care that white patients receive. And it's not just an issue of socio-economic status or insurance. We know that from a number of studies, this has been extensively documented in hundreds of studies - probably close to a thousand now. Now our study focused particularly on heart disease. And so we were interested in the number of studies that had documented that, in fact, African-American patients who present with a heart attack to the emergency department are less likely to receive a potentially life-saving, clot-busting medication, or a treatment called thrombolysis. CORLEY: Dr. Banaji, you designed the survey that measured these biases. Tell me why these findings are significant. Dr. BANAJI: First of all, let me just say that this is actually a very different test than what we might call a typical survey. CORLEY: Mm-hmm. Dr. BANAJI: In a survey, you would pose questions to the respondent - what did you eat for breakfast this morning? Are you racially biased? Things like that. And what this test tries to do is explicitly get away from posing those kinds of questions. We do that in part because we know that people may be not very willing to reveal the truth about what goes on in their minds and hearts. But especially because we don't think that most human beings or any - really have direct access to the contents of what goes on in their minds. So it's not that they're trying to lie to u
