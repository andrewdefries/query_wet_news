< Housekeeping Tips From One Mercurial 'Mommy'
October 01, 2012 5:11 PM
Copyright ©2012 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. The cursing mommy likes her scotch, and a martini - or four - and a full bottle of Kahlua consumed in the afternoon while soaking in a steaming bathtub, ignoring the knocks of her children locked outside. Along with her dubious parenting skills, the cursing mommy has no shame, and she swears an extremely blue streak. She is the flagrantly unpolitically correct creation of The New Yorker writer and humorist Ian Frazier, out with his very funny first novel, "The Cursing Mommy's Book of Days." Ian Frazier, welcome to the program. IAN FRAZIER: Well, thanks for having me. BLOCK: Let's talk about this character, the cursing mommy. She first started appearing in your columns in The New Yorker. And now, she has a whole book. It's her diary of one year of trouble. What did you describe this character, the cursing mommy? FRAZIER: Well, the cursing mommy is very serious, and she wants to do the right thing, and she wants to do what is expected of her. And she starts out generally, almost always, with a very good intention. But then something goes wrong. (LAUGHTER) BLOCK: Always. FRAZIER: And then she just totally blows up. She just screams and yells and curses. That's sort of her character. And then she recovers, you know? And then she's like, wow, what was I thinking? But she's mercurial in that way. BLOCK: And when she does go on these cursing jags, which is often, she inevitably ends up blaming the Bush administration. FRAZIER: Yeah. She's still really hung up. She belongs to a book group. And every couple weeks, they read another book about how terrible the Bush administration was, and so she knows all these Bush administration people. And their names sometimes almost substitute for curse words in her rants. BLOCK: Let's give a sense of this. We're going to be bleeping liberally here. This is one scene when the cursing mommy is vacuuming, and the vacuum scoops up her housecoat. FRAZIER: (Reading) The cursing mommy is doing her cleaning today in a comfortable, old, floor-length housecoat that used to be Grandma Pat's. And I swoop the suckable(ph) right at my feet, and ah, no, the (bleep) machi
