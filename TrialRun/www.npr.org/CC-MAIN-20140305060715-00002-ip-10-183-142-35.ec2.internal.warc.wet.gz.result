Listen to this 'Talk of the Nation' topic
So, cartoons are clearly op-eds, as we've said before. And today, our op-ed is courtesy of Hector Cantu — no thanks to Ken Burns. Burns' new World War II series The War has drawn complaints because it doesn't tell the stories of Latinos in the war — Cantu decided that if Burns wasn't going to do it, he'd tell them in his comic strip Baldo. He's added a character — a World War II vet — named Benito "Benny" Ramirez, who's telling his stories of the war. Benny started his story on Monday, and he's continued it throughout last week and this one. Today, we'll talk to Hector Cantu about Benny, and hope that you'll post your stories here as well.

International With Clinton In The Region, Israel, Hamas Continue To Trade Fire

(We rewrote the top of this post at 6:55 p.m. ET to sum up the day's news.) Diplomatic efforts accelerated and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the region on Tuesday, but despite the buildup, despite the rumors of imminent peace, there was no cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Instead, the two sides continued to trade fire into the early morning, marking one of the bloodiest days in the nearly week-old conflict. Quoting the Gaza Health Ministry, The New York Times reports that more than a dozen people were killed, bringing the death toll in the Gaza Strip to 130, "roughly half of them civilians." Shortly after landing in Tel-Aviv, Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. They appeared together during a news conference in which Clinton said America's commitment to Israel's security is "rock solid." "The rocket attacks from terrorist organizations inside Gaza on Israeli cities and towns must end and a broader calm restored," Clinton said. "The goal must be a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians alike." Clinton hinted that a cease-fire is possible in the "days ahead." On Wednesday, Clinton will visit Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the morning and perhaps more importantly, she will head to Cairo midday for a meeting with Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who has acted as the conduit for talks between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu, for his part, said Israel preferred reaching a "long-term solution" through "diplomatic means." "But if not, I am sure you understand that Israel will have to take whatever action is necessary to defend its people," Netanyahu said. We blogged the developments as they happened. If you want a play-by-play keep reading. Our Original Post And Earlier Updates Continue: Update at 4:06 p.m. ET. Clinton Arrives In Israel: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived a short time ago in Israel. Standing next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu she emphasized that the United States' commitment to Israel's security is "rock solid." "The rocket attacks from terrorist organizations inside Gaza on Israeli cities and towns must end and a broader calm restored," Clinton said. "The goal must be a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians alike." Clinton said that President Obama has emphasized the same points in his talks with Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and that she will carry that message to him in Cairo and to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
