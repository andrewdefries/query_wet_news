The new year could bring new challenges to the nation's schools and students. Host Michel Martin discusses what's ahead with NPR Education Correspondent, Claudio Sanchez. He says immigration policy and the demand for Pell Grants could have a huge effect on American education in 2013.
Copyright © 2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE, from NPR News. Coming up: Why did the Oscar-winning filmmaker of "The Hobbit" devote his time, money and moviemaking skills to an entirely different project about a long-ago crime in Arkansas? We'll speak with Peter Jackson and one of the men featured in a new documentary "West of Memphis." That's in just a few minutes. But first, we've been preoccupied with the country's fiscal issues, but now, as we look ahead to the New Year, we want to focus on what 2013 could mean for other important issues facing the country. Today we want to talk about education. Joining us for that is NPR's education correspondent Claudio Sanchez. Happy New Year. CLAUDIO SANCHEZ, BYLINE: Happy New Year, Michel. Good to be with you. MARTIN: I understand that one of the biggest changes you see coming to American education is actually because of changes to immigration policy. You think that the president's deferred action plan - and that's aimed at helping undocumented immigrants stay in the country legally, that's children who were brought here as children are now adults - how do you see that affecting who goes to college? SANCHEZ: This is going to be, I think, an incredible, important issue, not just for that population, but because of the demographics, for states all over the country. There are, after all, two million young people who could benefit from this. President Obama's signing the executive order that gives these people some respite. It means that these people are now flocking to immigration centers, to immigration attorneys to get that reprieve. And we're going to see in some states - California and Texas, Florida, certainly - a huge push to get some of these young people into college. Now, there is also a big question as to whether the long-term - and what I mean by that, whether Congress will resolve this legally. I mean, what the president has done is essentially given these young people a little bit of time. But ultimately, the answer to this question is going to be resolved by the Congress and the Obama administration. MARTIN: But your argument is that because these kids have the opportunity to normalize their status - at least get a reprieve - kids who did not previously see a reason to go to college probably now will. SANCHEZ: Exactly. And that is, I think, the tip of the larger conversation about immigration reform, which I think is, again, the long-term. MARTIN: Focusing on education, though, some 13 states - the latest being Maryland and Massachusetts - have now adopted policies that allow some undocumented students to get that financial aid that you were talking about, or in-state tuition rates at some public colleges and universities. Taking it a step further, the University of California, Berkeley has announced a $1 million scholarship fund for undocumented students. Are they the only people doing this? And what's been the reaction to this? Because you can see arguments on both sides. SANCHEZ: I think in California, where this issue is very volatile, I think that what the UC Berkeley folks did is important. I don't see it happening anywhere else, though. We're not hearing other institutions tal

When Steve Jobs died, there was a lot of talk about who would be the next Steve Jobs. But the truth is, rarely can one person reshape the future. And breakthroughs are almost never the work of corporate titans. Still, new technologies and the people who create them can give us a glimpse of what our future might look like. So as we head into 2013 here are my picks of five interesting technologists to keep an eye on. In Silicon Valley and around the world there are thousands of folks toiling away on new technologies, convinced that the thing they are building will transform the way we live. And sometimes they are right. YouTube
Regina Dugan says there's a lesson in that. As she told a TED conference last year, "You should be nice to nerds. In fact I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life you should get one." Dugan is a huge fan of the nerd. She used to run DARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA helped create self-driving cars and supported the invention of the Internet. So I decided to take Dugan's advice and introduce you to five techies whose research and work I will be keeping a close eye on in the coming year. Nerd No. 1 is Dugan herself. At DARPA she oversaw a diverse group of projects — from developing a space glider that flies at 20 times the speed of sound to research into what it would take to bring high-tech manufacturing back to the United States. Now Dugan is at Google, overseeing advanced research and technology for Motorola. She's keeping mum about what she's up to. I'm intensely curious — and we should hear more soon.

The Most Exciting Tennis Match Ever?

Sports analyst Bill Wolff looks at the Federer/Nadal match at Wimbledon yesterday and all the rest of the weekend sports news.
Copyright © 2008 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. MIKE PESCA, host: And now, we segue our way onto sports, the sporting life. This weekend included a win, a stumble, and this question. She is how old? Wimbledon, track trials and Olympic swimming were on the agenda, and we will recap now with Bill Wolff. Hello, Bill. BILL WOLFF: Well, good morning, Mr. Pesca. PESCA: Good morning, Bill. Let's start with a little clip of Wimbledon to try to reset what was a great, great match. (Soundbite of 2008 The Championships, Wimbledon Men's Final) Unidentified Announcer: Finally here, in this most amazing contest, four hours and 47 minutes old, he has this, to become Wimbledon champion for the first time. He serves down the center, forehand return, backhand from the dowel, forehand into the net! Flat on his back! Rafael rolls Wimbledon! Roger's long reign is finally over! PESCA: Ah, tennis on the radio, I love it. WOLFF: Yeah. ALISON STEWART: It's only better, Mike. Hi, Mike. It's Alison. I'm bombarding the sports segment this morning. PESCA: What? STEWART: See, we were on family vacation at Martha's Vineyard, and my grandma Vike is upstairs, making breakfast, and Bill was too nice to say we're on vacation. So, he decided to do the sports segment. So, I'm just joining along. PESCA: All right, so... STEWART: My family watched this tennis match yesterday. PESCA: What was going on in the Wolff/Stewart household as this tennis match unfolded? WOLFF: Well, grandpa was rooting for the Nadal, but being a wise son-in-law, I did not announce that I was kind of rooting for Federer. I just said, yep, oh, yeah. Right. Got it. You know, you don't want to alienate the father-in-law by taking the other side. PESCA: I was rooting for Federer only because he was, after falling behind two sets, his would be the comeback. But by the time it got to the fifth, I didn't care. I was just pinching myself that I got to see it. STEWART: Seriously, talk about the time! It went on forever. Why was that, Bill? WOLFF: Because it was five sets long, because Roger Federer, who has been perhaps the greatest tennis player over a five-year period in the history of the game, is apparently, or reportedly, at the end of the run. He has crested, and he is now descending as a player. But he dies hard. He was down two sets to love to this guy, Rafael Nadal, whom you saw, the sleeveless wonder from Spain. STEWART: That's the one that my two - my nieces and her 18-year-old friend like because they think he's cute. WOLFF: Well, you know, what are you going do? Anyway, he was up two sets to none, and Federer just would not die. I mean, brilliant shot after brilliant shot to save himself from losing the match, particularly in the fourth set tiebreaker, he was at championship-point. That is, had Nadal won a point, he would have beaten Federer earlier, but Federer just wouldn't go away. The reason I was rooting for Federer is I, as a sports fan, I always enjoy watching the best who ever was. That's why Tiger Woods is so compelling. You get to watch the one who is the best who ever was. And I thought, well, if Federer wins this, the argument is finished. He is the greatest, if he's able to beat this guy Nadal, who is pretty much favored to beat him, coming back from two sets down. So, I rooted for him, but you know, it was not to be. It was Nadal's day. PESCA: On NBC, John McEnroe called it the best match he ever saw. The one - the competition for that would be a match that McEnroe himself was in, in 1980 in Wimbledon

< What Has Changed Since The Tobacco Settlement?
November 16, 2008 3:38 PM
Copyright ©2008 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. LIANE HANSEN, host: Ten years ago, lawyers from the tobacco industry and eight state attorneys general reached agreement on the largest civil settlement in U.S. history. NPR's Debbie Elliott followed those tobacco talks and joins us to reflect on that landmark settlement. Good morning, Deb. DEBBIE ELLIOTT: Hi there, Liane. HANSEN: Tell us how this all began. ELLIOTT: Well, the idea was first hatched down in Mississippi back in 1993. Recently, I traveled down to Mississippi and paid a visit to former Attorney General Mike Moore there as part of a series that will be airing this week on NPR looking back at the tobacco settlement. And he recalled when a friend of his, a lawyer by the name of Mike Lewis, came to him. Lewis' secretary's mother was dying of heart disease caused by a lifetime of smoking, yet Lewis didn't think he had the resources to take on Big Tobacco on behalf of this woman. But he started to think about, well, you know, maybe the state did have the resources, and maybe the state had a case. And here's how Moore remembers the idea coming to him. Mr. MIKE MOORE (Attorney; Chairman of th
