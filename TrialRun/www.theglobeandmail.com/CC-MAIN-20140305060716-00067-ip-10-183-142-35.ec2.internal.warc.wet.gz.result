Angst about work-life balance is not something that arises in people working two or three jobs at the minimum wage, says Dalhousie philosophy professor Greg Scherkoske, who teaches a course called The Good Life. They don’t have the time for such complaints. “It’s a luxury of a privileged person that you can talk about work-life balance rather than how flipping tired you are,” he says.

Tied into it, Mr. Scherkoske notes, is the balance between meaning and tedium in our jobs. People who value achievement and have meaningful jobs are more willing to lead imbalanced lives. “Many people who are happy lead imbalanced lives,” he says, quoting Oscar Wilde: “Everything in moderation, including moderation.”Can philosophers and other academics help us to understand – and cope with – work-life balance better? To find out, I reached out to a few at Canadian universities, and right at the start was told that I needed a better definition of terms.
