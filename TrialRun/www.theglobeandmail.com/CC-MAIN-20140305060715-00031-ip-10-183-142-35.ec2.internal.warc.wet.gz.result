There’s no better time to enjoy strawberries than now. It’s the season when freshly picked berries are juicy, bright red (not white in the middle) and taste sweet like they’re supposed to. (Strawberries don’t ripen after they’re picked. That’s why berries shipped from south of the border can’t match the quality and taste of those locally grown.)

The premiers promoting a west-east oil pipeline are “bullish” on its prospects after TransCanada Energy, the company behind the proposal, signalled it is moving closer to being able to build it.The topic, however, had to be dealt with delicately at a Council of the Federation meeting in light of the disaster in Lac-Mégantic, Que., in which a train carrying crude oil derailed and blew up.
The pipeline would run from Alberta’s oil sands to refineries in Saint John, N.B., traversing six provinces. TransCanada has been working to secure commitments on oil shipments that would make the project viable, which it indicated is going well.New Brunswick Premier David Alward was similarly optimistic, and said he has had good signs from the other provinces.“They’ve all been very open to that discussion – I don’t have any concerns at all,” he told The Globe and Mail in an interview after meetings with his fellow premiers. “We’re bullish on the project because it’s a nation-building project, it’s going to have a positive impact on Canadians from coast to coast to coast.”Alberta Premier Alison Redford said no province had indicated it would block the pipeline.“I’m still very optimistic to know that each jurisdiction will do the work that it needs to do to receive the approvals that it needs to from independent approval processes,” she told reporters.The premiers indicated they did not speak extensively about it in their meetings. Asked about the pipeline proposal by reporters, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois replied: “I am not going to talk about this.”Her office indicated she is awaiting a report on the line. Sources in another premier’s office suggested Ms. Marois also did not want to talk about it so soon after t

From: Rob Ford, Mayor of Toronto
Dear Karen,
Thrilled and excited to appear in the ballet this year. The script you sent over is absolutely amazing. I’m just confused about one little thing: Where are all the lines?
No one says anything. Am I missing something?

Still kicking at 120: the evolution of The Nutcracker
Below, you'll see a couple tweaks/improvements:
First, why are the kids called Clara and Fritz? I know weird names are trendy and all, but this feels like an invitation to bullies. Why don’t we set an example and come up with names that sound a little more “normal”…
At the opening of Scene 1, the family is gathered in the parlour decorating the Christmas tree. Why not have the family hang out in the TV room? That way, you could show live sports on an actual TV so that all the bored dads in the audience will have something to watch. (And if there isn’t any dialogue, the live play-by-play won’t be a problem.)
Okay, this just came to me now: Let’s name the kids Brianna and Cole instead of Clara and Fritz. What do you think?
Not sure I get the whole “godfather” character. First of all, why would a mafia don being handing out magic gifts all of a sudden? And why would a mafia don be named Herr Drosselmeyer? Here’s a better idea. How about the gifts get handed out by “Uncle Dougie,” who pulls up in a big SUV with the third row of seats folded down to make room for all the presents? (I know just the guy to play the part!)
Also, why would Uncle Dougie give Brianna a nutcracker? Talk about lame. (I once gave a six-year-old a set of Ginsu steak knives. Big m

Brazil cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for the 10th straight time to a record low 7.25 per cent, injecting extra stimulus into a languid recovery threatened by a worsening global economy.The decision by the central bank’s monetary policy committee confirmed market bets for a 25 basis points cut over analysts expectations for a pause in the year-long easing campaign that brought rates to all-time lows. Five board members voted for the cut while three opted to keep rates steady.
