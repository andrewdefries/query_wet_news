Workers were forced to jump from the second storey as their colleagues on the ground fought desperately to push their way in to rescue others after a B.C. sawmill they were working at was blown apart by an explosion and fire.
Nineteen people were sent to hospital, some with critical injuries, and two were still missing in Burns Lake, B.C., Saturday as uninjured employees drove their burned colleagues to hospital and other members of the close-knit communities nearby rushed to the hospital to help out.

“I had to help a couple guys, one with a broken arm, one [with]his body severely burned,” Sam Tom told The Canadian Press on Saturday, still emotional after a night of horror and very little sleep.
Mr. Tom said he was just coming back from a coffee break when he saw a flash.
Then “boom. Everything just went flying,” he said, struggling to describe it further.
Mr. Tom said his job was outside the mill. When the explosion happened, he said he parked the loader he was driving and tried to run into the mill, but the flames were too hot.
“I couldn’t even make it in there,” he said. “Everything was burning.”
Mr. Tom then tried to get into the mill through a blown-out wall, but debris was everywhere.
“Everybody was yelling, so [I]followed the yelling noise, then we got one guy out and more guys started coming out.”
Co-workers jumped from the second floor of the building. Some people were screaming in pain.
“There was no time to think,” said Mr. Tom.
Two people were still missing Saturday morning, hours after the blast Friday evening at about 8:15 p.m. at the mill, Babine Forest Products, a company located on leased aboriginal land just outside Burns Lake.
Rescue efforts were further hampered by blowing snow, whiteout driving conditions and temperatures that dipped to -20 C.
Burns Lake is about 228 kilometres west of Prince George.
Steve Raper, spokesman for the Northern Health Authority, said 19 people were taken to hospital with a variety of injuries. Some of the injured have severe burns and four are in critical condition.
Neither Mr. Raper nor a RCMP spokeswoman would say if anyone had been killed.
Mr. Raper said after the explosion, two were airlifted to Vancouver General Hospital and two to Edmonton’s University Hospital. A fifth person was transferred to Vancouver later on Saturday, but was considered in stable condition.
Nine others remain in hospitals in Smithers, Vanderhoof, Prince George and locally. Five were treated and released.
There was no official word on what caused the explosion, but community leaders were hearing anecdotal reports from workers who smelled gas.
“It was a gas explosion,” said Wilf Adam, chief of the Babine Lake First Nation where many workers are members.
“The morning shift said that there was a big gas odour coming from the basement, and when the afternoon shift came on, that’s when it happened.”
Some injured workers who had been released from hospital gathered with their family, friends and co-workers at a community hall located on the reserve.
Mr. Adam said the facility was being used as a command centre to provide grief counselling and general updates on what was happening at the still-smouldering mill.
“We’re still waiting for the

After months of dealing with a stubbornly high Canadian dollar, some retailers are finally beginning to do what consumers have been demanding: narrow the price difference between Canadian and U.S. goods.
Despite dollar parity, Canadian retail prices have remained higher than U.S. prices for comparable, or identical, products. According to one bank economist's estimate, Canadian prices are, on average, about 12 to 15 per cent higher than those in the United States.
