Fiat SpA’s agreement to take 100-per-cent control of Chrysler Group LLC for $4.35-billion (U.S.) will create the world’s seventh-biggest auto maker and solidifies the reputation of Sergio Marchionne, the Italian-Canadian chief executive officer of both companies, as the industry’s top deal maker.What it doesn’t do is change the market conditions and lack of new products that have hobbled Fiat in Europe, where it loses money. Nor does it guarantee the new group’s success against Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and the other industry giants, which can devote tens of billions of dollars to product development programs as the technology arms race intensifies.
