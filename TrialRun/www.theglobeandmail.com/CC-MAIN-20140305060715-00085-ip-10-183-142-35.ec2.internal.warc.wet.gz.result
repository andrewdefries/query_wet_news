A bond default by one of China’s biggest solar panel makers is a sign the Chinese solar industry is heading for the same kind of consolidation that has hit the rest of the world, where overcapacity and low prices have driven many players out of business.Suntech Power Holdings Co. Ltd. revealed that on March 15 it defaulted on $541-million (U.S.) worth of bonds. The company, based in Wuxi, China, said it was going to try to “maintain business relationships with its existing customers and suppliers,” and would look for additional sources of capital as it restructures. But there is no sign so far that the Chinese government or its agencies will step in to help.
