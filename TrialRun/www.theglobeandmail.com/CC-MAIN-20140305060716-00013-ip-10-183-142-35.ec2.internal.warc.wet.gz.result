(For complete coverage of 2014 predictions for investors, see our Market Outlook page)The Toronto stock market lived up to its predicted modest gains for 2013, closing up about six per cent, but there’s optimism in the air for Canada’s main stock market for the year ahead.“I think 2013 marks the end of (a) period of time of sharp underperformance,” said Bob Gorman, chief portfolio strategist at TD Waterhouse. “I think in the coming year we will see a convergence of returns between the Canadian and U.S. markets.”

Telus Corp. ’s proposal to eliminate its dual-class share structure is at risk of failure now that a U.S. hedge fund that holds nearly 19 per cent of its common shares is vowing to vote against the plan.
New York-based Mason Capital Management LLC made that disclosure in a filing on Tuesday, a move that signals it is seeking additional support from other institutional investors to topple the proposal when it is put to a shareholder vote next month.

LTE is billed by industry players as the latest evolution in wireless technologies because it provides consumers with faster download speeds on such mobile devices as smartphones and tablet computers. For example, Telus estimated in its release that downloading a 600-megabyte music album with a 4G LTE-capable mobile device could be accomplished in as little as 3.5 minutes.=-
