Alice’s Adventures in WonderlandChoreography by Christopher WheeldonNational Ballet of CanadaFour Seasons Centre in Toronto on SaturdayChristopher Wheeldon’s new ballet, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, is a monumental achievement. This production has to be the best dance adaptation of Lewis Carroll’s beloved children’s classic on the planet.
The two producing partners, the National Ballet of Canada and London’s Royal Ballet, are lucky to have the work in their repertoire. This Alice (showing as part of the Luminato festival) is going to be a cash cow for both companies.Nicholas Wright’s scenario divides the story into two acts. The first contains the most famous of the Wonderland episodes such as the Drink Me/Eat Me scene, Pig and Pepper, and the Mad Hatter’s tea party. The second act is devoted to the Queen of Hearts’ croquet party and the Knave’s trial scene. Perhaps at an hour plus, the first act is a trifle rich, but cutting out any episode would be a crime.The ballet cleverly begins in reality, with a garden party at the home of Alice Liddell’s parents. The family and guests become the denizens of Wonderland. For example, Lewis Carroll is transformed into the White Rabbit, and Alice’s mother to the Queen of Hearts.The one deviation away from Carroll’s story is to make Alice (Jillian Vanstone) a teenager, so she can have a crush on Jack, the gardener’s boy (Zdenek Konvalina). Jack becomes the Knave of Hearts in Wonderland which allows Wheeldon to create three lushly romantic pas de deux.Vanstone is an absolute charmer. Her technique has always been exquisite, but this ballet also demands an actress. Her Alice is a feisty girl who isn’t afraid of anything, and who throws herself into every new adventure with gusto. She seems absolutely alive on stage, glowing with youth.As Jack, Konvalina can do no wrong. He has always cut a romantic figure on stage with his excellent technique, and he is every inch the ardent lover as the Knave. His performance is also expressive. The Knave’s beautiful solo in the trial scene where he tries to prove his innocence is poignant indeed.Alice is Wheeldon’s homage to traditional ballet. The piece is wall-to-wall dancing, all designed to show off formidable technique. Nonetheless, the British choreographer has added his own touches, such as unpredictability of direction, and the unusual ways that patterns segue into each other. The dance itself seems completely fresh.Wheeldon has also given each character its own individual movement personality. For example, the nervous White Rabbit (Aleksandar Antonijevic) is all about frantic tics and staccato, unfocused limb thrusts. The seductive Caterpillar with his Magic Mushroom (Jiri Jelinek) has been given sexy, undulating muscle isolations in the Oriental style. The madness of the Mad Hatter (Royal Ballet guest artist Steven McRae) is shown through a frenetic tap dance.One of the delights of the choreography is Wheeldon’s quotes from ballet masters. The Mad Hatter, March Hare (Jonathan Renna), and Dormouse (Lise-Mar

Anyone can sympathize with Mark Carney’s frustration, and with the similar feelings of many other central bankers around the world. Although the Governor of the Bank of Canada has pushed interest rates to record lows and promised to hold them there, business growth has remained sluggish. Many companies, exercising their own judgment, have insisted on holding onto their cash until they’re sure it’s safe to spend.
Mr. Carney scolded companies last week for excessive caution, and his views were echoed on Monday by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who told reporters his government has done all it can with tax policy to stimulate growth. “At a certain point, it’s not up to the government to stimulate the economy, it’s up to the private sector, and they have lots of capital,” Mr. Flaherty said.From the perspective of economists and policy-makers, Mr. Carney’s and Mr. Flaherty’s opinions are legitimate and their urgings are unsurprising. But for the business community, the implications that their choices are wrong, greedy or even unpatriotic are not fair. Much as Mr. Carney may wish things were different, it is unrealistic to expect business decisions to be made solely because of monetary or fiscal policy.That doesn’t mean, however, that the business community is immune to pressure. Many large public companies whose shares trade on stock exchanges face intense scrutiny from shareholders, investment advisers and analysts about how they use their cash. Having cash on hand is generally welcomed, but companies face significant pressure to deploy the money or boost dividends when the amounts build up too high for too long. In extreme cases, companies become targeted for takeover by activist investors when they insis
