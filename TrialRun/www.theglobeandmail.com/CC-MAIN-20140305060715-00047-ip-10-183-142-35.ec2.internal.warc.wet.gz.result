Plagued by cost-conscious corporate buyers and smartphone-loving consumers, the personal-computer market has become a dangerous place to do business.
Hewlett-Packard , the world’s largest PC manufacturer, announced Wednesday it will lay off 27,000 employees, or 8 per cent of its work force. The layoffs, which are the largest in HP’s history, come as the computer-maker tries to find a way to get profits growing again at a time when global sales of information technology (IT) are stagnating and only a handful of PC companies are seeing their fortunes improve.

HP’s announcement – which the company made while announcing fiscal second quarter earnings that were down from a year earlier – came at the end of a trading day in which rival PC manufacturer Dell saw its share price take a 17 per cent beating after earnings missed analyst expectations. Like HP, Dell has been struggling to reinvent itself as more than just a computer company as worldwide PC sales slow after decades of healthy growth.
Some observers look at the global IT business as a bellwether for the economy. Certainly the financial crisis in Europe has not helped the technology industry.
In a report issued earlier this month, Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes predicted global tech spending growth will settle at about 5 per cent this year, after hitting nearly twice that rate over the past two years. Spending in regions such as Western Europe – the second-largest tech market and a region hit hard by the euro zone crisis – will actually decline this year, he added.
PC makers face challenges that go beyond the general IT slowdown. Increasingly, consumers are spending money on upgrading their tablets and smartphones, rather than their desktops.
“Tech is facing an accelerating shift from older technologies (servers, PCs, routers) to new technologies (mobile devices, sensors, cloud computing),” Mr. Gomes said. “Smartphone shipments overtook PC sales in the final months of 2010 and continue to advance in excess of 50 per cent per annum.”
Both HP and Dell have previously tried to cater to the fast-growing smartphone and tablet markets, with little success. Dell will likely make another attempt later this year, building mobile devices to coincide with the launch of the latest version of the Windows operating system from Microsoft.

It was the Christmas bills that did it for Cindy McMullen.
In January, 2007, as she was opening the credit card bills that showed, in black and white, just how much money and she and her husband had blown during the holidays, Ms. McMullen decided it was time to do something about the cash crunch that had become a constant part of their lives.

Although she tracked their household expenses closely, Ms. McMullen says she and her husband just couldn't get on top of their debt load, which had climbed to "several tens of thousand of dollars" and included a bank loan, a line of credit and back income taxes.
