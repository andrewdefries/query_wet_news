For most people, it’s about as pleasant an activity as undergoing a colonoscopy.Doing one’s tax return is a chore average Canadians would gladly put off indefinitely, but as the April 30 deadline looms a new survey indicates that a majority of us feel it’s our civic duty to faithfully carry it out every year.
