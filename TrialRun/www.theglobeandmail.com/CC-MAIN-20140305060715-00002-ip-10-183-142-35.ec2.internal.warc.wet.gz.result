Apple has no problem getting Chinese consumers to desire its products, as a near-riot outside its Beijing store showed in January. But the U.S. tech giant has been beset by problems. As well as a rolling trademark battle, which has resulted in iPads being taken off the shelves in some cities, Apple’s market share is slipping, and the factory conditions at some of its Chinese partners are being questioned. It needs a new strategy.
Despite strong demand, Apple has so far held the Middle Kingdom at arm’s length. One in eight dollars of Apple’s revenue came from China in its fiscal 2011, yet only five of its 300 stores globally are there. That leaves room for rivals to grow. Apple’s smartphone market share in China was 7.5 per cent by the end of 2011, down from 10.4 per cent in the third quarter.
Step one should be to distribute more cleverly. The six-month delay in making the iPhone 4S available to its Chinese customers after the U.S. release looks too long. Yet instead of adding channels, Apple is pulling its tablets from unauthorized merchants including Amazon.com’s Chinese site. It halted iPhone 4S sales after overwhelming demand.
Striking a deal with China Mobile, the country’s biggest mobile carrier, would help. It currently relies on China Unicom, which reaches just 10 per cent of mobile users. If the iPhone could reach a third of China Mobile’s existing 120 million high-paying customers, it could boost projected earnings per share by up to a quarter in 2013, according to Morgan Stanley.
Tighter control of suppliers is another must. Not owning any factories in its most important manufacturing base has left it vulnerable to criticism over working conditions – particularly at its biggest supplier, Foxconn. The Fair Labour Association said it has uncovered “tons of issues” at the manufacturer’s plants.
Apple could do worse than buy a stake in Foxconn, dipping into its $98-billion (U.S.) cash pile. It has enough funds to buy Foxconn’s parent, Hon Hai Precision, three times over. For Apple, which doesn’t normally own its suppliers, it would be a departure. But doing so would ensure it has a bigger say over its supply chain. Without some new thinking, Apple is unlikely to realize China’s vast potential.

A radial artery taken from a patient's wrist or arm, versus a saphenous vein from the leg or thigh, has been shown to provide the best outcome five years after coronary artery bypass grafting.The Radial Artery Patency Study, published on-line in advance of publication in the July issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, is a randomized study involving nine Canadian centres and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The study looked at 269 patients approximately 7.5 years after having a heart bypass.

It's a funny thing about home-ice advantage and how it matters in some series more than others. Way back a couple of weeks ago against the San Jose Sharks, home ice wasn't much of an advantage to the Chicago Blackhawks. In fact, the Blackhawks were playing so much better on the road - seven wins in a row and counting - that they took the unusual step of checking into a local hotel to mimic the effects of the road. The road ruled! Jonathan Toews' video-game prowess was as much of a talking point as that 13-game scoring streak he piled up to lead the Blackhawks right into the Stanley Cup final.
That was then - and not so long ago either.
Now, in the heart of their series against the Philadelphia Flyers that is tied 2-2 heading into Sunday's fifth game, home-ice means all to Chicago. Home is where the heart is. Home is sweet. Home is the United Center and its crazy screaming fans, as crazy and as enervated as the 20,000 plus that peopled the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia and helped carry the Flyers to two consecutive victories.
