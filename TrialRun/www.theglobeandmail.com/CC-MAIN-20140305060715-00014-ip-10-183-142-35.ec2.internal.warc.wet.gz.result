Apple euphoria has hit a new high with some analysts forecasting that Apple Inc. is on the way to becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company at the expense of Research In Motion Ltd. and other competitors.
Within the next two years, Apple’s share price will likely hit $1,000 (U.S.), a 62-per-cent increase from the current level, two analysts said this week.

African countries have the lowest levels of contraception use in the world, trailing countries in Europe and the rest of the globe by significant amounts, according to data from the World Health Organization. Chad has the lowest levels of contraception use, with just 2.8 per cent of women or their partners using some form of birth control. This compares with much higher levels in Norway (88.4%) and other non-African countries including Canada (74%).
The information comes from interagency data collected by the WHO and measures the percentage of women aged 15-49, married or in-union, who together use some form of contraception.Chad bottoms the list along with other African countries: Angola (6.2%), Sudan (7.6%), Eritrea (8%) and Sierra Leone (8.2%). Low contraception use in developing countries can affect women who must care for more babies than they can support while struggling with poverty and disease. Advocates for family planning education and contraception have called the issue a human rights concern. This week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is co-hosting a summit on family planning in London to address the issue.Topping the list is Norway (88.4%), with Portugal (86.8%), Malta (85.8%) and China (84.6%) claiming the next highest spots. The U.S. ranks 15th (78.6%) while Canada sits in 24th place (74%).Click any country to see more information. Some countries are blank because no data exists for that region.

Richard Scott made a difficult decision on Friday and declined his invitation into this month's RBC Canadian Open. The golfer from Kingsville, Ont., was one of 11 Canadians extended an exemption earlier this week by tournament director Bill Paul based on his strong play this season on the Web.com Tour. However, Scott tells the London Free Press that it is because of his strong play of late on the developmental tour that is the reason behind his decision to play in a Web.com Tour event scheduled for the same week as the Open in Hamilton. The 28-year-old
three-time Canadian Amateur champion currently sits 27th on the money list with the top 25 at the end of the year qualifying for PGA Tour status in 2013. “On one side, it’s kind of a bummer that I got the opportunity to play this year and I’m going to have to pass it up, but at the same time, I think it’s the best decision for me right now," said Scott, who
