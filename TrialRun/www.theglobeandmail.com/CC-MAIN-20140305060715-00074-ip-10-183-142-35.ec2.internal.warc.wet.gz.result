Domenic Pilla is taking Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. into the future, one digital lipstick at a time.
The new chief executive officer oversaw the recent launch of the drugstore retailer’s first e-commerce initiative with the rollout of an online shopping site for its high-end Murale beauty chain. It comes at a time when the country’s largest drugstore merchant is feeling growing pressures of provincial drug reforms, which are squeezing the bottom line and forcing pharmacies to look for new revenue sources.
