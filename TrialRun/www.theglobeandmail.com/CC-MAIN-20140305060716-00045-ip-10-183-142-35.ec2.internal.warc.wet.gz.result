The NDP have swept to a decisive victory in both British Columbia by-elections – including a landslide win in an area where the party has not won since provincial elections began more than a century ago.The results – particularly in Chilliwack-Hope, an area where a left-wing party has never won – are what the NDP hoped for and the B.C. Liberals had feared. A split in the right-of-centre vote tore down what had been two Liberal bastions, with the NDP scoring clear wins in both.

Federal and Alberta regulators have conditionally approved Royal Dutch Shell’s multibillion-dollar Jackpine oil-sands mine expansion despite their findings that it would have a number of adverse environmental impacts.A joint review panel, appointed by the federal Environment Minister and the provincial energy regulator, ruled that the project’s effects on wildlife and vegetation will be significant, but that it is nonetheless in the public interest.

There is a paradox in this pocket of our shared history. Economies in many countries are struggling to recover from an all-time historical low, entire industries are caving and for many, the perceived safety of brick-and-mortar financial institutions is crumbling down.

Readers can pay 10 dollars a month for unlimited access to over a hundred Canadian and American monthlies, and can pay an extra five dollars for such weeklies as Maclean’s or The New Yorker.

You must have noticed how thin some magazines have gotten in recent years. Starved of advertising revenue as the Internet has scattered consumer attention, magazines appear to be ailing and weak. But perhaps an app will save them?That seems to be the pitch for Next Issue Canada. Billed as “the Netflix for magazines,” the
