A rush of adrenalin pumped thought the convention floor at the Verdun Auditorium in Montreal as hundreds of Quebec Liberal delegates arrived on Saturday for the party’s first leadership convention in thirty years.The enthusiasm was in contrast to the apathy that characterized the long drawn-out process to replace Jean Charest. The race finally comes to an end on Sunday and the only question is whether it will need one or two ballots to elect a new leader as front-runner Philippe Couillard makes his final pitch for a convincing victory.

For Canadian resource companies, the cost of doing business abroad is about to go up.New reporting requirements passed under the U.S. Dodd Frank financial overhaul bill will require resource extraction issuers to disclose all payments made to governments over $100,000, beginning in 2014. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulations will add new expenses for Canadian mining and energy companies listed in the U.S., and may hinder their competitiveness overseas.
