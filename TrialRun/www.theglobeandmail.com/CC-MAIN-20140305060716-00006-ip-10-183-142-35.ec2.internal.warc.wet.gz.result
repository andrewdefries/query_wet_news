The close: TSX slips as S&P 500 hits another record high
Press release from Business Wire
Boston Properties Announces First Quarter 2013 Results
<p class=&apos;bwalignc&apos;> <b>Reports diluted FFO per share of $1.06.</b> <b>Reports diluted EPS of $0.31</b> </p>
Tuesday, April 30, 2013
Boston Properties Announces First Quarter 2013 Results
17:59 EDT Tuesday, April 30, 2013
BOSTON (Business Wire) -- Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP), a real estate investment
trust, reported results today for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 were
$160.6 million, or $1.06 per share basic and $1.06 per share diluted.
This compares to FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 of $166.7
million, or $1.12 per share basic and $1.12 per share diluted. The
weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding totaled
151,645,578 and 153,259,143, respectively, for the quarter ended March
31, 2013 and 148,343,382 and 150,140,431, respectively, for the quarter
ended March 31, 2012.
The Company's reported FFO of $1.06 per share diluted was lower than the
guidance previously provided of $1.19-$1.21 per share. The Company's
reported FFO included the following items, among others, that were not
reflected in the guidance: $0.12 per share of greater than expected
general and administrative expense due to the recently announced CEO
succession and transition plan and a $0.05 per share impairment charge
on a parcel of land located in San Jose, California, offset by $0.03 per
share of improvement in portfolio operations.
Net income available to common shareholders was $47.9 million for the
quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared to $48.5 million for the quarter
ended March 31, 2012. Net income available to common shareholders per
share (EPS) for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 was $0.32 basic and
$0.31 on a diluted basis. This compares to EPS for the first quarter of
2012 of $0.33 basic and $0.33 on a diluted basis.
The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that
the results will not vary from the final information for the quarter
ended March 31, 2013. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results
have been made.
As of March 31, 2013, the Company's portfolio consisted of 157
properties, comprised primarily of Class A office space, one hotel,
three residential properties and four retail properties, aggregating
approximately 44.6 million square feet, including seven properties under
construction totaling 2.5 million square feet. In addition, the Company
has structured parking for vehicles containing approximately 15.9
million square feet. The overall percentage of leased space for the 147
properties in service (excluding the two in-service residential
properties and the hotel) as of March 31, 2013 was 91.7%.
Significant events during the first quarter included:
On January 7, 2013, the Company signed a 20-year lease with the
General Services Administration for 100% of its approximately 182,000
net rentable square foot previously vacant Three Patriots Park
property located in Reston, Virginia.
On January 28, 2013, the Company's Compensation Committee approved a
new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the “2013
MYLTIP”) in lieu of a 2013 Outperformance Plan as a performance-based
component of the Company's overall compensation program. Under the
Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” the 2013
MYLTIP has an aggregate value of approximately $8.1 million, which
amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year
plan period under the graded vesting method.
On February 5, 2013, the Company used available cash to repay the
mortgage loan collateralized by its Kingstowne One property located in
Alexandria, Virginia totaling approximately $17.0 million. The
mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.96% per annum and was
scheduled to mature on May 5, 2013. There was no prepayment penalty.
On February 6, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of 535
Mission Street, a development site, in San Francisco, California for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $71.0 million in cash,
including work completed and materials purchased to date. When
completed, 535 Mission Street will consist of a 27-story, Class A
office tower with approximately 307,000 net rentable square feet of
office and retail space. The Company has commenced development of the
project.
On February 7, 2013, the partner in the Company's Transbay Tower joint
venture issued a notice that it was electing under the joint venture
agreement to reduce its nominal ownership interest in the venture from
50% to 5%. On February 26, 2013, the Company issued a notice to the
partner electing to proceed with the venture on that basis. As a
result, the Company has a 95% nominal interest in and is consolidating
the joint venture. On March 26, 2013, the consolidated joint venture
completed the acquisition of a land parcel in San Francisco,
California which will support a 60-story, 1.4 million square foot
office tower known as Transbay Tower. The purchase price for the land
was approximately $192.0 million.
On February 20, 2013, the foreclosure sale of the Company's Montvale
Center property was ratified by the court. As a result of the
ratification, the mortgage loan totaling $25.0 million was
extinguished and the related obligations were satisfied with the
transfer of the real estate resulting in the recognition of a gain on
forgiveness of debt totaling approximately $20.2 million during the
first quarter of 2013. The operating results of the property through
the date of ratification have been classified as discontinued
operations on a historical basis for all periods.
On February 28, 2013, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50%
interest completed and fully placed in-service Annapolis Junction
Building Six, a Class A office property with approximately 120,000 net
rentable square feet located in Annapolis, Maryland. The property is
currently 49

Some who took part in the inquiry looking into why millions of sockeye salmon vanished from one of British Columbia’s most prized fisheries are already anticipating what the report might say, and many believe the news won’t be good for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.After listening to 160 witnesses, compiling 14,000 pages of transcripts and 2,100 exhibits, B.C. Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen must deliver his report to the federal government by Monday, although it remains unclear when, or even if, the document will be made public.

One of the groups that participated in the inquiry is the Watershed Watch Salmon Society. Its executive director, Craig Orr, said he believes the inquiry has proven major reforms are needed in how fisheries and natural resources are managed by the federal government.“The evidence was really clear that government is going to have quite a report on its hands, and there’s going to be a very high expectation that there’s going to be some major changes made,” he said.“The bigger question I think ... is [whether] government is going to have any meaningful reactions to the report, other than the usual deny, delay and distract kind of approach that we seem to get.”The federal government called the Commission of Inquiry into the Decline of Sockeye Salmon in the Fraser River and appointed Judge Cohen as commissioner in November, 2009. The bill for the inquiry is expected to be at least $26-million.Months earlier, an estimated 1.4-million sockeye showed up in B.C.’s rivers and streams in a run that was projected to be around 10 million. The offspring of those salmon are expected to return to the Fraser River during the summer of 2013.The inquiry began in August, 2010, and ended in December, 2011. During the course of its hearings, the commission tackled some 40 themes, ranging from aboriginal fishing to aquaculture, commercial fishing to disease, habitat management and enforcement to predation.Melanie Carkner, a spokeswoman for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, said in an e-mail to The Canadian Press the department wouldn’t be commenting or providing interviews on the report until it’s tabled.But Mr. Orr said many are cynical of the process because the federal government announced changes to legislation like the Fisheries Act, Environmental Assessment Act and Nav
