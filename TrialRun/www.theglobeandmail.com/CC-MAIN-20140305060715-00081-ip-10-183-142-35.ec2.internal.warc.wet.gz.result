A good deal of what airs on ABC tonight is Oscar-themed. This smacks of desperation.There’s the special episode of 20/20, Mad About Oscar With Katie Couric (ABC, CHCH, 10 p.m.) which promises “Footage of memorable acceptance speeches, hilarious monologues, unscripted moments and red carpet fashion from the Oscar archives.” Now, this sort of pre-AcademyAwards special is not unusual, though it does seem weird that the program looks back at old Oscar evenings rather than focusing on this year’s contest.
