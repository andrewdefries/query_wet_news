Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista is making a $1.2-billion cash offer to take full control of Ventana Gold Corp. , sending the company's shares soaring almost 40 per cent.
Mr. Batista, a resource tycoon with extensive holdings in mining and oil, already owns 20 per cent of Vancouver-based Ventana. The offer, a week after the company released positive results from a resource study of its Colombian gold project, is being made through Mr. Batista's company EBX Group.

Market View
Gold: It's really not a superstar
Ventana's properties are in the early stages of development, but it is well known in the mining world. "Just about every company in the gold mining space has looked at Ventana," said analyst Michael Fowler of Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon Ltd. He added the deposits are particularly attractive to some of the larger gold companies.
Mr. Batista's move could prove well timed, as gold prices sit near record levels. In the mining world, Colombia is quickly becoming the rising star, and Ventana operates next to Greystar Resources Ltd., which has substantial proven resources.
For that reason, Mr. Fowler thinks Mr. Batista's offer may not be high enough. Gold companies are paying prices in excess of $500 (U.S.) per resource ounce to acquire high-quality assets,

The questionThree years ago, my husband was referred to a specialist to operate on his ankle. His doctor’s office can tell us only that they did send the referral, but he still doesn’t even have a consultation booked. The receptionist at the specialist never answers the phone. We are very polite and we understand that there are wait lists and probably people with worse problems, but we don’t even know if we are in the queue. How should we proceed?
