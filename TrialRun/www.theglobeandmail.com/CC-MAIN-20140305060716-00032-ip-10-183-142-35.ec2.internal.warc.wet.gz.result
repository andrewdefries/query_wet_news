When you get a phone call from Mickey Hart at 1:30 a.m. you are grateful.As one of the Rhythm Devils that helped the Grateful Dead create its iconic sound, the cadence of a conversation with the rock legend feels like a jam session.He may be best known as a former member of the Dead, but with the “cutting edge” work Hart’s doing these days he may go down in history as a scientific musical explorer.
