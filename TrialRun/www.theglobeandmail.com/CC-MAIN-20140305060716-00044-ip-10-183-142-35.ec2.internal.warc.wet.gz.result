Just Wright
Directed by Sanaa Hamri
Written by Michael Elliot
Starring Queen Latifah, Common, Paula Patton, Phylicia Rashad, Pam Grier and James Pickens Jr.
Classification: PG

Just Wright, a modern Cinderella story with an old-school sensibility that proves you don't have to change the rules to make a winning romantic comedy.
Technically speaking, this is a romantic sports comedy. We don't get many films in which these elements work well as a team. More often, we get sports flicks with romance on the sidelines - the underdog hero with a love interest there for inspiration, or for post-game embraces on a Jumbotron.
One of the best examples of the hybrid is

Most romcoms attempting that delay tactic instead give us screaming matches, ridiculous misunderstandings and other exasperating nonsense that bring us to the brink of loathing.
Just Wright eschews the hysteria and shenanigans of most rom-com flicks and makes the friendship zone the barricade to romance. This could be dull as dishwater, but director Sanaa Hamri and writer Michael Elliot - with story-crafting assistance from producer Debra Martin Chase (
The Princess Diaries, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) - keep it lively with a smartly plotted script and no wasted scenes. While the dialogue often feels perfunctory, the appealing characters and fine cast move it along with convincing warmth.
One short scene early on tells us all we need to know about the love life of Leslie Wright (Latifah). After a slam-dunk date, the guy admits he just wants to be friends; Leslie has heard it before. She climbs into her pumpki
