I once survived for 18 months in a 107-square-foot garret in St. Germain des Prés. My Parisian memories are not of a claustrophobic room, but rather of a private refuge made livable by a city with great street life and public design. From cafés to cathedrals, parks to piscines municipales, the spaces outside my room were as much a part of my life as the space within.
