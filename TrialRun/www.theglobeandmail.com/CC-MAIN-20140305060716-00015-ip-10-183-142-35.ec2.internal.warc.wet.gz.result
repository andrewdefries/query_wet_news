In early trading, the S&P/TSX composite index was up 5 points, or 0.04 per cent, at 12,286; the S&P 500 was up 1 point, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,431; and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 11 points, or 0.09 per cent, at 13,247.

UBS paid CEO Sergio Ermotti almost $9-million and welcomed its new investment bank chief with a $26-million “golden hello” in 2012, the same year the bank announced plans to fire 10,000 staff in a cost-cutting drive.Bankers’ pay in Switzerland remains a heated issue five years after the near collapse of UBS in 2008, blamed by many on a culture of big bonuses driving bankers to make risky investments.

“He made his pick without any hesitation,” Hansen said.That could mean bad news for Broncos fans. The 13-year-old primate hasn’t been wrong since 2006.Last year, Eli charged out and knocked over a papier-mache goal post decorated with the Ravens logo.
