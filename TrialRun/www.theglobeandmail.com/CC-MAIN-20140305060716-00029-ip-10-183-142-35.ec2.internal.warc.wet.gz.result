Insurers are your modern stone-age industry.We are talking a Fred Flintstone level of evolution in terms of customer service. This point was driven home by the latest J.D. Power report on how satisfied customers are with providers of auto insurance. (To see a gallery of how satisfied Canadians are with their insurers, click here.)

Top oil industry executives are asking Ottawa for rules to protect Canadian ownership of major oil sands companies from a flood of foreign investment expected in the sector.Canada’s oil sands contain the third-largest crude oil reserves in the world and are a strategically critical resource for the country, industry executives argue. They support the proposed $15.1-billion acquisition of Nexen Inc. by China’s CNOOC Ltd., but note the deal signals growing foreign interest in the oil sands and insist Ottawa needs to ensure a substantial level of domestic ownership as more deals loom.
