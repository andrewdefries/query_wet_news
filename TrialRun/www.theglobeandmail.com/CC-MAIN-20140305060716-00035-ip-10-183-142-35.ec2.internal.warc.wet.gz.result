How Canada’s housing market will look in 2024: If you’re wealthy, it’s healthy.If house prices rise from current levels by an average annual rate of 2.5 per cent over the next 10 years, the average Canadian home will cost half a million dollars. By my rough estimate, that would be a realistic purchase only for families with pretax income of at least $125,000 or so. Just for context, the most recent Statistics Canada numbers put the median total family income at $72,240 in 2011.

If you feel your memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be, the remedy might be no farther away than your refrigerator. According to two new studies, the foods you eat – and supplements you take – can boost your brain power.The first study, published in the journal Neurology, analyzed the diets of 17,478 men and women with an average age of 64 to see how closely they adhered to the Mediterranean diet. The participants did not have any memory impairment at the start of the study and underwent cognitive tests annually over a four-year period.
