The Globe and Mail is using
Google Maps to plot some of the quarter million U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.
We’d like your help! If you come across any interesting cables relating to Canada or other countries, simply
edit this collaborative map.
Here's how: To plot a point, log into your Google/Gmail account in the top right corner, click "Edit" and select and drag the blue placemark tool at the top left of the map to the most relevant location. Fill in the title field with the year of the cable and a short descriptive headline. Then add a few sentences describing the cable. If possible, use the rich text editing option to add a link to the actual cable from
wikileaks.org. Click "OK," then "Save" and then "Done".
Click here to edit the map.

Plumes of noxious tear gas in the sky above Istanbul have spooked investors in Turkey, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s refusal to back down has sent many heading for the exit.The premier’s unrepentantly combative approach on Thursday deepened the turmoil rattling Turkish markets. The Istanbul stock exchange slumped another 4.7 per cent, to its lowest since December, and bond yields have shot up.
