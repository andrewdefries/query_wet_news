Hey guys: I drive a 2004 BMW 330ci convertible and I’m due for a change. I’ve looked at a gently used 2012 BMW 335xi coupe (last model year) and I am also considering a 2013 Golf R. Both cars appeal to me. The BMW seems more luxurious, the R sportier. Other than the all-wheel-drive feature, I have no other practical considerations, other than the R will be $10,000 less expensive, of course. Any advice for an undecided driver? – JP in Calgary
