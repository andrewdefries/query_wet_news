There are many reasons that the Masters is golf’s most popular event. Among these, of course, is the fact that it’s played on the same course every year, and that’s it’s sooooo private. I’m asked a lot of questions about golf, but the one I’m asked more than any other is whether I’ve played the course. I have, four times.
The first two times were because I’d been picked in the annual Masters lottery for media spots on the Monday morning following the tournament. Twenty spots were given to print, 20 to televisions, and 20 to radio. I was picked during one of the first years I covered the Masters in the mid-80s (the decade, not the score). We were required to play off the members’ tees. The course is about 6,400 yards from there. That was only about 500 yards short of where the Masters competitors played the tournament in those days, some 25 years ago.
I have no idea what I shot, but I recall thinking that club co-founder Bobby Jones was right on the money when he said the course should allow for an easy bogey and a hard par. It’s a club for members, after all, except during the Masters when the course should test the best players in the game. There was so much width to the fairways that it wasn’t difficult to keep one’s drive in play. If you can think your way around Augusta, you should be able to play to your handicap.
After that early win in the lottery, I didn’t bother bringing my clubs to Augusta when I covered the Masters. The rule then was that you couldn’t enter the lottery for another seven years after striking gold. The rule changed some years later, but I still didn’t bother bringing my clubs. I’d had my game at Augusta National.
But, at some point, my wife suggested I take my clubs to the Masters and put my name in again for the lottery. My name was drawn. This was about 20 years after the first time my name came up. I played with some English writers. The pace of play was agonizingly slow, because the group ahead took photos on every hole—of themselves, with every green and bank of azaleas as background. A couple of my playing companions had to leave before they finished so that they could make their flight home out of Atlanta—a two and a half-hour drive from Augusta.
It’s odd to me that I can hardly remember a shot I hit that round, either. I do remember that the guy caddying for me was big into disc golf; he told me about the Augusta Disc Golf Association and some of the area’s challenging courses. I finished my round, had a quick lunch, and that was that.
Then came a call a few years later. My daughter-in-law’s father, a good friend who had recently retired as the headmaster at a Montreal school, had been given two gifts. One was a trip to Scotland for golf, and he was invited to bring a companion. He invited his brother. The other retirement present came from one of the few Canadians who belong to Augusta National. He was invited to fly down to Augusta in a private plane, stay in a cabin on the club’s grounds, have dinner at the club, and play the next day. He was invited to bring a guest, and chose me.
Now this was something, much different than playing the course the day after the Masters. It was nearly a month after the tournament, and the course was about
