Since rolling the host Jets 30-9 on Oct. 28, the Dolphins offense has sputtered and spat — a big reason Miami goes into Sunday’s game at San Francisco losers in four of its past five games.The Dolphins have hit the 20-point mark twice since the Jets win, with Miami’s only victory in that span coming when it put up 24 against the Seahawks two weeks ago.Miami was held to a field goal in an embarrassing loss to the visiting Titans on Nov. 11 and scored 16 points in last weekend’s loss to New England. In a 19-14 loss at Buffalo, Miami’s offense accounted for just one fourth-quarter touchdown. “That’s a big focus of ours is to find a way to get more points on the board whatever way it is,’’ quarterback Ryan Tannehill said.“We have to find a way. I think our run game has been picking up the past few weeks, and we’re excited about that now. I have to do a good job in the pass game, get the pass going early on in games and be consistent throughout games.’’Playing timeCoach Joe Philbin said Thursday that he wasn’t in favor of getting players on the field solely for experience reasons. With a loss Sunday, Miami would drop to 5-8 and its already slim playoff hopes would be gone.Players who might be expected to see more playing time in such a scenario would be rookies Lamar Miller (27 carries in nine games) and tight end Michael Agnew (yet to be active this season).“Playing time has to be earned,’’ Philbin said. “They earn it with what they do on the practice field. If players earn it, we will most certainly play them whatever year they are. It doesn’t matter to us. ... Guys have to earn their keep. Some guys bust their tail every day.“It’s not fair to put someone into a game who doesn’t deserve it. ’’Said offensive coordinator Mike Sherman: "I’m just thinking about winning this game and that’s as far as I can go with that.’’The Dolphins will premier the movie More than Perfect. One Team, One Town. The Impact of the 1972 Miami Dolphins to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 17-0 champions at 5 p.m. on Dec. 15 at the Gusman Center in downtown Miami.According to the Dolphins, the majority of the 1972 team will be in attendance.“This documentary is not a highlight film,” Dolphins CEO Mike Dee said in a release.“While the story will tell what this team accomplished on the field ... it will also serve to tell the story of what this team meant to the city and the impact on modern-day Miami 40 years later.”Tickets can be purchased at dolphins.com/movie for $20; sales benefit the Miami Dolphins Foundation.
