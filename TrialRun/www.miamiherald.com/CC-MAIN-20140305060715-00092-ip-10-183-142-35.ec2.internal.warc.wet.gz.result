Posted on Sun, Jul. 01, 2012	Family in Marlins stadium tragedy identified; Jumbo's driver charged with DUI manslaughter
BY MEREDITH RUTLAND AND STEVEN MONTEROmrutland@MiamiHerald.comIn a tragic prelude to a holiday week, crashes by out-of-control vehicles have taken seven lives  including three members of a single family and two church leaders  in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.
