Insiders profit, travelers suffer - 10/17/1999 | MiamiHerald.com
Posted on Sun, Oct. 17, 1999	Insiders profit, travelers suffer
BY RONNIE GREENE, JOHN DORSCHNER AND JOSEPH TANFANIrgreene@MiamiHerald.comMiami's tourism industry is threatened by politicians who run the airport for the benefit of cronies - not millions of passengers. Miami International Airport, rated among America's worst for passengers, is being used by Miami-Dade politicians as a billion-dollar piggy bank to enrich their friends and campaign contributors. They manipulate rules so favored firms get airport deals. They delay for years other airport services, such as luggage carts, because companies haven't cut in the right people. They dictate everything from where rental car companies line up along the counter to how many firms will clean airport bathrooms. Miami-Dade Commissioner Pedro Reboredo once put it succinctly: "The main problem is us - politicians - involved in the process." A Miami Herald investigation proves that's true. From thousands of MIA files and hundreds of interviews emerges a portrait of an airport where political deal-making is more important than developing an inviting hub for travelers. The result: an airport that is threatening the region's economy and viability as a hemispheric commercial center. Key findings: Virtually all major deals at MIA go to companies that give political contributions and employ lobbyists who are key fund-raisers and advisors for county politicians. Outsiders, including American corporate giants such as Disney, can't get in. Major companies seeking work at MIA frequently are forced to give a piece of their deals to politicians' allies who have no experience in airport work. Example: Jorge de Cardenas, a lobbyist and campaign strategist with no background in retail sales, drew regular checks from his cut of the airport's duty-free deal - while serving time in prison for his role in a Miami bribery scheme. Minority hiring programs are sometimes exploited. In one case, a politically active multimillionaire with a waterfront home and a 54-foot yacht was slipped into a lucrative deal as a "disadvantaged businessman." Companies with the right connections get MIA's millions without ever going through a bid process. Firms offering long-distance phone cards and baggage wrap at the airport have operated for years on no-bid "test permits" - despite evidence they don't offer travelers the best deal. Travelers at MIA pay $6 to get a medium-size bag wrapped. In San Francisco, the charge is $3. Politicians shape contract specifications to help favorites. Some companies are given so many extra points for being locally based that outsiders who offer far better prices can't get MIA's business. In the case of a parking management contract, that meant a company partnering with a local businessman tied to several county commissioners got more points than a national company that offered a price 44 percent better. Reforms have done virtually nothing. A "cone of silence" that was supposed to reduce lobbyists' influence after projects are advertised has failed. Much of the lobbyists' efforts go into shaping contract specifications - an activity that happens before the cone of silence descends. In many cities, aviation experts run the airport. At MIA, politicians - encircled by a phalanx of lobbyists - micromanage an operation that rings up hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly sales. The result of their manipulations: an airport that is threatening the area's tourism industry, which creates 300,000 jobs, and the community's role as a hemispheric commercial center. MIA is becoming an expensive place for airlines, which help to finance the airport through landing fees and pass costs on to travelers. Many airlines and passengers are now flying into Fort Lauderdale because it's cheaper. Last year, for the first time, more domestic passengers started or ended their trips in Fort Lauderdale than in Miami. Many international passengers are also bypassing Miami if they can, with MIA's share of traffic to and from South and Central America dipping between 1993 and 1998. Those who stop in Miami often don't like what they see, surveys show. Retail concessions, the most politically connected deals at the airport, offer limited opportunities for eating and shopping. Several popular chains - common at airports elsewhere - haven't been able to get in because they lack political pull. Passengers rank MIA near the bottom of the nation's airports, according to a survey by Air Marketing Services. "It's a disgrace, " said President Ira Weinstein, whose company has surveyed passenger satisfaction at 150 airports for 15 years. THE LURE OF MONEY The airport's prominence and volume of business are temptations for public officials Why do politicians get so involved at the airport? One word: money. MIA has a $5.4 billion construction program. The Aviation Department shells out $500 million a year. Concessionaires pull in $300 million. "If this were a mill town, the airport would be the mill, " said Ric Katz, a political consultant. "It's the biggest employer, the biggest budget. It's just a huge cookie jar - just too tempting." The pressure of lobbyists and the amount of money in play lead to all sorts of dealing, said Rick Elder, Gary Dellapa's predecessor as airport director. Elder wrote to The Herald, but declined an interview request. Elder complained that he was told "to reevaluate a bid process that 'didn't come out right, ' to cater to certain special-interest groups and to hire relatives of the elected. "I refused on all counts, " he wrote, "and, of course, I brought the anger of my elected and appointed bosses upon my own head. . . . Special interest groups and lobbyists force contracts and contractors onto county department heads who know that they must treat them like they are special, because they, too, are - connected." At MIA, each example of political manuevering ends up costing travelers. Companies cover costs of hiring lobbyists and cutting in politically connected players by raising prices. "They have to boost their prices . . . by 30 or 40 percent in order to make a dime, " said ex-county commissioner Bruce Kaplan, who left office last year amid legal troubles unrelated to the airport. These additional costs will be passed on by airlines to passengers. In the next few years, MIA is likely to join JFK and Newark as the most expensive airports in the country for airlines. The more expensive it gets, the more tourists and discount airlines likely will go elsewhere - and the more the Miami-Dade economy will suffer. INSIDERS BENEFIT It's whom you know, not how much you know or contribute, that is often decisive. If passengers aren't winning at MIA, who is? Often, a small group of political insiders who reap millions in airport spoils without ever showing up for work, investing significant cash or bringing industry experience to the table. Developer Sergio Pino is one of the main fundraisers for Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and has contributed to at least 11 of the 13 commissioners. Last year, at Penelas' request, he hosted a $238,000 fundraiser for Commissioner Miriam Alonso. One of the largest builders in South Florida, Pino owns a waterfront home, a 54-foot yacht and has a net worth of at least $19 million. Yet in 1995 he was cut into the airport's duty-free shops, which pull in nearly $60 million a year, to meet airport rules requiring firms to hire minority partners. In the eyes of Miami-Dade County, Pino qualified as a "disadvantaged businessman." With his business interests now pulling in more than $32 million a year, Pino no longer qualifies as a minority entrepreneur but he's kept his place in the duty-free deal: the county decided he could stay in under a grandfather clause. Pino readily acknowledges his political ties, but said his team won because it offered the best return. His inclusion as a disadvantaged businessman? "I didn't make the rules, " he said. "I played by the law. .... To me, it was a business opportunity." Lobbyist Jorge de Cardenas, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of at least seven commissioners over two decades, was cut into the same deal for no other reason than to ensure votes at County Hall. "We are lobbyists. In consideration for that, I think we receive a percentage of their revenues, " the lobbyist's son, Luis, said in a sworn statement to the county explaining his father's 4 percent stake. De Cardenas' firm received $67,000 in duty-free fees over three years. He transferred ownership in the contract to his son after serving time in a Kentucky federal prison for his role in a Miami bribery scheme. Much of the time, the politically connected players are brought in using programs intended to boost struggling minority businesses. The Federal Aviation Administration requires that 10 percent of non-construction concessions be awarded to minorities, and Miami-Dade ordinances require that sometimes 20 or 30 percent of contracts be given to disadvantaged blacks, Hispanics and women. "These programs were meant to assist and develop minority businesses so they can compete in the marketplace without a set-aside program, " said Lenneal Henderson, a professor at the University of Baltimore who has worked with the U.S. Small Business Administration on minority business concerns. He decried any program when a minority gets "rented" to help a company win a contract. "Any program that doesn't provide a real opportunity, that's just favoritism." The intent of the programs has been perverted at MIA, where the politically connected sometimes do little more for their money than get votes for the project. The FBI is suspicious. Investigators recently tried to persuade an airport businessman to secretly record a shakedown attempt - one of many that agents believe may be going on at MIA. Ex-commissioner Kaplan: "Everybody is afraid of being called a racist, and so they don't raise objections, but so much business is done under minority empowerment, and it's often . . . pork barrel, rather than legitimate businesses. Amazingly, you see the same names over and over again - all politically connected, and surprisingly multi-talented."
