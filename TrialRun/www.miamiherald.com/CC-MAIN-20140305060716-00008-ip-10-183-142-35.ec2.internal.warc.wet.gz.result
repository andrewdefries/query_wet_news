As passenger numbers rise, Miami International Airport adds more venues, flights By Hannah Sampson The Miami Herald Buy Photo
Travelers hurry through Miami International Airport on April 4, 2012. PATRICK FARRELL / MIAMI HERALD FILE Photo

hsampson@MiamiHerald.com
Passenger traffic continues to climb at Miami International Airport, where the number of shops, restaurants and flights is also increasing.Miami International Airport said Monday that two new venues opened in October: a health supplement store and an Irish pub. GNC, which sells health products, opened Oct. 8 in the pre-security area of concourse G in the airport’s central terminal. And The Clover Irish Pub made its debut to customers on Oct. 15 near gate D-30.A new nonstop seasonal route on WestJet between Miami and Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, was scheduled to launch Monday night with the first flight arriving in Miami. The first departure from Miami is set for Tuesday morning, before which airport and airline officials are scheduled to hold a ceremony. The WestJet flights will be offered four times a week until Dec. 14. Starting Dec. 16, the frequency increases to six times a week. MIA said in a press release last week that is expecting the new Canadian route as well as new service from Mexico, Brazil and Italy to continue fueling growth. Through the end of September, the airport saw total passenger traffic increase year-over-year by 2.1 percent to 30.5 million. The number of international travelers increased by 4.4 percent to almost 15.2 million. Read more Business
