| License Photo	NEW YORK, July 17 (UPI) -- The unveiling of One Direction's Madame Tussauds wax figures will take place inside the museum due to the heat wave grilling New York, organizers said.The debut of the sculptures was to take place outside the popular Manhattan tourist destination Thursday morning, but plans have been changed as the mercury rose past 90 degrees this week. "Madame Tussauds artists worked closely with the band members to create their spot-on doppelgangers. Casually seated on bleachers with space for company, the figures embody the band's signature smart-casual style with attire donated by the boys themselves," a news release said. "After the unveil in the heart of New York City, the figures will take up residence at Madame Tussauds New York from July 19 through Oct. 11 before voyaging abroad to Sydney."

| License Photo	The public release of photos and videos in the hunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspects was made possible in large part because we now live in a society where we are never long out of the field of view of a camera mounted somewhere or carried by someone.The outcome will no doubt bring another round in the debate on the pros and cons of the seemingly Orwellian scenario of a camera on every street corner and in every citizen's purse or pocket.In the bombing, it is just that scenario that allowed the FBI to release videos and photos of two men they had identified as suspects in the act that killed three people and injured dozens more.Surveillance videos came first, from businesses and institutions along the streets adjacent to the marathon finish line where the two explosive devices were planted and then detonated.The release of those videos sent scores of people scrambling to scan the photos they had snapped with innumerable smartphones and digital cameras. The result was even more, and clearer, pictures of the alleged suspects flooding into the FBI.Some will argue for the benefits of the technology that found them; others will worry about that technology's ability to find -- and see -- any or all of us, and what that means to our privacy,The concern is not a new one. Ben Franklin famously said, "Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."The debate has come into even sharper focus in recent months over the subject of camera-equipped drones as increasing numbers of federal, state and local governments are using or considering using them for surveillance.Ordinary citizens can even purchase small helicopter-like drones equipped with high-resolution cameras that can send video to a smartphone or tablet.The proliferation of cameras has led the American Civil Liberties Union to go on record with concerns about the impact on the privacy of American citizens.In Britain, which has led the way in the use of surveillance cameras -- a reported 1.85 million closed circuit TV cameras are in streets, malls, hospitals and schools -- the debate over their use and presence has been constant and very public."The technology has overtaken our ability to regulate it," Andrew Rennison, Britain's first-ever surveillance commissioner, said in an interview with a British newspaper. "It is the Big Brother scenario playing out large. It's the ability to pick out your face in a crowd from a camera which is probably half a mile away."While few will take issue with the use of pervasive surveillance technology in solving a terror attack on American soil, when the terror case is resolved and its perpetrators brought to justice the cameras will still be there, silently watching and recording the activities of ordinary Americans as they go about their increasingly less-private business.

| License Photo	HERNDON, Va., Feb. 4 (UPI) -- As members of the U.S. Senate indicate they favor legislation imposing stricter sanctions on Iran should it violate a nuclear accord -- the complete details of which U.S. President Barack Obama has yet to release -- and, as he threatens to veto any such legislation Congress may pass, we learn Tehran now needs only a few months to attain an objective Obama assured us it never would.Obama used his State of the Union address to defend the secret agreement -- one he vowed to enforce regardless of bipartisan actions in Congress to the contrary.Shockingly, after 12 years of Iranian deceit on the nuclear issue, Obama suggested, "For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed."Obama either lacks confidence in the American people and their legislators to understand the nuclear deal's intimate details or has some unknown motivation for making an agreement with Iranian leaders who have done everything to lie, cheat and steal their way into becoming a nuclear armed power.Obama seems to suggest we are unappreciative and simply accept the Nancy Pelosi approach to this deal. In 2010, while Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized people for not appreciating Obamacare; but, when pressed for details, she only offered, "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy."We struggle today from Obamacare fallout; we can ill afford to await the fallout of Iran's nuclear program.In conducting his foreign policy, Obama has been more honest with the United States' adversaries than with the American people.This was evidenced in March 2012 when meeting in Seoul with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Obama was running for re-election; Medvedev would soon be stepping down to allow Vladimir Putin to become president.The two issued a joint statement, reporting discussions on the sensitive issue of a European missile defense would continue later. The reason became clear from an open microphone comment Obama made to Medvedev.Obama promised, "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense ... this can be solved but it's important for him (Putin) to give me space ...This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility."The underlying message Obama was, what Obama was willing to do vis-a-vis the European missile defense wouldn't endear him to U.S. voters and could hurt his re-election campaign. Therefore, he would delay any further discussions until after he won.Obama used this same approach, deceiving American voters on missile defense, as the Iranians regularly use to deceive him about their nuclear intentions. The Iranian term for it is taqqiya, which sanctions lying to opponents to advance one's position.Members of Congress and experts on Iran's nuclear program slam Obama's secrecy on the deal's terms. And those who have read it see little about which to get enthusiastic.House Committee on Foreign Affairs member Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., criticizes Obama for his "cone of silence" and keeping the agreement at "a super-secret location."Ros-Lehtinen suggests: "If this is such a great deal and so good for peace and diplomacy in our time why is it held in secret? If the administration is proud of it ... they should highlight it."Having read the agreement, she describes it as "quite eye opening ... It's a very easy to read document; one doesn't have to be as expert."She urges fellow HFAC members to review it as well.What has been shared about it tells us, despite last year's assurances by the Obama administration such an agreement with Iran wouldn't allow retention of its ability to build a bomb, it does.Further, Ros-Lehtinen reports, "There is no mechanism that allows for adjudication of violations in this deal and that is very troublesome."Nuclear expert Gregory Jones is bothered too by the administration's secrecy, suggesting "It appears to me the administration has negotiated an agreement it does not fully understand..."He cannot see how it prevents Iran from building a nuclear weapon.Jones also criticizes Obama for engaging in "mischaracterization of the deal's benefits and the denial of the deal's great flaw." The flaw is Iran can build one nuclear weapon within two months and as many as four within the next five-month period.Jones adds although: "President Obama has said that the deal has 'cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb,' this is not true. Before the current nuclear deal, Iran could produce the highly enriched uranium -- HEU -- for a nuclear weapon in just six weeks. Over the next six months, the joint plan of action will increase this interval only slightly to eight weeks."Further underscoring Obama's lack of comprehension of the deal, Jones says, "Iran's stockpile of this material (enriched uranium) will continue to grow during the course of this nuclear deal, though several White House statements, as well as Secretary (of State John) Kerry, have incorrectly claimed otherwise."The agreement has received bilateral criticism. Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., described it as a "terrible mistake ... naïve ... wrongheaded."In a rare moment of honesty by Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CNN the deal description given by Obama in his address was meant for "domestic consumption" as it didn't accurately represent its terms.Either Obama failed to heed technical experts on the deal or is motivated for unknown reasons to place the United States at risk.In either case, Obama's comment the deal is "for the sake of our national security" isn't true. We cannot follow the Pelosi School of Foreign Policy approach to determine what we have negotiated -- for doing so will leave us looking down an Iranian nuclear gun barrel.--(A retired U.S. Marine, Lt. Col. James Zumwalt served in the Vietnam War, the U.S. invasion of Panama and the first Gulf War. He has written "Bare Feet, Iron Will -- Stories from the Other Side of Vietnam's Battlefields," "Living the Juche Lie: North Korea's Kim Dynasty" and "Doomsday: Iran -- The Clock is Ticking.")--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

PRINCETON, N.J., May 21 (UPI) -- Healthcare, the federal budget deficit and unemployment are the three key economic issues facing the United States today, a Gallup-USA Today poll indicated.More than 80 percent of Americans ranked each issue as either extremely important or very important among 10 issues surveyed, results of a Gallup-USA Today poll released Monday indicated. Americans prefer President Obama over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for handling healthcare, Romney is favored to handle the deficit and the two tied on unemployment.At least seven in 10 Americans rated weak economic growth, higher education costs, financial performance of savings or retirement investments and housing- and mortgage-related issues as extremely or very important, results indicated.Romney led Obama in handling weak economic growth and financial performance of personal investments. Obama had the advantage on college cost issues. The two were roughly tied on handling home values and financing issues.Obama did well in perceptions of who could better handle the concentration of wealth in the country, but only a slight majority of Americans said they consider the matter a highly important economic issue.Obama and Romney were close in perception on who would better handle government regulations on private enterprise, but barely half of Americans said they thought the issue was highly important.Obama held an advantage over Romney in perceptions of who would better address living standards for the poorest people, but the matter was a somewhat lower priority for Americans, the Princeton, N.J., polling agency said.Results are based on nationwide telephone interviews with 1,012 adults conducted May 10-13. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.

| License Photo	MIAMI, March 29 (UPI) -- President Obama returned to economic issues Friday, urging Congress to pass tax incentive and spending proposals to lure investment in U.S. infrastructure.Standing under sunny skies at the Port of Miami Terminal, Obama said there was work to be done on the nation's infrastructure and workers ready to do it."Let's prove to the world there's no better place to do business than right here in the United States of America and let's get started rebuilding America," he told the crowd after he toured a joint public-private construction project building a tunnel beneath the channel to link the port to major highways.Obama also recalled his State of the Union call to rebuild the nation's infrastructure so America is more attractive for businesses.Obama's "Rebuild America Partnership" will bring together new and existing policies aimed at "enhancing the role of private capital in U.S. infrastructure investment as a vital additive to the traditional roles of federal, state and local governments, making American workers and businesses more competitive and putting more Americans back on the job," the White House said in a fact sheet.Obama called on Congress to enact a National Infrastructure Bank, based on a model that had bipartisan support in the Senate in the past, funded with $10 billion that would leverage private and public capital and invest in infrastructure projects that would be awarded "not pork-barrel politics" but on based on "how much good they'll actually do for the economy [and] how much the projects make sense."He also spoke of his new "America Fast Forward Bonds" program expands the Build America Bonds program to include projects that can be financed with qualified private activity bonds while also making the combined program more flexible.The third is to build on the success on of two grant programs that were part of the Recovery Act by proposing $4 million in new funding for both programs.The cost for the three programs would be about $21 billion, the White House said.Obama's chief economist, Alan Krueger, said the three programs would have a substantial effect on the economy because "they will be leveraged 2-to-1, 3-to-1, 4-to-1, up to 7-to-1, depending upon the particular program. And ... they will not increase the deficit by a dime because they are paid for in our budget."Building better roads, bridges and schools "should not be a partisan idea," Obama said, noting that the Chamber of Commerce and unions agree that it should be done.The White House said the Miami port tunnel project has created work for 500 employees and more than 6,000 contractors and subcontractors."We can do this not just here," Obama said, "we can do this all across the country."Before Obama's visit to Miami, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican said the president should reimburse Florida for its port projects."We're certainly glad President Obama is coming to the Port of Miami ... but he's late to the party," Scott, who is running for re-election, told reporters in a conference call Thursday."We could not wait for the federal government to come to the table with their share of the project," Scott said Thursday, demanding Obama "step up to the plate" and promise to reimburse Washington's share of the funding.In the past three years, Florida taxpayers invested $425 million in seaport-related upgrades, Scott said. This includes $77 million two years ago to fund the port's $180 million "deep dredge" project, deepening the port to 50 from 42 feet, which will let Miami handle bigger cargo ships and is projected to create more than 30,000 new jobs, he said.The White House responded to Scott, saying it funded a $340 million loan to help finance the port tunnel project and a $23 million grant to restore freight rail service between the port and the Florida East Coast Railway, which provides intermodal shipping-container transportation.

Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Following Melissa King's resignation as Miss Teen USA amidst claims she appeared in a sex video, the teen has been offered a contract from an adult entertainment website.In an open letter to King, YouPorn's marketing director Brandon Burns has offered the 18-year-old, $250,000 to be "Miss YouPorn" and tour the world promoting the site. He wrote: While you may have surrendered your tiara for Miss Teen USA, we'd like to keep that pretty head of yours topped with ours, and name you Miss Youporn! [...]We believe your incredible beauty and personality coupled with our internet trafﬁc is a "win win" for both of us.
We believe this story will only catapult your career and could really expose you to an entirely different audience. Many famous directors and producers frequent our site daily, we know this due to the emails we receive from them. I am sure through your travels with us as Miss Youporn, you will meet a lot of incredible people and see the world. We'd love to sit down with you and your representatives at your earliest convenience.Though King originally rose to notoriety Tuesday for her alleged performance in a sex tape, YouPorn's offer does not require her participation in any sex scenes, TMZ noted. King hasn't given an official response to the porn giant, but earlier today she re-tweeted a comment that likened her situation to Kim Kardashian's and how her journey to stardom also began with a leaked sex tape."Be strong, life has a funny way of working out. Kim K made it and now is one of the most powerful women in the US. #Support," read King's re-tweet. @melissa_m_king Be strong, life has a funny way of working out. Kim K made it and now is one of the most powerful women in the US. #Support— Adrian Nagelson (@Nagelson) February 28, 2013
