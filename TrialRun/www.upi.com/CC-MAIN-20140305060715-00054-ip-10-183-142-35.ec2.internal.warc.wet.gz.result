NEW DELHI, July 8 (UPI) -- The Indian rupee plunged to a record low of 61.19 to a U.S. dollar Monday on renewed concerns over U.S. monetary easing before making a small recovery.Foreign exchange experts had expected the rupee, already under severe pressure since May, to weaken further Monday because of concerns last week's optimistic job report and other positive economic news from the United States could result in the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering its stimulus program, thus ending the availability of cheap money.These concerns, along with India's own economic problems, have been largely responsible for the rupee slide lately as foreign investors sell more of their rupee holdings.On Friday, the rupee closed at 60.22.The Press Trust of India news agency, quoting foreign exchange dealers, said Monday's late recovery from the record low of 61.19 to about 61.04 against the dollar may have been due to some dollar selling by public-sector banks at the request of India's central bank.

NEW YORK, Aug. 27 (UPI) -- U.S. singer-actress Miley Cyrus is bragging about the attention she received through social media for her raunchy 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance. UsMagazine.com said the 20-year-old former "Hannah Montana" star set a record on Twitter after people offered their mixed reactions to the performance of her hit "We Can't Stop" and her "Blurred Lines" duet with Robin Thicke at Brooklyn's Barclays Center Sunday night.Cyrus was seen scantily clad, grinding against Thicke in a suggestive manner and making vulgar gestures with a foam finger throughout the performance."Smilers! My VMA performance had 306,000 tweets per minute," Cyrus tweeted Monday. "That's more than the blackout or Superbowl! #fact."

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Salaries paid professional baseball players in the minor leagues violate state and federal wage laws, former players charge in a lawsuit filed in California.The suit charges that although minor league players are paid only during the five-month playing season, they are contractually obligated to attend a number of spring training and other conditioning events without compensation, Courthouse News Service reported Tuesday.MLB, Commissioner Bud Selig, and the Kansas City Royals, Miami Marlins and San Francisco Giants are all named as defendants in the suit, which was filed by Aaron Senne, Michael Liberto and Oliver Odle.Senne played for the Marlins from 2010 to 2013, while Liberto was with the Royal's minor league team during those same years. Odle played with the Giants from 2007 to 2011.It claims amateur players are required to participate in the minor league draft and, once drafted, their contracts grant their teams exclusive rights to the player for seven years. During that term, players cannot voluntarily leave to play for another team, even outside the United States, and cannot renegotiate their salaries.Depending on which division players are in, they are paid between $1,100 and $2,150 a month.The players only receive their salary during the season, but are contractually obligated "to perform professional services on a calendar year basis," the suit alleges."Given that MLB carefully controls the entryway into the highest levels of baseball, and given the young minor leaguer's strong desire to enter the industry," the suit charges, "MLB and the defendants have exploited minor leaguers by paying salaries below minimum wage, by not paying overtime wages and by often paying no wages at all."The suit seeks class-action status, as well as damages for wage and overtime violations.

CANBERRA, Australia, May 13 (UPI) -- An Iranian-born Australian citizen has been charged with 89 counts of people smuggling concerning the fatal shipwreck at Christmas Island in December.Ali Khorram Heydarkhani, 40, was deported from Indonesia and arrested upon arrival at Sydney. He later appeared in a Sydney court to have the charges read out and was denied bail.The trial will take place in Perth, Australia, next month.The trial will be high profile because of the tragic nature of the shipwreck that involved an unseaworthy vessel with nearly 100 asylum seekers being smashed against a rocky coastline in rough seas.Would-be rescuers watched on shore as people, including women and children, yelled for help and attempted to swim to shore. Many of the asylum seekers' attempts to save themselves were televised live.Up to 50 asylum seekers drowned, including at least one baby. Coast guard vessels rescued 42 survivors, mostly Iranian, Iraqi and Kurdish asylum seekers, and recovered 30 bodies from the sea. But up to 20 people remain unaccounted for.Indonesian police arrested Heydarkhani in January and deported him this week after his visa expired, Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor said."Those people who seek to lure, in some cases people who are desperate, into unseaworthy vessels where people's lives are at risk, where people perish, will be punished," O'Connor said.Like many asylum seekers, the shipwreck passengers were on their way to Australia by way of Indonesia, after paying notorious people smugglers thousands of dollars for passage on the overcrowded boat.O'Connor said it was "the right decision" to conclude a refugee swap agreement with Malaysia in an attempt to thwart the people smugglers. ''We do not want to see any more tragedies. We do not want to see men, women and children perish at sea,'' O'Connor said.Over the next four years, Australia will send around 800 boat people to Malaysia as soon as they arrive in Australian waters and are picked up by Australia's coast guard and navy.For every person transferred to Malaysia, Australia will take five refugees from Malaysia on condition that they haven't been boat people. This means an additional 4,000 refugees arriving in Australia, the government estimated.The deal is part of a "regional cooperation framework" that Canberra said is aimed at putting out of business notorious people smugglers operating across Asia, as well as stemming the tide of boat people heading for Australia.Australia's Department of Immigration said 134 boats carrying 6,535 people arrived last year. So far this year, 16 boats carrying around 920 people have been intercepted by Australian authorities.A big issue for successive Australian governments is ensuring enough detention centers to house them while their asylum status is investigated.The detention center on Christmas Island -- around 1,600 miles from Australia's west coast but less than 200 miles from Indonesia -- is at its capacity of around 1,700 people.Australia also is in discussions with Papua New Guinea about reopening a former detention center on PNG's remote Manus Island.

| License Photo	BOSTON, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- An adviser to presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Romney's campaign staff was optimistic of winning until voting results began coming in."We went into the evening confident we had a good path to victory. I don't think there was one person who saw this coming," the unnamed senior adviser said.After polls closed in Pennsylvania and Ohio and were won by President Barack Obama, and North Carolina and Florida were seen as unexpectedly tightly contested, "We just felt, 'Where's our path?' There wasn't one," a senior adviser told CBS News.An aide said Romney was stoic as he spoke by telephone with Obama after the election was decided, but Romney's wife Ann cried.Vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan seemed genuinely shocked, and his wife Janna cried, the aide said.After Romney delivered his hastily-written concession speech, "He was shellshocked," one adviser said.A few hours after Romney conceded to President Obama, Romney told his staff they had just witnessed his last political campaign, The New York Times reported.However, two people in that meeting in Boston said Romney said, "I will not fall off the map."Friends, aides and advisers have speculated Romney could write a book, return to the financial sector or could take on a major role in the Mormon Church"The only door that is closed to Mitt Romney for the remainder of his life is being president of the United States," said Steve Schmidt, a campaign adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his unsuccessful 2008 bid to be the president. "He can do whatever else he wants to do." Losing a presidential campaign, however, "is something you never get over," Schmidt said. "The question is whether you can move forward without bitterness or rancor." At a breakfast for top advisers and donors Wednesday, Romney spoke of how Obama campaign turned out such huge numbers of voters, and expressed frustration about opposition attempts to characterize him as an enemy of women, which Romney said was simply untrue, those attending the event told the Times. "He will be sifting through this for quite a while," said Kirk Jowers, a friend of the former Massachusetts governor. "The question is whether the sifting takes a couple of hours a day instead of being all consuming."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says writings under his name will be treated like academic papers "if it will make people leave me the hell alone" about plagiarism.Paul's comment Tuesday at his Senate office in Washington came as BuzzFeed reported yet another instance of plagiarism involving his 2012 book, "Government Bullies."The website said part of the book appeared to be lifted from an article previously published in Forbes. BuzzFeed had said the book contained just one plagiarized passage, three pages worth of content listed from The Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute.Bill Singer, who wrote the Forbes article, told BuzzFeed his work on the article made extensive use of a U.S. Justice Department news release."It would appear whoever wrote the senator's book copied my language not the press release," Singer said.Center Street, which published "Government Bullies," said future printings of the book will attribute the plagiarized material properly, BuzzFeed reported.The website said a speech on Paul's website has been revised, with footnotes added.BuzzFeed said Monday some transcripts of Paul's speeches have been taken down at his website.Paul said Tuesday he was being treated unfairly, The New York Times reported.He said he doesn't know what effect the revelations might have on a campaign if he decides to enter the 2016 presidential race, newspaper said."What we are going to do from here forward, if it will make people leave me the hell alone, is we're going to do them like college papers," he said. "We're going to try to put out footnotes. We're going to have them available."Senior Paul adviser Doug Stafford pledged there would be a new review process and that footnotes to his speeches would be available upon request, Politico reported."In the thousands of speeches and op-eds Senator Paul has produced, he has always presented his own ideas, opinions and conclusions. Senator Paul also relies on a large number of staff and advisers to provide supporting facts and anecdotes -- some of which were not clearly sourced or vetted properly," Stafford said in a statement Tuesday. "Footnotes presenting supporting facts were not always used."Under the changes, Stafford said, "footnotes will be available on request.""There have also been occasions where quotations or typesetting indentations have been left out through errors in our approval process. From here forward, quoting, footnoting and citing will be more complete," Stafford said. "Adherence to a new approval process implemented by Senator Paul will ensure proper citation and accountability in all collaborative works going forward."BuzzFeed said a commentary Paul wrote in September for The Washington Post on mandatory prison sentences was quite similar to a piece written by a senior editor of The Week and published a week earlier.Media outlets such as Politico, MSNBC and BuzzFeed have reported a number of Paul's works -- including speeches, his book and congressional testimony -- contain sections that appeared to be lifted from other sources.Paul rejected the accusations on his speeches as attacks by the "footnote police" and "hacks and haters," saying spoken words don't allow for footnotes as an academic paper would, Politico reported.

| License Photo	TEHRAN, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- A man said to be a nuclear scientist working at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant was killed Wednesday in a car bomb attack officials blamed on Israel.The death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan was similar to killings of other Iranian nuclear scientists the Iranian government blamed on Israel and the United States -- and both countries denied -- The Daily Telegraph reported Wednesday.Obama administration deputy press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters any suggestion the United States, which is at odds with Iran over its nuclear aspirations, was somehow involved in the attack is "categorically not true.""The United States condemns this kind of violence," he said. "... This is exactly the kind of violence that we unequivocally condemn."A person who was in the car with Roshan when the bomb detonated died later of injuries he sustained in the explosion, the Tehran Times said.Officials said a motorcycle rider attached a magnetic bomb to the vehicle carrying Roshan and the other person.The Web site of Sharif University in Tehran, where Roshan, 32, a chemistry expert, graduated, said the scientist "has been working as the deputy in charge of commerce at the Natanz site.""The responsibility of this explosion falls on the Zionist regime," Tehran province Gov. Safar Ali Bratloo told Iran's Arabic-language al-Alam broadcaster. "The method of this terrorist action is similar to previous actions that targeted Iran's nuclear scientists."There was no immediate response from Israeli officials, the Telegraph said.The blast occurred outside the campus of Allameh Tabatai University, where the report said Roshan was a lecturer, reports from Iran indicated.Western nations charge Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons capability and have stepped up sanctions to try to halt its progress.

When Ellen DeGeneres confronted singer Christina Aguilera about being 'checked out' by secretary of state Hillary Clinton during a dinner party last October, the singer said the attraction had been mutual.DeGeneres was referring to the photo, in which Clinton, was captured by the cameras taking an accidental (or not so much) peek at Aguilera's chest during a ceremony where the singer was being honored for her work as a UN World Food Programme Ambassador.CREDIT: The Ellen ShowAfter congratulating the star of 'The Voice' for being honored, DeGeneres moved on to the really important questions, "Let's talk about this picture of Hilary Clinton checking you out" she said."It kinda looks like it was Photoshoped. But it's not. It was a real moment," the singer replied. A response that practically begged DeGeneres' next question, "but could you feel her gazing down on your breasteses?""She's such a force in a room. She's got that star charisma and everything about her. I couldn't take my eyes off her, either, so it was mutual," Aguilera said. "Is that bad? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have said that! I'm so inappropriate". Aguilera who's been scrutinized about her body since 'Genie in a Bottle' came out in 1999, and to answer DeGeneres questions regarding a possible lack of budget for clothes, made use of the all-eyes-on-her opportunity to address the appearance of her curvaceous naked body on the cover of her new album 'Lotus.'"I like to be free. Sometimes the less clothing the better. I'm just comfortable in my skin and my body," the songstress said.

Wiki
Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (Persian: علی اکبر هاشمی رفسنجانی Ali Akbar Hāshemī Rafsanjānī, Hashemi Bahramani (هاشمی بهرمانی); born February 15, 1934) is an influential Iranian politician, writer and former president. Currently he holds the position of Chairman of the Assembly of Experts (a deliberative body of Mujtahids that is charged with electing, monitoring, and dismissing the Supreme Leader of Iran) and Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran (an unelected administrative assembly that resolves legislative conflicts between the Majlis (Parliament) and the Council of Guardians).
Rafsanjani served as President of Iran from 1989 to 1997. In 2005 he ran for a third term in office, placing first in the first round of elections but ultimately losing to rival Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the run-off round of the 2005 election. He was also elected as the Chairman of Iranian parliament in 1980 and served till 1989. In 1980, Rafsanjani survived an assassination attempt, during which he was seriously injured.
Rafsanjani has been described as a centrist and a "pragmatic conservative". He supports a free market position domestically, favoring privatization of state-owned industries, and a moderate position internationally, seeking to avoid conflict with the United States and the West.
