| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UPI) -- Consumer Reports named Tesla's Model S as its top pick in the 'Best Overall Car' category, in its annual Auto Issue, which rates the best and safest cars.The Tesla beat out competitors like the Audi A6, Toyota Prius and BMW 328i in the ratings conducted by the the independent product-testing magazine. The reviewers picked the Model S for its “blistering acceleration, razor-sharp handling, compliant ride and versatile cabin.”This is the first time a U.S. automaker has has won in the overall category, ending the domination of Japanese cars, which traditionally earned 70 percent of the magazine’s best-car spots since 1997, but only earned half that number this year.Analysts have said that if Tesla, the youngest of the major U.S. automakers, can reduce the costs of its batteries, it could double its chunk of the global car market to one percent. The California-based automaker has said that it will see a 56 percent increase in deliveries, about 35,000 cars, this year.“If Tesla can become the world’s low-cost producer in energy storage, we see significant optionality for Tesla to disrupt adjacent industries,” said Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst.The Toyota Prius continued its domination as the best “green car,” having won the accolade for the 11th consecutive year. Chrysler notched a surprise win with Ram 1500, which was selected at the best pickup truck. This is the first time Chrysler has had a win since the 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV.The Volkswagen Audi A6 was chosen as the best luxury sedan, while Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s 328i was named the top sports sedan.

BALTIMORE, Aug. 25 (UPI) -- Workers at a Baltimore hospital said a baby born after 33 hours of labor became the facility's first infant to be born during an earthquake.The Greater Baltimore Medical Center said the mother, identified only by her first name, Jennifer, 38, had been in labor for 33 hours and the baby's head appeared just as Tuesday afternoon's earthquake began, The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday.Jennifer's husband, Tom, 39, said he was confident in the building's ability to withstand an earthquake because it had been designed by his firm."I was certain the building was sound and everything would be OK," he said.Hospital spokesman Michael Schwartzberg said baby John was born at 8 pounds, 11 ounces."We've had babies in other storms that Mother Nature has brought us," Schwartzberg said. "As far as I know, this is the first baby born in an earthquake.""On the other hand, it was another normal day for labor and delivery. You never know what will come through those doors," he said.

The cockroach, common in Asia, is resilient in cold weather, and has never before been seen in the US.	By Ananth Baliga | Dec. 9, 2013 at 9:47 AM | Updated Dec. 10, 2013 at 8:40 AM | 0 comments

Dec. 9 (UPI) -- A species of cockroach called Periplaneta japonica, usually found in Asia, has been identified in Manhattan, New York.The roach has been documented in Asia, but has never seen before in the U.S.Unlike other roaches, which prefer to stay indoors and like warmer temperatures, the Periplaneta japonica has been found to withstand harsh winters including snow.But Rutgers University insect biologists Jessica Ware and Dominic Evangelista, whose findings were published in the Journal of Economic Entomology, said there is probably little cause for concern for New Yorkers.“Because this species is very similar to cockroach species that already exist in the urban environment,” said Evangelista, “they likely will compete with each other for space and for food.”This intense competition would divert the roaches' focus from reproduction toward competing for space and food, thereby keeping their numbers low and in check. Additionally, interbreeding would be impossible, as the species' genitalia do not match.The species was first sighted by an exterminator on the High Line, an elevated walkway and park on Manhattan's West Side. The roach looked different from what he was used to seeing so he sent it to the University of Florida's Lyle Buss, who then proceeded to contact the Smithsonian who got her in touch with Ware.While it is not clear how the cockroach arrived in the U.S. Ware said it was likely that one of the ornamental plants that adorn the High Line could shave housed the roach. She also said that the chances of interbreeding and the creation of a hybrid breed is impossible as the male and female genitalia do not match.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (UPI) -- Most Americans support the death penalty for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev if he is convicted, a Washington Post-ABC News poll indicated.Seventy percent of those surveyed said they supported the death penalty for the 19-year-old, the poll, released Wednesday, said.Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death. He is accused, along with his older brother, Tamerlan, of setting off two bombs at the Boston Marathon April 15, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The support for capital punishment crosses party lines with most people of both the Democratic and Republican parties agreeing at least somewhat.The bigger divide is racial, with 75 percent of white people said they supported the death penalty, compared to 62 percent of Hispanic people and 52 percent of African-American respondents, the poll said.The racial division is reflected in the overall support in the death penalty itself, The Washington Post said. A recent Washington Post Maryland poll indicated 63 percent of white respondents and 37 percent of African-Americans asked said they support the death penalty for people convicted of murder.A random sample of 1,000 adult Americans was surveyed for The Washington Post-ABC News poll from April 24-28. There is a 3.5 percentage point margin of error for the results.

| License Photo	JERUSALEM, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- A heavy snowfall in Israel cut off the entrance to Jerusalem Thursday as a winter storm battered the Middle East for the fourth day in a row, forecasters said.At least four deaths in Lebanon and two in the West Bank have been blamed on the weather that has caused widespread power outages, property damage and heavy flooding, The (Beirut) Daily Star reported.Weather forecasters predicted the storm would die down by midday Thursday, but not before dumping more snow, flooding rivers. High winds caused temperatures to plummet.In Jerusalem, heavy snow caused city officials to halt public transportation and request residents stay at home, the Haaretz live blog reported.In Egypt, several buildings collapsed, crops have been ruined and only 6,101 of Cairo's 14,136 drains are properly working due to the storm, the Egypt Independent reported.Meanwhile, 39 flights in and out of Istanbul were canceled due to snowfall, the semi-official Turkish news Anadolu Agency reported.Temperatures are approximately 9 to 18 degrees below normal for this time of year in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, CNN said. Temperatures should rebound toward the end of the week, though cold air currents from Europe are predicted to cause more cold snaps this winter, the Muslim Brotherhood newspaper Freedom and Justice reported.

May 1 (UPI) -- Photos of Rihanna kissing a male fan on the cheek surfaced on Instagram this week and made the rounds on Twitter. The star had posted multiple photos of her with on-again-off-again boyfriend Chris Brown earlier this month, but after Brown's response, it may be off again.Justin LaBoy posted three photos of him with Rihanna in a New York nightclub -- one with the caption "Me & the wife @Badgalriri out here tonight."Brown has since unfollowed Rihanna on Twitter and tweeted his reactions. He posted, "[expletive] is overrated now a days." He followed it with, "Just remember to keep ya [expletive] head up."No word on whether the couple is officially apart. If they are, Brown's father will be happy.

He participated in four Space Shuttle flights between 1983 and 1992. In 1983, as a member of the crew of the space shuttle Challenger on mission STS-8, Bluford became the first African American in space, and the second person of African ancestry, after the Cuban cosmonaut Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez.
Bluford was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Guion (a mechanical engineer) and Lolita (a special education teacher), and graduated from Overbrook High School. He received a B.S. in aerospace engineering from the Pennsylvania State University in 1964, an M.S. in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 1974, a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering with a minor in laser physics, again from AFIT, in 1978, and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Houston–Clear Lake in 1987. He married Linda Tull in 1964 and had two sons,Guion III and James.
Bluford attended pilot training at Williams Air Force Base, and received his pilot wings in January 1966. He then went to F-4C combat crew training in Arizona and Florida and was assigned to the 557th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. He flew 144 combat missions, 65 of which were over North Vietnam.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
