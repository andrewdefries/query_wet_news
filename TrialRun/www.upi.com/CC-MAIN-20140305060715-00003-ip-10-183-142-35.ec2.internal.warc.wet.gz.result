As foreseen, the U.S. housing market is turning itself around in what might be called an organic economic recovery.The Obama administration has done its best to bully the market into compliance, kneading it here and prodding it there, but the market, in the end, had to recover on its own. The largest influence in the recent upswing in home prices and the gains in homeowner equity that go along with what have been mostly the product of tight supply in the market -- as opposed to, say, dragging the nation's banks through an opportunistic legal imbroglio, as the Justice Department did in response to the 2010 foreclosure debacle.That isn't to say the banks didn't deserve a slap on the wrists -- a hard one. It is merely to point out that the banks, in response to the judicial inquiries, pulled back on their foreclosure plans, which slowed the recovery. Maybe it needed to be slowed on moral grounds -- but the recovery slowed down, nonetheless.In a recent CNNMoney survey of economists, more than 50 percent of respondents indicated they believe the housing market would drive the economic recovery in 2013. Of the remaining respondents, an equal number pointed to consumer spending, cheap energy and assistance from the Federal Reserve as the primary contributors to an economic comeback.The data on housing is certainly strong. Housing construction starts are up and projected to rise 28 percent more in 2013. Supply is tight, as a bulk of the ground-to-a-halt foreclosures have finally worked their way through the system. Of course, the Fed has helped. Interest rates on mortgages are rising, but they are still close to historic lows. The Fed has said it will not touch its key interest rate until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent, which allows banks plenty of warning time, given the unemployment rate is currently 7.8 percent and millions of discouraged workers will likely return to the workforce as the unemployment rate drops, which will keep the figure elevated for at least one more year. Inflation hawks will soon start pounding on podiums and putting pen to paper, writing terse editorials -- writers should be concise when complaining about inflation or they could be guilty of rhetorical inflation. But the Fed would be wise to stay the course, given the lower unemployment rate is an economic false summit at this point. Economists should also point to increased exports as a solid contributor to gains in the gross domestic product, and much of that is tied to an upswing in energy production. Increased home equity means revolving loans will perk up in 2013. That also means increased consumer spending.Economists should also be looking for lessons learned since 2007. How far will the savings rate drop, indicating consumers are getting ahead of themselves again? And how much will a recovery weaken arguments for vigilance? In international markets Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan rose 0.39 percent while the Shanghai composite index in China added 0.53 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was flat, sliding 0.07 percent, while the Sensex in India gave up 0.56 percent.The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia rose 1.11 percent.In midday trading in Europe, the FTSE 100 index in Britain climbed 0.16 percent while the DAX 30 in Germany dropped 0.12 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.22 percent while the Stoxx Europe 600 was off 0.01 percent.

LOS ANGELES, April 13 (UPI) -- Screenwriter Stuart Beattie ("Collateral") will write a period epic set in his native Australia for director Baz Luhrmann.The Hollywood Reporter described the project as a romance along the lines of "Gone With the Wind," but said details are being kept under wraps. The project seems to be part of a trio of epic films Luhrmann has talked about making -- including a film about the life of Alexander the Great and a Russian epic.The Reporter said Luhrmann had been developing "Alexander" for Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman, but apparently has put the project on the shelf.Luhrmann has called his three movie musicals -- "Strictly Ballroom" (1992), "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" (1996) and "Moulin Rouge" (2001) his Red Curtain trilogy.Beattie's screenwriting credits also include "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" and the upcoming Clive Owen-Jennifer Aniston drama "Derailed."

FORT PIERCE, Fla., Jan. 25 (UPI) -- A necropsy has been performed on a humpback whale that died in a Florida inlet, but results won't be known for weeks, marine conservation officials said.The 28-foot juvenile whale beached in the shallows at Fort Pierce Inlet State Park Monday, TCPalm.com reported.Construction equipment was used to pull the dead animal from the inlet onto a beach where officials examined it."Something must have been wrong for it to come to shore," Blair Mase, a federal marine mammal stranding coordinator, said. "It was thin and in poor body condition."Scientists conducted the necropsy outside, a normal procedure given the mammal's size of 5,000 to 6,000 pounds, research biologist Megan Stolen said.The whale was "emaciated" and should have weighed double that amount, Stolen, with Hubbs Sea World Research Institute, a non-profit arm of Sea World, said."It was definitely a very sick whale," she said. "Its stomach was virtually empty."In Florida, humpback whales that die usually are juveniles, conservationists said."It is not common to have a fresh specimen," Mase said. "We should be able to learn a lot from it."

| License Photo	CLEVELAND, Dec. 14 (UPI) -- Cleveland Browns quarterback Colt McCoy wasn't tested for a concussion after a hit to the head because medics didn't see it, a team official said Wednesday.Browns President Paul Holmgren told reporters team medical staffers had their attention trained elsewhere when McCoy took a helmet-to-helmet hit from Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison in a Dec. 8 game.Harrison, a repeat offender for delivering dangerous hits, was suspended for one game by the NFL.Holmgren said by the time medics reached McCoy, he was lucid and not exhibiting any signs of a concussion, so no sideline tests were administered, The New York Times reported.The quarterback later re-entered the game, which the Browns lost 14-3.His father, Brad McCoy, Tuesday criticized the team for putting him back into the game even though he had knocked unconscious. Holmgren and head Coach Pat Shurmur have said Colt McCoy didn't show any concussion symptoms until after the contest.The quarterback was diagnosed with a concussion the day after the game.No one who saw a video replay of the hit immediately told medical personnel of its severity, he said."It seems inconceivable, but nobody alerted anyone," Holmgren said.

PARIS, Aug. 26 (UPI) -- Not since Mikhail Gorbachev began speaking of "Glasnost" and "Perestroika" in what turned out to be the twilight years of the Soviet Union has there been such ferment among policy intellectuals.In Washington and Berlin, Tokyo and Paris, Seoul and New Delhi, policymakers and their advisers are arguing about what's really going on in China.The source of the latest debate is known simply as Document No. 9, an internal Communist Party memorandum issued in April that seems to foreshadow a new kind of Cold War against the subversive menace, presented by Western ideas and "Western constitutional democracy," to Beijing's rule."Western forces hostile to China and dissidents within the country are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere," it says, a translation by The New York Times states.The concern this has provoked among Western policymakers is echoed separately by the intense debate over China's economic prospects that is raging among Western economists and financial analysts.The clear signs of a Chinese economic slowdown, combined with growing alarm over the stability of the Chinese financial sector, have shaken the conventional wisdom of recent years that China was on a steady course to overtake the United States and become the world's leading economy.At the same time, Western military analysts have been sounding warnings for several years that China's decade of double-digit growth in defense spending is shifting the balance of power in Asia.New tensions with Japan over disputed islands and with other neighbors over offshore oil rights have cast a controversial shadow of Beijing's traditional claim that it was committed to a "peaceful rise" to wealth and prosperity.The result has been a growing uncertainty in Western capitals over the state of play in China. Its foreign policy, its military (and space) ambitions, its uncertain economic prospects and now its new political hard line have combined to sound notes of alarm that the Beijing leadership isn't prepared to be "a responsible stakeholder" in the global political economy, as former World Bank President Robert Zoellick once put it. Some even see a new Cold War in the offing."It's already becoming a new kind of cold war," suggested Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer last year. "What this means is that the Americans and the Chinese will be frenemies. They're not going to become enemies, because that's not possible, but they're not friends any more, either."All of America's allies are very much afraid of China's rise, so they're begging the U.S. to play a more significant role in Asia."Bremmer spoke before the concerns aroused by Document No. 9, which suggests a striking sense of defensiveness and disquiet among China's ruling elite about their grip on power. It hasn't been officially published outside the party. But echoes of this new ideological hard line against Western ideas have been erupting in local party newspapers and official websites and publications."Constitutionalism belongs only to capitalism," said one commentary in People's Daily, an official publication. Constitutionalism "is a weapon for information and psychological warfare used by the magnates of American monopoly capitalism and their proxies in China to subvert China's socialist system," said another commentary in the same newspaper.Document No. 9 says the main subversive threats beyond constitutional democracy include "universal rights," Western concepts of a free press and the West's mistrust of one-party rule.In its support for the dominant role of the party in public life it also challenges the West's belief in the importance of civil society. And it goes on to warn against critiques of the party's historical record, for example of the crushing of the student movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989, or Mao's Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s.The overall effect of Document No. 9 is to suggest a remarkable sense of vulnerability at the top of the Beijing power system as the Internet and blogging and the rise of a prosperous middle class rooted in the private sector all seem to threaten the party's hold, even as criticism of corruption among party officials is becoming widespread.Political opponents, says the document, "have stirred up trouble about disclosing officials' assets, using the Internet to fight corruption, media controls and other sensitive topics, to provoke discontent with the party and government.""Other sensitive topics" include the country's environmental woes and the controversial one-child policy, still largely in force despite some reforms, which is threatening China with a demographic nightmare of few children to support an ever-rising number of elderly.The crucial issue is that there appears to be a growing disconnect between the interests of the party elite, committed to retaining sole power, and the interests of China and its people as a whole. They, after all, appear to enjoy the freedom of speech and comment and criticism on the internet.And as the economy falters the party elite, with an eye on the way that Glasnost helped collapse the Soviet Union, seems to be running scared.

CHICAGO, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- An Illinois man who pleaded guilty to murder has won a new trial by arguing that his 30-year prison sentence was too lenient.Benny Deanda Jr.'s unusual legal argument in an appeal for a new trial is rare, but Deanda's court-appointed attorney Levi Harris said Deanda wanted another trial so he could put on a self-defense case for the 2001 slaying, the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday."Ninety-nine out of 100 times, it would be inadvisable to do it," Harris, an assistant defender with the state appellate defender's office, told the Chicago Tribune Wednesday. "Here, he wanted another shot (at a trial)."Deanda, 26, pleaded guilty during trial to the 2001 murder of Mario Jiminez, 16, in exchange for 30 years in prison.The least amount of time he should have received by law was 35 years in prison, a fact Deanda used in his appeal for a new trial.Deanda now faces up to life in prison if he's found guilty at trial and is aware his sentence could more than double, Harris said.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Tuesday for a white couple who adopted an American Indian baby but were ordered to return her to her biological father. The ruling crossed ideological lines. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito said nothing in federal law barred the termination of her biological father's parental rights.The emotionally charged case pitted South Carolina law -- and the laws of most states, which consider the best interests of an adoptive child -- against the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA.The 1978 act was designed in part to protect the interests of Indian fathers when single mothers give up children for adoption. Private adoption agencies had been sending Indian children to white adoptive parents at a high rate."Veronica" was born in 2009 to a single Indian mother in Oklahoma. Her father, a Cherokee and a soldier at the U.S. Army's Fort Sill, Okla., texted the mother while she was pregnant, giving up all rights. But the father later decided he wanted the child, and eventually a divided South Carolina Supreme Court cited the federal act, said it trumped state law and ordered that the white adoptive parents, a James Island, S.C., couple -- the only parents the child knew -- to give up the 2-year-old.She has since been living with her biological father."This case is about a little girl [Baby Girl] who is classified as an Indian because she is 1.2 percent [3/256] Cherokee," Alito said in the majority opinion. "Because Baby Girl is classified in this way, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that certain provisions of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 required her to be taken, at the age of 27 months, from the only parents she had ever known and handed over to her biological father, who had attempted to relinquish his parental rights and who had no prior contact with the child. The provisions of the federal statute at issue here do not demand this result."Under the way the South Carolina Supreme Court read federal law, "a biological Indian father could abandon his child in utero and refuse any support for the birth mother -- perhaps contributing to the mother's decision to put the child up for adoption -- and then could play his ICWA trump card at the 11th hour to override the mother's decision and the child's best interests. If this were possible, many prospective adoptive parents would surely pause before adopting any child who might possibly qualify as an Indian under the ICWA." The ruling reverses the lower court and sends the case back down for a new result based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Latest Headlines Photos Quotes Wiki	Wiki
Muhammad Yunus (Bengali: মুহাম্মদ ইউনুস, pronounced Muhammôd Iunus) (born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist and founder of the Grameen Bank, an institution that provides microcredit (small loans to poor people possessing no collateral) to help its clients establish creditworthiness and financial self-sufficiency. In 2006 Yunus and Grameen received the Nobel Peace Prize. Yunus himself has received several other national and international honors.
He previously was a professor of economics where he developed the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. He is the author of Banker to the Poor and a founding board member of Grameen America and Grameen Foundation. In early 2007 Yunus showed interest in launching a political party in Bangladesh named Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power), but later discarded the plan. He is one of the founding members of Global Elders.
Yunus also serves on the board of directors of the United Nations Foundation, a public charity created in 1998 with entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner’s historic $1 billion gift to support United Nations causes. The UN Foundation builds and implements public-private partnerships to address the world’s most pressing problems, and broadens support for the UN.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
