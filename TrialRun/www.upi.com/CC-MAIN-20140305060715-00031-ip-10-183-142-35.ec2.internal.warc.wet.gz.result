CHICAGO, Oct. 6 (UPI) -- Legal giant Sidley Austin's decision to pay $27.5 million in an age discrimination case has set important precedent, says a U.S. employment commission."The demographic changes in America assure that we will see more opportunities for age discrimination to occur," said Ronald S. Cooper, general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Therefore, it is increasingly important all employers understand older workers are protected under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Cooper said.Chicago-based Sidley Austin Friday agreed to pay $27.5 million to 32 former partners over the age of 40 who had their pay cut and then were told to leave the firm, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.The case was closely watched because of a widely held belief in the legal profession that firm partners are "employers" and therefore not covered by federal anti-discrimination laws, the Times reported."Anyone who is in a position where they can be forced out because of age should be considered an employee," said Catherine Fisk, a Duke University law professor and employment law specialist.

LONDON, Sept. 24 (UPI) -- Some of the untapped fossil fuel resources should be left in the ground for the sake of the environment, former Irish President Mary Robinson said.Robinson serves as a U.N. envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa and is a member of The Elders, a non-governmental group advocating for human rights.She told The Guardian newspaper in London the threat of pollution suggests some untapped oil and natural gas reserves should be left alone."There is a global limit on a safe level of emissions," she said in an interview published Monday. "That means major fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground."Her comments come ahead of the formal release of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The BBC reported Monday the report may suggest global warming is slowing down.Robinson said there was some skepticism surrounding global warming trends that are not "based in reality."She added there were bound to be concerns from an energy sector called on to leave billions of dollars worth of oil and natural gas untouched."We are already talking to the business community that wants change, but there is obviously a business community that is trying to cloud and distort the science," she said.

CAIRO, July 28 (UPI) -- An American archaeological team has discovered the remains of the oldest bakery to date used by ancient Egyptians to produce "sun bread" -- bread still made today in Egypt's southern villages, officials said Sunday.The secretary-general of the Archaeological Higher Council, Zahi Hawas, said the archaeologists were digging south of the Sphinx in Giza when they found what was, in the third millennium B.C., a fully stocked and functioning bakery.He told United Press International the discovery showed modern farmers in the rural villages in Egypt were still using the same methods to produce the same bread their forefathers made more than 4,000 years ago.The team, headed by archaeologist Mark Lener, found trays and tools used to make and ferment the dough. Also uncovered were closets used to store the seeds before sending them to the bakeries, Hawas said.Egyptologists said ancient Egyptians succeeded in producing yeast during the Old Dynasty (2686 to 2181 B.C.), and used it to produce the oldest known types of alcoholic beverages and 12 kinds of bread and pastries.Team leader Lener told UPI the team also found tools and equipment used to construct two of the three pyramids of Giza, built to bury two of the most important pharaohs who ruled in the Fourth Dynasty between 2613 and 2494 B.C. Among other discoveries: -- a collection of archaeological pieces used to count the laborers building the two pyramids, believed to have exceeded 20,000 workers;-- primitive statistical drawings to record the number of tools handed out to the workers;-- an industrial zone that manufactured bronze tools and special uniforms for the laborers building the pyramids.-- 250 ceramic stamps printed with the names of the Pharaohs Khafra and Manqara, owners of the second and third largest pyramids in Egypt.The latest discoveries came within an archaeological campaign by Egyptian and U.S. archeologists in the Giza and Sakkara areas to uncover tools and technologies used by the ancient Egyptians to build the pyramids.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- British rock 'n' roll icon Paul McCartney has recorded a track with his former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr for Starr's upcoming CD "Y Not."The album, which Starr also produced, is set for release Jan. 12 on Hip-O Records/UMe, Universal Music Enterprises said Friday.Starr and McCartney collaborated on the CD's first single, "Walk with You," a song about the power of friendship. Starr's decision to take a stronger role in the recording of his latest solo album was a significant one, his record label said. "I didn't do it at the start," Starr said in a statement. "I was the least involved in the production of the Beatle records. And then with my solo records, I worked with some other great producers like Richard Perry, Arif Mardin and Don Was. So it just seemed like that's the way that it goes. Then suddenly, it's another point in your life, and you say, 'I'm going do this now.' So I'll be producing anything I make from now on. That's the good news. It's a confidence thing, I suppose. And 'Y Not' is really another way of me saying, 'Yes, I can.'"

HOUSTON, June 1 (UPI) -- The silhouette created as Venus transits the face of the sun Tuesday will be widely visible across seven continents, U.S. space officials said.Even a sliver of Antarctica will be in position to see it, NASA said.The transit, which will take nearly 7 hours, begins at 6:09 p.m. EDT on June 5, with the best viewing in the mid-Pacific, where the sun will be high overhead during crossing. The best view in the United States will be around Sunset.NASA warns viewers not to stare at the sun, but instead use a projection technique or solar filter.The last time Venus made the transit was in 2004, when modern solar telescopes captured an "unprecedented view" of the planet's atmosphere backlit by solar fire. NASA said pictures of the 2012 transit will be even better due to improvements in cameras and solar telescopes.Venus will next transit the sun in 2117 and 2125.

BOSTON, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Vernon Wells doubled home the eventual winning run in the 10th inning Thursday, allowing the Los Angeles Angels to earn a wild 14-13 win over Boston.The Angels overcame an early six-run deficit by scoring eight times in the third. They then fell behind 11-9, came back to take a 12-11 lead in the top of the ninth and wound up going into extra innings when Cody Ross tied it for Boston with a homer in the bottom half of the inning.Kendrys Morales put Los Angeles back in front with a solo shot in the 10th and Wells produced his RBI double later in the inning to give the Angels a two-run advantage. They needed it when Dustin Pedroia brought Boston within one with a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 10th.The teams combined for 38 hits.Pedroia had five RBI, three of them on a second-inning homer. Wells contributed three RBI for the Angels, one coming on a bases-loaded walk in the eighth-run third inning and another with a solo homer in the top of the ninth.Ernesto Frieri (3-0) worked the ninth and 10th innings for the Angels and gave up two runs, but still picked up the victory.The loss went to Alfredo Aceves (2-8), who retired only three men while giving up five runs. He was the seventh of eight Boston pitchers.

SOCHI, Russia, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- Victor Ahn collected his sixth Olympic medal for two different countries Saturday with a victory in the 1,000-meter short-track skating race.Ahn won three golds and a bronze at the Turin Games of 2006 while representing his native South Korea. He now has two more medals at the Sochi Games as a citizen of Russia. Ahn won bronze earlier in the Olympics in the 500-meter race.In the other short-track final held Saturday, Zhou Yang of China successfully defended her Olympic title over 1,500 meters.Ahn edged Russian teammate Vladimir Grigorev by .074 of a second to earn the title. It was the third gold of the Olympics for the host country.Sjinkie Knegt of the Netherlands won the bronze. Until Saturday, all of the 12 medals won by the Netherlands at these Games had come in oval speed skating.American J.R. Celski fell in his quarterfinal heat and again was shut out of medal contention.In the women's race, seven competitors were placed in the finals after various penalties had cost skaters a fair chance to compete. That made for a crowded track and some sort of incident was almost inevitable.Sure enough, three skaters hit the ice early in the race in an incident the judges decided had been caused by South Korea's Alang Kim. One of those caught up in the crash was American Emily Scott.That left four skaters to compete for the medals and Zhou won by a tenth of a second over Suk-Hee Shim of South Korea.Arianna Fontana of Italy took the bronze for her second medal of the Olympics. She finished second in the 500-meter race.

ALBANY, N.Y., Feb. 10 (UPI) -- The New York Senate, in a rare act, voted 53-8 Tuesday night to oust Sen. Hiram Monserrate, who was convicted of a misdemeanor for roughing up his girlfriend.Gov. David Paterson called a special election for March 16 to determine who will replace the Queens borough Democrat, whose ouster leaves the state Senate with 31 Democrats and 30 Republicans, The New York Times reported.Monserrate said he intends to try to regain his seat in the special election and his attorneys also are seeking a remedy in federal court, the newspaper said. "The New York state Senate does not have the constitutional and legal authority to expel Senator Monserrate," said Norman Siegel, one of the ousted lawmaker's lawyers. "And even if they did, their actions have not been consistent with due process of law." Monserrate was arrested in December 2008 and convicted on a misdemeanor count last fall. He avoided conviction on a felony charge that he cut his companion on the face with a broken glass.Monserrate is the first state lawmaker expelled in New York since the 1920s, when six assemblymen who were members of the Socialist Party of America were booted, the Times said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 15 (UPI) -- Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., could tip his plans for 2014 and possibly beyond during his speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference, observers said.Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, unveiled his budget blueprint earlier this week and his speech Friday before CPAC gives him a forum to discuss his budget in particular or his economic vision for the country, The Hill reported.The Budget Committee chairman said on "Fox News Sunday" campaigning for vice president made a possible presidential run "more realistic." He also said if he remained in the House, he'd rather be a policy shaper and not run for a House leadership position."If I wanted to be in elected leadership like speaker, I would have run for these jobs years ago. I've always believed the better place for me is in policy leadership, like being a chairman," Ryan said Sunday. After the 2014 midterm election, Ryan will have to announce whether he will run seek the presidency or push for the Ways and Means chairmanship should Republicans retain control of the House, The Hill said. He could do both, but observers said that would be impractical because he would have to focus on the campaign. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, has more seniority than Ryan on Ways and Means although Ryan would be considered the favorite should he seek the job, The Hill said. The current chairman, Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, is term-limited. "There is a tension between whether he wants to be a [Ways and Means] committee chairman or president," GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak told The Hill. "He's going to have to make that decision in January of 2015, after the election, around the same time he would need to be launching a presidential campaign."

CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- Venezuelans should freely vote for a new leader if Hugo Chavez dies, not simply accept his successor, the man who lost the presidential election to Chavez said."This is not Cuba, nor is it a monarchy where a king designates the next king," the newspaper El Nacional quoted Henrique Capriles Radonski as saying Sunday. "The last word belongs to the people."Capriles, 40, wished Chavez, 58, a long life and a complete recovery."May God bless him and the virgin cover him with her mantle," Capriles said at a campaign stop ahead of next week's gubernatorial election.Capriles, the governor of Miranda, one of the country's most populous states, which includes part of Caracas, the capital, is running for re-election in a race The New York Times said was difficult.Chavez was back in Cuba Monday for further cancer surgery after flying to Caracas from Havana to announce on national television Saturday night his cancer had returned. He flew back to Havana early Monday.Chavez said somberly on television it was a possibility he might not be able to continue as president or begin his new term in office next month.In that case, "my strong opinion, as clear as the full moon, irrevocable, absolute, total," is that "you should elect [Vice President] Nicolas Maduro" as the new president."I ask it from my heart," Chavez said with Maduro at his side and a bust of South American independence leader Simon Bolivar behind them.He spoke several times of the importance of "unity" in Venezuela and said he hoped he would recover fully."With the grace of God, as on the previous occasions, we'll come out victorious," he said, holding up a crucifix and kissing it.Chavez, president since Feb. 2, 1999, was elected to a fourth term in October, defeating Capriles 55 percent to 44 percent.Capriles' portion of the popular vote was far more than any previous candidate against Chavez.His new six-year presidential term begins Jan. 10.But if Chavez dies or cannot continue to govern before then, the Chavez-influenced Constitution, adopted in 1999, says Maduro, as vice president, would become president and finish out the current term's remaining days.It says if Chavez is able to begin his new term, or if he leaves office within the first four years, new elections would have to be called within 30 days."We don't know if Chavez is telling the truth about his health or if this is a political ploy," Maria Elena Ferrer, a Venezuelan national and political author who runs the Humanamente consulting firm in New York, told United Press International Sunday night."But if Chavez is telling the truth -- and therefore putting at risk all his party's gubernatorial candidates a week before Sunday's election -- then he must be very ill," she said."Because people don't vote for his United Socialist Party or for his revolution," she said. "They vote for Chavez. And if Chavez is out of the picture, everything gets very confused."

Nov. 28 (UPI) -- Impersonating at varying intervals a posh British man chewing on a tobacco pipe and a beret-wearing French artist, Glenn Beck spent a segment of his internet show, "GBTV," ruminating on art's history and purpose, in response to the work of Boston artist Michael D'Antuono's painting of President Obama as a crucified Jesus Christ. Beck explained:Art is in the eye of the beholder, and this guy has right to do this. I think it’s offensive. I don’t think it’s close to reality, but whatever floats your boat. I support his right to do exactly that. I agree with him that people who are upset should not trump his right to be able to do it and be able to hang it wherever he wants – as long as its wanted there.But would artists like D'Antuono respect Beck's right to make his own brand of art? "Kids do not try this at home," Beck said as he dropped an Obama figurine into a jar of what Beck called "pee-pee," but was later identified as a yellow liquid made to look like urine. "I prefer to call this work of art ... 'Flo-bama,'" Beck said of his creation, which mimics the 1987 "Piss Christ" photograph by Andres Sorrano. The Blaze, a website owned by Beck's media company, later explained the former Fox News host's intentions: The idea, for Beck however, is not to be untoward, but through irony, to highlight the hypocrisy of those who would shout in defiance at defacing the image of a sitting U.S. president, but not that of an image so sacred to Christianity — the world’s largest religion.Beck put the jar, called "Obama in Pee Pee," on eBay. Though the posting has since been removed -- eBay does "not allow the sale of bodily waste" -- it was going for $11,000.Your browser does not support iframes.
