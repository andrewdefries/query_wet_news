WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The U.S. Energy Department said it expected commercial operations for offshore wind power generation to begin near six states in less than five years.U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said offshore wind engineering, design and deployment projects were awarded in Maine, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Virginia. The projects are scheduled for commercial operation by 2017."The United States has tremendous untapped clean energy resources and it is important for us to develop technologies that will allow us to utilize those resources in ways that are economically viable," Chu said in a statement.The Energy Department said offshore wind has the potential to produce as much as 4,000 gigawatts of renewable electricity, four times what the country produces now.In April, U.S. regulators approved the construction plan for the Cape Wind energy project off the coast of Massachusetts. The project calls for 130 wind turbines capable of generating about 3.6 megawatts of energy each. It should be completed by 2014.Onshore wind power in the United States accounted for 32 percent of new additions to grid capacity last year.

STANFORD, Calif., Aug. 3 (UPI) -- The most recent common male and female human ancestors -- so-called Adam and Eve -- lived during the same time period, U.S. and Italian researchers say.It has generally been accepted that Eve lived about 190,000 to 200,000 years ago, while Adam lived 50,000 to 115,000 years ago, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.Theodore Schurr, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not part of either study, said that "didn't make a lot of genetic sense" -- and researchers at Stanford University in California now say Adam actually lived 120,000 to 156,000 years ago.Researchers involved in the study said they traced the Y chromosome of 69 men living all over the world, using new technological that allows researchers to sequence more DNA cheaper and faster. They repeated the sequencing with mitochondrial DNA from women and concluded that Eve lived around 99,000 to 148,000 years ago -- and for the first time found Adam and Eve may have lived during the same time period.In a separate study, Italian researchers used a similar approach and estimated Adam to have lived roughly 180,000 to 200,000 years ago."The male most recent common ancestor is just the individual whose Y chromosome happens to survive to this day, whereas those of his contemporaries have died out," said David Poznik, a geneticist at Stanford.The same applies to women, Poznik said."Up until now we've done these studies with very few markers," said Paolo Francalacci, a geneticist from the University of Sassari in Italy, who led the second study. "It was like looking at a photo with a few pixels."The new studies open "a new era of evolutionary research," Francalacci said.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 15 (UPI) -- The latest claim that a human rights defender was abused while in Bahraini custody suggests the country is "a haven for torturers," Human Rights Watch said.Human Rights Watch said Wednesday it had evidence that Bahraini authorities abused human rights defenders arrested for protesting during the Formula 1 race in April.Rights activist Naji Feteel, one of those detained, said he was subjected to electric shocks and waterboarding while in a Bahraini prison cell.Director of Middle East programs for Human Rights Watch Sarah Leah Whitson said from Beirut that Bahrain's allies need to pressure the government to take rights concerns seriously."If the latest allegations are brushed aside it will be yet more evidence suggesting that Bahrain's justice system is a haven for torturers," she said in a statement.The rights group reports that Bahrain's own investigation into the government's response to a 2011 uprising found that five detainees died as a result of torture while in custody.Bahrain said it's committed to a series of reforms outlined by an independent commission probing the 2011 crackdown. Its allies, including the United States, have been criticized for taking a soft line on allegations of abuse in Bahrain.

BRUSSELS, July 31 (UPI) -- The former wife and accomplice of homicidal Belgian pedophile Marc Dutroux was granted a conditional release from prison Tuesday, officials said.Michelle Martin was expected to enter a nunnery and won't be allowed to live within a 62-mile radius of any of her and Dutroux's victims, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported.A Belgian court authorized Martin's release after accepting her application for parole last year. Dutroux was sentenced to life in prison in June 2004 for the kidnap and rape of six young and teenage girls during the 1990s, four of whom were murdered. Martin, 52, has been behind bars since 1996 and was convicted in 2004 of being Dutroux's accomplice in the deaths of two girls. The couple since divorced.The announcement of Martin's release drew protests from the parents of her and Dutroux's victims, the Telegraph said. "We still know nothing of the release plan," said Jean-Denis Lejeune, father of Julie, 8, who was raped and murdered by Dutroux. "Legally, we are in a state of helplessness. We cannot do anything except scream. But no one hears us." Authorities had refused Martin's parole request three times before.

| License Photo	Jan. 6 (UPI) -- Bruce Jenner and Lamar Odom have been commiserating over their shared status as former Mr. Kardashians.Jenner, who split last year with Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner, has been giving advice to Odom in the wake of the disintegration of his marriage to Khloe Kardashian.The two exiles reportedly spent an hour on the phone on New Year's Day as Jenner advised Odom to steer clear of watching the famous family's reality show.Jenner, 64, told the NBA star, 34, to "hope for the best but expect the worst when it comes to that show and what they're going to reveal because this is how [the Kardashians] survive -- by putting everything on the table," a source said.“He told Lamar to forget about everything that happened in 2013 and not drag all the drama, defeats and embarrassments with him,” the source said. “Bruce told him, ‘It will eat you alive and ruin any progress if you stay in the past.’ He also told Lamar to stay off the websites and turn the TV off and not listen to gossip about him. He basically gave Lamar a lot of advice and mental support.”

Jennifer Nettles (born September 12, 1974 in Douglas, Georgia) is an American country music artist. She is known primarily for her role as lead vocalist of the duo Sugarland alongside Kristian Bush. Before Sugarland's inception, she also fronted Atlanta, Georgia-based bands called Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band. She also charted as a duet partner on the country version of rock band Bon Jovi's 2006 single "Who Says You Can't Go Home", a Number One hit on the Billboard charts.
Nettles began performing at school assemblies, her Southern Baptist church, and in community theater. She was also a member of Georgia 4-H's Clovers & Company performing arts group from 1986 to 1993.
Nettles studied Sociology and Anthropology at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia and graduated in 1997. While a student there, Nettles and Cory Jones (who at the time was studying classical guitar at the University of Georgia) formed the group Soul Miner’s Daughter. Performing as both an acoustic duo and with a band, they released two albums: The Sacred and Profane in 1996 and Hallelujah in 1998, both of which were composed of songs written collaboratively by Jones and Nettles.

Wiki
Slobodan Milošević (sometimes transliterated as Miloshevich; Serbian pronunciation: ( listen); Serbian Cyrillic: Слободан Милошевић; 20 August 1941 – 11 March 2006) was President of Serbia and Yugoslavia. He served as the President of Socialist Republic of Serbia and Republic of Serbia from 1989 until 1997 in three terms and as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He also led the Socialist Party of Serbia from its foundation in 1990. His presidency was marked by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent Yugoslav wars. In the midst of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Milošević was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
Milošević resigned the Yugoslav presidency amid demonstrations, following the disputed presidential election of 24 September 2000. He was arrested by Yugoslav federal authorities on Saturday, 31 March 2001, on suspicion of corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement. The initial investigation into Milošević faltered for lack of evidence, prompting the Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić to send him to The Hague to stand trial for charges of war crimes instead. Milošević conducted his own defense in the five-year long trial, which ended without a verdict when he died on 11 March 2006 in his prison cell in The Hague. Milošević, who suffered from heart ailments and high blood pressure, died of a heart attack. The Tribunal denies any responsibility for Milošević's death. They claim that he refused to take prescribed medicines and medicated himself instead.
Milošević had roots in the Vasojevići Serb clan. He was born and raised in Požarevac, Yugoslavia during the Axis occupation of World War II. His parents separated in the aftermath of the war. His father, the Serb Orthodox deacon Svetozar Milošević, shot himself in 1962, and his mother, Stanislava Resanović, a school teacher and also an active member of the Communist Party, committed suicide in 1972. Milošević went on to study law at the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he became the head of the ideology committee of the Yugoslav Communist League's (SKJ) student branch (SSOJ). While at the university, he befriended Ivan Stambolić, whose uncle Petar Stambolić had been a president of Serbian Executive Council (the Communist equivalent of a prime minister). This was to prove a crucial connection for Milošević's career prospects, as Stambolić sponsored his rise through the SKJ hierarchy.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
