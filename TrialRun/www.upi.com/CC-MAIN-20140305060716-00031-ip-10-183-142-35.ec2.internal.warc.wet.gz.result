CALGARY, Alberta, Sept. 20 (UPI) -- Canadian pipeline company Enbridge said while growth forecasts are fluid, most suggest its proposed Northern Gateway oil pipeline is needed for the industry.Enbridge aims to build the Northern Gateway pipeline to deliver around 525,000 barrels of so-called tar sands oil from deposits in Alberta to the port of Kitimat in British Columbia.Aboriginal communities along the Canadian western coast, as well as some provincial leaders, have expressed their objection to the project. A pipeline in Michigan operated by Enbridge and carrying tar sands ruptured in 2010, leading to the costliest onshore release in U.S. history.Enbridge President John Carruthers defended the economic gains of Northern Gateway against critics who questioned the company's calculations regarding the future of the oil sector."There could be differences as forecasts change over time but they all show substantial growth in oil supply from the western Canadian basin," he was quoted by the Edmonton Journal as saying.The report adds that Enbridge in 2011 described its forecast as "bullish."Supporters of projects like Enbridge aim to access western ports to deliver oil to Asian markets. Hearings on Northern Gateway continue into next week.

| License Photo	CHICAGO, March 13 (UPI) -- Pope Francis had one lung removed because of an infection when he was a teen, but it should not slow him down as pontiff, a U.S. expert says.Dr. Daniel Dilling, a pulmonologist at the Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, said lungs are to a certain extent "overbuilt" and have a good deal of reserve volume. "A person with two lungs has a lot of reserve function, so if one lung is removed, he or she can still function normally, without shortness of breath," Dilling said in a statement. "You can live no problem with one lung."However, if a person with one lung suffers a lung disease, he or she will not have any reserve capacity to compensate for loss of lung function, Dilling said.

| License Photo	ELMONT, N.Y., June 11 (UPI) -- Long shot Ruler On Ice and jockey Jose Valdivia Jr. Saturday claimed the 143rd running of the Belmont Stakes, the final jewel in racing's Triple Crown.Ruler On Ice, a 24-1 shot, logged an official time of 2:30.88 on the muddy track.Finishing second was Stay Thirsty, while Brilliant Speed took third.With steady rain falling in New York, the track for Belmont Park was classified as "sloppy" more than 2 hours before post-time.The upset left the Triple Crown with three different winners. Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom nearly fell just after the start of the Belmont and a late rally fell well short. Preakness Stakes winner Shackleford led most of the way Saturday but couldn't get the 1 1/2-mile distance in the "Test of Champions."Instead, it was Ruler On Ice, whose road to Belmont Park came not through Louisville but through Sunland Park in New Mexico -- where he finished third in the Sunland Park Derby in March. He then rebounded to finish second in the Federico Tessio Stakes in Maryland in his final Belmont prep.With Valdivia riding, Ruler On Ice stayed just behind and outside Shackleford. He finally edged to the lead at mid-stretch and won by about a half length over Stay Thirsty. Brilliant Speed was third and Nehro finished fourth. Shackleford finished fifth and Animal Kingdom struggled home sixth.The final time, over a track officially rated sloppy, was 2:30.88. By contrast, Secretariat's track and stakes record is 2:24.Winning trainer Kelly Breen was having trouble handling Ruler On Ice after the race as the Roman Ruler colt was still full of spunk."He's a little crazy," Breen said. "He's done things you can't imagine a horse can do."Breen said he told Valdivia he had studied recent runnings of the Belmont and found that "horses that have been in the top four have won it. I said, 'Stay close.'"He just ran an unbelievable race. It was great."Ruler On Ice now has three wins from seven career starts. The Belmont was his first stakes triumph.Animal Kingdom's chances of winning disappeared just a few jumps after the start when he clipped heels with the horse to his outside of him and stumbled."I almost came off," jockey John Velazquez said. "I fell so far back, the race was lost at the start … . I knew I was done."Shackleford simply ran out of gas coming down the stretch but ran credibly for 1 1/4 mile. Since that is the longest distance any of these horses is likely to face during the rest of their careers, a showdown involving the three Triple Crown race winners is a distinct possibility later in the year -- perhaps in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic in November at Churchill Downs.Animal Kingdom was the favorite in the hours leading up to the $1 million race, with Irish import Master of Hounds gaining fans among early bettors.Animal Kingdom was posted at 2-1 as of 10:30 a.m., according to the Daily Racing Form, with Master of Hounds at 8-1 and Nehro, the Derby show horse, at 4-1.Other odds had Mucho Macho Man at 8-1, Shackleford at 11-1 and Stay Thirsty at 17-1.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (UPI) -- Paraguay is not facing suspension from the Organization of American States because of the way in which its Congress removed Fernando Lugo from the presidency, OAS officials say.To suspend Paraguay from the 35-member organization would not serve OAS objectives of restoring good governance, ensuring fair elections and a return to normal conditions in the landlocked country, OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza said.Lugo's speedy impeachment and removal from the presidency was met with disapproval of other regional organizations, including Mercosur and the Union of Arab States. The Paraguayan Congress accused Lugo of failure to control political unrest after a riot that left 17 people dead and appointed Vice President Federico Franco as president.OAS membership is important for impoverished Paraguay as the association serves as a conduit for aid from the United States and other international aid-giving governments and agencies. OAS brings together all 35 independent states of the Americas and has 67 states and the European Union as observers.Insulza ordered an investigation into the events, rejecting calls for Paraguay's immediate suspension. In a report to the OAS Permanent Council following a fact-finding mission to Asuncion last week, Insulza said he favored a more active OAS presence in Paraguay to "avoid exacerbating the divisions within Paraguayan society and the country's political system and avoid causing unnecessary suffering among the people of Paraguay."The permanent council held a special meeting to receive Insulza's report, which will now go to the member states' foreign ministers and other senior officials.Insulza said OAS looked to Paraguay for an early return to normal conditions and to hold elections next year.OAS aims to "strengthen governance in Paraguay in the transition to the 2013 elections by promoting public dialogue and supporting the legal reforms that may help avoid further crises," Insulza said.He said the organization would "ensure that the electoral process is participatory and transparent, and that there are no reprisals or exclusions because of what happened, especially reprisals against President Lugo or his supporters."New president Franco is yet to be recognized by neighbors as well as regional organizations Mercosur and Unasur.Differences over how to handle the crisis in Paraguay widened after regional leaders met in a summit in Mendoza, Argentina, soon after the impeachment and Lugo's removal.Mercosur backed Lugo and a statement from the group condemned his removal as a "legislative, congressional or institutional coup" in which the former president was denied time to defend himself against an "express" impeachment vote.Unasur also protested Lugo's removal, asserting the move against him didn't respect due legal process.Paraguay says Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay have ganged up on the new government and want Paraguay expelled from the OAS.The political crisis has thrown Paraguay's dysfunctional economy into further disarray, not helped by Venezuela's decision to cut off oil supplies Paraguay receives on reduced and deferred payment bases.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- Police say pupils back from winter break in Los Angeles will see a greater police presence in their schools following the Newtown, Conn., massacre.Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said officers will step up patrols of the city's 600 elementary and middle schools, with an officer visiting every school at least once a day and as many as three times per day."I don't want anyone to think they can walk into a school in Los Angeles and be immune from the police, 'cause you won't be," Beck told CBS News Monday.CBS said many school districts across the country are stepping up security in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., last month that claimed 20 young children and six faculty members.

| License Photo	DAMASCUS, Syria, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- Syrian President Bashar Assad, critical of Turkey's stance on the unrest in Syria, warned Monday the "fire" in Syria threatened to spread to Turkey.Also Monday, a Russian flotilla docked at the Syrian port of Tartus to demonstrate solidarity with the Assad regime, Britain's Guardian newspaper reported. Syria's defense minister visited a Russian aircraft carrier Sunday. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet quoted Assad as saying: "If there is a fire in one room of the house, it will spread to the other rooms. To stop the fire from spreading to the other rooms and harming our brothers and sisters, we must work together to put it out."A crowd gathered at Monument Square in Deir Ezzor to condemn a series of explosions the government said were terrorist-sponsored, the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. Participants also voiced rejection of the foreign interference in Syria's affairs. On Friday, 26 people died in an explosion in Damascus that activists said was caused by the government but the government blamed on terrorists. On Sunday 11 Syrian soldiers were killed in attacks south of Damascus, in the town of Basr al-Harir rights observers reported.Anti-government activists on Sunday flocked to Arab League observers the Jabal Zawiya region of Idlib to determine whether the Assad regime was ending its violent crackdown against the protesters. Video posted by activists showed league monitors wearing yellow vests surrounded by chanting protesters.Activists also posted an Internet video that seemed to show a heavy army presence in Darkoush in Idlib on Sunday.Arab League monitors in Syria should receive reinforcements soon after league ministers were told the controversial mission needed more time and resources to observe escalating violence, The Guardian said. However, no agreement was reached on whether the mission should seek U.N. "technical assistance" to improve its performance.Syria has denied it hid anything from the observers after the league urged the Assad regime to improve cooperation, end violence and protect civilians."We let them move freely anywhere," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said after the league issued an interim report on the observers' mission. "We have provided all the things they need."The observers, who the report said were subjected to "harassment" by the government and the opposition, also believe Assad failed to honor his regime's promise to end the violence, the report said.But Qatari Prime Minister Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who led a Sunday league meeting in Cairo, said the mission had succeeded in reducing the level of killing.Hamad, who is also Qatar's foreign minister, said he expected the violence would lessen further by the time the league issues its final report on the observer mission Jan. 19.PHOTOS: Civil unrest in Syria"If the killings continue, then the mission's presence will be useless," he told reporters.Six army and law-enforcement personnel were buried Sunday. SANA said the officers were killed by armed terrorists Damascus and Homs.SANA reported armed gunmen kidnapped and killed a chief warrant officer in Harasta.Officials in Harasta also reported confiscating a vehicle they said was loaded with rifles, ammunition, night-vision goggles, military uniforms, driver licenses and loudspeakers. More than 160 people have been killed since the observer mission began Dec. 26, the umbrella anti-government activist group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.Death tolls and other accounts cannot be independently confirmed due to restrictions imposed on journalists by the Syrian government. The United Nations estimated last month the Syrian death toll topped 5,000. Estimates of detainees run from 15,000 to 40,000.

| License Photo	CAIRO, July 31 (UPI) -- The Egyptian Tamarod movement that led protests against ousted President Mohamed Morsi wants his Muslim Brotherhood to be listed as a terrorist organization.The movement called on the United States to give that label to the Muslim Brotherhood and said the Hamas military wing in the Gaza Strip, which is listed as a terror organization, is a brotherhood offshoot, Israel Radio reported Wednesday.Tamarod said 120,000 people have signed a petition calling on the U.S. government to blacklist the Muslim Brotherhood.In another development, Tamarod spokesman Mahmoud Badr said the movement hopes Egypt's interim government will formulate an entirely new constitution rather than amend the existing one drawn up by Morsi, who was ousted July 3, Masry al-Youm reported."We want a civilian, democratic constitution that ... upholds equal opportunity and does not differentiate between Egyptians on the basis of religion or race," Badr said.

Aug. 20 (UPI) -- An auction featuring over 500 vintage Chevrolet vehicles will take place in Pierce, a small town in northeastern Nebraska from the 28 through the 29 of September. The cars and pick-ups to be auctioned were collected over a period of 50 years by former dealership owner Ray Lambert, who claims he kept the vehicles assuming the cars would appreciate over time. About 50 of the cars have fewer than 20 miles on the odometer. Some are so rare that no price has been established yet. The vehicles haven't been touched in decades and some of them still have the manufacturers' plastic on the seats.The most valuable car is a rare Chevy Cameo pickup that is expected to receive a six-figure bid. Ray, 95, and his wife, Mildred, 92, retired in 1996 but still live in town. They reportedly decided to sell the collection so others could enjoy the vehicles. Auctioneer Yvette VanDerBrink says she has received calls about the auction from all over the world, including Iceland, Singapore and Brazil."To find this many new, old vehicles is unheard of," she said. "It's like a white buffalo."The most valuable vehicles were reportedly stored at a nearby warehouse until a until a heavy snow collapsed the roof. Many of the cars were saved, however, and moved to a different location. The rest sat under trees at a nearby farm the Lambrechts owned.The cars will be sold as they are for collectors who view them as works of art to display or as restoration projects. "This kind of stuff is absolutely the rarest of the rare," said Mark Gessler, president of the Historic Vehicle Association."You can see plenty of cars that have been restored. We want to ensure that we're celebrating the original craftsmanship, the original technique," he said. "It's a touchstone of our past."

But it was a big deal at the time: 130,000 U.S. troops were deployed in a multiyear counterinsurgency campaign, and more than 4,000 of them died. U.S. forces tortured prisoners. Insurgents committed atrocities. Very messy.

There is no doubt that it is a tough fight in Afghanistan	Different views of the same conflict

I was not expressing opposition to thinking about and preparing for the future. It would be irresponsible to do so -- and the overwhelming majority of the people in the Pentagon, the services and the defense industry do just that.

Wiki
Edvard Grieg (15 June 1843 – 4 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist. He is best known for his Piano Concerto in A minor, for his incidental music to Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt (which includes Morning Mood and In the Hall of the Mountain King), and for his collection of piano miniatures Lyric Pieces.
Edvard Hagerup Grieg was born in Bergen, Norway on June 15, 1843. His parents were Hiemlik Grieg (1806–1875), a merchant and the American vice consul in Bergen, and Gesine Carrie Hagerupel (1814–1875), a music teacher and daughter of Edvard Hagerup. The family name, originally spelled Greig, has Scottish origins. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, however, Grieg's great-grandfather traveled widely, settling in Norway about 1770, and establishing business interests in Bergen.
Edvard Grieg was raised in a musical home. His mother was his first piano teacher and taught him to play at the age of 6. Grieg studied in several schools, including Tank's School. He often brought in samples of his music to class.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
