WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The U.S. energy sector needs "planning for resilience" as domestic markets struggle to recover from Hurricane Sandy, an analyst said.New Jersey this week lifted a rationing system for retail gasoline purchases nearly two weeks after Hurricane Sandy, a Category 1 storm, battered the East Coast. Millions of residents in the region lost electrical power in a storm intensified by an east-bound system. Energy infrastructure was challenged further by a nor'easter that followed.Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research company IHS, told delegates at an energy security forum in Washington that there's an "urgent need" to advance energy security in the United Sates."One has to assume that shocks will come. This requires planning for resilience and striving for the best information for decision-making," he said. "It also requires pre-positioning the knowledge so that governments and private sector can communicate smoothly and quickly."An update on recovery operations in New York, provided by Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office, reports that nearly 25,000 consumers were still without power."An emergency order establishing an odd-even license plate system for gasoline purchases remains in effect until further notice," a statement from Bloomberg's office read.

| License Photo	June 12 (UPI) -- George Takei, best known for playing Sulu on "Star Trek," has experienced a career resurgence thanks to his outspoken advocacy of gay rights and his hilarious, timely Facebook posts. The 76-year-old actor has more than 4.1 million Facebook followers who look forward to his clever thoughts on issues of the day, but many fans were disappointed to learn last week that Takei paid a ghost writer to to pen his jokes. The news came to light when comedy writer Rick Polito admitted to writing "funny lines" for Takei at $10 a joke in a recent interview with Jim Romenesko. Takei brushed aside criticism in an email to Wired last week: What is this hoo-ha about my FB posts? I have Brad, my husband, to help me and interns to assist. What is important is the reliability of my posts being there to greet my fans with a smile or a giggle every morning. That’s how we keep on growing.Polito responded to the mini-controversy in another email to Romenesko."I wrote an apology to George and Brad and their guy said he’d pass it on. I just said that I’d been looking for any mention of my book I could get and that I hadn’t meant to expose anything," Polito said.“I don’t update his page. I’ve had no direct contact with George. I’ve sent him some memes, as have other comedian types and I was happy for the exposure," he added.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Sept. 8 (UPI) -- A monkey being kept illegally in California as a pet is now in quarantine after biting a woman. The Javan macaque inflicted severe wounds on the hands and arms of the victim Aug. 29, the Los Angeles Times reported. The monkey was being kept in Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County. Eric Anderson, the county animal services manager, said he got a notice this week about the bite. He said Javan macaques can inflict bites like those of dogs. "This kind of animal is never meant to be kept domestically. It is illegal," Anderson said. "It lived on a diet including Frosted Flakes and juice. We strongly discourage the keeping of any such animal and that is entirely the wrong kind of diet."The monkey will remain in quarantine for 60 days at Zoo to You, a rescue operation.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- The Swiss Alps' iconic Matterhorn has been has been mapped in detail never possible before by a fleet of autonomous, fixed-wing drones, researchers say.The Matterhorn, dominating the skyline of the Swiss/Italian border at 14,692 feet, has challenged climbers since it was first scaled in 1865.The new mapping, conducted by unmanned aerial vehicle company SenseFly and aerial photography company Pix4D, was introduced at the Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference in New York City this past weekend, NewScientist.com reported.Three drones were launched from the peak of the Matterhorn, flying down the mountain just 100 yards from the face while capturing data points just 8 inches apart.When they reached the bottom of the mountain a second team of researchers recovered the drones and then relaunched them for additional mapping."Such a combination of high altitudes, steep rocky terrain and sheer size of data set has simply not been done before with drones, we wanted to show that it was possible," SenseFly's Adam Klaptocz said.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- The stakes are high as Secretary of State Colin Powell delivers a major address on Monday outlining the Bush administration's new initiatives to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace.In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the administration is in a unique position to dramatically establish real, lasting peace. Anything less than a concerted effort, however, will result in another failure, leading to even greater violence.The Bush administration hoped to avoid becoming as involved in this conflict as former President Clinton had been. Bush and his team hoped that, somehow, the intifada, which began in September 2000, would end, almost of its own accord.While the Bush team made numerous attempts to bring about cease-fires and encourage both sides to resume negotiations, their underlying approach was that peace would come when both sides tired of violence.Most of the cease-fires were short. Each failed attempt to stop the violence only fueled more attacks and reprisals by both sides.Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat each responded to the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington by offering to play a major role in the coalition against terrorism. Both Sharon and Arafat emphasized their desire to assist the United States; yet each attacked the other, labeling his adversary a "terrorist."Sharon called Arafat "Israel's bin Laden" and drew parallels between the attacks on the United States and those that Israel had endured from the Palestinians. Conversely, Palestinians called their suicide bombers "freedom fighters" and sought to portray Israeli troops as "terrorists."In addition to the growing violence in the region, other factors have contributed to the urgency and importance of America's renewed role in the Middle East peace process. The Bush administration feels that daily stories of Israeli activities against Palestinians fuel anti-Israeli and anti-American sentiment. Thus, the administration hopes that reducing Israeli-Palestinian tensions would remove this issue from bin Laden's panoply of appeals to Muslims around the world.The administration is also motivated by the fact that virtually every Arab leader has called on the United States to help resolve this conflict. In addition, our European allies have also encouraged the United States to play a more constructive role. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, presented a forceful case for greater U.S. involvement when he met with Bush last week.The real key will be American actions after Powell's remarks. Jordan's ambassador to the United States stated that what America does will "indicate that this is not an isolated speech but that the administration has decided this is the time for very close engagement with the Middle East."Essentially, America must boldly help both sides achieve their major objectives, which will require that each also make significant concessions, which they have, thus far, been unwilling or unable to make.The United States must reaffirm its support for the security of Israel and the sanctity of the state behind recognized borders. This includes increased pressure on Arafat to take all steps to end violence against Israelis, including arresting those responsible for past attacks and those planning future violence.Powell's speech will certainly reinforce President Bush's recent talk at the United Nations calling for a Palestinian state, but this must be followed with concrete proposals delineating the nature and boundaries of this state.Solutions cannot be imposed upon the participants; neither side would be willing to live up to dictated agreements. Past negotiations, however, provide a basis upon which the administration can build.In particular, Israelis and Palestinians came very close to working out the framework for an agreement when they met at Taba in January 2000. The United States was not a party to these negotiations, which should now be used as the start for a settlement.Using the Taba talks as the basis, a Palestinian state can be established comprising all of Gaza and approximately 95 percent of the West Bank. To compensate for the 5 percent of the West Bank that would remain as part of Israel, the Palestinians would receive an equivalent amount of land near Gaza. This provides Palestinians with more room, while hardly impacting Israel.Palestine would gain control of about half of the current city of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount (al Haram al Sharif), but excluding the Western Wall and Jewish holy sites. Israel and Palestine could have their capitals in their respective sections of Jerusalem.Under the scenario that could develop if Taba were the starting point for the new negotiations, the new Palestinian state would be recognized by the United Nations and would receive significant economic assistance to jumpstart its economy. Its military would be severely curtailed and would be required to stop all violent acts against Israel.The Palestinians would have to declare that the conflict with Israel was over and must work to ensure that other Arab states endorsed the agreement.Palestinians would have to end their anti-Israel propaganda and revise their anti-Israeli school texts.While Israel would keep only 5 percent of the West Bank, it is significant that this is where 140,000 of the 180,000 Israelis who live in the territories currently reside.Officially adding this land to Israel would also broaden the width of the country. It would enable Israel to add some of the surrounding Jewish areas in the West Bank to the municipality of Jerusalem, thus enlarging the Jewish city, albeit with different than current borders. Settlers living in the more outlying settlements would be given the option of remaining in the new Palestinian state or moving within Israel's new borders.Even if they accept this framework, the two sides have many other serious issues to resolve including water rights, international peacekeepers and schedules for implementation.At present, neither side appears ready for such a comprehensive settlement. Many Palestinians are still not willing to accept any two-state agreement as they yearn for the elimination of Israel.Even the majority of the less radical Palestinians remain unwilling to give up their dream of gaining all of the West Bank and an unlimited right of return for all Palestinian refugees.Many Israelis, including Prime Minister Sharon, publicly refuse to accept any agreement that would result in abandoning the majority of settlements in the West Bank and all in Gaza. Many are not willing to accept any new borders for Jerusalem, even if these lead to a larger Israeli-controlled city. Most believe Israel cannot absorb so many Palestinian refugees.Even if an accord is reached, in the aftermath of so much violence and broken accords, neither side trusts the other. Only the United States can provide appropriate assurances that the next agreement will be fulfilled.Secretary Powell's speech may provide a temporary reprieve, but if it is not followed by a concerted American effort it will do more harm in the long run. To be effective, American actions must include diplomatic, economic and other pressures. While the administration should not seek to impose final terms, it must restart the process of negotiations that will lead to a settlement. The world changed as a result of Sept. 11 and the United States must ensure that these changes include a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.--(Ralph Nurnberger is counsel to the Washington law firm of Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, LLP and teaches graduate courses on international relations at Georgetown University.)

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- Nominees for governor and U.S. Senate in California are saying little publicly about this week's court ruling on same-sex marriage, electoral analysts say.Republican Senate nominee Carly Fiorina and gubernatorial hopeful Meg Whitman oppose U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker's ruling overturning California's ban on gay marriage, and Jerry Brown, the Democratic nominee for governor and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer support it -- but four have been reluctant to talk about the issue, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.Morris Fiorina, a political science professor at Stanford University who is not related to the candidate said, "It's a danger to both parties if you have big chunks of your own constituency that are on the other side of the issue."The top two Republican candidates issued statements saying Walker's ruling was one step in a long process but no statements on the were found on the candidates' Web sites and all four of the top nominees said they planned to focus elsewhere during the campaign, the Times reported."We just made the decision that our time is used most effectively if we talk about the things where the next governor can have some impact," Brown spokesman Sterling Clifford said.Whitman spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said the candidate will "continue to focus on her plans to keep and create jobs in California."

ST. GEORGE, Australia, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- Rising floodwaters isolated the town of St. George in Australia's Queensland state where about 400 people hunkered down Sunday night, officials said.The rest of the community of about 2,400 people had already left under mandatory evacuation orders, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. The remaining residents were expected to be airlifted out Monday since the roads have been inundated by the swollen Balonne River.The ABC said the Weather Bureau projected the river could reach 49 feet by Tuesday, surpassing the previous high mark set in 2010 by about 3 feet."I can't stress enough stress enough the importance of people complying with the police order to evacuate the town," Premier Anna Bligh said. "I understand what a very difficult thing it is we are asking of people but we would not ask it if we did not believe personal safety was at risk."At Charleville, authorities recovered the body of a woman who had been missing in floodwaters in Roma since Friday, the news network said.

CAIRO, Dec. 22 (UPI) -- Following a second weekend of voting, the new Egyptian Constitution appeared assured of passage, early results compiled by the Muslim Brotherhood indicated.The Islamic political party said late Saturday results showed the charter was garnering 70 percent of the vote with more than 60 percent of the polling places counted, The New York Times reported.The newspaper said Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekki resigned Saturday. His position would be eliminated under the new constitution.The former judge had originally submitted his resignation in early November, but stayed on during the turmoil leading up to the constitutional referendum. "The nature of political work does not suit my nature as a judge," he said. Once the votes are officially tabulated in the coming days, President Mohamed Morsi will deliver a nationally televised address urging unity and reconciliation, his aides said.His advisers said he plans to appoint some of his opponents to the Islamist-dominated upper house of Parliament that will act as the main legislative body until upcoming elections for the lower house. Ahram Online reported Morsi spokesman Yasser Ali announced the names Saturday of 90 members of the 270-member upper house, the Shura Council. Ali said in a post on his official Facebook page, the appointments represent 17 political parties, of which 12 parties were not previously represented. The members also include eight women, 12 Coptic Christians, five Azhar representatives and two representatives of the January 25 revolution's injured.Millions of Egyptians voted Saturday, but overall the turnout, like in the previous week's voting, was low, the Times said.Salafist Nour Party and Brotherhood FJP Party members were at some polling stations throughout Egypt, campaigning on behalf of the draft of the constitution, Ahram Online reported."Voting 'Yes' will ensure Egypt enters a new era under an umbrella of justice and freedom that hasn't been witnessed in decades," said the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie.Opponents of President Mohammed Morsi have been protesting the draft, the BBC reported."We know that if this constitution is passed, there will be no stability," opposition figure Mohammed ElBaradei said Thursday.The voting came a day after Islamists clashed with secular rivals in Alexandria, hurling stones at each other outside a mosque. Police dispersed the crowd using tear gas; 32 people were injured in the incident.
