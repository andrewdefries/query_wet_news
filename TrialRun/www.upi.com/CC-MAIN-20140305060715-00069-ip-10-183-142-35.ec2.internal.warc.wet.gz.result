LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Market analysts are betting that gasoline prices in the United States may remain in the grips of an early season spike, an oil analyst said.Motor group AAA reports that U.S. commuters paid, on average, $3.60 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, up 30 cents compared to last month and 10 cents higher than the same time last year.Daily price records were reported for California markets, where prices increased 14 cents in one week to more than $4 per gallon.Tom Kloza, an oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, told the Los Angeles Times "there has never been this much money bet on higher gasoline prices this early in the year."Higher crude oil prices and refinery shutdowns may explain some of the increase in prices. The U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration states that crude oil prices are responsible for about 68 percent of the cost of retail gasoline.Bloomberg News reports Brent crude oil futures are up nearly 7 percent for the year on signs of economic recovery in the United States. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in its February report stated that its forecast for world oil demand growth for the year has also been revised higher.Southern Colorado Public Radio reports that a gasoline price spike in the state is outpacing the national average. Despite the increase, commuters there paid, on average, $3.35 for a gallon of regular unleaded, about 25 cents less per gallon than the national average.

A weekly series by UPI examining the global telecommunications phenomenon known as the World Wide Web.--CHICAGO, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- As the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court last summer prepared their opinions for the case of Lawrence, et al. vs. Texas, gay activists around the country rapidly readied their online response. "We didn't know whether we would celebrate, protest, or celebrate and protest," said Robin Tyler, executive director of the Equality Campaign, a homosexual rights organization, at dontamend.com."So we had three sets of postings ready," he told United Press International. "The second it came out, we distributed our talking points by e-mail and online postings."Based on Internet talking points, which touted a ruling on June 26, 2003, that struck down an anti-sodomy law, homosexual activists took to the streets, around the country, seemingly spontaneously."From Fairbanks, Alaska, to the East Coast of the United States, the coverage said that gay activists poured out into the streets," Tyler said. "No one in the media thought to ask how it was organized."The Internet continues to transform grassroots politics, giving small, often home-office-based activists the ability to get their messages out, just like high-priced lobbyists and publicists on K Street in Washington, D.C., and on Madison Avenue in New York City. Fax machines and calling trees of the past are now passé for these grassroots activists, as blogs, Web sites, and mass e-mailing of PDF files -- as well as mobile phones and text messages -- are the new communications technologies. "The Web allows people who might be geographically or physically incapable of contributing to a movement to contribute their ideas, resources and support," said Andy Dehnart, a lecturer in communications studies and English at Stetson University in DeLand, Fla."The decentralization of the Web enables people to bypass more traditional methods of communication," he told UPI. "Pre-Internet, one person might have had a burning passion about a particular issue, but no way of finding others who agreed. Now, that person can connect online with others that he or she might not have known existed before."The "Howard Dean for President" campaign, with its free-form bloggers -- or Web loggers -- and virtual chats at meetup.com, generated a lot of attention starting late last year, but it is the small, non-profit organizations that truly are benefiting from political exposure online."It used to be that if you couldn't get the Los Angeles Times to cover you, your protest would not even come together," Tyler said. "What good is the freedom to assemble if you can't get the message out? But the Internet is fantastic. It is giving small groups the freedom to organize, online and offline, and get the message out. But we're not the only ones doing it now. The right is as well."Indeed, last fall, Matt Margolis, a recent college graduate who lives in suburban Boston, was miffed by the coverage the bloggers and online activists for Dean were generating in the national news media. So, he decided to launch his own grassroots effort -- a blog for President George W. Bush."Everyone thought blogs and the Internet were a liberal thing -- a liberal alternative to talk radio," Margolis told UPI. "I wanted to challenge that. We're a grassroots blog, dedicated to helping re-elect President Bush."Margolis founded BlogsForBush.com last fall, and now provides links to 825 other, pro-Bush blogs on an interactive part of his site, called the blog roll. "We started off with only a handful of links to other blogs," he said. "The initial goal was to have more than Howard Dean had on his site. He had about 90 blogs at the peak of his candidacy. We surpassed that. Before (Sen. John F. Kerry) picked (Sen. John) Edwards, he had a blog roll on his site and they had 55 blogs for Kerry. There's a big difference there. Since it changed to Kerry-Edwards, I haven't seen a blog roll."Another site that is making waves online is SwiftVets.com, funded by former U.S. Naval officers who served in Vietnam. The funders have also -- famously -- aired ads on TV, but they are using the online site, with a very active discussion board for Naval vets, to continue to protest Kerry's candidacy.According to the ad copy on the blunt, tough-talking Internet site, "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has been formed to counter the false 'war crimes' charges John Kerry repeatedly made against Vietnam veterans who served in our units and elsewhere, and to accurately portray Kerry's brief tour in Vietnam as a junior grade Lieutenant."Some experts, however, are skeptical about the impact these sites are having on changing public perceptions. "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a sound?" Mario Almonte, a public relations professional in New York City, told UPI. "If someone launches an Internet-based-protest, and the traditional print and broadcast media don't know about it, is it really happening?"Maybe that does not matter to some, who never would have learned of certain news events were it not for the content of activists' e-mail messages. Activists backing the nascent Senate campaign of Republican candidate Alan Keyes in Illinois on Tuesday sent journalists and others via e-mail a copy of remarks Keyes made. The campaign's official Internet site, Keyes2004.com, is merely a placeholder site at this point. A leading, local blogger also is said to be involved in the Keyes online campaign.The newsworthy statement by Keyes -- who is opposing Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate -- addressed a proposal to remove the tax burden on the "black community for a generation or two in order to encourage business ownership, create jobs and support the development strong economic foundations for working families."Experts said that, to be sure, such a statement might not be considered news in the strict sense until reported by the conventional media, but there is no doubt the cultural framework for what is news is changing because of the Internet. Tyler noted activists in her network waged a campaign, StopDrLaura.com, to protest comments made by Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a controversial conservative broadcaster, entirely online."The Internet has a significant impact beyond what most people realize," Almonte said. "Consider the Internet like the wind -- you can't see it, but it can have a significant impact on its surroundings if it reaches hurricane force."--Gene Koprowski covers telecommunications for UPI Science News.

ALBUQUERQUE, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- U.S. scientists report it's possible to predict how well people will remember information by monitoring their brain activity while they study.Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico said they were able to demonstrate predictions based on the results of monitoring test volunteers with electroencephalography sensors. The research team, led by Laura Matzen of Sandia's cognitive systems group, monitored test subjects' brain activity while they studied word lists, then used the EEG to predict who would remember the most information.For example, "if you had someone learning new material and you were recording the EEG, you might be able to tell them, 'You're going to forget this, you should study this again,' or tell them, 'OK, you got it and go on to the next thing,'" Matzen said in a Sandia release Tuesday.One of the study's goals, she said, is to discover if recording a person's brain activity while they use their natural approach to studying can predict what kind of training might work best for that person."That's promising because one of the things we want to do is see if we can use the brain activity to predict how people react to the training, whether it will be effective for them," Matzen said.

KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Though the overall number of civilian deaths as a result of conflict in Afghanistan is down, they were increasingly the target of attacks, a U.N. report says.The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported a 12 percent drop in the number of civilian deaths from conflict in 2012 when compared to 2011 figures. The decline, the first in six years, was attributed to a decrease in the number of suicide attacks as well as efforts by international forces to avoid civilian causalities when fighting militants.Jan Kubis, U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, said the decrease in the number of civilian deaths was welcome news, though it was overshadowed by the continued use of improvised explosive devices."Steep increases in the deliberate targeting of civilians perceived to be supporting the government demonstrates another grave violation of international humanitarian law," he added. "Particularly appalling is the use of suicide attacks including those carried out by brainwashed children to murder civilians which is also a clear breach of the norms of Islam."International forces are wrapping up their mission in Afghanistan after more than 10 years of engagements. Elections are planned for next year.UNAMA reports that more than 80 percent of the civilian casualties were attributed to those fighting against Afghan and international forces.

HUNTSVILLE, Texas, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- A Texas judge delayed Tuesday's scheduled execution of Kimberly McCarthy until April after defense attorneys argued her conviction was tainted by racism.McCarthy, 51, was to be executed Tuesday by lethal injection at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville for the July 21, 1997, slaying of her neighbor, retired college Professor Dorothy Booth, 71.Dallas County Judge Larry Mitchell rescheduled the execution for April 3 after University of Texas law Professor Maurie Levin argued McCarthy, who is black, was a victim of racial discrimination when a jury of 11 whites and one black convicted her, KWTX-TV, Waco, reported.Prosecutors -- who had argued the record does not support the defense argument of discrimination -- said they will not appeal the ruling, KWTX-TV said.McCarthy was convicted of beating Booth to death with a candelabra then cutting off the victim's finger to steal her wedding ring.After McCarthy was arrested for Booth's slaying, Dallas police linked her to two other fatal stabbing-robbery cases from 1988, WFAA-TV, Dallas, said.McCarthy was convicted of Booth's murder in 1998. Her conviction was overturned in 2001, but she was found guilty a second time a year later and sentenced to die for Booth's murder. The conviction and sentence stood as the case moved through the appeals process.McCarthy is one of 10 women on death row in Texas, the Death Penalty Information Center said. Twelve women have been executed in the United States -- four of them in Texas -- since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the center said on its website.

| License Photo	CANBERRA, Australia, March 2 (UPI) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard named Bob Carr foreign minister Friday to replace Kevin Rudd, who had resigned to challenge her Labor Party leadership. Carr is a former New South Wales premier.Before his appointment was announced, there had been speculation Defense Minister Stephen Smith would get the Foreign Ministry post, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.Gillard said Smith, who had been foreign minister before Rudd took the job, would stay on as defense minister and had much work ahead of him.The prime minister retained her party leadership after defeating Rudd's challenge in a 71-31 vote earlier this week.Emergency Management Minister Robert McClelland, a Rudd supporter, was dropped from the new Cabinet, the report said.Carr, who has been out of public life for six years, said Gillard made him an offer he could not refuse.''You don't choose the moment; very often the moment chooses you,'' he said.Carr, praising his predecessor, said he would seek Rudd's advice, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.Rudd said Carr is an "excellent choice" and regards him as a good friend.Three other ministers who had supported Rudd survived the reshuffle and retained their jobs.

HARBIN, China, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- A ramp on a 9-month-old bridge in China collapsed Friday, sending four trucks crashing to the ground 100 feet below and killing three people, authorities said.Five people were hospitalized with injuries, the Xinhua News Agency reported.It was at least the sixth major bridge collapse in China since July of last year. The collapses have been blamed on shoddy construction and overloading, the report said.The bridge ramp collapsed in Harbin city, capital of Heilongjiang province. In an unrelated incident in the same province, two passenger trains collided at a railway station Thursday, injuring at least 24 people.The ramp, joining the Yangmingtan Bridge, tilted to one side and crashed to the ground about 5:30 am, the deputy head of the Harbin city construction committee said.Photographs showed the crashed trucks turned upside down and the collapsed ramp resting almost perpendicular to the ground.Xinhua said the 9.5-mile long, eight-lane bridge spanning the Songhua River and described as the longest bridge in north China was opened to traffic in November.

| License Photo	Jan. 22 (UPI) -- An intriguing tidbit came through the Apple rumor mill hinting at additions to the iPhone technology that would introduce biosecurity to the device for mobile payment.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Sercurities, told Apple Insider that the latest innovation in the next generation of iPhones could be a fingerprint censor under the home button, allowing for extra security in a way that its competition will struggle to replicate.The sensor would pave the way for Apple to integrate Near Field Communication--technology often used in "digital wallet" applications--by using fingerprint recognition for increased transaction security.Fingerprint recognition could also eliminated the need for usernames and passwords, streamlining the user interface. The fingerprint sensor would be integrated into the home button, fitting with Apple's devotion to sleek, minimalist design. Competitor's phones such as those that run Android and Windows, with more than one button below the display, could struggle to make fingerprint scanning intuitive, Kuo said.Apple's 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec, which has developed a "Smart Sensor," was a big clue into Apple's plans for the fingerprinting technology. And though Apple typically refuses to confirm its plans, Kuo has a proven track record: he successfully predicted the company's entire third quarter lineup last year.

Sofia Carmina Coppola (born May 14, 1971) is an American screen-writer, film director, actress, and producer. In 2003 she became the third woman (and the first American woman) to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing, for Lost in Translation, and in 2010 with Somewhere, she became the first American woman (and fourth American filmmaker) to win the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival.
Coppola was born in New York City, New York, the youngest child and only daughter of set decorator/artist Eleanor Coppola (née Neil) and director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather and Apocalypse Now), granddaughter of the composer Carmine Coppola, sister of Roman Coppola and Giancarlo Coppola, niece of her father's siblings August Coppola and Talia Shire, and a cousin of Nicolas Cage, Jason Schwartzman and Robert Carmine. She attended high school at St. Helena High School and graduated class of 1990. She later went to Mills College and the California Institute of the Arts, and interned with Chanel when she was fifteen years old. After graduating, Coppola started a clothing line called Milkfed that is sold exclusively in Japan.
Coppola's acting career, frequently described as based largely upon nepotism, began as an infant, making background appearances in seven of her father's films. The most well-known of these early roles is her appearance in The Godfather as the baby boy in the christening scene. She is also seen in her father's film The Outsiders in a scene where Matt Dillon, Tommy Howell, and Ralph Macchio are eating at a Dairy Queen before the famous burning church scene.
