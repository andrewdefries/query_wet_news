YOKOHAMA, Japan, Aug. 26 (UPI) -- The General Assembly of the World Psychiatric Association voted Monday to send an international delegation of psychiatrists to China to investigate that government's alleged abuses of psychiatric diagnoses in its ongoing suppression of the Falun Gong sect."We have to do this as soon as possible. Over 500 complaints of abuse in Falun Gong-related cases have been submitted to our Committee for the Review of Abuse of Psychiatry," Dr. Juan Jose Lopez-Ibor, outgoing president of the association and director of psychiatry at the World Health Organization's collaborative center at San Carlos Hospital in Madrid, told United Press International. "We need to create a protocol for our investigation within China, and we need the cooperation of the Chinese government in enacting what we regard as a professional and ethical imperative," he said."All of the members of the Chinese Society of Psychiatry at the assembly this evening gave their support to this action," Lopez-Ibor added.The World Psychiatric Association is composed of 119 affiliated national associations. The group is gathering this week in Yokohama for its 12th triennial World Congress of Psychiatry, the first held in Asia. The executive commitee of the organization will select the members of the investigative team. "Up to this point, we have had good cooperatioin with the Chinese," Dr. Marion Kastrup, outgoing chairman of the Committee for the Review of Abuse of Psychiatry and director of the Institute for Trans-Cultural Psychiatry in Copenhagen, told UPI. "On several occasions we have talked with representatives of the Chinese Society of Psychiatry about abuse claims, and they have, up until now, been very cooperative," Kastrup said. "But we need to get into the country and study these claims. We have to look at files and talk with persons. We must obtain entry to China and permission to study whatever we need to study." Kastrup added the WPA already has held preliminary discussions with Chinese officials "in anticipation of the decision we made tonight -- and they have been positive talks."The association leadership wants to send investigators into China no later than early next spring. They also want to finalize the report by May 2003, before the annual meetings of the American Psychiatric Association and the U.K. Royal College of Psychiatry, two organizations that have pressed for an investigation of alleged Chinese abuses.As part of the Chinese government's campaign since 1999 to discredit Falun Gong, official Chinese media have promoted the idea that the movement's adherants are mentally disturbed and in need of psychiatric treatment. Hundreds of Falun Gong members have been hospitalized by force and medicated, according to reports from the movement itself and from human rights organizations. "Now we need the 'green light' from the Chinese government to come in," said Lopez-Ibor. "And the world will be watching," Kastrup added.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Giving the Taliban diplomatic influence is a much-needed step in political reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan, a U.S. foreign policy expert said.A report last week from The Times of London claimed Washington supported a plan for the Taliban to open an official political office in Qatar. The plan, the newspaper said, coincides with efforts to start formal peace talks with the former leaders of Afghanistan.Xenia Dormandy, a U.S. foreign policy expect at Chatham House, said that while a diplomatic presence for the Taliban wasn't a "final solution" to Afghanistan's political woes, it was a "necessary step," German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports."Some kind of legalized office where Taliban representatives can function is a prerequisite to talks getting anywhere," added Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.GALLERY: The War in Afghanistan Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, stressed that any efforts to reach out to certain members of the Taliban was an Afghan initiative."The U.S. has certain red lines," she added.The U.N. Security Council in June voted to split sanctions imposed on al-Qaida and Taliban members. The process is seen as part of an effort to clear moderate elements of the Taliban for reintegration into political life in Afghanistan.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UPI) -- The National Science Foundation says the three major risk factors for mass shootings are exposure to violent media, mental health and access to guns.The 41-page NSF report, titled "Youth Violence: What We Need To Know," was released Thursday by U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., and will be discussed by the House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee later this spring, Wolf said in a release.Wolf requested the report following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.The report drew on "reliable evidence and a stable of theories to explain youth violence that have emerged from decades of research, including research supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Research Council and other federal agencies."One study the report cited suggested there may be a link between mental health issues and the consumption of violent media, which includes video games."We have found that depressed and hopeless youth migrate toward gaming and Internet activity in general," the author wrote. "There is already some suggestive evidence that online violent gaming is associated with cyberbullying. This may increase the exchange of rejecting messages, thereby further exacerbating hostile feelings among suicidal youth."Wolf said he had hoped President Barack Obama would have addressed the causes of mass shootings during Tuesday's State of the Union Address, but was disappointed when he only discussed gun control."To only focus on one piece of a large and complicated puzzle is irresponsible," Wolf said."While I recognize the potential constitutional issues involved in tackling media violence, mental health parity and gun control, I am disappointed that mental health issues and media violence were left out of the president's address," Wolf said."The president said that the victims of mass shootings, including Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, the college students at Virginia Tech, the children at Sandy Hook, the high school students at Columbine, and the movie-goers in Aurora all deserve a vote for gun control proposals. How can he in good conscience call for that, but not acknowledge the fact that each one of the shooters in those events was mentally disturbed? How could he not acknowledge the role that violent media played in some of their lives?"The president has failed the American people and the families of the victims by remaining frustratingly silent on these crucial issues and ignoring the other central factors related to mass violence of this kind."
