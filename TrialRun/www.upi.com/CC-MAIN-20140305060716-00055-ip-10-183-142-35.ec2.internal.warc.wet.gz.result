TOKYO, Dec. 20 (UPI) -- Japan's central bank, maintaining its earlier economic assessment of moderate recovery, Friday made no change in its 9-month-old liberal monetary easing policy.The Bank of Japan on its website said its nine-member board after its monetary policy meeting unanimously decided to continue with its market operations to increase the monetary base at an annual pace of about 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen.The monetary easing policy began in April of this year, calling for doubling the monetary base and boosting purchases of government bonds. The effort is to lift the country's economy out of its 15 years of deflation and achieve a 2 percent inflation rate in two years."The Bank will continue with quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner."The bank also said: "Japan's economy has been recovering moderately," and that overseas economies as a whole were also picking up moderately.As a result, both Japan's exports and business fixed investments aided by hither corporate profits also have also been rising."Public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has also increased," the bank said.Japan's private consumption has remained resilient, with improvement in the employment and income situation, it said.The bank said the current inflation is around 1 percent, adding "inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole."In its outlook, the BOJ said Japan's economy is expected to "continue a moderate recovery as a trend, while it will be affected by the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the consumption tax hike."Japan's sales tax will go up to 8 percent starting April from 5 percent currently as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government prepares to check the soaring public debt.

| License Photo	ATLANTA, May 8 (UPI) -- TNT said it has ordered 10 episodes of the new U.S. action-drama series "The Last Ship," starring Eric Dane and produced by Michael Bay. The small-screen adaptation of William Brinkley's popular novel is to air on the cable network in 2014. "The story opens with a global catastrophe that nearly decimates the world's population. Because of its positioning, the Navy destroyer U.S.S. Nathan James avoids falling victim to the devastating tragedy," said a synopsis released Tuesday. "But now the crew and its captain must confront the reality of their new existence in a world where they may be among the few remaining survivors."Dane will play Captain Tom Chandler, a career Navy man who is described as "authoritative and decisive, but also fair and courageous." Rhona Mitra and Adam Baldwin co-star in the series."'The Last Ship' has all the elements of a big Hollywood blockbuster, from its epic storytelling to its top-notch cast headed by the perfect leading man, Eric Dane," Michael Wright, president and head of programming for TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies, said in a statement. "Michael Bay and his fellow executive producers have shaped William Brinkley's story and characters into an exceptional drama full of action, suspense, tragedy and triumph. 'The Last Ship' is smart, fun television that takes you on a great ride."

July 22 (UPI) -- Heather Barnes, a marine biology student at New College in Florida, got stranded at sea while on a school trip to Honduras.Barnes, 20, says she went to collect coral samples around 4 a.m. on Friday, and after she began cramping, was pushed out to sea.She says she knew they were supposed to always swim with a buddy, and that she had "for the first couple weeks," but thought the small bay was calm enough to snorkel alone.Barnes was stranded for 16 hours, mostly spent treading water as the sun beat down on her face and jellyfish swarmed around her legs."Even when I didn't feel like I was strong enough," Barnes said, her legs were able to just keep going. "It didn't seem like a choice."Fellow students and school staff soon realized Barnes was missing, and organized a search. They also called on the help of Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Vern Buchanan, both of Florida, to reach out to the Honduran government. Barnes was eventually able to swim back to shore, where two people gave her water and used their kayak to take her back to where she was staying.Barnes is now back in Florida, where she is recovering from jellyfish stings and sunburn.

| License Photo	COLUMBIA, S.C., Aug. 11 (UPI) -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford should be impeached for allegedly not seeking the lowest airfares while conducting state business, a lawmaker says.Republican state Sen. David Thomas has accused Sanford of abusing his position of authority during two trips taken to London and China, charging $13,700 to the state could have been avoided if he had sought the most economical airfares as required by state law, CNN reported Tuesday. Sanford, 49, is already under fire for disappearing for nearly a week in June. The married governor eventually admitted he was visiting a mistress in Argentina."The two flights by Gov. Sanford were in violation of the South Carolina Code of Regulations," Thomas said in a letter to members of a legislative oversight committee. "The difference in price between the most economical and the more expensive price of the seats the governor chose is approximately $13,700."Thomas told CNN he thought the violations were enough to trigger impeachment proceedings.

MENLO PARK, Calif., Feb. 8 (UPI) -- A Facebook glitch redirected users visiting hundreds of websites to a cryptic error page, Web watchers say.Facebook users attempting to log into websites by way of their Facebook account during a period of less than 10 minutes Thursday found themselves automatically redirected to the error page, Mashable reported.Exiting the page or attempting to re-access the original site would lead to another redirect to the error page.Although the bug was short-lived, hundreds of websites were reportedly affected, including those of The Huffington Post, Kayak, Hulu and Pinterest."For a short period of time, there was a bug that redirected people logging in with Facebook from third-party sites," Facebook told Mashable in a statement. "The issue was quickly resolved and Login with Facebook is now working as usual."The problem demonstrated just how many important websites use Facebook Connect for user authentication, with Facebook logins being used by millions of people, Mashable said.

JOLIET, Ill., Feb. 18 (UPI) -- Some intense legal maneuvering could be on the horizon as a former suburban Chicago police officer tries to get his murder conviction overturned, lawyers said.Former Bolingbrook, Ill., police Sgt. Drew Peterson is petitioning for a new trial, telling Judge Edward Burmila his attorney, Joel Brodsky, botched his defense so badly it ended in his guilty verdict in the 2004 killing of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. Her death -- she drowned in a bath tub -- was initially ruled an accident until Peterson's fourth wife, Stacey, went missing. If Burmila allows Peterson to move forward with his incompetent defense argument, it could lead to Peterson taking the stand in his own defense for the first time. It could also lead to prosecutors being called as defense witnesses and Brodsky being called on the prosecution's behalf to defend his handling of the trial, the Chicago Sun-Times said Monday.The hearing date is set for Thursday. If Burmila denies Peterson's request, it clears the path for sentencing, the Sun-Times said.

OTTAWA, June 3 (UPI) -- About two dozen students visiting Ottawa from Toronto have become ill in what health officials say is a suspected norovirus outbreak.Paramedics responding to a call from the Quality Hotel in Ottawa's downtown area, where a group of 44 13- and 14-year-old students was staying, found about half the group had symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the Ottawa Citizen reported Friday.The affected students and some adults with symptoms were treated at the hotel for dehydration and nausea, but no one had been hospitalized by Friday afternoon, the newspaper said.An outbreak management team from Ottawa Public Health was dispatched to the hotel to collect stool samples for testing, the results of which are not expected until late Friday or Saturday.The ill students and adults have isolated themselves from the rest of the group, and there is little health risk to the public, Siobhan Kearns of Ottawa Public Health said.Instructions on how to thoroughly disinfect the rooms where the group is staying to prevent the virus from spreading have been provided to the hotel, the Citizen said.

Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy	April 10 (UPI) -- Jenna Bush Hager, currently expecting a child with her husband Henry Hager, was treated to a book-themed baby shower last week thrown by the women of the "Today" show. In a Wednesday morning appearance on the daily talk show, Bush Hager told hosts Willie Geist, Natalie Morales and Al Roker that the theme was inspired by her mother's role as a librarian, and her own experiences as a teacher and reading coordinator. Bush Hager, due in May, currently serves as Southern Living magazine's editor-at-large and a "Today" show contributor. People published photos of the party, which show Bush Hager receiving belly pats from Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kobt, a surprise appearance from Hager, and what looks like a tiered cake made of diapers. According to People, the "Today" show women gifted Bush Hager with their favorite children's books, including Katie Lee Gifford, who gave her "Party Animals," and Natalie Morales, who gave her "Goodnight Moon." The raciest literary contribution came from "Today" producer Jackie Levin, who presented Bush Hager with a copy of the erotic bestseller, "Fifty Shades of Grey." “That’s baby number two material!” Bush Hager quipped.
