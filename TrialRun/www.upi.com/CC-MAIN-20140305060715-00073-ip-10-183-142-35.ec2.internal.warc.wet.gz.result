STANLEY, Falkland Islands, Nov. 2 (UPI) -- The Falklands' bid to enter the big league of oil producers in the South Atlantic is drawing hedge funds to what promises to be a multibillion-dollar enterprise.The Falkland, a British Overseas Territory, has been challenged by Argentina every step of the way from prospecting to commercial exploitation of subsea crude oil and possibly natural gas.Argentina invaded the islands in 1982 but was repelled by Britain in a 74-day war that resulted in about 1,000 deaths.Argentina's ruling military, which launched the attack, formally surrendered to Britain but lost its grip on political power soon after. The country's switch to elected government led to a revival of Buenos Aires claims on the islands, which Argentina calls its own.Argentine claims have embittered diplomatic and trade ties between Britain and Argentina, Argentina and the Falklands and Argentina and any nation that trades with the British territory.Argentina routinely blacklists shipping to and from the Falklands but, notwithstanding its punitive measures, international investor interest in Falklands oil continues to grow.Falklands oil prospecting began under British umbrella, with most of early money drawn from London's alternative capital markets. Since last year, investor input has diversified, drawn North American and Asian interests under different guises and now appears poised for takeoff with hedge fund managers looking keen.As oil and gas prices still show resilience, investor appetite for new energy fields remains ravenous.Regulatory data indicated that hedge funds are buying unspecified stakes in the Falklands exploration program, operated mostly by firms based in Britain or quoted on London markets. The Falklands' own interests are spearheading moves to draw cash into the territory to speed the exploration and development process.The regulatory data showed Lansdowne Partners, Odey Asset Management and Blackfish Capital are among funds accumulating part ownership of ventures in the Falklands' growing energy sector.Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd., the territory's major energy company, has seen its equity value rise as the investors come in with more cash.The FOGL exploration program is supplemented by firms that until recently were struggling to find new investors. Borders and Southern, Desire Petroleum and Rockhopper Exploration are among key players in the changing investment landscape.France's EDF and U.S. Noble Energy earlier revealed their interest in developing the new oil and gas province despite its remoteness from both North America and Europe.Desire Petroleum, another Falklands operator, this week announced changes to its production licenses following approval from the Falklands government.Desire said its Production Licenses PL003, PL004 and PL005 will be grouped together with collective requirements for all three licenses. The licenses contain a successful extension, Sea Lion, and all other oil and gas discoveries.Desire Petroleum also said it relinquished production licenses PL006 and PL007 because of poor results from the exploration program in the area. "A mature source rock is unproven in this area, and the only significant prospectivity in the license areas was tested by the 25/5-1 well which encountered only gas shows."Desire Petroleum Chief Executive Officer Stephen Phipps thanked the Falklands government for the licensing review and reaffirmed commitment to continue exploring in the territory's South Atlantic waters.

NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 19 (UPI) -- A Norfolk, Va., city councilman blames restrictive aspects of the city's chicken ordinance for making Norfolk "the laughingstock of the chicken world."Councilman Tommy Smigiel said there has not been a single application for a chicken license since the city passed an ordinance in September allowing the fowl to be kept in the city, the (Norfolk) Virginian-Pilot reported Thursday.Smigiel blamed the lack of applications on the restrictive requirements of the law, which include a detailed property survey with drawings of the coop design, electrical power installed in the coops in compliance with building codes and a minimum size of 24 square feet, with 12 of those square feet dedicated to a ventilated indoor space with protection from weather."We've kind of become the laughingstock of the chicken world on Facebook," Smigiel said Tuesday. "I don't think that it was this council's intention to not have any citizens be eligible for chickens."Smigiel said the chicken ordinance is far more restrictive than those in neighboring communities."Some of that was through the guidance of the Health Department, who didn't really want this. I think that we really need to look at it," Smigiel said.Mayor Paul Fraim asked Smigiel to list specific issues with the ordinance and bring them before the council for consideration."Just the notion that we'd be the laughingstock of the chicken world," Fraim said. "I thought we had a model ordinance."

MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Aaron Rodgers' 335 yards and three touchdowns Sunday boosted the Green Bay Packers to a 33-27 win over upset-minded Minnesota.Rodgers completed 24-of-30 pass attempts, hooking up with Greg Jennings on a 79-yard scoring bomb less than a minute into the second half to put the Packers ahead for good at 20-17.He then found Jermichael Finley on a 2-yard scoring play only 3 1/2 minutes later after Randall Cobb had set up the TD with a 42-yard punt return.Jennings made seven grabs for 147 yards for the Packers (7-0), who remained the NFL's lone unbeaten team and are off to their best start since 1962.Rookie Christian Ponder, making his first start for the Vikings, kept the game close in the fourth quarter, rallying Minnesota (1-6) for 10 late points.Ponder found Michael Jenkins on a 72-yard gain on his first play from scrimmage, finishing 13-for-32 through the air for 219 yards with two TDs and two interceptions.

CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is back in Latin America building bridges with fellow oil producers Ecuador and Venezuela and populist governments in Cuba, Guatemala and Nicaragua.Ahmadinejad added Guatemala to his itinerary to take part in the inauguration of President-elect Otto Perez, a ceremony that will be attended by at least 11 other heads of Latin American and Caribbean states. Prince Felipe de Borbon, heir to the Spanish crown, is also to attend.Ahmadinejad last visited Latin America in 2009 and later was host to former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and numerous other senior officials from Central and South America.The Iranian visit is the second recent instance of Latin American governments' policies moving markedly away from Washington, after last year's support to Palestinian statehood and recognition of a future Palestinian state. Ahmadinejad's last visit to the region raised the specter of sweeping U.S. government sanctions on countries dealing with Iran. But such retaliation became difficult after Brazil joined the campaign to bring Iran to the conference table over its nuclear program. Iran initiated a wide range of trade finance and economic collaboration deals and is likely to pursue of the same during the coming visit.Brazil and Turkey are engaged in talks to cool temperatures between Iran and the West over the nuclear controversy.After the last visit, The Economist wrote: "The United States government stayed silent on the subject of President Ahmadinejad's visit to Brazil. But its annoyance at seeing the Iranian leader embraced so warmly in its backyard may be tempered by the thought that at least there is now a line of communication open, via Brasilia, to Tehran."U.S. President Barack Obama visited Brazil last March and is actively seeking a regeneration of diplomatic and trade ties with all of Latin America, including countries that are seen to be closer to Tehran than to Washington, in particular Venezuela.Iran is pursuing a similar aim. The official IRIB News Agency said, "The promotion of all-out cooperation with Latin American countries is among the top priorities of the Islamic Republic's foreign policy."Ahmadinejad will begin his visit in Venezuela, where he will meet Chavez, then fly to Managua to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Nicaraguan President Ariel Ortega following his recent re-election.Talks in Cuba and Ecuador will follow. Plans for Ahmadinejad's visit coincide with continuing tensions over Iranian actions in the strategic Persian Gulf oil waterway, the Strait of Hormuz.The Pentagon snubbed an Iranian warning not to return a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region, saying Washington will operate there as it has for decades.The U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier John C. Stennis will operate in the region to maintain security and stability, Pentagon spokesman George Little said after Iran's army commander in chief told Washington the carrier, which left the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz last week, shouldn't return.Roughly one-fifth of all the crude oil traded worldwide passes through the narrow strait.Iran's economy, battered by Western sanctions over its nuclear program -- which U.S. and European officials allege is to build nuclear weapons -- received another hit Saturday when Obama signed a bill that could penalize buyers of Iranian oil.Iran, the world's No. 3 energy exporter, relies on oil exports to finance as much as half its national budget.It also insists its nuclear goal is to generate electricity without dipping into its reserves of oil Iran would prefer to sell abroad and to provide fuel for medical reactors.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 (UPI) -- The field of female U.S. presidential contenders in 2016 would be wide open of Hillary Clinton does not throw her hat in the ring, Democratic Party leaders say.Clinton, the U.S. secretary of state, missed her first party convention since 1968 this week due to an official trip to Easy Timor. There has been widespread speculation at the convention and in the media that she might be a leading contender for the party's 2016 presidential nomination."It's hard to predict right now. There are women who are outstanding members of the Senate, outstanding members of the House," said former Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who was once a member of the Democratic leadership in the House.Elizabeth Warren could be a contender if she wins her high-profile U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts in November, Frost told The Hill.Other names being mentioned include Clinton's fellow Cabinet secretaries Janet Napolitano (Homeland Security) and Kathleen Sebelius (Health and Human Services). On Capitol Hill, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are possibilities, The Hill said.Clinton -- who will turn 70 a few weeks prior to the 2016 election -- has indicated she will not be back for another term as secretary of state should President Barack Obama be re-elected.Some of her supporters insist she still has the stamina to make a serious run at becoming the first female U.S. president.

| License Photo	MILWAUKEE, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- In his congressional race this year, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's victory margin was his smallest ever -- just 11.5 points ahead of his challenger, results show.Ryan's previous re-election campaigns were won with 63 percent to 68 percent of the vote, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. However, on Tuesday Ryan only received 55 percent of the vote.Ryan also lost his hometown of Janesville by 10 points -- the first time that has happened.The results from Election Night show the limited impact Ryan had on the Republican presidential ticket, the report said, as the Romney-Ryan ticket lost the battleground state of Wisconsin by 7 points.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 20 (UPI) -- A couple in San Francisco said they have written a check to the city for $105,000 to cover the costs of Batkid day, an event thrown for a child with leukemia.Philanthropists John and Marcia Goldman said they decided to pay the bill for the Nov. 15 party for 5-year-old leukemia patient Miles Scott after hearing the Make-A-Wish Foundation was raising money to help the city pay for the event, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday."When we read in your column how the Make-A-Wish Foundation was trying to raise the money to pay back the city for the setup and public safety costs surrounding the event, we thought, 'Wait a minute -- they shouldn't have to pay for such a good deed and such an amazing event,'" John Goldman told the newspaper.The donation was actually his wife's idea, Goldman said."We've supported Make-A-Wish for some time," Goldman said. "What a great way to celebrate something really amazing. It brought out the best in the city and showed it to the world."Make-A-Wish said it expected several hundred people to show up and turn part of San Francisco into Gotham for Miles, the Los Angeles Times reported.However, more than 14,000 came together for the event, increasing the cost of setup and public safety.Public officials, including congressmen and President Barack Obama issued congratulatory video statements to Miles."Way to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham," Obama said in his.

Wiki
Alan Wolf Arkin (born March 26, 1934) is an American actor, director, musician and singer. He is known for starring in such films as Wait Until Dark, The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Catch-22, The In-Laws, Edward Scissorhands, Glengarry Glen Ross, Marley & Me, and Little Miss Sunshine, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2007. He is the father of actors Adam Arkin, Anthony Arkin, and Matthew Arkin.
Arkin was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Beatrice (née Wortis), a teacher, and David I. Arkin, a painter and writer who mostly worked as a teacher. Arkin was raised in a Jewish family with "no emphasis on religion"; his maternal grandfather was an immigrant from Odessa, Ukraine. The family moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles when Arkin was 11 years old, but an eight-month Hollywood strike cost Arkin's father a set designer job he had wanted to take. During the 1950s Red Scare, Arkin's parents were accused of being Communists, which led to David losing his job when he refused to answer questions about his political affiliation. David challenged the dismissal and was ultimately vindicated, but only after his death.
Arkin has been married three times. He and Jeremy Yaffe, to whom he was married from 1955 to 1960, have two sons: Adam Arkin, born August 19, 1956, and Matthew Arkin, born in 1960. In 1967, Arkin had son Anthony (Tony) Dana Arkin with actress-screenwriter Barbara Dana (born 1940), to whom he was married from June 16, 1964 to the mid-1990s. In 1996, Arkin married a psychotherapist, Suzanne Newlander. As of 2007, they live in New Mexico.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Elizabeth Stamatina "Tina" Fey ( /ˈfeɪ/; born May 18, 1970) is an American actress, comedian, writer and producer, known for her work on the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live (SNL), the NBC comedy series 30 Rock, and films such as Mean Girls (2004), Baby Mama (2008), and Date Night (2010).
Fey first broke into comedy as a featured player in the Chicago-based improvisational comedy group The Second City. She later joined SNL as a writer, later becoming head writer and a performer, known for her position as co-anchor in the Weekend Update segment. In 2004 she adapted the screenplay Mean Girls in which she also co-starred.

In the series, Fey portrays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series. In 2008, she starred in the comedy film Baby Mama, alongside former SNL co-star Amy Poehler. Fey next appeared in the 2010 comedy films Date Night and Megamind.
She has received seven Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Writers Guild of America Awards. She was singled out as the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008 by the Associated Press, which gave her its AP Entertainer of the Year award for her satirical portrayal of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a guest appearance on SNL.
