ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 7 (UPI) -- Cities in Michigan will use $100 million in federal money to help eliminate housing blight, Gov. Rick Snyder said when announcing the Treasury Department funds.Snyder said Thursday the money -- part of funds Michigan received as part of an 18-state program -- is targeted for Detroit, Pontiac, Flint, Grand Rapids and Saginaw and marks a key expansion of anti-blight work, The Detroit News reported."We will be stabilizing neighborhoods with a large-scale demolition of the abandoned properties that foster crime and push down property values," Snyder said in a statement. "Getting rid of these properties will encourage more people to stay in their homes and be part of the effort to improve their neighborhoods."The Detroit News first reported the Treasury Department approved the novel proposal from Michigan to use $100 million in unused Troubled Asset Relief Program funds for a pilot demolition program. The $7.6 billion TARP program, known as the Hardest Hit Fund, targeted 18 states staggered by the housing crisis and economic downturn.Nationwide, about 28 percent of the aid has been spent so far, prompting calls from lawmakers to expand the money's use beyond mortgage assistance into areas such as blight reduction, the News said.The TARP program was designed to keep families in their homes. Treasury Department and Michigan state officials said expanding the program to anti-blight efforts furthers the goal."Members of our team have learned as we've dealt with the foreclosure crisis that there is a direct link between foreclosure and blight," Michigan's Housing Development director, Scott Woosley, said.

LAS VEGAS, June 28 (UPI) -- A tribute to dead bandmates became a family event of sorts in Las Vegas for Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison.After unveiling portraits of George Harrison and John Lennon, which will be on permanent display at the Mirage Hotel, the four watched the first-anniversary performance of "Love," the Cirque du Soleil production that explores Beatles' music, The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. The production had been Harrison's dying wish for one more creative collaboration from the Beatles.McCartney said he, Starr and Harrison were concerned about their music being exploited."It's like it was a great idea: Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles -- but what's the story?" he said. Ono said she wasn't certain what Lennon's reaction would have been until she saw the show for a second time."I thought maybe John would have been a little bit nervous about it," Ono said. "But (Tuesday), I finally felt that, OK, John would have been very happy with it.""Love" music co-producer Giles Martin created the soundtrack with his father, longtime Beatles producer George Martin. The younger Martin said changes have been made on basically a quarterly basis since the show opened.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, July 21 (UPI) -- Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, Manager Joe Torre and bench coach Bob Schaefer all received suspensions Wednesday.The discipline was handed down as a result of an incident in Tuesday's game between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, in which Kershaw was ejected after umpires concluded he intentionally threw at Giants outfielder Aaron Rowand in the seventh inning.Kershaw was given a five-game suspension and fined, but has filed an appeal. Torre and Schaefer were both suspended for one game and fined an undisclosed amount.The Dodgers lost Tuesday's game 7-5 after hitting coach Don Mattingly -- acting manager in Torre's absence -- was forced to remove closer Jonathan Broxton from the game due to a rule prohibiting making two visits to the mound in one trip out of the dugout.

NEW YORK, July 7 (UPI) -- Adam Jones pounded a go-ahead, two-run homer in the ninth inning Sunday, rallying the Baltimore Orioles over the New York Yankees 2-1.The Orioles had trailed 1-0 since the second inning as Yankees starter Hiroki Kuroda stifled them on three hits over seven shutout frames.But facing New York closer Mariano Rivera in the ninth, Nick Markakis singled with one out and Jones followed by belting a pitch into the left field stands for the decisive blow.Rivera (1-2) blew only his second save of the season, breaking a streak of 41 straight converted attempts at Yankee Stadium.Darren O'Day (5-0) was credited with the victory thanks to a scoreless eighth inning and Jim Johnson racked up his major league-best 30th save as the Orioles salvaged one game of a weekend series and snapped New York's six-game winning streak.Edwin Nunez drove in the Yankees' only run.

Analysis Home / Analysis / Outside View	/ Obama has little choice but to back Egyptian military	Obama has little choice but to back Egyptian military

| License Photo	COLLEGE PARK, Md., July 10 (UPI) -- In Egypt, the United States is once again confronted with a tough choice between backing the champions of the status quo ante -- a military-endorsed regime that resembles that of deposed President Hosni Mubarak -- or accepting an Islamic state.As much as anything else, Egyptian economics dictates that the forces for modernism and a genuinely inclusive democracy are simply too weak and disorganized to offer a viable third option.After World War II, Egypt pursued what economists call an import-substitution strategy. It sought to develop domestic industries -- through stiff tariffs, mercantilist regulations, subsidies, and state ownership -- to push out imports from Europe and the United States and cultivate exports. For example, it established a state-owned automobile company.As throughout Latin America and significant parts of Asia, this policy resulted in massive government borrowing and collapse in the sovereign debt crisis of the 1980s. Mubarak's government instigated notable reforms that engendered a more modern, market-oriented economy but the Egyptian economy remains hamstrung by considerable state involvement and a bloated, corrupt government sector.It does boast substantial food processing, textile, metals, petrochemical, tourism and light-manufacturing industries and has managed to university educate large numbers of youth.However, the legacy of protectionism, as almost everywhere else, is corruption, self-dealing and nepotism in government and business and not enough economic prosperity and democratic freedoms to satisfy the rising expectations of young, Western-looking Egyptians.The distribution of wealth and income are too uneven and many Egyptians are stuck in near poverty; not too dissimilar to many oil-dependent states in the region. The Mubarak and Morsi governments placated the poor and middle class with food and fuel subsidies but those require large government deficits and foreign aid to sustain.Within the Egyptian middle class are two opposing and important groups:On the one hand, are entrepreneurs and mandarins, who often exhibit remarkable thrift and political acuteness, know how to work the corrupt political system, establish businesses, staff the bureaucracy and prosper.On the other hand, is an idealistic and less enfranchised class, which was in the streets during the Arab Spring and brought down Mubarak's government. It has high-minded notions of political freedom and reform but it lacks the political skills to organize the urban workers and rural poor to accomplish an electoral majority. Nor could it run the country in the way that the more pious entrepreneurial and mandarin class has accomplished.The Muslim Brotherhood tapped into the disenfranchised poor to elect President Mohamed Morsi and its fundamentalist Islam poses a threat to both groups.The Saudis shrewdly see all this -- having similar tensions within their equally undemocratic society -- and along with a few other autocrats in the region, they throw their support behind the military coup.Interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi holds some promise as a reformer. A 77-year-old former finance minister, he is a liberal economist and committed to a more open Egyptian economy. However, he will likely prove hesitant to quickly move reforms that substantially lessen the privileges of the entrepreneurial class and self-dealing bureaucrats.To be sure, the military should step aside and encourage him to try but his biggest obstacle will be the entrenched bureaucracy. Their only wealth is control of a corrupt system of government regulations and largess that must be dismantled, and as they proved during the Morsi presidency, are quite adept at throwing sand, stones and boulders into the gears of government if provoked.If Beblawi or a similar successor fails at initiating substantial reforms, then the choice is really between a strong military that imposes order and limited democracy or an Islamic Republic.To the Obama administration's great discomfort, the advocates of an Islamic state won a majority that elected Morsi but are clearly more hostile to Western values and modernism than whatever the military imposes.That reality crystallizes why President Obama may ultimately have to come down squarely in support of the military, instead of the forces for a genuine democracy.--(Peter Morici is professor of international business at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and a widely published columnist.

| License Photo	SALEM, Ore., Jan. 24 (UPI) -- An Oregon lawmaker has proposed making it illegal to possess or distribute cigarettes without a doctor's prescription.The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mitch Greenlick of Portland classifies cigarettes as a Schedule III controlled substance, such as ketamine, lysergic acid and anabolic steroids, KPTV, Portland, reported Wednesday."The state Board of Pharmacy may adopt rules placing requirements and limitations on the sale or transfer of products containing nicotine," the bill states.Offenders of the bill would face maximum punishments of one year in prison, a $6,250 fine or both."I think it's pretty crazy," said Juan Silva of Salem. "I don't see it going through. It's going to be something to watch for, but I don't think it'll pass."

| License Photo	KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- Protests against Koran burning erupted for a second day in Afghanistan, turning deadly, despite apologies from the United States and NATO, officials said.The protests spread from Kabul to eastern Afghanistan as angry Afghans reacted to news of the burning of the Muslim sacred text at Bagram Air Base.Wednesday's demonstration came on the heels of protests Tuesday and rumors NATO personnel were preparing to dispose of more Korans.CNN reported at least five people died and others were injured in Wednesday's violence. Of those, one died in Kabul, the U.S. news network said. The other four died in Parwan province in police firing, CNN reported, quoting a provincial official.The report said at least 11 protesters were injured in Kabul and 10 more in eastern Nangarhar province.CNN said about 400 to 500 protesters burned tires and threw rocks outside Camp Phoenix near the Kabul International Airport.The U.S. Embassy in Kabul went into lockdown and all travel by staff was suspended, The New York Times reported."The embassy is on lockdown; all travel suspended. Please, everyone, be safe out there," an embassy Twitter post said.The report said NATO soldiers were keeping military vehicles off the streets in Kabul.In Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, protesters tried to break into the NATO base and later set fire to six fuel tankers in a nearby parking lot, the Times said.The protest in Kabul saw people shouting anti-American slogans and throwing stones at Afghan army vehicles.NATO Commander Gen. John Allen, in a recorded statement Tuesday, said the Koran burning was not intentional.Also on Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta joined General Allen in apologizing for the improper and inadvertent disposal of the religious items. White House spokesman Jay Carney called it a "deeply unfortunate incident," and "we apologize to the Afghan people and disapprove of such conduct in the strongest possible terms."The Times said Afghan President Hamid Karzai Wednesday condemned the Koran burning and announced an investigation.The Times said reports by witnesses at the burning and religious leaders who met with NATO officials at Bagram indicated some copies had been pulled from the flames before they were badly damaged.CNN, quoting a military official, said copies of the Koran and other religious materials apparently were removed from the library of a detainee center at Bagram on concerns inscriptions on them might be used for communication by extremists.The apologies came amid concern among NATO officials the protest could spread across the country, triggering violence.Allen's "sincere apologies" were conveyed to the Afghan government, its president and "most importantly, to the noble people of Afghanistan."Allen also ordered an investigation and asked every coalition soldier to complete a 10-day training course on "the proper handling of religious materials," the Times reported.

TRIPOLI, Libya, Jan. 25 (UPI) -- Libyan authorities said Saturday that four members of the Egyptian embassy's staff were kidnapped in Tripoli.The circumstances of the abduction reported by the state-run news agency LANA were murky but one of the victims was described as the Egyptian cultural attache.Libya has been on wobbly footing since Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown in 2011. Security has been a concern and kidnappings are on the rise.CNN said a South Korean trade official was taken from his car in the capital last weekend, but was rescued and his alleged kidnappers arrested.

Wiki
Barney Frank (born March 31, 1940) is the U.S. House Representative for Massachusetts's 4th congressional district, serving since 1981. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He won his first full term in 1980 and has been re-elected ever since by wide margins. In 1987, he became the second openly gay member of the House of Representatives. Frank has been described as one of the most prominent LGBT politicians in the United States. From 2007 to 2011, Frank served as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
Frank was born Barnett Frank to a Jewish family in Bayonne, New Jersey, one of four children of Sam and Elsie. Frank's father ran a Jersey City truck stop — a place Frank describes as "totally corrupt" — and served a year in prison, when Frank was 6 or 7, for refusing to testify to a grand jury against Frank's uncle. Frank was educated at Harvard College, where he resided in Matthews Hall his first year and then in Kirkland House and Winthrop House, graduating in 1962. Frank's undergraduate studies were interrupted by the death of his father, and Frank took a year off to help resolve the family's affairs prior to his graduation. He taught undergraduates at Harvard while studying for a Ph.D., but left in 1968 before completing the degree, to become Boston mayor Kevin White's Chief Assistant, a position he held for three years. He then served for a year as Administrative Assistant to Congressman Michael J. Harrington. Frank later graduated from Harvard Law School, in 1977, while serving as Massachusetts State Representative.
In 1972 Frank was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. Frank made a name for himself in the mid-1970s as a political defender of the Combat Zone, Boston's notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank's district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), Frank introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston's Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston's Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him having attempted to permit red light districts in all Bay State communities.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
