KHARTOUM, Sudan, June 6 (UPI) -- A delegation from the Sudanese petroleum sector is in Iraq to discuss the possibility of future oil cooperation, the Sudanese investment minister said.The Sudanese government said a team from the Petroleum Ministry was in Baghdad. Sudanese Investment Minister Mustafa Osman told reporters in Khartoum that Iraq was responding to Sudan's growing energy needs.The independent Sudan Tribune reports Sudan has struggled to satisfy local demand for oil since South Sudan became an independent country in 2011."There is now a technical team from the Sudanese petroleum ministry [in Iraq] to discuss technical issues of a deal in terms of volumes and payments," Osman was quoted as saying Tuesday.Sudan in May confirmed it was getting oil from South Sudan after government officials agreed in April to resume bilateral cooperation.South Sudan gained control of most of the region's oil reserves when it gained independence. Sudan, however, controls the export infrastructure.The Sudanese government last year enacted strict austerity measures to cope with the decline in oil revenue.

LOS ANGELES, May 26 (UPI) -- U.S. actor Charlie Sheen is being billed by his birth name, Carlos Estevez, in the upcoming film "Machete Kills," directed by Robert Rodriguez.A screen grab of the intro to the film, due in theaters Sept. 13, shows a red and black portrait of the former "Two and a Half Men" star posing with a gun with the words "And introducing Carlos Estevez," the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.Sheen, 47, plays a U.S. president who hires assassin Machete Cortez, played by Daniel Trejo, to "battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space," IMDB.com said.Sofia Vergara, Mel Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez, Antonio Banderas, Jessica Alba, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lady Gaga, Vanessa Hudgens, Amber Heard and Demian Bichir are set to appear in the film, the Times said.It is unclear why Sheen chose to use his birth name for the first time. The more dramatic role is a departure from his usual comedic characters, the Times said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 (UPI) -- Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday demanded the Senate pass a trillion-dollar U.S. government funding bill before voting to extend the payroll tax cut.The move by McConnell, R-Ky., prevented the Senate from voting on the GOP plan to extend the payroll tax cut, which passed the House Tuesday.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said earlier the payroll tax bill, crafted by House Republicans, "is dead on arrival in the Senate."Democrats have withheld support for the omnibus spending bill in the hopes of getting House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to agree to changes in the payroll tax bill, Politico reported."There's agreement on the funding bill, but no agreement and no plan at all about how we're going to pass the payroll tax cut extension," McConnell said Wednesday during a heated exchange with Reid. "We ought to finish our most immediate concern first.""As soon as we put this useless partisan charade behind us, we can negotiate a solution that protects middle-class workers," Reid said.White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer issued a statement Wednesday saying President Barack Obama "continues to have significant concerns about a number of provisions that have been reported to be in the Republican agreement on the omnibus.""This includes provisions that would undermine Wall Street reforms, enact extreme social and ideological riders, undercut environmental protections, and threaten the foreign policy prerogatives of the president," Pfeiffer said. "Given the magnitude of the legislation -- providing over $1 trillion dollars in funding -- coupled with the unresolved payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance extension, Congress should pass a short-term continuing resolution as it has seven times already this year so that all parties have an appropriate opportunity to consider and complete all of the critical budget and economic issues necessary to finish our responsibilities for the year."The House voted 234-to-193 Tuesday to pass the Republican payroll tax-cut extension. The plan links the extension to a host of other measures -- including a provision to speed up a decision by the Obama administration on building the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline system to transport synthetic crude oil and diluted asphalt, tar and other road- and roof-surfacing materials to the Gulf Coast from Alberta, Canada -- a project the White House has sought to delay.It includes provisions to roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules limiting toxic air pollutants from commercial and industrial boilers, and ban the EPA from proposing a new standard in the near future. It would extend unemployment insurance but cut the maximum unemployment coverage to 59 weeks from the current 99 weeks by mid-2012. And it would prevent a 27 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors next year -- instead, increasing their Medicare payments 1 percent each of the next two years.The plan seeks to pay for the extended tax cut and added unemployment benefits by cutting back on social-program benefits, selling federal assets, freezing federal employees' pay through 2015 and cutting the number of federal workers by about 10 percent through attrition.The vote on the bill generally followed party lines, but 14 Republicans voted against it and 10 Democrats voted for it -- each defying the wishes of their party leadership.Reid said Tuesday the bill was "a pointless partisan exercise.""The bill is dead on arrival in the Senate," he said. "It was dead before it got to the Senate."McConnell said Reid and other Democrats were siding with environmentalists over "job creators.""It's time for the Unites States Senate to act, and they're going to act, because we can sit here and stare at each other in the face for as long as it takes, but they are going to act," The Hill reported Boehner said Wednesday.A Senate rejection would set the stage for House and Senate compromise negotiations that were likely to continue into the weekend, aides said.President Barack Obama said last week he would reject any effort to tie the oil pipeline to the payroll tax cut.In its veto threat Tuesday, the White House said House Republicans were protecting tax breaks for the wealthy and injecting "ideological issues into what should be a simple debate about cutting taxes for the middle class."

LOS ANGELES, May 1 (UPI) -- Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger argued for immigration reform at a Los Angeles forum, using his own story as an example. Schwarzenegger said he was a typical immigrant, a young Austrian with dreams that could only be achieved in the United States, the Los Angeles Times reported. He hosted an event Tuesday at the University of Southern California's Arnold Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. "These are all very hardworking people. They have a dream. They want to make their dream a reality," he said of the 11 million illegal immigrants now believed to be in the United States.The speakers included Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who were both in the Gang of Eight who drafted an immigration reform bill, and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the son of a Mexican immigrant. Villaraigosa said providing a path to citizenship for illegal residents will help his city's economy because many of them own small businesses. Bennet said the bill needs as many votes as possible in the Senate to increase support in the House. "I really worry that if we don't get this done now, it's going to be a very long time before we get this done, and it'll be one more self-inflicted wound holding American workers back," he said.

ALGIERS, Algeria, Feb. 3 (UPI) -- A band of Islamic militants who seized a remote Algerian natural gas plant were bent on destroying the facility, survivors said.Employees who escaped last month's siege told The New York Times their captors were adamant about re-starting the desert processing plant and using the volatile fuel in the system to blow up the entire plant and create a fireball that would kill everyone in the complex."They pushed me very hard to restart the plant," said plant executive Lotfi Benadouda. "Their objective was to move the hostages to the plant. They wanted to get to the factory with the hostages, and explode it."Benadouda was senior enough to be considered the man in charge of the plant by the militants, The Times said. He and his colleagues did their best to stall the invaders in early hours of what became a siege that lasted nearly a week."We gave them vehicles and food, but we didn't restart the plant," Mr. Benadouda said.The Times said the takeover was ended by Algerian forces when the militants loaded all of the foreign hostages into five trucks wired with explosives. New information from Algerian officials indicated at least three of the trucks were blown up by the militants, not by inadvertent fire from the Algerian troops.Nearly 40 foreign hostages and 29 kidnappers were killed in the assault along with an unspecified number of Algerians.The odds of the militants actually blowing up the plant were debatable. Witnesses indicated the attackers were not entirely sure how the plant was laid out, and industry experts said it would be difficult to ignite escaping gas unless it was inside a closed space where it would not dissipate.

| License Photo	May 13 (UPI) -- Is Chris Brown being unneighborly?The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that resident complaints prompted the city of Los Angeles to fine the 24-year-old singer for the art adorning outdoor walls of his Hollywood Hills home. The art portrays grinning goblin faces which can be seen from the sidewalk. "There are lots of babies, lots of children, and they're literally frightened. It's like devils on the wall — big, scary eyes and big, scary teeth, and just the whole vibe is not what we're used to," Hollywood Dell Civic Association President Patti Negri said. According to Billboard.com, city ordinances prohibit most murals on private property. Brown took to Twitter to defend the paintings, saying that his neighbors to "keep [their kids] inside." "It's art. There are scarier creatures on Harry potter. Get a f***ing life!" Brown said. "Lords of dogtown"is how I live my life. #Free ima paint until my hands fall off.— Chris Brown(@chrisbrown) May 12, 2013
Mark Geragos, Brown's attorney, accused the singer's neighbors of "trying to suspend the First Amendment." "I'm scared of neighborhood busybodies like this," he said. "They've called animal control. They have sicced parking [enforcement] on [Brown], and now they reached the heights of ridiculousness here. Shame on them."Brown's art projects seem to be as important to him as his music career. He often shares photos of his paintings and murals on Instagram and Twitter, and recently worked with street artist Slick to raise money for Best Buddies International Foundation. painting for Best Buddies charity today in Miami :) twitter.com/IamPorshay/sta…”— Chris Brown(@chrisbrown) March 28, 2013

Wiki
Wayne Alphonso Brady (born June 2, 1972) is an Emmy Award winning actor, singer, comedian and television personality, known for his work as a regular on the American version of the improvisational comedy television series Whose Line Is It Anyway?, and as the host of the daytime talk show The Wayne Brady Show. He was the original host of FOX's Don't Forget the Lyrics!, and currently hosts the 2009 revival of Let's Make a Deal.
Brady was born in Columbus, Georgia to West Indian parents, and moved to Orlando, Florida as a young child to live with his grandmother and aunt. When Brady talks about his "Mom," he is referring to his grandmother Valerie Petersen, who raised him. He attended Dr. Phillips High School, in Orlando, Florida, where he graduated in 1989. In 1990, he began enrollment at the University of Miami, where he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. At 16, he started performing in community theater and at the Orlando improv troupe SAK Comedy Lab where he first started developing his improv skills. He moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1996, where he continued developing his acting skills.
Brady's career began as one of the improvisational theater performers in the original (British) version of Whose Line Is It Anyway?, along with Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and host Clive Anderson in 1998 when the last season was filmed in Hollywood, after which he became a regular on the American version, hosted by Drew Carey, which was his first Stateside television exposure. In 2003, Brady won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Series for his work on the show, the only person to win the award for a television series, as opposed to a special, since Dana Carvey in 1993.
