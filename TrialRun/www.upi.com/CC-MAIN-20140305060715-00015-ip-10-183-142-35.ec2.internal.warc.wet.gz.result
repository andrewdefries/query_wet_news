WASHINGTON, April 19 (UPI) -- An environmental group accused U.S. lawmakers of grandstanding on the Keystone XL pipeline, though a congressional leader said energy security is at stake.The U.S. House of Representatives, by a vote of 293-127, passed a transportation funding bill that includes a rider on the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline. The measure would remove presidential authority over the pipeline.The White House needs to give its consent to Keystone XL because it crosses the U.S. border with Canada.Jeremy Symons, a senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation, criticized the politicking over the project."House leaders are grandstanding on the Keystone pipeline once again for their oil company allies but this effort to take the decision out of the hands of safety regulators should die in conference," he said in a statement.U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said U.S. energy security is at stake."As these gas prices continue to go up, Americans understand supply and demand. 800,000 barrels a day that we can get from our friends, the Canadians," he said during floor debate. "And if we don't do so, where is it going to go? China."U.S. President Barack Obama, who rejected a similar Republican effort in January, has threatened to veto the bill.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 20 (UPI) -- AARP says it endorses the Medicare Drug Savings Act of 2013, which requires drug manufacturers to provide rebates for Medicare Part D for low-income seniors. Joyce Rogers, AARP's senior vice president for government affairs, said the legislation requires prescription drug manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs provided to Medicare Part D low-income subsidy beneficiaries, including those who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid."Medicare Part D benefit costs are projected to grow at an average annual rate of almost 10 percent through 2021, significantly faster than GDP. Unlike Medicare Part A, which is financed primarily through payroll taxes, Medicare Part D is funded through a combination of premiums and general revenue," Rogers wrote in the letter. "As Part D spending increases, so does the cost burden shouldered by enrollees and taxpayers. The Medicare Drug Savings Act would provide a significant financial benefit to the Part D program."AARP understands the important need to spend Medicare dollars wisely and to reduce the nation's spending on healthcare generally, Rogers said. However, AARP wants to ensure that Congress does not simply ask seniors to pay more or enact harmful cuts to Medicare benefits. Consequently, AARP is encouraged by the legislation, which instead focuses on constructively reducing costs, saving as much as $141 billion over the next 10 years without negatively impacting Medicare Part D benefits, the letter said.

FORKS TOWNSHIP, Pa., Sept. 6 (UPI) -- A Pennsylvania man who homeschools his children said he paid his $7,143 school tax in $1 bills to protest funding public education.Rob Fernandes videotaped himself delivering the 7,143 $1 bills, along with 54 cents change, to the Forks Township municipal building and explaining his reasoning to tax collector Anne Bennett-Morse, Philly.com reported Friday."I'm not doing this to make anybody's life more difficult," Fernandes can be seen telling Bennett-Morse in the video.Fernandes said he sees the money taken for school taxes as "stolen.""We homeschool our kids, so we don't even use the public school system, yet I'm being forced to pay all this money into a public school system that I don't use, don't want, don't need. And I don't think that's really either fair, just or even ethical," he said."It would be the equivalent if McDonald's were to force vegetarians to pay for their cheeseburgers," he said."I'm a big proponent of education," he said, adding that "education can be provided more efficiently in a free market."

ALGIERS, Algeria, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- The Algerian government is moving closer to supporting an African-led intervention in Mali to wipe out extremist influence, a U.S. official said.The U.S. State Department reported Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights Maria Otero arrived Monday in Mali.She is to "discuss political and civilian security issues -- including the conflict in northern Mali -- refugee and migration issues, food security, human rights, trafficking in persons and combating terrorism," the State Department said.U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Algeria pressing the issue as support grows for a neutral force envisioned by members of the Economic Community of West African States."They're (Algeria) beginning to warm to the idea, to talk through how it might work," a State Department official told The Washington Post on condition of anonymity.Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department, has said that Washington was looking into ways to support the ECOWAS mission and political evolution in Mali.Some militants with ties to al-Qaida claimed autonomy for northern Mali following a coup early this year. U.N. officials have said they suspected northern militants were committing atrocities.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 1 (UPI) -- The European Union said this week it will "watch closely" as political events in Ukraine unfold following parliamentary elections labeled unfair by observers.Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ruling Party of Regions claimed victory after the weekend balloting, in which his slate of candidates was ahead with about 30 percent of the vote with counting nearly complete.An observer mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the elections were carried out on a tilted playing field that featured "abuse of administrative resources" as well as "a lack of transparency in campaign and party financing" and unbalanced media coverage.EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Catherine Ashton and Stefan Fule, commissioner for EU enlargement, Tuesday issued a statement acknowledging reports of electoral abuse and warning subsequent developments in Ukraine would be monitored closely."We take full note of the International Observation Mission's preliminary findings on the conduct of the elections -- which present a mixed picture with several shortcomings -- and of the difficulties faced by the local electoral observers," they said."The final assessment will also depend on post-electoral developments, which we will watch closely," including the "tabulation of results and following up on possible electoral complaints."The Party of Regions has come under criticism from Brussels for the jailing of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is serving a 7-year prison sentence after a conviction on corruption charges and watched the elections from jail after not being allowed to run for her Fatherland Party.Tymoshenko said she won't recognize the election results and has launched a hunger strike in protest.OSCE observers said the absences of Tymoshenko and fellow jailed opposition figure Yuriy Lutsenko "negatively affected the election process."That process was also unduly influenced by "powerful economic groups" who took advantage of "a lack of diversity in media ownership" and poor transparency in campaign and party financing, they said.Ashton and Fule cited their "regret" that the prison terms, which came as the result of "trials that did not respect international standards," had prevented a fairer vote and urged Ukraine to "take further steps to reform the judiciary to avoid their recurrence."The elections featured high turnout and were conducted peacefully, but the vote tabulation process wasn't clearly visible in many cases, the European observers said."Ukrainians deserved better from these elections," Andreas Gross, head of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe delegation, said in a statement. "The 'oligarchization' of the whole process meant that citizens lost their ownership of the election, as well as their trust in it."Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov brushed off Western criticism and cited the findings of election observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian-led organization of post-Soviet nations."To claim that the elections were undemocratic, non-transparent -- it's like black and white," the premier said Tuesday. "I met with the (CIS) observers ahead of the elections, and I said we accept and consider all absolutely objective conclusions, but we don't accept biased assessments of our elections."Azarov noted the CIS leaders stated that, in their opinion, elections in all of Ukraine's regions were "held in an organized way, transparent and (with) high activity of voters."Complaints were "considered promptly and substantially," he said.

| License Photo	CHARLESTON, W.Va., Jan. 11 (UPI) -- Jay Rockefeller, who arrived in West Virginia almost 50 years ago as a VISTA volunteer, announced Friday he will not run for a sixth term in the U.S. Senate.Rockefeller, 75, served for eight years as governor of the state before winning a Senate seat in 1984. He was the first member of his family to run for public office as a Democrat."I'm going to serve out my term," Rockefeller said in an interview with Politico. "It was a very hard decision for me. Once it's made, like any hard decision, it eases up. But it was a very tough decision for me."His decision means the seat will be up for grabs in 2014 with a Republican candidate having a good chance of winning it, the report said.Rockefeller said fear of losing the next election was not a factor in his decision.Rockefeller, great-grandson and namesake of oil baron John D. Rockefeller, moved to West Virginia in 1964 to work for the domestic equivalent of the Peace Corps. At the time, his uncle, Nelson Rockefeller, was the Republican governor of New York. Another uncle, Winthrop Rockefeller, was elected governor of Arkansas in 1966. After losing a race for governor in 1972, Rockefeller won four years later. Rockefeller told Politico one of his biggest mistakes was his 2003 vote in favor of the invasion of Iraq. His proudest achievements, he said, include the 1992 Coal Act, which provided health benefits for retired miners, and an expansion of Medicaid to cover more poor children.

| License Photo	VATICAN CITY, April 16 (UPI) -- Pope Benedict XVI accepted greetings on his 85th birthday Monday, and said he is inspired to go on by "the light of God." The Vatican has encouraged followers to send birthday wishes by e-mail and is denying speculation the pope's apparent frailty might lead to his resignation, the ANSA news agency reported Monday."I find myself in the last stretch of the course of my life and I do not know what awaits me," the pope said in a statement. "I do know, however, that there is the light of God, and that He is risen.""The Church is celebrating with joy as birthday greetings arrive from all over the world. The pope is leading us with great strength, kindness and faith, and therefore he is a gift from God," Federico Lombardi of the Holy See's Press Office told Vatican radio.The birthday comes three days before the seventh anniversary of Benedict XVI's election to replace John Paul II.

Jan. 16 (UPI) -- On the morning of the Sandy Hook massacre, retired psychologist Gene Rosen found six first-graders and a school bus driver in front of his Newtown home. They told him they had run away from the school because someone had killed their teacher, 27-year-old Victoria Soto. Rosen, who gave a series of emotional interviews in the days following the shooting, invited the terrified children into his home for food and juice while they waited for their parents. "I comforted them because I'm a grandfather," the 69-year-old Rosen told "Today" a few days later.Rosen is now a prime target of a group of people dubbed the Sandy Hook Truthers -- conspiracy theorists who believe the Sandy Hook shooting is part of some kind of media or government cover-up, or a ploy to enact stricter gun control laws. “I don’t know what to do,” Rosen told Salon. “I’m getting hang-up calls, I’m getting some calls, I’m getting emails with, not direct threats, but accusations that I’m lying, that I’m a crisis actor, ‘how much am I being paid?’” “The quantity of the material is overwhelming,” Rosen said of the rumors flooding the Internet. “There must be some way to morally shame these people, because there were 20 dead children lying an eighth of a mile from my window all night long." Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyThe Sandy Hook Truther movement has gathered steam in recent weeks. Gawker points to a 30-minute video, "The Sandy Hook Shooting - Fully Exposed," which summarizes most of the conspiracies circulating the Internet. Posted January 7, the video now boasts more than 8.5 million views. "When Sandy Hook first happened i just had a feeling like it was all too perfect," the man behind the video explained to Gawker. "I just had this feeling deep down that these people and the whole town had this artificial vibe about them."One of the Truthers' seemingly more mainstream voices is Florida Atlantic University communications professor James Tracy, who wrote in a blog post: "The public’s general acceptance of the event’s validity and faith in its resolution suggests a deepened credulousness borne from a world where almost all news and information is electronically mediated and controlled." The condition is reinforced through the corporate media’s unwillingness to push hard questions vis-à-vis Connecticut and federal authorities who together bottlenecked information while invoking prior restraint through threats of prosecutorial action against journalists and the broader citizenry seeking to interpret the event on social media.FAU distanced itself from Tracy saying, "James Tracy does not speak for the university. The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with FAU in any way."

(UPI) -- A 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Japan Friday afternoon, prompting authorities to issue a tsunami warning.The quake, 200 miles off the coast of Fukushima prefecture, is not likely to cause a catastrophic tsunami, but might affect the stricken nuclear plant that was severely damaged in March 2011 in another trembler and subsequent tsunami."Earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a hundred kilometers of the earthquake epicenter," the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. "Authorities in the region of the epicenter should be aware of this possibly and take appropriate action."

Jan. 9 (UPI) -- An explosion at the Mitsubishi Materials chemical plant in Yokkaichi, Japan on Thursday killed five people and injured at least 12.The Mie Prefecture Police Department reported that the explosion occurred during a maintenance and cleaning operation at the chemical plant. According to Mitsubishi Materials, a heat exchanger exploded outside one of its facilities while it was being cleaned by approximately 20 workers and supervisors. The company speculated that the explosion could have been caused when a chemical agent inside the heat exchanger was exposed to air. The fire department reported that three of the five who died were Mitsubishi Materials employees and at least one person was taken to Mie University Hospital.Yokkaichi is about 200 miles from Tokyo.[CNN]
