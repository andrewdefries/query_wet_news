WASHINGTON, March 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection agency has formed a research advisory panel to examine the potential effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water.Acting EPA Administrator Bob Perciasepe said an independent science advisory board will peer-review a draft report on hydraulic fracturing, known also as fracking."Our final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources must be based on sound science and take into account the latest practices being used by the industry," he said in a statement.New technologies used in the extraction of oil and natural gas have led to increases in U.S. production. The government estimates oil and gas production are at historic highs.Fracking critics, however, have expressed concern over the potential for chemicals used during the process to leach into groundwater.The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in January said it was searching for a common sense rule for natural gas fracking.American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard said most states have rules that are strong enough, however.BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley predicted the "shale revolution" in the United States could make the country nearly energy independent by 2030.

“I’m not going to eat, and I won’t let docs at the prison revive me in any way," O.J. reportedly said. "I will fight it. I used to live my way, and now I’m going to die my way."	By Evan Bleier | Feb. 13, 2014 at 9:48 AM | 0 comments

| License Photo	LOVELOCK, Nev., Feb. 13 (UPI) -- According to repots, “The Juice” won’t eat…The National Enquirer is reporting that O.J. Simpson is so desperate to end his incarceration in Nevada that he is trying to commit suicide by going on a hunger strike. Simpson was given a 33-year prison sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping which he is currently serving at the Lovelock Correctional Center.The suspected murderer is depressed and simply wants to “just sit down in a corner and die,” the Enquirer reported. “O.J. is done.”The former NFL running back is eligible for parole in 2017.“He’s dropping weight fast, and it’s scaring the hell out of his few remaining friends. He just won’t eat, and you can tell by his voice that he just wants to die. That’s exactly what is going to happen to him un­less some good news drops out of the sky to cheer him up and give him a reason to live. However, that doesn’t seem likely.”If Simpson is able to go through with the hunger strike, his four kids would inherit the money from his NFL pension.“They ain’t ever going to let me out of here,” O.J., 66, reportedly told a friend. “I’m not going to eat, and I won’t let docs at the prison revive me in any way. I will fight it. I used to live my way, and now I’m going to die my way…My life is already over.”Although he was found not guilty in the June 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in a criminal trial, many people believe that Simpson is a murderer.

TEHRAN, March 7 (UPI) -- The power struggle within Iran's political hierarchy is getting rougher as outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei square off for the final run-up to presidential elections in June.The outcome of what may be the most divisive of the Islamic Republic's elections will determine where Iran, locked in a worsening confrontation with the West over its nuclear program, is headed.Ahmadinejad, whose re-election for a second four-year term in 2009 triggered Iran's worst political upheaval since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, cannot run again but he's determined to install his closest associate and former vice president, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, or someone like him, as his successor.Khamenei has immense political, religious and ideological authority as well as the support of the powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps.Khamenei, a former president himself, was a revolutionary associate of the Islamic Republic's founder, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and represents the hard-line theological Old Guard, the 1979 generation.Ahmadinejad, a controversial populist who was once Khamenei's protege and leans toward the secular, is the brash nationalist challenger who wants to marginalize the mullahs who have run Iran since 1979.This unprecedented power struggle erupted two years ago when Ahmadinejad turned against his former benefactor amid wide scale riots against his disputed re-election and the mass roundup of liberals, reformers and student protesters.Khamenei overruled Ahmadinejad's appointment of key allies to important posts, such as intelligence minister, as the president increasingly and openly challenged the supreme leader's authority.The Times of London reported Feb. 27 that Ahmadinejad is planning an "extraordinary attack" on the clerical establishment in a bid to "separate mosque and state."Ahmadinejad and Mashaei, his chief of staff whose son is married to the president's daughter, want to "effectively dismantle the theocratic structure of Iranian government that has stood since the revolution," the Times reported.But Ahmadinejad's already in a corner. All candidates for the June 14 polling must be vetted by the Guardian Council, a 12-member body with wide constitutional powers. It's unlikely to approve Mashaei, or anyone considered to be in Ahmadinejad's pocket, as a candidate.The council consists of six clerics selected by the Supreme Leader, and six jurists chosen by the Majlis, or Parliament, where Khamenei has a firm majority.A possible candidate from Khamenei's camp is Ali Larijani, a member of a powerful political family that's allied with the supreme leader, although he hasn't disclosed any intention to run for president.He's a bitter opponent of Ahmadinejad and they have engaged in some pretty down and dirty exchanges of late that have stunned even scandal-hardened politicos in Tehran.In one of the most bizarre mud-slinging episodes, Ahmadinejad created an uproar by publicly accusing Larijani's brother Fazel of corruption during a raucous parliamentary session. He played a videotape that purported to show Fazel Larijani promising a businessman to get him fat government contracts in exchange for $20 million.Larijani responded by practically throwing Ahmadinejad out of the Majlis.Larijani's elder brother, Sadeq, retaliated by having Said Mortazavi, a shadowy figure close to the president, arrested on a charge of entrapping the younger Larijani.On Feb. 18, Iran's Supreme Court upheld death sentences for three businessmen and a banker in a high-profile, $2.8 billion corruption case linked to Ahmadinejad.Sentencing four people to death in a single corruption case is unprecedented. It was seen as a not-too-subtle warning to Ahmadinejad that his allies and business cronies could face similar fates if they fund whoever runs as his candidate.Another Larijani sibling, Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, is head of the judiciary.Iranian exile and analyst Amir Taheri described this high-profile scrapping as "Mafia-style squabbles."And he observed that "while rival factions are engaged in a zoological struggle for power, the country" -- facing the specter of conflict with the United States and its sanctions-crippled economy collapsing -- "is looking increasingly like a rudderless ship adrift in stormy seas."Khamenei has ordered mass arrests of reformists, even moderates, the largest roundup in years, as the power struggle intensifies.A measure of the grim mood pervading Tehran is illustrated by a call by one of Khamenei's clerical representatives, Ali Saeedi, that the Revolutionary Guards should "engineer" the elections.

| License Photo	SANFORD, Fla., June 29 (UPI) -- After a 3-hour hearing Friday, a Florida judge postponed a decision on renewing bail for George Zimmerman, accused of killing an unarmed black teenager.Zimmerman's attorneys argued for release on $150,000 bail, the Orlando Sentinel reported. That was the figure set before Judge Kenneth Lester revoked it after prosecutors argued Zimmerman and his wife had lied about money raised through an online appeal. During the hearing, the defense acknowledged Zimmerman's wife lied about the money but argued Zimmerman, 28, is a good candidate for release. They also presented testimony to show Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder, acted in self-defense when he shot Trayvon Martin. Martin, 17, was on his way to a relative's house in a gated community in Sanford when Zimmerman began following him. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, ignored a 911 dispatcher's urging to stop his pursuit. Robert Zimmerman testified during the hearing that a voice calling for help on a 911 tape was his son's. A Sanford firefighter said Zimmerman had "blood on his face and the back of his head" and his nose showed signs of severe injuries. Bernie De la Rionda, the prosecutor, said Martin could have perceived Zimmerman as a threat. He said Zimmerman had "profiled" the teenager. "What you have here is basically a defendant who perceives himself as the police out there," De la Rionda said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 16 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama Tuesday nominated two new members of the National Labor Relations Board and withdrew nominations of two recess appointments.The nominations of Kent Yoshiho Hirozawa, of New York, and Nancy Jean Schiffer, of Maryland, came after Senate Democrats and Republicans took action on long-delayed presidential nominations amid indications a deal was near on averting a showdown on procedural filibusters.The agreement calls for Republicans to retain the ability to filibuster presidential nominees while allowing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to reserve the right to trigger the so-called nuclear option to change the rules on filibuster, The Hill said."They're not sacrificing their right to filibuster, and we damn sure aren't filibustering our right to change the rules if necessary, which I'm confident it won't be, but I want it made very clear," Reid said.The Senate earlier Tuesday voted 71-29 to move Richard Cordray to the brink of formal ratification as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Obama said in a statement released by the White House after the breakthrough his nominees "have waited far too long for a vote.""Over the last two years, I've nominated leaders to fill important positions required to do the work of the American people, only to have those positions remain unfilled -- not because the nominees were somehow unqualified, but for purely political reasons," the president said."In the weeks ahead, I hope the Congress will build on this spirit of cooperation to advance other urgent middle-class priorities, including the need to take action to pass commonsense immigration reform and keep interest rates on student loans low for families trying to afford a higher education," Obama said.Hirozawa is a member of New York law firm Gladstein, Reif & Meginniss LLP -- which represents local unions in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area and international unions based in Washington. Schiffer is associate general counsel for the AFL-CIO in Washington.Republicans have agreed to allow votes before the August recess on Hirozawa and Schiffer, The Hill reported.Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was attempting to line up six Republican votes on Obama administration nominees to the National Relations Board, Roll Call said.As part of the agreement announced Tuesday, Obama agreed to withdraw NLRB nominations of Sharon Block and Richard Griffin Jr., who have been serving on the board since made them recess appointments in January 2012.Senators emerging Monday night from a rare, bipartisan, closed-door caucus meeting in the richly decorated but rarely used Old Senate Chamber said no deal was struck during the session.Some of the 98 senators who attended said they were confident an agreement could be reached Tuesday to defuse the tense partisan standoff.Filibustering senators are allowed to speak for as long as they wish on any topic they choose. A filibuster can be stopped when 60 senators vote to end debate and bring the filibustered matter to a vote.Reid has said if Republicans try to filibuster the controversial nominations Tuesday, Democrats will change Senate procedures so only 51 senators are needed to end a filibuster on an executive-branch nomination.The 60-vote threshold to end filibusters would remain for judicial nominees and legislation.Democrats and allied independent senators hold 54 seats.Changing the Senate rules would also require 51 votes.

DHAKA, Bangladesh, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- A countrywide dawn-to-dusk general strike in Bangladesh, called by an Islamist group, began Monday morning without incident, authorities said.The strike was called to protest the deaths of three people in clashes between police and demonstrators protesting the life sentence given by a Bangladeshi tribunal to Abdul Kader Mullah, chief of the Jamat-e-Islami group, for his alleged role in crimes during the country's 1971 independence war.Members of the so-called Shahbagh movement want Mullah executed.The Bangladesh Daily Star said no incidents were reported as the strike began Monday. The report said public transportation systems were operating in the capital Dhaka, but there were fewer private vehicles on the roads.Security remained tight in the capital as supporters of the Shahbagh movement urged the public to ignore the strike and go about their daily routine.Thousands of Shahbagh supporters have been holding demonstrations ever since the sentencing of Mullah, demanding his execution as well as a ban the pro-Jamaat blog and the immediate arrests of those responsible for last week's killing of Ahmed Rajib Haidar, a key movement supporter. They also want death penalty for all war criminals and no grant of amnesty.The Star reported many had heeded the call of Shahbagh supporters to defy the Jamaat's strike call.As the Shahbagh demonstrations continued, Bangladesh's parliament amended a law to allow the state to appeal the tribunal's life sentence of Mullah, which was cheered by tens of thousands of the demonstrators, the BBC reported.Bangladesh, formerly the eastern wing of Pakistan, became an independent republic in 1971 after a nine-month war against the Pakistani army. Some estimates say as many as 3 million people died and tens of thousands of women were raped and attacked during the war.The Bangladeshi tribunal was set up in 2010 to try some of the local groups who allegedly opposed the freedom war and collaborated with the Pakistani army in aiding the killings, rapes and other atrocities.The Jamaat claims the latest efforts are part of a political vendetta by the government.The BBC reported Mullah and seven others accused are Jamaat party leaders, while the other two are members of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, a rival of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her ruling party.The tribunal does not conform with international standards, human rights groups have said.Mulah's sentencing was the second by the tribunal. On Jan. 21 Jamaat member Abul Kalam Azad was sentenced, in absentia, to death.

April 18 (UPI) -- In a bit of drama befitting a soap opera, ABC is being accused of sabotage for killing off characters already licensed out to another company, according to The Hollywood Reporter.Producer Prospect Park, which licensed "One Life to Live" and "All My Children" from ABC and plans to relaunch them as a web series beginning April 29, claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court that the network is trying to cause it to fail.The widespread fan disappointment at ABC's cancellation of the two popular soaps, with a combined history of more than 80 years, led media to describe the event as "Soapocalypse."Prospect argues that it has been dealing with ABC in good faith, allowing it to use OLTL characters on General Hospital until the relaunch, but ABC actively has caused problems, including refusing to transfer the website addresses for the shows and failing to consult on storylines."For over one year, ABC outright failed and refuse to consult with Prospect on any storylines involving these characters, rendering Prospect's approval rights meaningless. [...] In the ultimate act of bad faith, ABC killed off two OLTL characters on loan to General Hospital by having their car forced off a cliff. ABC effectively killed another major OLTL character, who was not even licensed to ABC, by revealing that is long-standing OLTL character is in fact another character on 'General Hospital'."The complaint goes on to say that one unnamed ABC executive responsible for the "egregious" programming decisions "openly declared his desire to see Prospect fail."The suit seeks more than $25 million in damages. Prospect "has no intention of allowing Soapocalypse II."

Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov (Russian: Ви́ктор Алексе́евич Зубко́в; born September 15, 1941) is a Russian politician and businessman who was the Prime Minister of Russia from September 2007 to May 2008.
He was a financial crime investigator until September 12, 2007, when he was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to replace Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, who resigned earlier that day. The nomination was approved in the Duma on September 14, 2007. On May 7, 2008 Zubkov's cabinet was automatically dismissed. This procedure, following an inauguration of the President of Russia is required by the Russian Constitution. After Putin became Prime Minister, Zubkov was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister.
Zubkov is also the current chairman of the board of directors of Gazprom, Russia's largest corporation and one of the largest oil and natural gas companies in the world.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
