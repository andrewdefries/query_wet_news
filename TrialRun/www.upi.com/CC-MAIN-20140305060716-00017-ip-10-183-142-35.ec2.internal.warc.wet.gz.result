BANDA SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- The head of Japan's Trans-Pacific Partnership delegation said a trade agreement among the 12 participating countries this year would take considerable work."The participating countries will be required to put in significant effort," TPP Minister Akira Amari said at a press conference in Brunei, The Mainichi reported Saturday.Delegates that the TPP conference agreed to speed up efforts to reach an agreement, but a comprehensive deal appears to be far off, the newspaper said.Japan intends to keep tariffs on dairy, wheat and rice products in place. At odds with that position are dairy export countries, such as New Zealand, the United States and Canada, all of which are looking for accommodating policies that also protect their own farmers.Agreements have been reached on food safety and telecommunications, but countries remain divided on fishing, farming and the automobile industry, The Mainichi reported.There is general expectation that a comprehensive agreement would be reached before the October meeting of the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit, but Amari said completion of an agreement by then would be difficult."We won't have all the details down, but will aim for an agreement on the major issues," he said.

PASCAGOULA, Miss., Sept. 16 (UPI) -- Fabrication of the next Arleigh Burke-class destroyer for the U.S. Navy has been started by the shipbuilding division of Huntington Ingalls Industries.The 100 tons of steel cut by robotic machines of Ingalls Shipbuilding is for the future USS Ralph Johnson, the 30th Arleigh Burke-class (DDG 51) guided missile destroyer built by the company."The DDG 51 program continues to be a model of success for our company," said DDG 51 Program Manager George Nungesser. "We have talented, experienced shipbuilders working on this program, and they have provided excellent quality on Aegis destroyers since the program's inception."Ingalls in June was awarded a $3.3 billion, multi-year construction contract to build five more DDG 51 destroyers, ensuring Ingalls will build DDGs for the next decade. A total of 28 DDG 51 ships have so far been delivered to the Navy.Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are capable of simultaneously fighting air, surface and subsurface battles with a variety of offensive and defensive weapon systems.

The telephone survey of 1,007 U.S. adults, conducted in September, also indicates: -- 44 percent have family members or friends with Alzheimer's.-- 23 percent of adults are extremely or very concerned that they may someday provide care for a loved one with Alzheimer's.-- 18 percent say they have made any plans for the possibility of getting Alzheimer's disease, while 41 percent say they talked to their families about Alzheimer's.-- Thirty-three percent say they considered care options in the event of the disease and 44 percent designated someone to take care of them, while 21 percent say they made financial arrangements. No margin of error was provided. The findings are at: www.metlife.com/Alzheimers.

Gen. Ahmad Reza Pourdastan announced plans for coordinated maneuvers with members of the national army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp."This year the largest joint maneuver between the Army and the IRGC will be staged for the first time," he was quoted by state-funded broadcaster Press TV as saying.Some military powers are monitoring developments in the region after Iran threatened to block oil shipping lanes through the Strait of Hormuz in response to increased sanctions pressure.Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi warned that Tehran won't let foreign troops undermine the security in the Persian Gulf.The announcement comes days before scheduled nuclear negotiations between Iran and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- along with Germany in Istanbul.Iran is suspected of pursuing the technology needed to manufacture a nuclear weapon, an allegation the government denies.Tehran didn't announce a schedule for the military maneuvers.

ROMEOVILLE, Ill., Dec. 27 (UPI) -- Former Chicago Bear Steve "Mongo" McMichael said he filed a petition to run for mayor of Romeoville, Ill., adding celebrity appeal to a three-way race.McMichael, 55, will be running against former Mayor Fred Dewald, who resigned in 2008 months after pleading guilty to a drunken driving charge, and incumbent John Noak in an April 9 election, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday.McMichael, a defensive lineman on the Bears' 1985 Super Bowl championship team, filed petitions at the village hall Wednesday."I've always relied on the counsel of the people who have been there before me," McMichael said.McMichael began renting a condominium in Romeoville last April to meet residency requirements to run in the election, though he's been a presence in the community for two years when Mongo McMichael's Sports Bar opened, the Sun-Times reported.He said the fact that the mayor also serves as liquor commissioner shouldn't be a conflict of interest because he does not own the bar or receive income from the business. He said he let friends use his name to open the bar and only received free drinks and food when he visits the establishment.McMichael said he would appoint someone else as liquor commissioner if the public demanded it.Romeoville is a town of about 40,000 in the suburbs southwest of Chicago.

| License Photo	MISURATA, Libya, Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Vast stockpiles of weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, remain unguarded in the area around the Libyan city of Sirte, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday.The New York-based organization said for months it has been warning Libya's ruling National Transitional Council and NATO about the dangers posed by the weapons and the urgent need to secure them. "Now that the fighting has ended, one of the NTC's top priorities should be securing weapons facilities, and bringing the unchecked flow of arms in the country under control," said Peter Bouckaert, the group's emergencies director.Brouckaert added there is no time to waste."Surface-to-air missiles can take down civilian aircraft, and the explosive weapons can be converted easily into the car bombs and IEDs that have killed thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Bouckaert.The United States has sent a team of experts to Libya to help the NTC locate missing surface-to-air missiles.

Nov. 27 (UPI) -- The black spot on Apple's otherwise wildly successful launch of the iPhone 5 was undoubtedly the new Maps app in the new iOS 6.Now, Apple has fired Richard Williamson, the manager who oversaw the mapping team, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the move. While Apple's penchant for secrecy means the news probably won't ever get an official announcement, the move is the latest in a shakeup of Apple's top brass that handed both Maps and the similarly disappointing Siri to newly promoted Senior Vice President Eddy Cue.Apple launched its proprietary Maps app in September with the release of its latest operating system, iOS 6, for the first time dumping the trusty Google Maps app that had come loaded on every iPhone since the device's debut in 2007.

Wiki
Steven Allan Spielberg (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, film producer, video game designer and studio executive. In a career of more than four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as the Holocaust, slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most popular and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the co-founders of the DreamWorks movie studio.
Spielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws (1975), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993)—achieved box office records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5 billion worldwide. Forbes puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0 billion.
Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother, Leah Adler, was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg, was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. He spent his childhood in Haddon Township, New Jersey, where he saw one of his first films in a theater, as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona. Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8 mm "adventure" films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
