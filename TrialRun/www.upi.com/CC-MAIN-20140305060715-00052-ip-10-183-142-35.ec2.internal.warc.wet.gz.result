ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Italy's Selex ES says flight trails of its Gabbiano radar installed on the company's Falco unmanned aerial system have been successfully completed.In the trials, the radar's T-20 version demonstrated capabilities such as air-to-sea surveillance; high-resolution ground mapping; ship target imaging and classification with ISAR mode; navigation with ground mapping and weather avoidance."The open-architecture of the Falco made installing the Gabbiano radar a simple matter of adapting the UAV's nose bay" said Selex ES head of unmanned aerial systems Fabio Pauluzzo."The successful combination of our Falco and Gabbiano product families will allow Selex ES to provide a more versatile tactical UAV solution for typical MALE multi-sensor missions."The trials were announced at the IDEX conference and exhibition in the United Arab Emirates."The flight campaign highlighted how the Gabbiano T-20's light-weight, low-power consumption, ease of installation and advanced performance allowed it to improve the Falco's long-range surveillance capabilities," Selex ES said. "At up to 160 nautical miles over sea and ground, the Gabbiano was able to provide air to surface surveillance modes and high-resolution imaging information."The company also reported continued improvement of its UAVs. The new EVO variant of the Falco recently extended its endurance to more than 18 hours and payload capacity to more than 220 pounds.

SUWANEE, Ga., Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Shoppers at a Georgia grocery store were startled to see two deer running through the aisles.Store officials are still unsure of where two fawns came from and what prompted them to enter the Suwanee, Ga., Publix grocery store, WSB-TV, Atlanta, reported.Shopper James Chronicle filmed the event with his cellphone."They bolted through the store. I heard kids screaming and I thought I better catch those deer and I got to the back of the store by the freezer section and they ran past me and at that point I thought I better film these deer," Chronicle said.After running around the store and the back room, employees were able to corral the deer in the meat department. They then carried the deer out the back door and released them.Store officials said no one was injured while the deer were in the store and the meat department was sanitized.

DARWIN, Australia, March 5 (UPI) -- An Australian fisherman said a huge crocodile took a chunk out of the engine of his boat while he and a friend were sleeping in the craft.Peter Dienhoff said he and a friend had been fishing for barramundi Thursday and they were sleeping around midnight near the mouth of the South Alligator River, about 136 miles east of Darwin, when they were awakened by the boat shaking, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Monday."The boat was rocking, the cowling nearly got torn off by the crocodile," Dienhoff said. "We scampered down the back and turned the spotlight on and about five meters (16 feet, 4 inches) out the back of the boat the crocodile was laying there looking at us."He said the croc was about 13 feet long."I've been fishing up here for 35 years and being on the water that time I thought I'd seen everything," he said. "But this one certainly takes the cake."He said the animal took a chunk out of the boat's engine."This crocodile approached with no hissing or growling as they normally do before an attack," he said. "It just slipped out of the water and grabbed the outboard."

JERUSALEM, Sept. 9 (UPI) -- Archaeologists say excavations at the foot of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem have yielded a treasure hoard in the form of coins, jewelry and a medallion.Two bundles were unearthed containing thirty-six gold coins, gold and silver jewelry, and a gold medallion etched with symbols of a menorah, a shofar (ram's horn) and a Torah scroll, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem reported Monday.Archaeologist Eilat Mazar called the find at the Temple Mount's southern wall "a breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime discovery.""We have been making significant finds from the First Temple Period in this area, a much earlier time in Jerusalem's history, so discovering a golden seven-branched Menorah from the seventh century CE (A.D.) at the foot of the Temple Mount was a complete surprise."The menorah, a candelabrum with seven branches used in the Temple, is the national symbol of the state of Israel and reflects the historical presence of Jews in the area, the researchers said.Mazar said he believes the treasure was either hidden or abandoned around the time of the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 A.D."It would appear that the most likely explanation is that the ... cache was earmarked as a contribution toward the building of a new synagogue, at a location that is near the Temple Mount," he said. "What is certain is that their mission, whatever it was, was unsuccessful. The treasure was abandoned, and its owners could never return to collect it."

DETROIT, Feb. 9 (UPI) -- Jimmy Howard turned aside 23-of-24 shots and survived a late Edmonton power play Saturday, backstopping the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory.Howard allowed only a second-period tally to Justin Schultz and stood firm in the closing minutes when the Red Wings' Johan Franzen was penalized for closing his hand on the puck and the Oilers pulled their goalie for a 6-on-4 advantage.Niklas Kronwall recorded his first goal of the season early in the third period to break a 1-1 tie and Pavel Datsyuk added a marker as Detroit won a second straight.Forty-year-old Nikolai Khabibulin, making his first start of the season, was touched for two goals on 30 shots for Edmonton, which has lost five consecutive games.

STORRS-MANSFIELD, Conn., April 28 (UPI) -- A former University of Connecticut football player pleaded guilty to child pornography possession and faces a year in prison, his attorney said.Gregory J. McKee, a 20-year-old redshirt freshman at the time of his arrest last year, pleaded guilty to third-degree child pornography possession. Under terms of the deal, McKee will serve a year in prison, followed by four years of post-release supervision and must register as a sex offender.Prosecutors said McKee uploaded multiple videos to a social networking site that appeared to show children ages 8 to 15 engaged in sex acts. Investigators who got a tip about the videos traced them to an Internet service provider and email McKee controlled, the Hartford (Conn.) Courant said Friday.After obtaining a search warrant, police searched McKee's computer and found 96 still images and 26 videos constituting child porn.McKee, an offensive tackle, never played a game for the Huskies. He has since left the school and returned to his native Chicago while he awaits sentencing, the Courant said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 21 (UPI) -- An appellate court Tuesday ruled the U.S. government properly classified more than 50 post-mortem photos of Osama bin Laden and they can remain secret.The organization Judicial Watch had filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking 52 images of bin Laden taken after he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALS and other military and Central Intelligence Agency officials, which the Obama administration had classified Top Secret to keep the photos from being used by militants."We affirm because the images were properly classified and hence are exempt from disclosure under the act," the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said in its ruling. Some of the images were posed for facial identification to confirm it was bin Laden's body."The CIA's declarations give reason to believe that releasing images of American military personnel burying the founder and leader of al-Qaida could cause exceptionally grave harm," the three-judge appeals court wrote. "Together, these declarations support their declarants' determinations that releasing any of the images, including the burial images, could reasonably be expected to trigger violence and attacks 'against United States interests, personnel, and citizens worldwide.'"The al-Qaida founder was killed on May 1, 2011, by U.S. forces during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and his remains were buried at sea. The CIA said at that time it would withhold images taken after his death, many "quite graphic" and "gruesome."Judicial watch sued for the release of the photos -- some showing the fatal bullet wounds -- but John Bennett, the CIA's director of National Clandestine Service, asserted all of the images had been properly kept secret "because, if disclosed, they could be expected to lead to retaliatory attacks against Americans and aid in the production of anti-American propaganda."

JERUSALEM, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- Palestinian hunger-striker Samer Issawi was sentenced to eight months in prison for violating parole but he may be confined only until March, officials said.Issawi was sentenced Thursday for trying to enter the West Bank in July 2012, a violation of his 2011 parole, Ahram Online reported.He had been previously sentenced to 30 years in prison for his involvement in terror activities, but was released after nine years as part of a Egypt-brokered prisoner swap between Hamas and Israeli authorities in October 2011. A stipulation on his release was that he not enter the West Bank.Issawi's new prison sentence is retroactive to July and he will probably be released in March, Ynetnews reported.Since his arrest, Issawi has been on a hunger strike, along with several other Palestinian detainees in Israel.Palestinians have been protesting Issawi's detainment during the past week."The protests ... were reminiscent of the first Intifada. If something happens to Issawi, I believe that the entire West Bank will erupt in a new, non-violent Intifada of the people," said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian Parliament member and one of the leading organizers of protests in support of Issawi and other Palestinian administrative detainees.

| License Photo	Aug. 30 (UPI) -- Sean Kingston has been sued by a 22-year-old woman who claims the singer, his bodyguard, and a member of his band gang raped her in Kingston's hotel room in 2010.Carissa Capeloto claims in her lawsuit that she was forced to have sex with Kingston and two other men after being invited to the singer's room for a meet-and-great in 2010 following a Justin Bieber concert where Kingston also performed. Capeloto says she was "obviously intoxicated [and] incapable of consent" from having smoked marijuana and drank 7-10 shots of vodka when she walked into Kingston's hotel room and found him naked on the bed. She claims that after she entered the room the bodyguard picked her up, placed her on top of the singer and that all three man began to gang rape her. A friend of Capeloto reportedly entered the room and rescued her later on that night. Police were called to the scene and she was taken to a hospital where she claims she was treated for physical injuries consistent with rape. Criminal charges against Kingston were dropped in 2010 after officials concluded there was not enough evidence to charge him. Now, Capaloto is suing all three men claiming that her life has been ruined, that she can't sleep and that she has mood swings and panic attacks. She is seeking a minimum compensation of $5 million.Kingston has filed documents insisting the sex was consensual. A trial has been set for November.
