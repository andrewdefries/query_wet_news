BEIJING, Jan. 24 (UPI) -- Chinese officials said they were interested in playing a greater role in Iraq's oil sector but expressed reservations regarding Baghdad's political situation.The Chinese National Petroleum Co. has stakes in three Iraqi oil projects, which have a combined output of about 1.6 million barrels of oil per day. An industry official working in close association with CNPC told newspaper China Daily on condition of anonymity that the company was also interested in taking a stake in the West Qurna I project."It's just too sensitive to release anything now," the official said.U.S. supermajor Exxon Mobil is keen to sell its interest in West Qurna to take on a greater role in fields in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. The Kurdish and central Baghdad governments are at odds over oil laws, however, and Baghdad said it considered unilateral deals there illegal.Lin Boqiang, director of energy economics at China's Xiamen University, said work in Iraq carries inherent risk."Good oil resources in other areas of the world have already been carved up by international oil giants and there are not many choices left for Chinese companies," he said.

NEW YORK, June 9 (UPI) -- Twenty-six percent of New York City residents have genital herpes, compared to 19 percent nationally, New York health officials say. Herpes Simplex Virus-2, the virus that causes genital herpes, is a lifelong sexually transmitted infection that can cause painful genital sores in a minority of cases, but most have no recognizable symptoms. Herpes Simplex Virus-2 facilitates the spread of HIV -- doubling the risk that a person will contract HIV when exposed to it. Herpes Simplex Virus-2 can also be serious when transmitted to newborns, although this is rare, officials said. The study, published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases, said that among New Yorkers, the rate is higher among women than men -- 36 percent versus 19 percent; higher among blacks than whites -- 49 percent versus 14 percent; and higher among men who have sex with men than those who don't -- 32 percent versus 18 percent. The national rate has declined in recent years."Genital herpes alone will not cause serious problems for most people," lead author Julia Schillinger of the health department said in a statement. "But some people will have painful genital sores and the infection fosters the spread of HIV. Using condoms consistently will help you avoid getting or spreading genital herpes."

HAMILTON, Ontario, May 13 (UPI) -- One-year-old babies exposed to music lessons demonstrated better communication and more sophisticated brain responses to music, Canadian researchers say. Laurel Trainor, director of the McMaster University's Institute for Music and the Mind in Ontario, and David Gerry, a music educator and graduate student, said the study involved groups of babies and their parents who spent six months participating in one of two types of weekly music instruction.All the babies had shown similar communication and social development and none had previously participated in other baby music classes.One music class involved interactive music-making and learning a small set of lullabies, nursery rhymes and songs with actions. Parents and infants worked together to learn to play percussion instruments, take turns and sing specific songs.In the other music class, infants and parents played at various toy stations while recordings from the popular Baby Einstein series played in the background."Babies who participated in the interactive music classes with their parents showed earlier sensitivity to the pitch structure in music," Trainor said in a statement. "Specifically, they preferred to listen to a version of a piano piece that stayed in key, versus a version that included out-of-key notes, while the passive listening infants did not show the same preferences." The findings were published in the journals Developmental Science and Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.

It brightens everyone's day," Dunn said. "Everyone's talking about it. This just kind of reaffirms the Christmas spirit."

MOSCOW, Aug. 19 (UPI) -- Members of the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster were detained in Moscow for holding an unsanctioned "pasta procession" in the city.The Church, which refers to its adherents as "Pastafarians," said the "pasta procession" in Moscow was held Saturday to celebrate the birthday of actor Robert De Niro, who played a character nicknamed "Noodles" in Sergio Leone's 1984 film "Once Upon A Time In America," but the event was broken up by riot police and Orthodox activist Dmitri Enteo's God's Will group, RIA Novosti reported Monday.God's Will has held numerous rallies recently against homosexuals."Guys, because of the dispersion by riot police and provocations by Enteo and Co the Ramen [noodles] eating arrangement is canceled," the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster said on its website.Moscow police confirmed eight of the Pastafarians were detained for "attempting to hold an unsanctioned rally."

NAIROBI, Kenya, March 11 (UPI) -- Kenya is on a knife-edge following the hair's-breadth victory of Uhuru Kenyatta, son of the nation's founder, in a presidential election that leaves the East African nation, once a model of post-colonial democracy, bitterly divided.Kenyatta is facing trial at the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity in the deaths of 1,200 people after the bitterly disputed 2007 presidential poll in which his rival, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, was among the losers.Kenyatta, son of the late Jomo Kenyatta, a towering figure in Africa's post-colonial politics, was declared the winner in the closely fought poll March 4 election.Uhuru Kenyatta took 50.07 percent of the 12.3 million votes cast, just enough to avoid a runoff against Odinga, who had 43.31 percent of the vote.Amid growing concerns about the validity of the ballot, with an unusually high 10 percent of votes declared invalid, and the shortcomings and breakdowns in the computerized tallying system intended to avoid the vote-rigging accusations of 2007, Odinga branded the electoral process "tainted."He said he'll challenge the result in Kenya's Supreme Court and called on his followers to remain calm.Despite widespread fears of violence, the election produced no major eruption of the fierce tribal rivalries that took Kenya to the brink of civil war in three months of bloodshed triggered by the December 2007 poll.However, it was clear the voting left the country still bitterly divided, with the narrowness of Kenyatta's victory feeding his opponents' anger.Much will depend on what happens in the next few weeks, as Odinga's challenge makes its way through the courts.Observers expect legal challenges after myriad failures in the systems established by Kenya's electoral commission following the 2007 affair.Whatever election-related developments occur, Kenya's new leaders have other battles on their hands.Kenyatta's victory, by a mere few thousands votes, is likely to come under intense scrutiny since the new head of state of one of Africa's foremost countries, and his running mate William Ruto, will have to go before the ICC in The Hague to answer charges they directed, incited and provided weapons for the savage deaths of their countrymen in the 2008 bloodbath.Ruto's trial is scheduled for April; Kenyatta's for July.Africa Intelligence, a Paris website, warned, "This election victory is like a ticking time bomb."It went so far as to say that on top of the traditional tribal divisions that have marred Kenya politics since independence from Britain in 1963, the tactical alliance between Kenyatta's Kikuyu and Ruto's Kalenjin could fall apart if one of the partners is convicted in The Hague.There's a widespread expectation Kenyans will show restraint because of the 2008 atrocities but, with Kenyatta's trial likely to fan political and tribal rivalries, Africa Intelligence noted, "This election victory will do nothing to erase the various major land disputes between the rival communities."These quarrels have pitted rival tribes against each other, particularly in the fertile Rift Valley, since independence and were heightened by the 2008 bloodletting.Kenya also faces a wider, diplomatic problem now that it's elected as president a scion of the nation's leading political dynasty who may be convicted of mass murder and wind up serving a life sentence in a foreign prison.British international affairs specialist Simon Tisdall commented that Kenyatta's victory, "if confirmed, would lead the international community into dangerously unfamiliar territory, with possibly far-reach deleterious consequences for U.S. and British relations with Kenya, U.N. operations and the struggle against al-Qaida-style Islamist extremism."The spectacle of Kenya's head of state put behind bars by the ICC "would inevitably be portrayed as partisan, biased and part of the post-colonial West's alleged wider vendetta against black Africa," Tisdall wrote in The Guardian newspaper."Worse, it would compromise the arguably much stronger but so far stalemated ICC genocide and war crimes case against Omar al-Bashir, president of Sudan, and possible future cases involving, for example, Syria's Bashar Assad."The U.S., Britain and leading figures including Kofi Annan the former U.N. secretary-general, have already made clear, in a roundabout way, that Kenyatta's victory would not be welcome," Tisdall observed."Britain has indicated officials will avoid any but essential contact with him. If London sticks to this approach, a diplomatic rift may be inevitable."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 (UPI) -- Acting CIA head Michael Morell says "Zero Dark Thirty," about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, leaves a false impression about the use of "enhanced interrogation."In a letter addressed to CIA employees Friday, Morell said the question of whether so-called enhanced interrogation techniques -- often including waterboarding -- "were the only timely and effective way to obtain information from those detainees, as the film suggests, is a matter of debate that cannot and never will be definitively resolved.""The film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding bin Ladin," Morrell wrote in the letter, which was posted on the CIA webste. "That impression is false."Morell said "multiple streams of intelligence" allowed analysts to determine bin Laden was in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Navy SEALs killed the al-Qaida leader in May 2011.He said "Zero Dark Thirty" -- which has received several award nominations and is considered a likely nominee for a best picture Oscar -- is "a dramatization, not a realistic portrayal of the facts."Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Armed Services Committee Ranking Member John McCain, R-Ariz., said this week in a letter to Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynton that scenes of detainees being tortured, in particular, create the implication that torture yielded "critical" information on a courier who, in turn, led to bin Laden."'Zero Dark Thirty' is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative," the senators wrote.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Sept. 22 (UPI) -- A Florida dentist allegedly abused dozens of his pediatric patients, but was convicted in only one case, records indicate. Thomas Floyd allegedly called children names, including cry baby and brat, and was also accused of pinching a 2-year-old and giving a 4-year-old eight crowns without her parents' consent, documents recently obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel indicate. Investigators who probed the many complaints against Floyd hit many roadblocks, the Sentinel said. Employees who filed complaints didn't know the patients' names in many cases, and doctors said some of the injuries could have resulted from the dental procedures. But in 2012, he was convicted of a child neglect charge for jamming a dental tool in a 4-year-old's mouth, causing blood to squirt out. He agreed to five years' probation and to never practice dentistry in the United States again. Floyd's defense attorney said that complaints included the reports stem from complaints from his former employees who have been harassing his client. "If these accusations were true, Tom Floyd would have had problems years and years ago," Michael Salnick, Floyd's attorney, said. "There were things that would go on that would have a reasonable explanation in the practice of pediatric dentistry."Floyd declined to be interviewed, the Sentinel said.

ROME, June 26 (UPI) -- Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said Wednesday she has no plans to take over her father's political movement. Several of her father's allies suggested Marina could revive the People of Freedom Party by returning it to its roots as Forza d'Italia, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Marina Berlusconi, head of the Berlusconi holding company Fininvest, mounted a vigorous defense of her father after he was convicted Monday of having sex with an underage woman. Marina Berlusconi released a short statement: "The reiterated rumours of a political career for Marina Berlusconi are groundless."Berlusconi was sentenced to seven years in prison by a court in Milan and banned for life from public office. He says he is the victim of a vendetta by liberal judges. Also Wednesday, President Giorgio Napolitano, who is the ex officio head of the Italian judiciary, invited the former prime minister to a private meeting. That appears to be a show of support for Berlusconi and his charges against his judges.

Anthony S. Fauci (born: December 24, 1940) is an immunologist who has made substantial contributions to research in the areas of AIDS and other immunodeficiencies, both as a scientist and as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Anthony Stephen Fauci was born on December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York, to Stephen A. Fauci, a pharmacist, and Eugenia A. Fauci, a homemaker. He graduated from the all-scholarship, Jesuit-run Regis High School in New York City. He went on to attend the College of the Holy Cross and later received his M.D. from Cornell University Medical College in 1966. He then completed an internship and residency at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
In 1968, Fauci came to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a clinical associate in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI) in NIAID. In 1974, he became Head of the Clinical Physiology Section, LCI, and in 1980 was appointed Chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, a position he still holds. In 1984, Fauci became Director of NIAID, where he oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat infectious and immune-mediated illnesses, including HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, illness from potential agents of bioterrorism, tuberculosis, malaria, autoimmune disorders, asthma and allergies.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (born Astrid Winfreda Madikizelza; 26 September 1936) is a South African politician who has held several government positions and headed the African National Congress Women's League. She is currently a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee. Although still married to Nelson Mandela at the time of his becoming president of South Africa in May 1994, she was never the first lady of South Africa, as the couple had separated two years earlier after it was revealed that Winnie had been unfaithful during Nelson's incarceration. Their divorce was finalized on 19 March 1996, with an unspecified out-of-court settlement. Winnie Mandela's attempt to obtain a settlement up to US$5 million, half of what she claimed her ex-husband was worth, was dismissed when she failed to appear at court for a financial settlement hearing.
A controversial activist, she is popular among her supporters, who refer to her as the 'Mother of the Nation', yet reviled by others, mostly due to her alleged involvement in several human rights abuses, including the 1989 kidnap of 14-year old ANC activist Stompie Moeketsi, who was later murdered.
In March 2009, the Independent Electoral Commission ruled that Winnie Mandela, who was selected as an ANC candidate, could run in the April 2009 general election, despite having a fraud conviction.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
