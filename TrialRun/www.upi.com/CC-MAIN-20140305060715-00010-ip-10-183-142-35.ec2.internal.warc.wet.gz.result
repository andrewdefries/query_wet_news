COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 12 (UPI) -- Talk show host Jerry Springer has confirmed he plans to file papers with Ohio election officials to lay the groundwork for a possible Senate bid. While the 59-year-old Springer has yet to make a formal announcement, the paperwork was necessary so the television talk show host could avoid problems raising cash before declaring his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, E! Online reported. According to his political adviser, Mike Ford, Springer will make an official decision whether to launch a campaign by the end of this month. Springer, former mayor of Cincinnati, has already started airing infomercials in other states to test the waters, build a support base, and raise the necessary funds to take on State Senator Eric Fingerhut, the leading Democratic challenger. If Springer beats Fingerhut in the primary, he'll go head-to-head with incumbent Republican Sen. George Voinovich.

Manigault was credited with reviving him by performing CPR and getting him to the hospital.Jackson brought the painful subject up during a confrontation with Manigault, who was her teammate on Sunday's episode of "Apprentice." "Omarosa is the most evil person I have ever met. She's a no-good, conniving, scheming, cut-throat, probably pulled the cord on Michael Duncan Clarke," E! News quoted Jackson as saying.Jackson also said Manigault probably caused Duncan's heart attack.Show host and executive producer Donald Trump later fired Jackson after her team failed to create a successful 5-minute soap opera for Crystal Light, E! said.Celebrities previous eliminated this season from the business-themed competition series this season are rockers Dee Snider and Bret Michaels.Still in the competition are Manigault, Gary Busey, Lil' Jon, Lisa Rinna, Dennis Rodman, Claudia Jordan, Trace Adkins, Brande Roderick, Penn Jillette, Marilu Henner and Stephen Baldwin.

Gator head launch delayed by constructionFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Dec. 3 (UPI) -- A Florida artist behind a plan to float a giant alligator head down the Intracoastal Waterway said the project was delayed by construction issues.Hollywood artist Lloyd Goradesky and Everglades historian Cesar Becerra said they had planned to launch the 40-ton alligator head, made of reclaimed parts and titled "Floating Tile Art: Gator in the Bay," Sunday, but the plans were delayed by issues with construction, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Monday.Goradesky, who said the head may be launched Monday, said the gator is controlled by a self-propelled barge built into the head and a crane boom inside the sculpture opens and closes its three-story-tall mouth."It's safe to say something like this has never been done before," Goradesky said.Becerra said the project is aimed at raising awareness of restoration efforts for the Everglades' ecosystem.Napoleon letter sells for $244,800FONTAINEBLEAU, France, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- A coded letter from Napoleon Bonaparte threatening to blow up the Kremlin in Moscow sold for $244,800 at a French auction, officials said.The letter brought more than 10 times its estimated price to the Museum of Letters and Manuscripts in Paris at an auction in the nearby city of Fontainebleau, Radio France Internationale reported Monday."I am going to blow up the Kremlin on 22nd at 3 a.m.," Napoleon wrote in the coded letter, which was dated Oct. 20, 1812, and addressed to his foreign minister, Hugues-Bernard Maret.French mayor demands manners at town hallLHERAULE, France, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- A French mayor has introduced rules to have citizens ejected from the town hall if they don't say "hello" and "thank you" when addressing workers.Mayor Gerard Plee of Lheraule, a small town of 185 north of Paris, said the new rules are aimed at maintaining the "social standards in the municipality" after a poll earlier in the year found more than half of France's residents cited "a lack of manners" as their top source of stress, France 24 reported Monday."I believe that when people enter the town hall they should comply with certain practices like saying hello and goodbye as well as please and thank you," Plee said. "Being polite is the basic gesture of respect towards others which is needed for people to live together in harmony.""If I don't introduce this rule I have no power to take action against these people because there is no law in France that forces people to say hello, and there's no judge who will condemn someone for not saying it," he said.A sign posted on the door of the town hall warns visitors of the new policy and asked "the eternally dissatisfied, the rancorous and any other grumpy people" to mind their manners.Woman choked on glitter, stage caught fireBERLIN, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- A German talent show being broadcast live on TV suffered a series of setbacks including a singer choking on glitter and a fire breaking out on stage.Viewers of Saturday night's live broadcast of "Supertalent" were treated to an unusual spectacle when a singer named Laura choked on the glitter and confetti raining from the ceiling during her performance and an opera singer, Simone Ciccarese, lost her voice after breaking in the clouds from dry ice placed on the stage, The Local.de reported Monday.The show's string of problems culminated in a fire breaking out on stage when two men, Christian and Leo, accidentally caused a fire when they smashed up a car as part of their act. Stage hands rushed the stage with fire extinguishers to put out the flames.

MONTGOMERY, Ala., July 19 (UPI) -- Alabama's George Wallace Jr., was defeated in a state Republican run-off in his bid to run for lieutenant governor by lawyer and lobbyist Luther Strange.The Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser reported with more than 99 percent of the votes counted statewide, Strange had 54 percent of the vote and Wallace conceded the election late Tuesday night.The acrimonious campaign saw Strange's campaign refer to Wallace as an "out of touch liberal" while Wallace took shots at Strange's lobbying for corporations. However, in conceding, Wallace called Strange "his friend," and wished him well, the newspaper said."I wish him the very best as they go forward and represent our party in November," Wallace said.Wallace, the son of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, previously lost bids for Congress and lieutenant governor.Strange will face former governor and lieutenant governor Jim Folsom Jr. in November's general election.

AKRON, Ohio, July 7 (UPI) -- Restaurant owner Josephine Ann Harris died Friday, just hours after President Barack Obama visited her eatery in Akron, Ohio.White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One the president spoke with Harris' daughter, Wilma Parsons, by phone after learning the owner of Ann's Restaurant had died."So the president expressed his sorrow and his condolences at the very sad event," Carney said. "He was honored to meet her this morning and passed on his feelings that the whole family is in his thoughts and prayers today.Carney said it was his understanding, based on press reports, that she had not been well and died of a heart attack.The Akron Beacon Journal reported Harris, 70, was taken by ambulance to Akron General Medical Center after complaining of fatigue and a tingling feeling following Obama's visit. She died at the hospital about 11:15 a.m."You know it's great," Harris had said after Obama left her restaurant.She hadn't known Obama intended to stop by during his campaign swing through Ohio and Pennsylvania until earlier in the morning."He treated us like one of the brothers," she said. "He hugged all of us and ... got his picture taken with all of us."Frankie Adkins of Tulsa, Okla., said her sister had "loved Obama.""It was just so fast," Adkins said of Harris' passing."Ann is really the matriarch of the whole thing. She was the backbone."

JARRETSVILLE, Md., Feb. 4 (UPI) -- A girl, 10, was impaled in the back by a steel reinforcement bar while sledding after a snowfall in Jarretsville, Md., a county fire official said.The unidentified child was hospitalized at a regional pediatric shock trauma unit about noon Monday, Hartford County Fire and EMS spokesman Rich Gardiner said.She was found near her home "lying on her side on a little slope with a pierce of rebar sticking out of her," Jarretsville Fire Company Chief Rudy Walter said, a reference to the term used for steel rods inserted in concrete to reinforce it.A reciprocating saw was used to cut the material away from the girl, "leaving a piece of about 6 inches hanging out of her," Walter added.She underwent surgery to remove the metal, and is expected to recover, the Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday."We do get sledding accidents, but [usually] what happens is the child or an adult ran into a tree ... a building or they ran into another person. We get nothing that they are impaled," Walter said.

May 2 (UPI) -- The Opa-Locka Police Department in Florida on Wednesday argued before an arbitrator that one of their own officers deserved to be fired -- for the sixth time.The department told arbitrator Jeanne Wood that Sgt. German Bosque should be terminated because he left a city-owned, 30-round AR-15 assault rifle with the father of his then-girlfriend and now fiancé.WFOR CBS4 Miami reports that Bosque is "the most disciplined, fined, fired, arrested police officer in the state." He has been fired eight times by three departments in Florida. Opa-locka's six previous attempts to fire Bosque have not succeeded.Over the years, he has faced allegations including "busting the skull" of a handcuffed suspect, beating juveniles, having drugs in a patrol car, falsifying reports, conducting an unauthorized car chase where four people were killed and “calling in sick…from Cancun.”“It’s allegations. Allegations are not convictions,” said Bosque’s union-provided attorney, Andrew Axelrad. As to Bosque's alleged carelessness with his police-issued rifle, Axelrad said the weapon was safe with the man Bosque calls “Daddy,” who is a licensed security guard.“Anyone can legally purchase this weapon,” Axelrad said.“Not just anyone can purchase one from the Opa-locka police department,” retorted city attorney Joe Geller. The arbitrator said she would issue a decision in 60 to 90 days.

In the summer of 1989, Zubrus moved to Kharkiv, Ukraine to train under Ivan Pravilov on the Druzhba-78 squad. He continued to develop his play there until the end of 1995.
