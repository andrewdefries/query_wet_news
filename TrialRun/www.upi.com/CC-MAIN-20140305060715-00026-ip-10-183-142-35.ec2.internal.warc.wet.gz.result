WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UPI) -- While the shipment of U.S. petroleum products by rail reflects a national oil boom, coal is by far the most abundant cargo, the U.S. Energy Department said.Crude oil and petroleum products accounted for more than 30 percent of rail deliveries last year, up more than 25 percent from their 2009 levels, the department's Energy Information Administration states.Oil production from the lucrative Bakken play in the Northern Plains is exceeding regional pipeline capacity, prompting energy companies to turn to rail to deliver petroleum to refineries. The EIA states that, usually, 90 percent of crude oil and petroleum products are delivered by pipeline.The Association of American Railroads reports the shipment of petroleum products during the last week of January was 56 percent higher than the same time last year. The petroleum industry was responsible for most of the growth in rail traffic last year.For coal, the EIA states that coal deliveries by rail for 2012 declined 11 percent year-on-year. About 70 percent of the coal delivered to U.S. power plants is carried by rail, though more use of natural gas has crimped that delivery volume."Notwithstanding these changes, coal remained by far the dominant category of carload shipments, accounting for 41 percent of total carloads, compared to a 4 percent share for all petroleum and petroleum products combined," the EIA stated.

NEW YORK, June 14 (UPI) -- Al Pacino is to star in the Broadway revival of David Mamet's play "Glengarry Glen Ross" this fall, producers announced Thursday.Daniel Sullivan is directing the new production of the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, which is to begin previews Oct. 16 ahead of a Nov. 11 opening.Pacino earned an Oscar nomination for portraying Ricky Roma in the 1992 film version of "Glengarry Glen Ross." He will now take on the role of Shelly Levene. This production marks the 30th anniversary of the play, which Mamet wrote in 1982. It premiered in the 1983-84 season at the Royal National Theatre in London. That same year, it made its American debut at Chicago's Goodman Theatre before moving to Broadway's Golden Theatre where it ran for 378 performances. "The stakes are high at a fly by night Chicago real estate office: 1st prize -- a new Cadillac, 2nd prize -- a set of steak knives, 3rd prize -- you're fired!" a synopsis said. "'Glengarry' slices to the core of the American dream and exposes the depths people will go to stay on top of the game."Pacino and Mamet most recently worked together on the HBO Phil Spector biopic, written and directed by Mamet and starring Pacino and Helen Mirren. It will premiere in 2013.Pacino was last seen on Broadway in "The Merchant of Venice" in 2010-11.

HAMILTON, Ontario, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- A fossil find in a cave in Serbia suggests Eastern Europe was an important pathway in human evolution as mankind spread out of Africa, scientists say.Canadian researchers, with partners from France, England and Serbia, have dated a partial lower human jaw as being almost 400,000 years old, and said it could be even a half-million years old.That makes the jawbone the easternmost European fossil of its age so far discovered, sharing far more in common with African and Asian fossils than with contemporary examples from Western Europe, the researchers said."During this time, humans in western Europe started to develop Neanderthal traits, which are lacking in this specimen," paleoanthropologist Mirjana Roksandic from the University of Winnipeg said. "Humans in southeastern Europe were never geographically isolated from Asia and Africa by glaciers and accordingly, this resulted in different evolutionary forces acting on early human populations in this region."The fossil lends weight to the possibility the Balkan Peninsula could have been a gateway in the movement of populations from Asia to Europe, the researchers said."This is opening up the window to study Eastern Europe as an important place in human evolution. It's important to all the modern European evolution that comes after that," Jack Rink of McMaster University in Ontario said. "This fossil being so old and coming from that place links it to fossils that came out of Africa not long before that, in the context of human development."The researched has been published in the open-access journal PLoS ONE.

WASHINGTON, July 13 (UPI) -- Afghanistan is now promoted to the exalted status of "major non-NATO ally" by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on one of her stopovers in a diplomatic marathon. She goes to sleep in her Air Force Boeing 757 cabin in one continent, wakes up in another -- aloft for74 days and on the ground in 44 countries so far this year.Clinton can be forgiven for not remembering what President George W. Bush did in 2004. That's when he anointed Pakistan, under President Pervez Musharraf, who has since gone into exile, with what subsequently became the dubious honor of "major non-NATO ally."Today, 74 percent of Pakistanis asked say they view the United States as the enemy, the latest Pew Global Attitudes Project indicates, up from 69 percent two years ago.In the interim, a U.S. Navy SEAL team found Osama bin Laden in his secret residence, near the Pakistani military academy -- and killed him.The United States also inadvertently killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Afghan border last November and Pakistan promptly closed NATO's two principal resupply routes from the port of Karachi to east and west entry points into Afghanistan.This cost the United States an additional $100 million a month to switch all traffic to the costlier northern route from the Baltic through Russia by rail, road and even by the Caspian Sea -- until the Pakistani demand for an abject U.S. apology was met.A U.S. grovel is what Pakistan said would reopen Afghan supply routes. But while the United States conceded bombing coordinates were misread by U.S. fighter bombers and gunships, the Pakistani military supplied erroneous information on the location of Taliban forces.Finally, the United States uttered a word short of the apology demanded -- "sorry" -- and the Pakistanis, in a phony burst of wounded pride salved, allowed truck convoys to inch forward as they were inspected for prohibited lethal weaponry and to collect a toll of $300-$500 depending on the size of the vehicle.Some of the three out of four Pakistanis who say the United States is the enemy of Islam and consider reconciliation tantamount to treason, moved forward slowly in what they called "a long march" -- actually two days -- by truck, bus, car and bicycle -- from Lahore to the front of Parliament House in Islamabad.Led by Sami ul-Haq, one of Pakistan's principal politico-religious leaders, and retired Gen. Hamid Gul, one-time head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, and other prominent "America Haters," the two-day march of tens of thousands of dissenters was designed to block NATO's now reopened supply routes through Pakistan.Sami ul-Haq also runs a large madrassa university (2,800 students) devoted to the "Education of Truth" where the all-Koranic curriculum is interspersed with messages of hate for the United States, India and Israel. He was a close friend of bin Laden and is a long-time friend of Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, long suspected of hiding near Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan, under an ISI security blanket.Both bin Laden and Mullah Omar gave commencement addresses at Sami ul-Haq's university in the spring of 2001, four months before Sept 11.Addressing the marchers in Rawalpindi this week, Sami ul-Haq said the best interest of Pakistan and Ummah (community of Islamist states) is in ridding itself of "U.S. slavery and liberating Afghanistan from American control." Speaker after speaker said U.S. supply trucks for the war effort in Afghanistan "must be stopped."All the familiar themes against U.S. drones, "secretly authorized by the Pakistani traitors now in power," were trotted out with banners and shouted slogans against American "terrorism," all organized by the newly minted "Defense of Pakistan Council."Munawwar Hasan, head of Jamat-e-Islami told a UPI correspondent that the march wasn't only aimed "at salvaging Pakistan but also the whole Muslim Ummah because it was launched to end U.S. slavery in the Muslim world and the plunder of its resources.""Death to America," shouted speaker after speaker, including several who are on Pakistan's most wanted list of terrorists but police made no move to arrest them. Gul called for the arrest of the CIA station chief in Islamabad.Hafiz Saeed, chief of the banned Jamaat Ud Dawa, the most-wanted terrorist planner for the 2008 Mumbai massacre (209 killed and 700 injured), was the star attraction. He lived up to his billing with an outburst berating the government for "giving in to the American diktat" and pledged to take the fight against "U.S. hegemony to the finish."The purpose of the Defense of Pakistan Council, explained Saeed, "is to free the homeland from U.S. slavery by all means at our disposal."Hasan added that "those who want to befriend the U.S. and were happy with U.S. slavery should stay away." JI's Munawar Hassan accused the United States of sponsoring terrorism. And so it went as all of Pakistan's principal politico-religious leaders joined the march.One speaker -- Hafiz Saeed -- said the alliance of the patriotic parties in the DPC was "a blessing of Allah as they joined hands and came out to protect national and Islamic interests." He recalled the uphill ordeal of the Muslim army in the Battle of Tabook, some 1,500 years ago, against the alliance of Christian Western nations, "but the help of Allah finally arrived because Muslims had showed unwavering trust in Him."Leaders of the "Long March" said it will force the United States to seek in its ranks "the real apology from America and pay compensation to the martyrs of the Pakistani army."The next attraction by the America-haters is scheduled next week. The long "marchers" plan to drive from Peshawar to Torkham, the border post in the Khyber Pass prior to entering Afghanistan.Moving billions of dollars worth of U.S. equipment out of Afghanistan through 700 miles of Pakistan to Karachi will now be far too dangerous. The northern route through former Soviet republics and Russia to Baltic and German ports is safer -- and costlier.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (UPI) -- Republican challenger Mitt Romney has a slight lead nationally over President Obama, but was still in the margin of error in a Politico poll released Monday.Results of the Politico-George Washington University Battleground Tracking Poll of likely voters indicated Romney led Obama by 2 percentage points, 49 percent to 47 percent, but the race remained in a virtual dead heat because the lead was within the margin of error.In the 10 states identified by Politico as competitive, Romney led 50 percent to 48 percent. Politico considers Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin as the 10 competitive battleground states.On a generic congressional ballot, Republicans tied Democrats at 46 percent after trailing slightly during the past six weeks, results indicated.Regardless of which candidate they back, 51 percent of registered voters said they think Obama will win the election and 37 percent said Romney, results indicated.Results are based on nationwide polling Oct. 14-18 of 1,000 registered voters who said they were likely to vote in the election. The margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Veteran journalist Bob Woodward, half of The Washington Post's famous Watergate team, says he received a threatening email from a senior White House aide.In his "Behind the Curtain" column, Woodward, a prolific political author, said Gene Sperling, economic adviser to President Obama, messaged him that he would "regret" questioning the administration's version on how the forced federal spending cuts known as sequestration came about.The $85 billion in across-the-board federal budget cuts go into effect over the next few months if an agreement is not reached by Friday.Woodward said in his 2012 best-selling book "The Price of Politics" that the idea for the sequester began in the White House, something the president denied and that the White House later acknowledged."They're not happy at all," Woodward said Wednesday on CNN's "The Situation Room." "It was said very clearly, you will regret doing this."Woodward and Sperling have known each other for decades, beginning when Sperling was an economic adviser in the Clinton administration. Politico obtained emails exchanged between the men Feb. 22-23 in which Sperling apologized for "raising my voice in our conversation today." He said the two just did "not see eye to eye here.""But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying that Potus [president of the United States] asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim. The idea of that the sequester was to force both sides to go back to try at a big or grand bargain with a mix of entitlements and revenues..."Woodward messaged back, "Gene: You do not ever have to apologize to me. You get wound up because you are making your points and you believe them. This is all part of a serious discussion. I for one welcome a little heat; there should be more given the importance."

BENGHAZI, Libya, March 6 (UPI) -- Civic leaders in eastern Libya declared semi-autonomy for the oil-rich region of Cyrenaica at a meeting attended by some 2,000 people, observers said.Supporters of the move said the region has been neglected for decades and residents should be in charge of local matters, the BBC reported Tuesday.It is not clear what degree of autonomy the region is seeking and will likely be the subject of debate with the governing National Transitional Council in Tripoli over the coming months, the BBC said.Libya's National Transitional Council has argued against federalism on grounds it could resulting in breaking up the country.

Gregg Popovich (born January 28, 1949) is an American basketball coach, and is currently the head coach of the National Basketball Association's San Antonio Spurs. He is often referred to as "Coach Pop" or simply "Pop."
Popovich, whose father was of Serbian and mother of Croatian descent, was born in East Chicago, Indiana, went to High School at Merrillville High School and was graduated in 1970 from the United States Air Force Academy. He played basketball for four seasons at the Academy, and in his senior year was the team captain and the leading scorer.

In 1972, he was selected as the Captain of the Armed Forces Team, which won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship. This earned him an invitation to the 1972 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team trials	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Wiki
Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish writer and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. Today he is remembered for his epigrams, plays and the circumstances of his imprisonment, followed by his early death.
Wilde's parents were successful Dublin intellectuals, and their son showed his intelligence early by becoming fluent in French and German. At university Wilde read Greats; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Dublin, then at Oxford. He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of aestheticism (led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin), though he also profoundly explored Roman Catholicism, to which he would later convert on his deathbed. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States of America and Canada on the new "English Renaissance in Art", and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress, and glittering conversation, Wilde had become one of the most well-known personalities of his day.
At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
