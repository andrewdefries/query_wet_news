BRISBANE, Australia, July 7 (UPI) -- Fuel derived from eucalyptus trees could be the fuel of the future for the airline sector, says Virgin Group Chief Executive Officer Richard Branson.Virgin Australia, the country's second biggest airline, announced it was working with Melbourne's Renewable Oil Corp. and Vancouver's Dynamotive Energy Systems to work toward developing a commercial plant in Western Australia to create biofuel.The consortium plans to use fast pyrolysis technology developed by Dynamotive to process the native mallee species of the eucalyptus tree.Speaking Wednesday at the Asia Pacific Cities Summit in Brisbane, Branson said, "Obviously Australia has a lot of eucalyptus trees and, if we are correct, it would be a wonderful fuel for the future which won't eat into the food supply," The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reports.Renewable Oil, which identified the mallee tree as a promising biofuel feedstock, is Dynamotive's Australian partner and develops biofuel projects in Australia.Virgin Australia Chief Executive Officer John Borghetti said the company has been working with stakeholders across the industry the last few years to research and develop bio-derived renewable fuels that can "progressively replace" conventional aviation fuels."We believe this new project has great potential given the results with the technology and the availability of this unique Australian feedstock. It is also particularly attractive to Virgin Australia because it aligns with our commitment to supporting the Australian economy and environment, and encouraging Australian innovation," Borghetti said in a statement.The demonstration unit is expected to be operational next year, followed by the construction of a commercial-scale plant, which could be operational as early as 2014.A recent study by Australia's national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, claimed that biofuels for the aviation sector could slash Australia's reliance on fuel imports by $2 billion a year and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent.In 2009, the European airline sector pledged to slash emissions in half by 2050.In a news conference at the Brisbane conference, Branson addressed his concerns regarding Australia's proposed carbon tax, the details of which are to be released Sunday by the government."Any tax should be done on a global basis, I think ideally, not on a country-by-country basis," he said. Pointing to the next U.N.-sponsored climate change meeting in Durban, South Africa in December, Branson said he hoped for a global solution on carbon emissions that "doesn't disadvantage individual countries or individual companies."

NEW YORK, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein was reported seriously ill in a New York hospital Friday.A source close to Wasserstein said the 55-year-old single mother was diagnosed with leukemia and has not been able to receive chemotherapy because of an infection, the New York Daily News reported."There's a percentage chance of survival," the source said, "and our hope is that she can fight this off. But it's very serious."Wasserstein won a 1989 Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award for "The Heidi Chronicles." Her eighth play to be staged in New York is "Third," starring Dianne Wiest.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla., July 26 (UPI) -- U.S. researchers found post-menopausal women -- a group at high risk of heart attack and stroke -- who ate two apples a day had 25 percent lower cholesterol.A team of researchers at Florida State University said the study involved 160 women who had been through the menopause. Half ate 75 grams a day of dried apple -- the equivalent of two medium-sized fresh apples -- and the other half were told to eat the same quantity of prunes.Each volunteer underwent blood tests every three months for one year, the researchers said.The study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, showed that after three months total cholesterol levels in the group that ate apples dropped by 9 percent and low-density lipoprotein, the "bad," cholesterol, dropped by 16 percent, The Daily Telegraph reported.Levels were even lower after six months, with total cholesterol down 13 percent and low-density lipoprotein levels dropped by 24 percent, the study said.The prunes lowered cholesterol levels slightly but not to the same extent as the dried apple.

LOS GILES, Spain, April 28 (UPI) -- A woman in Spain recently gave birth to the first child born in the village of Los Giles in 45 years, causing a stir in the village.First-time parents Beatriz and Iker gave birth to Ainara in the village in Spain's Almeria province three weeks ago, thinkSPAIN reported.The couple has lived all over Spain but settled in Los Giles so their child could grow up close to her maternal grandparents and "grow up close to nature," the couple said.Los Giles has a predominantly older population as no one in the village of about 60 people has given birth since 1968.Beatriz and Iker say they take Ainara on daily walks in the village so the older residents can meet her."Everyone's really pleased -- this is a celebration," one Los Giles resident said.Ainara has been held by nearly all of the village's residents and neighbors constantly stop by the family's home to visit, her parents said.

AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- A free throw by A.J. Abrams with 10 seconds remaining Thursday finally wrapped up a 68-64 victory for No. 8 Texas over ninth-ranked UCLA.The Bruins came back from a 16-point deficit to take a 62-60 lead with 5:32 to play on a jumper by Josh Shipp and then managed only two more points the rest of the way. UCLA missed eight of its last nine shots from the field along with its only free throw attempt.UCLA's only basket during the final 5 minutes came from Alfred Aboya with 2:17 to go. It brought the Bruins to within a point.Abrams made two free throws with 1:49 left to give the Longhorns a 67-64 lead and neither team could score until Abrams made one out of two foul shots with 10 seconds left.Abrams led the Longhorns (6-1) with 31 points and Damion James had 13. No other Texas player managed more than six.UCLA (4-2) was paced by Darren Collison with 22 points, but he made just nine of 22 attempts from the field.

OTTAWA, May 20 (UPI) -- Colin Greening scored 7:39 into the second overtime Sunday and Ottawa bounced back in its second-round playoff series with a 2-1 win over Pittsburgh. The Senators, trailing 2-0 in the Western Conference semifinal series, seemed destined to fall again, trailing 1-0 with less than a minute remaining in regulation and Pittsburgh on a power play.Ottawa Coach Paul MacLean then pulled goalie Craig Anderson to add an attacker for a 5-on-5 situation, and the move paid off.Daniel Alfredsson took a pass from Milan Michalek and backhanded a shot over the shoulder of Penguins netminder Tomas Vokoun with 28.6 seconds left for the equalizer.After a scoreless first overtime, Ottawa struck 7:39 into second extra frame when Andre Benoit launched a shot at Vokoun and Greening was there to backhand the rebound into the net.Anderson turned aside 49-of-50 shots for the Sens, who took the longest game of the current post-season. Tyler Kennedy scored and Vokoun ended with 46 stops of the Penguins, who will again attempt to put a stranglehold on the series in Wednesday's Game 4.

UNITED NATIONS {WOMENSENEWS}--Charles Dinda is conducting an experiment.With funding from the Danish Institute for Human Rights, the Zambian legal researcher and human rights activist is carrying out a pilot project in the country's southern and eastern provinces that links paralegals trained in formal court systems with local tribal courts.One goal is to bolster the justice that women receive in traditional tribunals for complaints of sexual violence, divorce, custody and inheritance.The paralegals come from the same rural areas to which they are assigned. They offer free legal advice and counseling on human rights, targeting women in their advocacy outreach.Read more at Women's eNewsThey are also training local leaders to recognize cases beyond their jurisdiction--such as child abduction or murder--for referral to state-run, local courts. Since the pilot program launched about a year ago, more of these cases are being referred to state-run courts, Dinda said."Right now the environment is not very good in Zambia but a lot is changing," he said. "In our draft constitution and bill of rights there has been an increase of enlisting discussion of human rights and the local courts are, little by little, becoming more receptive to this idea, to see that women are given a fair deal."In many parts of rural Zambia, a woman with a dispute she can't resolve on her own will be funneled into a traditional court, mandated by traditional leaders who are seldom formally trained in governance or human rights.Male Run Courts"In most cases a woman at a traditional court will find that she is going to face nine men against one woman, because the courts are predominately male run," Dinda said in a phone interview from Zambia. "Then, traditionally, a woman is not supposed to challenge any male person or her husband, so when she is challenged by the court that can make her claims very difficult to back."Traditional justice systems--also called informal or customary-- function outside the sphere of official state laws and handle about 80 percent of disputes in most developing countries, according to U.N. Women.Driven by cultural and religious traditions, they have long been studied by anthropologists. Now they're attracting growing notice by human rights activists and researchers interested in improving the legal treatment of women."We are starting to provide a framework, so we can look at the strengths and weaknesses of these systems and in five or 10 years we can get a better basis for comparison," said Fergus Kerrigan, lead author of a January 2013 report on informal justice systems and human rights. A group of U.N. agencies commissioned the report from the Danish Institute for Human Rights.Rural women in much of the world cannot access official courts. "They are too far away, too expensive," Kerrigan said. "We see more potential in trying to reform informal justice systems in a positive way than say we are going to abolish these and expect that everybody can go to a state court because that is just unrealistic."Gender Cases ReferredTraditional rulers in some places will refer gender-specific cases to their nation's formal courts. Male-dominated indigenous legal councils in Ecuador, for instance, will do this with rape cases.In some cases, informal justice affords women a higher degree of legal protection than state courts and laws.In Niger, for example, communities that adhere to Sharia, or Islamic law, and not state law, will grant women rights to some portion of inherited family land in her name, which official law in Niger does not do. Yet Sharia also permits polygamy and limits a woman's ability in rural Niger to independently seek a divorce.While women often face overwhelmingly male power structures, Juan Carlos Botero, executive director of the Washington-based World Justice Project, cautions against generalizing about the up-or-down treatment of women in these informal systems."There are traditions where male dominance has been part of the culture, and in general the elders of the community are men, so that may create a bias," said Botero in a phone interview. "But in Liberia, for example, there are female chiefs, too."In Rwanda and Malawi, the strong participation of female mediators and judges in informal justice has encouraged female victims of violence to step forward, the January 2013 U.N.-sponsored report found.Traditional courts in Uganda, South Africa, Bangladesh and Papa New Guinea have all set quotas for female representation.Yet Papa New Guinea, for instance, still has a state law that criminalizes sorcery. And a United Nations investigator in March noted that women are disproportionately targeted as victims of violent attacks by those targeting suspected sorcerers.In Colombia, the indigenous Kogi people mostly appoint male traditional justice heads, but sometimes women serve the role, as well, and have the chance of a fair hearing, said the World Justice Project's Botero.Read more at Women's eNews

| License Photo	BOSTON, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- The extended hospitalization of Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino has tongues wagging about possible successors, observers said.Menino, who will turn 70 next month, has been mayor for nearly 20 years and has not yet announced if he will run for a sixth term, the Boston Herald reported Wednesday.Menino has been in the hospital for three weeks since returning early from Italy, and his doctors on Tuesday were vague about his condition.A virus has "lifted," his doctor said, and a blood clot has been fixed.The mayor has been fitted with a back brace for a fractured vertebra, but his pain level has increased in the past few days.His doctors have not set any timetable for his release.Still, don't count out the mayor to run for a sixth term next year, an aide says."No one should underestimate him ever," Menino spokeswoman Dot Joyce said. "The guy just loves his job."Democratic strategist Michael Goldman said "the only people talking about him not being a candidate are those who want to be a candidate."Hopefuls seen as likely to jump into any potential race are seven city councilors, a state representative, the current and former Suffolk County attorney, the Suffolk County sheriff and the state's top transportation official.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is ready to announce reforms to the National Security Agency's data collection programs, the White House said Friday.White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Obama will address the issue in a speech next Friday.The NSA's extensive data collection programs were revealed by former agency contractor Edward Snowden, who spirited documents detailing NSA surveillance out of the country when he fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia where he has temporary asylum.Obama has been mulling changes since the revelations began last summer."It is absolutely being seriously considered," a senior administration official said of a proposal by a presidential task force to end the NSA's bulk collection of phone records and instead force it to do focused searches of data held elsewhere."This is really crunch time," Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has advocated for a major surveillance overhaul, told the Journal."This is when major decisions about the new rules as it relates to surveillance are going to be made," he said.Obama is expected to back a mix of executive actions and measures that would require congressional approval, the officials told the Journal.Carney told reporters Thursday he expected Obama would announce some reforms that he would "want to act on, or want the government to act, on right away."There will be others that he may decide should not be acted on, and there may be some that would require further review," Carney said.Obama and top administration and congressional officials held a flurry of meetings on surveillance reform this week.The meetings with lawmakers, intelligence officials, privacy and civil liberties advocates, and others included a gathering Friday with technology firms to hear their concerns, White House officials said without identifying the firms.The meeting was billed as a follow-up to Obama's Dec. 17 session with more than a dozen technology executives, including Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Yahoo! Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Google Inc. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, a tech representative told Politico.Many of the companies urged Obama after the meeting to "move aggressively" on NSA reform.The string of meetings is part of a broad review by Obama and other White House officials of 46 wide-ranging recommendations by the task force, which Obama assembled to assess the nation's surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities.The panel's Dec. 18 recommendations include revamping the NSA's phone-records collection program, as well as the process of foreign spying."Any decision to engage in surveillance of the leaders of a foreign nation must be taken with great care," the report says. The group further recommends the administration consider informal arrangements with close allies to govern spying on each other's citizens.The report also proposes making the NSA director a Senate-confirmed post and creating a "public advocate" to argue against the government's case in the secret U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.Snowden was invited Thursday by a European Parliament committee to testify via video link as part of an investigation into how to protect the privacy of European citizens.The Justice and Civil Liberties Committee did not propose a date for the testimony. It was not immediately clear if Snowden would accept the invitation.
