MOSCOW, July 2 (UPI) -- Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin has demanded an investigation of the Bank of Moscow, amidst accusations of fraudulent loans.One-third of the bank's assets -- valued at $9 billion -- were discovered to be bad loans, forcing the Russian central bank to give the Bank of Moscow a $14 billion rescue loan at 0.5 percent interest, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Saturday.The Financial Times reported the bad assets were uncovered as VTB increased its stake in the bank to 46.5 percent through a hostile bid.The bailout is the largest bank rescue in Russian history, sparking a round of accusations seemingly from all corners.Investors accused the central bank of lax oversight. Others wondered how VTB could make such an enormous purchase without a thorough investigation first.Former Bank of Moscow President Andrei Borodin -- in London, fleeing a warrant for his arrest -- said the takeover of the bank was politically motivated. In Moscow, VTB charged the Bank of Moscow with "fraudulent lending," the BBC said.Borodin and business partner Lev Allaluyev owned 20.3 percent of the bank. For the past month, they rejected VTB's offers and, instead, sold out their shares to businessman Vitaly Yusufov. The terms of the bailout include a nominal 0.5 percent interest on a five-year loan. VTB is also expected to increases its share in the bank to 75 percent.

OCEANSIDE, Calif., Dec. 27 (UPI) -- A broken water main is being blamed for a flood and sinkhole that swallowed a municipal bus in California.As water flooded several streets in Oceanside, Calif., early Wednesday, onlookers told KGTV-San Diego they saw a bus slowly creeping along. The water hid a treacherous sinkhole and one resident who'd stepped out onto his balcony to see what the commotion was about said he watched the bus pitch forward into the depression."You could see the water. You didn't know it was a sinkhole," said Kevin Russell, who lives in an apartment complex overlooking the flooded street. "The bus just kind of creeped in and went down."The bus driver was the only person on the vehicle. He escaped through a side window unharmed.

| License Photo	ACAPULCO, Mexico, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Rafael Nadal's camp is denying reports Tuesday the world No. 5-ranked tennis player will skip two ATP Masters tournaments next month.It was reported that Nadal would miss the Masters tournaments in Indian Wells, Calif., on March 4-11 and the March 18-25 event in Miami because of ongoing issues with his right knee.But Nadal's publicist Benito Perez-Barbadillo Jerez issued a posting Tuesday on Twitter that the report was based on speculation.Nadal has said recently he would only play in clay-court events, including this week's Abierto Mexicano Tercel in Acapulco, Mexico, through the French Open. The Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami are on hard courts.Nadal was sidelined the second half of the 2012 schedule because of tendinitis in his right knee. He has played in two tournaments this year, finishing runner-up to Horacio Zeballos in Chile and winning the ATP stop in Sao Paulo. Both of those tournaments were on clay.He says the knee is improving but he's going to be cautious with it."It's better and I've been able to compete but it's still bothering me," he said in Acapulco. "It's better on some days and worse on others, which isn't ideal for someone like me, because my idea of competing is based on giving it all at all times."He said he will limit his play to clay courts through the French Open in May. Nadal has won the French Open each of the last three years. He's won seven French Open titles 2005-12. He missed the 2009 French Open because of a knee injury.Nadal was a semifinalist at both Indian Wells and Miami last year.

MOSCOW, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- Russia has tested the world's most powerful vacuum bomb on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the horrendous Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Famous Russian author Anton Chekhov once wrote: "If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off." The latest vacuum-bomb test, which was bound to be developed sooner or later, is a warning to all potential enemies. The world had amassed so many weapons in the 20th century that they must be used, no matter what. The 34 major and small wars fought in the 1990s include Operation Desert Storm, two campaigns in Chechnya, a self-proclaimed republic in the North Caucasus, and a violent conflict in Yugoslavia. Efforts to combat terrorism, an omnipresent threat, have become a top priority. Although humanity has not invented an alternative to the use of weapons, pitched battles involving fronts, armies, corps and divisions are now history. A study of recent and future conflicts shows that they feature fast combat operations in small sectors lacking clear boundaries. Moreover, the situation can change at a breathtaking pace.Reconnaissance and target-acquisition systems are now entering the spotlight. It will no longer be necessary to deploy tank armadas and hundreds of artillery pieces per every kilometer of the front. Massive strikes are giving way to precision-guided weapons for hitting relatively small enemy units and installations. For obvious reasons, nuclear weapons will continue to play the part of deterrent, but conventional arms packing nearly the same devastating punch are now called on to accomplish strategic objectives. Both the United States and Russia are moving to upgrade conventional weaponry. Two years ago, Washington decided to install conventional warheads on Trident-2 submarine-launched missiles. But the Pentagon encountered serious political problems and was eventually forced to scrap the program. Now the U.S. military is developing the long-awaited penetration bombs capable of destroying hardened bunkers. Moscow is focusing on the rather exotic vacuum bombs, which have been around for quite a while. The United States used vacuum bombs in the 1960s during the Vietnam War. Russian-made TOS-1 heavy flame-thrower systems fired thermobaric warheads at Mujahideen positions in the 1980s and were also used to hit Chechen separatists in the 1990s and early 2000s. Vacuum bombs are also known as thermobaric munitions containing volatile hydrocarbon mixtures. They are released when the bomb explodes about 10 meters, or more than 30 feet, above ground level, mix with oxygen in the atmosphere and form a highly explosive aerosol cloud 20 meters, or more than 60 feet, in diameter and 3 meters, or more than nine feet, high. The cloud detonates 100-140 milliseconds later. The explosion causes a supersonic shock wave traveling at 3 kilometers per second, or 2,160 miles per hour,and causing excessive pressure of up to 30 kilograms, or 66 pounds, per square centimeter. Deep vacuum is formed after the explosion cloud sucks out the air and solid particles. The blast forms a distinctive mushroom cloud most commonly associated with nuclear munitions. When the United States used a large vacuum bomb in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, the press said a tactical nuclear warhead had been detonated. Although thermobaric bomb components cannot effectively destroy various obstacles, they are used with devastating results on military personnel. In some cases, these aerosol clouds do not explode due to rain or powerful winds but can, nonetheless, seep into every crack and poison all living things. After the explosion, the survivors are subjected to a powerful shock wave and deep vacuum. According to doctors, such munitions cause very characteristic wounds, such as contusions and blindness; they also pierce eardrums, burn lungs and the respiratory tract, cause numerous internal bleeding, dislocate and rupture internal organs. Nuclear weapons can also produce a certain vacuum effect. For example, two nuclear warheads could explode in a preset area in quick succession; the second explosion would take place in an extremely dense environment and would cause much greater destruction than normally expected. --(Andrei Kislyakov is a political commentator for RIA Novosti.

CLEVELAND, Oct. 28 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were tied in the battleground state of Ohio, a newspaper poll released Sunday concluded.The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer and Ohio Newspaper Poll said both candidates had 49 percent of the vote in the state, which is considered a key swing state with enough electoral votes to be potentially decisive.The same poll Sept. 23 had Obama with a 5-percentage point lead.The Plain Dealer said Ohio has been awash in political advertising and campaign workers have been scouring the state to make sure every possible voters makes it to the polls on Election Day.The small number of undecided voters so late in the game has made rallying likely supporters a major priority for both campaigns."Absent any more twists and turns, a remarkable presidential campaign may end with the campaign that executes the best ground game, narrowly delivering Ohio for the next president of the United States," said Eric Rademacher, co-director of the University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research.The poll released Sunday was conducted by telephone Oct. 18-23 among 1,015 likely voters. The margin of error was pegged at 3.1 percentage points.The Plain Dealer said some of the respondents were contacted before the Oct. 22 presidential debate but it did not appear reaction to the debate influenced the overall poll results.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 (UPI) -- U.S. President Obama granted clemency to 21 people Thursday in the form of eight commutations and 13 pardons, the White House said.Obama's clemency decision commutes prison terms of several people serving life sentences for drug crimes. In an accompanying statement, Obama said many of the inmates who will be released would have received lesser sentences if they had been convicted of the same crimes today."Today, I am commuting the prison terms of eight men and women who were sentenced under an unfair system," Obama said. "Each of them has served more than 15 years in prison. In several cases, the sentencing judges expressed frustration that the law at the time did not allow them to issue punishments that more appropriately fit the crime."Three years ago, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which he said "dramatically" narrowed the gap between penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. "Commuting the sentences of these eight Americans is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness. But it must not be the last," Obama said. "In the new year, lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress.""Today the president of the United States made a significant and major breakthrough in the unfair mandatory sentencing disparities for crack cocaine offenders in this country," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights advocate. "President Obama gave a holiday gift that many of us have labored to see, and we celebrate this step towards a more just judicial system."

ZURICH, Switzerland, Aug. 26 (UPI) -- Drive-through "sex boxes" were opening in Zurich Monday to try to reduce blatant prostitution and organized crime and protect women, Swiss officials said.Nine of the so-called sex boxes, able to accommodate one car at a time, are located in the city's Sihlqai district, where residents have complained at length about on-street prostitution, The Independent of Britain reported.Each garage-sized box has alarm buttons and a security guard presence. Customers drive in, choose one of the prostitutes at work there, negotiate a price, then park in a box."Prostitution is a business. We cannot prohibit it, so we want to control it in favor of the sex workers and the population," said Michael Herzig, a Zurich social services director. "If we do not control it, organized crime and the pimps will take over."Slightly more than 52 percent of Zurich's voters approved of plans to introduce sex-boxes in a referendum in March 2012. The boxes cost about $2.1 million to install and $749,000 to run annually.Switzerland's right-wing Swiss People's Party opposed the move, The Independent said."It will not work, either because the clients will not come or because the site will not be used by prostitutes," said party politician Sven Dogwiler. "It puts them in a cleaner environment but one which is subsidized by taxpayers."In Germany, sex boxes have been operating in designated big-city areas since 2001 and reportedly led to a "considerable drop" in violence against prostitutes, The Independent said.

Wiki
Adam Alexander Loewen (born April 9, 1984 in Surrey, British Columbia) is a Canadian outfielder and first baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays, and formerly a pitcher. He bats and throws left-handed. He is 6'6" tall and weighs 220 pounds.
Loewen grew up in Surrey, British Columbia, and was both a starting pitcher and first baseman for the team that represented Canada at the 1996 Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He would go on to attend Fraser Valley Christian High School and play baseball for the Fraser Valley Chiefs of the British Columbia Premier Baseball League. While playing for the Chiefs, Loewen was selected with the No. 4 overall pick of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. This was the highest a Canadian player had ever been drafted until righthander Jameson Taillon was drafted 2nd overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Loewen went on to play one season with Chipola College, but signed a Major League Baseball contract with Baltimore worth $4.02 million shortly thereafter. In 2004, he was named their top prospect by Baseball America. However, by early 2006, he had been downgraded to the team's second best prospect.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
