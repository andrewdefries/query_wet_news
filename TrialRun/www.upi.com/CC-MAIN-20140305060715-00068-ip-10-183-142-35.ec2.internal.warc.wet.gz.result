WASHINGTON, March 14 (UPI) -- The Keystone XL oil pipeline can't be in the U.S. national interest because U.S. refiners processing Canadian crude will export the oil, an opponent said.Oil Change International, a group opposed to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, said government data suggest more than half of the refineries that would receive Canadian crude oil from the pipeline export most of their products.Supporters of Keystone XL say the project would help ensure North American energy independence by utilizing more regional oil reserves. Oil Change International, however, challenges that logic, citing export data from southern U.S. refiners."It is now clear that the Keystone XL pipeline is a pipeline through America not to America," the group stated.A U.S. State Department review of the pipeline dampened environmental criticism of the pipeline but said domestic oil market dynamics and transit infrastructure like rail should be considered when assessing the need for Keystone XL.Statements from Oil Change come as Republicans pressure U.S. President Barack Obama to sign off on the project. Presidential consent is needed because the pipeline would cross the U.S.-Canadian border.The Hill, a Washington newspaper, reports that Obama told House Republicans that a decision was expected soon. The Hill reports Republicans were divided, however, on where the president stands on the project.

CHICAGO, Nov. 23 (UPI) -- A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study found Botox boosts overall quality of life and self-esteem, U.S. researchers say. Dr. Steven H. Dayan, a Chicago facial plastic surgeon, says study participants were photographed and randomized to receive injections of Botox between the eyebrows, forehead and crow's feet or injections of a saline solution. It is not uncommon after Botox treatment for patients to report an increase in satisfaction with their appearance and feeling happier. All participants finished a health outcomes survey consisting of a quality-of-life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire, before Botox injections, two weeks after and three months after injections.The study, published in the journal Dermatologic Surgery, found statistically significant improvements in participants treated with Botox Cosmetic were observed in answers to questions pertaining to physical health, mood, household activities, overall life satisfaction, body satisfaction, self-consciousness, intellect, self-worth, appearance, comprehension, weight satisfaction, attractiveness and sense of well-being. "We have long known the physically enhancing benefits of Botox treatments, but to now have data that indicates Botox also improves one psyche, self-esteem and quality of life is very significant," Dayan of the Chicago Center for Facial Plastic Surgery says in a statement.

| License Photo	PITTSBURGH, June 22 (UPI) -- A U.S. study suggests humans are more likely related to orangutans and not chimpanzees, as is commonly proposed.Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and the Buffalo Museum of Science said they view as "problematic" the popular suggestion, based on DNA analysis, that humans are most closely related to chimpanzees. They said that hypothesis is not supported by fossil evidence.University of Pittsburgh Professor Jeffrey Schwartz and John Grehan, director of science at the Buffalo museum, conducted a detailed analysis of the physical features of living and fossil apes. They said their findings suggest humans, orangutans and early apes belong to a group separate from chimpanzees and gorillas.Schwartz and Grehan scrutinized hundreds of physical characteristics often cited as evidence of evolutionary relationships among humans and other great apes and selected 63 that could be verified as unique since they do not appear in other primates. Of those features, the analysis found humans shared 28 unique physical characteristics with orangutans, compared with only two features with chimpanzees.The study is detailed in the Journal of Biogeography.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Jury selection began Monday in the Charlottesville, Va., trial of ex-University of Virginia lacrosse player George Huguely in the death of a former girlfriend.Yeardley Love, who also played lacrosse for UVA, was found dead in a pool of blood nearly two years ago in her off-campus apartment.A street was closed near the courthouse to accommodate a large media presence at the trial. TV trucks crowded the area and more than 150 reporters had registered for 30 seats in the courtroom, The Washington Post said.Police say Huguely, 24, of Chevy Chase, Md., admitted in a videotaped statement he kicked through Love's bedroom door May 3, 2010, and engaged in a physical altercation with the 22-year-old woman. He is charged with first-degree murder, felony murder in a robbery or attempted robbery, robbery of a residence, burglary, entering a house with intent to commit a felony and grand larceny.Defense attorneys are expected to argue Love, of Cockeysville, Md., did not die of blunt-force trauma to the head and instead suggest she could have died from an irregular heartbeat related to the prescription drug Adderall, the newspaper said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UPI) -- Iran may face increasing consequences should it decide to continue shirking its international nuclear and human rights obligations, a U.S. official said.U.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order implementing parts of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the measure broadens certain aspects of sanctions on Iranian authorities while tightening sanctions targeting the country's energy sector."It builds on the sanctions that have been imposed on the Iranian government, and provides for additional sanctions on activities related to Iran's energy and financial sectors, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, support for terrorism and activities related to human rights abuses by Iran and Syria, among other things," he said in a statement.Obama signed the act into law in August. His executive order created the foundation for the enforcement of sanctions. Vietor said Iran may face additional "consequences" should it continue "its defiance."Washington and its European allies last month accused Iran of supporting the Syrian military amid growing frustration with Tehran's role in the international community.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice had said Iranian support for the "murderous" regime in Damascus was "of particular concern."

LIBERTY, Texas, Nov. 28 (UPI) -- Jared Len Cruise has been found guilty of participating in the gang rape of an 11-year-old Cleveland, Texas, girl.The verdict was offered Wednesday by a jury in Liberty County. Cruse faces a sentence of 25 to 99 years in prison, the Houston Chronicle reported.Cruse, now 20, is the second of 20 defendants to be tried for allegedly sexually assaulting the girl over the course of four months in 2010. Eric McGowan was the first; he was judged guilty and received a 99-year sentence. Seven juveniles received probation and six adults each receive sentences of 15 years after pleading guilty in exchange for plea deals, the newspaper said.In closing remarks defense attorney Steve Taylor pointed out testimony from the girl in which she answered "yes sir" to a question of whether she was a willing participant in the assaults."She told you she was a willing participant, but they [the prosecution] will tell you the law doesn't care," he said.Prosecutors said the law provides no excuse for sex with children, and noted evidence in the trial included a videotape, made by the alleged participants, of a sexual assault."Look how proud he [Cruse] is on that video," said prosecutor Joe Warren in closing remarks, adding that rarely in his criminal trial work can he present an actual video of a crime being committed.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- U.S. military leaders said mandated budget cuts would have serious consequences, including the curtailing of training for 80 percent of the ground forces.U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno said the $46 billion in cuts to the Pentagon in the sequester deal between the White House and Congress would force him to extend deployments of troops in Afghanistan."If we have to reduce the amount of training we give our pilots, they will go in with a hell of a lot less capability. That means mistakes will be made. That means we'll have accidents. That means we'll be more likely to be shot down by enemy fire," he said. The Washington Post said the U.S. Navy delayed the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf as a result of the looming cuts and U.S. Air Force representatives said reductions would force the cutting of 200,000 flying hours. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta notified 800,000 employees Wednesday that they may face a 20 percent pay cut if furloughs are implemented as a result of the sequester, the Post reported.

EDMONTON, Alberta, Dec. 31 (UPI) -- A 29-year-old man savagely beaten on a light-rail train in Edmonton, Alberta, has died and his alleged assailant will be charged with murder, authorities say.John Hollar died Sunday night, two days after he was attacked in front of about a dozen witnesses, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. At least two passengers tried to intervene in some fashion, while others made emergency phone calls, the Edmonton Journal reported."From the beginning of the fight to the end, it seemed very one-sided," city police homicide Detective Colin Derksen said Monday. "It appears that Mr. Hollar was just trying to avoid the situation and get away." The two men apparently knew each other, but it wasn't clear what led to the beating.The Journal said the mid-afternoon assault went on for a time despite the train's driver announcing over the train's public address system police were en route.When officers arrived, Hollar was unconscious. The alleged assailant, Jeremy Newborn, 29, tried to flee but was arrested nearby, the newspaper said. He was held on an aggravated-assault charge police said would be upgraded to second-degree murder at his next court appearance, Jan. 14.

PLASTER ROCK, New Brunswick, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- Two fires burning after a CN Rail train derailed in New Brunswick have burned out, allowing evacuated residents to return home, officials say.The controlled-burn fires were started Friday in an effort to make it easier to move the derailed train cars after the fires were extinguished Saturday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.CN spokesman Jim Feeny said crews have removed the derailed cars from scene and work has begun to repair the damaged track.Nine of the train's 122 cars derailed near Plaster Rock Tuesday. The train was carrying oil."Investigators found a cracked wheel on a car near the front of the train. This wheel moved on the axle and lost track gauge, resulting in the derailment of that wheel set. There was also a broken rail," investigators reported. Local officials met with nearby residents at about 11 a.m. Saturday to update them on the situation.Evacuees, except those who live within a 330 feet safety zone have been allowed to return to their homes.

Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko (Belarusian: Аляксандр Рыгоравіч Лукашэнка, ; Romanized: Alyaksandr Ryhoravich Lukashenka; Russian: Александр Григорьевич Лукашенко, ; Romanized: Aleksandr Grigoryevich Lukashenko; born 30 or 31 August 1954) has been serving as the President of Belarus since 20 July 1994. Before his career as a politician, Lukashenko worked as director of a state-owned agricultural farm. Under Lukashenko's rule, Belarus has come to be viewed as a state whose conduct is out of line with international law and whose regime is considered to grossly violate human rights. Belarus has never held a poll seen as fair by international monitors since Lukashenko began his presidency. Belarus has been called “the last true remaining dictatorship in the heart of Europe” by the former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He and other Belarusian officials are also subject of the sanctions imposed by the European Union for egregious human rights violations.
Lukashenko was born on 30 or 31 August 1954 in the settlement of Kopys in the Vitebsk voblast of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Trokhym Lukashenko, grandfather of Lukashenko – was born in the Sumy Oblast of Ukraine. Lukashenko grew up without a father in his childhood, leading him to be taunted by his schoolmates for having an unmarried mother. He graduated from the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute in 1975 and the Belarussian Agricultural Academy in 1985. He served in the Border Guard (frontier troops) from 1975 to 1977 and in the Soviet Army from 1980 to 1982. Lukashenko led a Komsomol chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978. While in the Soviet Army, Lukashenko was an officer of the 120th Motorised Rifle "Guard" Division, which was based in Minsk. After leaving the military he became the deputy chairman of a collective farm in 1982 and in 1985. He was promoted to the post of director of the Gorodets state farm and construction materials plant in the Shklov district.
In 1990, Lukashenko was elected as a Deputy in the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He was the only deputy of the Belarusian parliament who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union and set up the Commonwealth of Independent States in its place.
