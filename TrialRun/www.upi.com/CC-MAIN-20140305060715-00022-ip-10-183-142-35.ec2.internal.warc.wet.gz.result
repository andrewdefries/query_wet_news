KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 21 (UPI) -- Ukraine continues to import European natural gas via Poland as it seeks to break the stranglehold of Russian supplies, Kiev's energy minister says.Ukrainian Energy and Coal Industry Minister Eduard Stavitsky said Friday the state-owned gas company Naftogaz is still receiving supplies under a contract with German utility RWE via reverse flows from Poland, Interfax-Ukraine reported."For now we are getting gas via Poland only ... and we are working on two more routes," he said. "Something will be known about them very soon."Naftogaz in November struck a deal with RWE to supply it with 56 million cubic meters of natural gas over a two-month period via Poland through the reversing one of the lines that connecting the two countries' transmission systems at Drozdovychi.The German company wouldn't confirm the price it is getting from Naftogaz but local media reports claimed it is cheaper than those charged by the Russian company Gazprom, which is fetching what Ukraine considers to be an exorbitant rate of $426 per cubic meter, British energy analysts ICIS Heren reported.Ukraine has already purchased about 57 million cubic meters from RWE via Poland, but the arrangement is continuing, Stavitsky said.Naftogaz in May signed an agreement with RWE creating a legal framework for the importation of natural gas supplies from the German utility -- a deal that wouldn't contain binding purchase or supply commitments, such as required by Gazprom.News of the framework agreement came after Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov in March told the German newspaper Die Welt that if Ukraine can't reach an agreement with Gazprom on renegotiating its current gas contract, it could buy Russian gas from RWE through reverse flows.The throughput capacity at Drozdovychi is about 4 million cubic meters a day.Meanwhile, Stavitsky said another deal to import RWE gas via Hungary hadn't begun while two more reverse-flow European gas routes are being considered, ITAR-Tass said.In November, Stavitsky's predecessor, Yuriy Boiko, said Ukraine was to start importing natural gas through Hungary on Jan. 1."The current shipments of gas (from RWE) go through the territory of Poland," he told the Inter television channel at the time. "Starting from January 1, the supplies will go through the territory of Hungary... We have done a great job, have held talks with the countries that have received permission from regulators and bought the capacities."He said Ukraine hoped to save $2 billion via the purchase of 5 billion cubic meters of western natural gas through long-term contracts.Experts told Interfax-Ukraine that Kiev could also use reverse flows via Slovakia to buy up to 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year on European spot markets though Slovakia starting in 2015-16.However, progress on Slovakian front has been slow, ICIS reported.The analysts said a recent tender held by Slovak transmission system operator Eustream showed no market interest, with Eustream unlikely to press ahead with plans for a new pipeline without booked transmission capacities.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Brad Pitt's manager says the actor was misquoted as telling the German magazine Stern that Tom Cruise's Nazi-themed picture "Valkyrie" was "ridiculous."Pitt, who co-starred with Cruise in the 1994 film "Interview with the Vampire," was said to have made the remark while promoting his new World War II movie "Inglourious Basterds." Cruise's 2008 film was based on the true story of a botched attempt to assassinate German dictator and Holocaust architect Adolf Hitler.Rottentomatoes.com indicated both of Pitt's and Cruise's WWII movies earned generally favorable reviews.Asked by a Stern journalist for his opinion about "Valkyrie," Pitt reportedly said, "It was a ridiculous movie."However, Pitt's manager told People.com the report was "inaccurate," adding, "Brad has never even seen 'Valkyrie.'"

| License Photo	DALLAS, May 25 (UPI) -- A U.S. nutritionist suggests an alternative to the high-fat traditional Buffalo chicken wing -- take off the skin and bake or grill instead of deep-fat frying.For a lower-calorie chicken wing, Lona Sandon, a clinical nutritionist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, suggested grilling chicken pieces instead of traditional wings. Make your own hot sauce without the butter and use low-fat versions of cream cheese, sour cream and blue cheese, or substitute plain Greek yogurt, Sandon said. Sandon also suggests ways to reduce fat from snacks and summer grilling: -- Try salsas, low-fat sour cream dips or yogurt instead of traditional chip and vegetable dips, or low-fat versions of dressing instead of traditional ranch dressing. Substitute fat-free or lower-calorie ingredients such as vegetarian-style refried beans or whole beans, sour creams, low-fat cheeses and ground turkey to reduce calories for seven-layer dip.-- Cut calories with baked tortilla chips, vegetarian refried beans or mashed black beans, low-fat cheese, peppers and tomatoes or fat-free sour cream.-- Try vinegar-based sauces instead of those with high brown-sugar content for grilling. Mix chicken and beef to help lower overall calories.-- Try leaner beef ribs instead of pork ribs, which are usually fatter. Consider brisket instead.-- Try using your favorite spices and rubs on veggie, turkey, or soy burgers to give similar flavor with fewer calories, or blend hamburger with ground turkey or ground soy. Try beef jerky to get the beef flavor.-- Look for 100 percent beef franks, turkey or soy instead of bratwurst, which usually has more calories than lean hot dogs.

TORONTO, Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Toronto's controversial mayor, Rob Ford, engaged in a friendly arm-wrestling match with Hulk Hogan and beat him, Hogan said. Whether the bout Friday was any more genuine than other pro wrestling events is unknown. The Toronto Star said the event at the Canada Fan Expo convention was aimed at promoting Hogan's appearance there. Ford became a household name in Canada and even outside Canada in May when the U.S. website Gawker reported being offered a video clip apparently showing the mayor smoking crack. The Star later said two of its staffers had also seen the clip and had no way of verifying it. The mayor has denied smoking crack. "Wow, that was a setup," Hogan exclaimed before lifting Ford's arm in victory. "Good job, mayor -- number one Hulkamaniac right here, guys," Hogan said to applause, as the mayor wiped his face with a towel.Hogan, who has had his own problems with leaked videotapes, responded "I'm hungry," when someone asked him about Ford's supposed crack smoking after Friday's bout.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (UPI) -- A lack of commitment to address government corruption in Kabul is undermining the war effort there, a security analyst said.Washington expressed frustration over a decision by the administration of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to dismiss Fazel Ahmed Faqiryar, the deputy attorney general. P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said the prosecutor was doing important work addressing corruption in the government."Those charged with pursuing corruption need to continue their work without political interference," he said.Karzai during a May visit to Washington pledged to address corruption within the government ranks. One government official who spoke with The Wall Street Journal on condition of anonymity, however, said the Karzai administration was proving "very difficult to manage."The U.S. Defense Department is scheduled for a review of its Afghan war strategy in December. Christine Fair, a peace and security professor at Georgetown University, told the Journal that the war effort was undermined by rampant corruption in Kabul."There is a fundamental lack of commitment from the Afghan side and we simply can't win this without the governance," she said.Karzai, the Journal said, points the finger at Washington and its Western allies for funneling billions of dollars worth of aid into the country with little accountability or oversight.

Mark Schauer, now a business development representative with the Michigan Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust. "This is a direct affront to organized labor and its members. It's a game-changer."The state Legislature has fast-tracked the package of bills and it may be ready to sign by Gov. Rick Snyder by Tuesday. Snyder has already has said he will sign the legislation when it hits his desk."Citizens are going to be coming up and thanking legislators and the governor for doing the right thing," said Republican consultant Stu Sandler.

| License Photo	Jan. 2 (UPI) -- Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969, a moment he marked with the iconic phrase, "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." But in a new BBC documentary, Armstrong's brother, Dean, contradicts the late astronaut's insistence that he came up with those famous words on the spot.In "Neil Armstrong: First Man on the Moon," Dean Armstrong says that he saw Neil's speech months before the Apollo launch during a family game of Risk. Via the Daily Mail:"[Neil] says, 'What do you think about that?'" recalled Dean Armstrong in the film, 'Neil Armstrong: First Man on the Moon.'"I said 'fabulous'. He said 'I thought you might like that, but I wanted you to read it.'"Dean Armstrong also confirmed that Neil's original remark included the words "a man," though the broadcast's viewers only heard the contradictory statement "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Armstrong later claimed that static overpowered his "a." But for the 500 million people around the world who watched the moon landing on their television sets, the spontaneity of Armstrong's comments probably won't diminish their experience. Neil Armstrong died last August aged 82. Follow @KateStan and @UPI on Twitter.

Wiki
Sheldon Gary Adelson (born August 6, 1933) is an American billionaire businessman. Adelson is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., the parent company of Venetian Macao Limited which operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Adelson vastly increased his net worth upon the initial public offering of Las Vegas Sands in December 2004. He is currently the 13th richest American, with a fortune amounting to $14.7 billion.
Adelson's parents were Jewish. His father's family came from Eastern Europe. Adelson was born and grew up in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, a section of Boston, where his father was an entrepreneur and sometimes drove a taxicab. He worked at a young age selling newspapers on local street corners and owned his first business by the time he was twelve. In the years that followed, he worked as a mortgage broker, investment adviser and financial consultant. He started a business selling toiletry kits, and in the 1960s he started a charter tours business with two friends. He went to college at City College of New York but did not complete a degree there.
Adelson was born into a traditionally Democratic family but became a staunch Republican as his wealth grew. "Why is it fair that I should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else?" he was reported to have once asked. He began making major contributions to the Republican National Committee following clashes with labor unions at his Las Vegas properties.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
