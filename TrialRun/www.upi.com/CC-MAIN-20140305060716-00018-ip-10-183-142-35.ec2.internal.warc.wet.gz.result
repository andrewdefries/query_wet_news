NEW YORK, Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Nicholas Brooks, son of songwriter Joseph Brooks, was sentenced in New York Monday to prison for 25 years to life for killing swimwear designer Sylvie Cachay."You're an animal -- a sewer rat," Antonio Cachay, the victim's father, told Brooks during the sentencing hearing. "I have sat on that bench for every hearing and during the trial and not once did you show any evidence of regret or ... remorse."Sylvia Cachay, the victim's mother, said there was no word that "could describe the cruelty and cold blood of this man that only thought of himself."Brooks, convicted in July of strangling and drowning his 33-year-old girlfriend in 2010 at Soho House in New York City, stared straight ahead while the Cachay family berated him, then expressed his sadness over his girlfriend's death."Your honor, the loss of Sylvie is the most devastating thing that has ever occurred in my life," he said. "I think about her every day and it breaks my heart."Joseph Brooks, known for the song "You Light Up My Life," committed suicide in 2011 before his trial on charges he raped 13 women.

NEW YORK, April 30 (UPI) -- A female production assistant for "The View" was shot in the stomach while defending her cousin during an altercation in a New York deli, police said.The New York Post reported Monday Lourdes Guillen, 25, was with several family members ordering sandwiches at a Brooklyn bodega early Sunday when three men started harassing them for slowing down the line, then began beating up Guillen's relatives.One of the men shot Guillen's cousin Juan Medina, 24, twice in the stomach. When Guillen pleaded with the shooter to leave her family alone, stating they didn't want any trouble, the gunman fired at her, the newspaper said."I knew that if my cousin got shot again, he would die," she later told the Post from her bed at Bellevue hospital. "I couldn't let that happen. I had to do something."Medina was reported in critical but stable condition.Guillen, who has also worked for "Good Morning America," was in stable condition, the newspaper said. No arrests had been made in the case.

WASHINGTON, April 21 (UPI) -- Spies hacked into U.S. military computers, copying data that could threaten the effectiveness of U.S. fighter jets, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.In recent months, the newspaper said, someone was able to get intoPentagon's $300 billion Joint Strike Fighter project and take several terabytes of information concerning design and electronics systems. Officials told the Journal it could make it easier for America's enemies to defend against the F-35 Lightning I fighter jet.The Journal reported the Air Force's air-traffic-control system also was breached in recent months."There's never been anything like it," one source told the Journal, adding that other military and civilian agencies as well as private companies are affected. "It's everything that keeps this country going."While former U.S. officials told the newspaper it appeared the attacks originated in China, the specific identity of the attackers and the extent of the damage to the U.S. defense program wasn't known. However, the hackers weren't able to access the most sensitive material, which is stored on computers not connected to the Internet, the Journal said.

TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 25 (UPI) -- The Republican National Convention will start a day late in Florida because of fast-approaching Tropical Storm Isaac, GOP leader Reince Priebus said Saturday.Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in a statement posted on the committee's Web site, said because of the fast-approaching storm, the decision was made to convene the convention in Tampa Monday, but then immediately recess until Tuesday afternoon. He said exact times would be announced later."Our first priority is ensuring the safety of delegates, alternates, guests, members of the media attending the Republican National Convention, and citizens of the Tampa Bay area," Priebus said. "RNC Convention officials and the [Mitt] Romney campaign are working closely with state, local and federal officials, as well as the Secret Service, to monitor Tropical Storm Isaac and preserve Florida's emergency management resources. Officials have predicted participants may encounter severe transportation difficulties due to sustained wind and rain. "The Republican National Convention will take place and officially nominate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and the party has other necessary business it must address."The convention staff is working around-the-clock to ensure the delegations housed in storm-impacted areas have alternative housing if needed."Even before the storm forced a delay, party officials had decided to move the convention speech by Romney's wife Ann from Monday to Tuesday because of TV network broadcast plans, officials said.Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades said in a statement U.S. Sen. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida "was incredibly gracious to offer his speaking slot to Mrs. Romney, and we thank him for his kind offer," USA Today reported Friday."However, he will remain the last speaker in prime time on Thursday night before Gov. Romney accepts the nomination," Rhoades said.The scheduling change also meant New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez will speak on Wednesday instead of Monday.The convention's opening day was to feature the roll call of states, in which Romney and Ryan will be formally nominated as the GOP's presidential and vice presidential ticket. Ryan was to deliver his acceptance speech Wednesday and Romney was to speak Thursday.

OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 28 (UPI) -- A former U.S. Army Ranger says Oakland police beat him during an Occupy protest and that Alameda County deputies failed to get him medical help in jail.Kayvan Sabeghi, 33, filed a lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court last month against the County Sheriff's Office, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. He said his spleen was damaged during his arrest in November 2011 but deputies decided he was drunk and taking heroin. The deputies finally called an ambulance when he was scheduled to be released on bail the next day, court papers say. He was unable to move after a friend put up the bail. The lawsuit alleges deputies made fun of Sabeghi instead of getting him help, the Oakland Tribune reported Wednesday. "Later, another county deputy looked into the cell and observed Mr. Sabeghi lying on the floor throwing up," Sabeghi's lawsuit charges. "This deputy taunted Sabeghi by stating, 'Don't do heroin.' He then pointed Mr. Sabeghi out to other inmates and stated, 'see this is why you don't do heroin.'"The Chronicle said Sgt. J.D. Nelson, a sheriff's spokesman, denied deputies had mistreated Sabeghi or ignored his condition. He said video footage confirms officers acted properly."As his conditioned worsened, we got an ambulance there," Nelson said.Sabeghi served in Iraq and Afghanistan while with the Rangers.

TOKYO, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A Japanese court sentenced two Somali pirates to jail terms for an attempt to hijack an oil tanker operated by a Japanese company in the Indian Ocean in 2011.The Tokyo District Court sentenced Mohamed Urgus Adeysey, 23, and Abdinur Hussain Ali, 38, to 10-year prison terms Friday.Both defendants admitted taking part in the attempted hijacking, The Japan Times reported Friday.In the first case tried in Japan under a 2009 anti-piracy law, the primary issue was whether the judge would impose a prison term or offer a suspended sentence so the convicted men could be deported to Somalia, the newspaper noted.The court said that, although Adeysey, Ali and two other Somali citizens in custody in Tokyo failed to hijack the 57,000-ton ship, their actions were nonetheless vicious and well-planned.

| License Photo	VATICAN CITY, March 14 (UPI) -- Pope Francis, in his first mass as leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, Thursday urged the church to have courage."When we don't walk, we are stuck," Pope Francis said in a homily at the altar in the Sistine Chapel where the conclave of the College of Cardinals that chose him met.Citing passages from the Psalms, the Gospel of St. Matthew and the Letter of St. Peter, he said, "When we don't build on the rock, what happens? It's what happens to children when they build a sand castle and it all falls down. When we walk without the cross, when we build without the cross and when we confess without the cross, we are not disciples of Christ. We are mundane."I would like for all of us, after these days of grace, that we find courage to walk in the presence of God ... and to build the church with the blood of Christ. Only this way will the church move forward."Francis began his first full day as pope with a visit to the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome.The Rev. Ludovico Melo, a priest who prayed with him, said the pontiff spent about a half-hour at the basilica, a special place for Jesuits, which included singing a hymn and spoke to people in the church to go to confession, the Italian news agency ANSA reported."Mercy, mercy, mercy," the Argentine pope said, Melo indicated.Pope Francis, the first South American pope elected Wednesday after five votes at the conclave, also prayed before a famous icon of the Virgin Mary called the Salus Populi Romani, ANSA said. New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, who participated in the conclave, said Pope Francis was to travel to the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome Thursday to meet his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who resigned at the end of February, citing health and age.The schedule indicates Francis, 76, was to meet with cardinals – both who participated in the conclave and those who did not -- on Friday. ANSA said he will lead his first Angelus, a Catholic devotional, as pope in St. Peter's Square on Sunday. His inaugural mass is scheduled for Tuesday.Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio who was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, told the cardinals following the conclave Wednesday that one of his first acts as pope would be a visit to his predecessor.U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, plan to be at the inaugural mass and lead the U.S. delegation, the White House said.Biden said in a statement the Catholic church played "an essential role in my life," not just in matters of faith but also "in pursuit of peace and human dignity for all faiths."

Wiki
Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913 – January 29, 1964) was an American film actor.
Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He was the only child of Ina Raleigh Ladd and Alan Ladd, Sr. He was of English ancestry. His father died when he was four, and his mother relocated to Oklahoma City where she married Jim Beavers, a housepainter. The family then moved again to North Hollywood, California where Ladd became a high-school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics at North Hollywood High School, graduating on February 1st, 1934. He opened his own hamburger and malt shop, which he called Tiny's Patio. He worked briefly as a studio carpenter (as did his stepfather) and for a short time was part of the Universal Pictures studio school for actors. But Universal decided he was too blond and too short and dropped him. Intent on acting, he found work in radio.
Ladd began by appearing in dozens of films in small roles, including Citizen Kane in which he played one of the "faceless" reporters who are always shown in silhouette. He first gained some recognition with a featured role in the wartime thriller Joan of Paris, 1942. For his next role, his manager, Sue Carol, found a vehicle which made Ladd's career, Graham Greene's This Gun for Hire in which he played "Raven," a hitman with a conscience. "Once Ladd had acquired an unsmiling hardness, he was transformed from an extra to a phenomenon. Ladd's calm slender ferocity make it clear that he was the first American actor to show the killer as a cold angel." - David Thomson (A Biographical Dictionary of Film, 1975) Both the film and Ladd's performance played an important role in the development of the "gangster" genre: "That the old fashioned motion picture gangster with his ugly face, gaudy cars, and flashy clothes was replaced by a smoother, better looking, and better dressed bad man was largely the work of Mr. Ladd." - New York Times obituary (January 30, 1964). Ladd was teamed with actress Veronica Lake in this film, and despite the fact that it was Robert Preston who played the romantic lead, the Ladd-Lake pairing captured the public's imagination, and would continue in another three films. (They appeared in a total of seven films together, but three were only guest shots in all-star musical revues.)	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
