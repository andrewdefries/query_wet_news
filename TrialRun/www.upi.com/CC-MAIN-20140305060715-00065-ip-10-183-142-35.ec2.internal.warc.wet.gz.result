HEATHROW, Fla., March 3 (UPI) -- AAA is supporting a bill to force U.S. regulators to update fuel-economy measurements of vehicles, which often fail to meet stated mileage ratings.The U.S. motorists club conducted its own mileage tests on numerous cars and trucks and found many of them miss their government fuel-economy ratings, USA Today said Friday.AAA data come from tests done by drivers across the country "getting groceries, getting stuck in traffic jams, driving the same way you would," says AAA spokesman Mantill Williams.The organization, which concedes its tests aren't scientific but insists the results are representative, planned to endorse a bill that would force the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct realistic assessments of new vehicle fuel efficiency.The so-called Fuel-efficiency Truth-in-Advertising Act would require EPA tests to "reflect modern driving patterns and experiences, specifically speed and highway-vs.-urban driving," said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., co-sponsor of the bill with Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J. "Those are no-brainers," she said.

Seldom has American real estate seen such a surge of price increases as those experienced by Northern California markets over the past six month. Median prices through March 25 are 56.8 percent above those of a year ago in Sacramento, 45.6 percent higher year over year in San Francisco and up 33.3 percent over 2012 in San Jose.While some have been concerned that a new “bubble” is forming, the reality is that soaring prices are simply supply and demand at work. Demand, fueled by buyers eager for a piece of pricey California real estate before prices rose even higher, crashed head on with contracting supply, which instead of growing to meet demand continued to shrink through the first weeks in the year.Now, with the possible exception of Sacramento, soaring prices are having an effect on sellers, according to the most current weekly data from the Department of Numbers.In San Francisco, inventories have increased 1.6 percent in the last week, 9 percent in the past month and 18.5 percent since January, but they are still 64.6 percent below the level of a year ago. In San Jose, inventories are up 5 percent in the week ending March 25, 13.7 percent month over month and 24 percent since January. Compared to a year ago, San Jose listings are about half of where they were a year ago, at 50.2 percent.Sacramento, which has registered the fastest rising prices and fastest shrinking inventories in the nation though the fall and winter months and has become the unofficial headquarters for “flash sales,” where homes are being sold in 24 hours or less, is just beginning to turn around. Prices still rose 5.5 percent over the past 30 days and are up 56.8 percent on the year. In the past month, inventories are up only 1.5 percent, but they fell slightly from March 18 to March 25. Since January, Sacramento inventories have increased only 2 percent, or 80 listings.Local real estate professionals point to a shortage of new homes caused by a lack of buildable parcels. It will take 18-24 months for new construction to truly impact available inventory, they say. Others point to the activities of institutional investors like Blackstone which bought 1,000 Sacramento homes last year. According to DataQuick, more than 38 percent of the homes sold in Sacramento County October, for example, went to so-called absentee buyers, typically, investors. Others point out that the surge is more of a bounce back from the housing crash. Some Sacramento-area homes lost more than half their value.

BRISBANE, Australia, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- The preserved tracks of an assumed dinosaur "stampede" in Australia are largely those of swimming rather than running animals, paleontologists say.University of Queensland researchers studied thousands of small dinosaur tracks in central-western Queensland where 95-million-year-old prints are preserved in thin beds of sandstone deposited in a shallow river when the area was part of a vast, forested floodplain."Many of the tracks are nothing more than elongated grooves, and probably formed when the claws of swimming dinosaurs scratched the river bottom," Queensland doctoral candidate Anthony Romilio said."Some of the more unusual tracks include 'tippy-toe' traces -- this is where fully buoyed dinosaurs made deep, near vertical scratch marks with their toes as they propelled themselves through the water."It's difficult to see how tracks such as these could have been made by running or walking animals," he said in a university release Wednesday.The swimming dinosaur tracks at Lark Quarry Conservation Park belonged to small, two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs known as ornithopods, he said.However, Romilio said, the study may contradict the long-held belief the huge numbers of tracks are the result of a dinosaur "stampede.""Taken together, these findings strongly suggest Lark Quarry does not represent a 'dinosaur stampede.'""A better analogy for the site is probably a river crossing," he said.

| License Photo	LONDON, Aug. 9 (UPI) -- Two goals by Carli Lloyd and a spectacular save by Hope Solo Thursday brought the United States women the Olympic gold medal with a 2-1 victory over Japan.It was the third straight title for the United States and the fourth in the five Olympics in which soccer has been played by women.Lloyd scored the goal in extra time that gave Team USA a 1-0 win over Brazil in the title game in Beijing four years ago and she was the star again in 2012. She gave the Americans the lead 8 minutes into the game when she sidestepped a defender and scored from point-blank range.Lloyd sent a header into the left corner of the net in the 54th minute to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.Japan, which won last year's World Cup in a penalty shootout, clawed back in the game on a goal by Yuki Ugimi in the 63rd minute due to a defensive lapse and Solo then came through with the game-saver.Mana Iwabuchi broke in all alone in the 83rd minute and her shot headed for the right side of the net. Solo lunged in that direction and got just enough of the ball to deflect it wide of the goal.Solo also made a big save in the first half with a deflection that bounced off the crossbar.The game attracted 80,203 to Wembley Stadium, a record for a women's Olympic soccer game.

"We have a draft that attracts record audiences. We have camps. We have [scouting] combines."Goodell said advances in technology and growing international appeal was rapidly expanding the NFL's audience. "It technology changes for us that we have to bring it into our stadiums," he said, "We have to make sure that we're making the experience in our stadiums a fantastic experience."And while the NFL might appear to be sitting pretty as the premier sport in the United States, Goodell said the league was not about to become complacent."We don't believe that our current success is going to drive us forward without being aggressive," Goodell said. "We have to find new ways to grow."

| License Photo	UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (UPI) -- Members of a U.N. peacekeeping force should deploy to Mali to relieve French forces, a report from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.Mali in January called for military support from former colonial power France to fight Islamic militants. Foreign and al-Qaida fighters took control over northern Mali following a coup in early 2012.Bloomberg News obtained a copy of a 26-page report from Ban calling on African forces to integrate into a U.N. mission that would replace French forces in Mali. A French combat and counter-terrorism role would be needed to support a U.N. mission, however."Given the anticipated level and nature of the residual threat, there would be a fundamental requirement for a parallel force to operate in Mali," the report said.The United Nations said Mali needs political reforms to correspond with security gains if it's to ensure stability and territorial integrity.Ban's report expresses concern about the residual nature of insurgents fighting against Malian and French forces, however."An unknown number of fighters have sought refuge outside Mali or have melted back into the population, retaining weapons caches and the capacity to re-emerge," the report warns.

DETROIT, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Mayor Dave Bing said Detroit will have to close 51 city parks following the city council's rejection of a plan to lease Belle Isle to the state of Michigan.At a news conference Friday, the mayor said programs for children and the elderly will also take a hit, the Detroit Free Press reported.The state had offered to take over management of Belle Isle, a 985-acre park in the Detroit River, assuming responsibility for $6 million in operating costs.Because of other cutbacks, only 57 of the city's more than 300 parks will be open this summer. Officials said maintenance at the remaining open parks will be reduced.The city is struggling with a $350 million budget deficit."We looked a gift horse in the mouth," Bing said. "We had a deal that was workable that would not have closed parks. ... When we thumb our nose at $6 million, I think it's nuts."Brad Dick, the general services manager, said with no maintenance, the closed parks will look "pretty awful" once summer arrives."It's going to be tall weeds with trash in there," he said.

KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo, June 8 (UPI) -- The U.N. World Food Program said it has provided a monthly food ration to 20,000 people newly displaced by violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The food aid released this week went to displaced people and host families in Beni in the eastern DRC, the organization said in a release."With the conflict escalating in the past few weeks, WFP has been providing lifesaving assistance to Congolese who were forced to leave everything behind," Stanlake Samkange, WFP regional director for east and central Africa. "But continued violence will lead to more people requiring help and it will be critical to ensure that WFP has sufficient resources to address the needs of the newly displaced."The U.N. agency said tens of thousands of people have fled their homes and many have sought refuge near Goma, or elsewhere in the DRC, while thousands of others have crossed the borders of Rwanda and Uganda.In April, rebel Gen. Bosco Ntaganda staged a mutiny in the DRC, accusing the government of violating terms of a 2009 peace agreement that brought his rebel forces into the military.In the Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu, the WFP said it's providing emergency food assistance to more than 244,000 displaced people.In the Great Lakes region, the WFP said, it's providing assistance to 532,000 Congolese refugees and internally displaced people.

Wiki
Shane Albert Doan (born October 10, 1976) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward and captain for the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL). Doan is the longest tenured player on the club, having played all fourteen of his NHL seasons with the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes franchise. He is also the last remaining Coyote to have played for the Jets.
Competing internationally for Team Canada, he has won two gold medals and two silvers at the World Championships, as well as one World Cup championship in 2004. He was also a member of Canada's 2006 Winter Olympic team.
After winning the Memorial Cup and Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as tournament MVP with the Kamloops Blazers in 1995, Doan was drafted by the Winnipeg Jets in the first round, seventh overall, in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He was the Jets' final first-round pick prior to the franchise moving to Phoenix. He immediately made the transition from major junior to the NHL in 1995–96 and tallied 17 points in his rookie season with the Jets. After the Jets relocated to Phoenix and became the Coyotes the following season, his points total did not improve greatly until the 1999–00 season when he scored 26 goals (the first of nine consecutive 20-goal campaigns for Doan).
