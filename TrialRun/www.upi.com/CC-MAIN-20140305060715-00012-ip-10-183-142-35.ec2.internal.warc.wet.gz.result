WASHINGTON, May 23 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama was the last obstacle to getting the Keystone XL oil pipeline built through the country, the chairman of a House committee said.The House of Representatives passed the Northern Route Approval Act on a vote of 241-175, largely along party lines. Nineteen Democrats voted in favor of a measure that takes the Keystone XL decision out of the administration's hands.U.S. Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., sponsor of the bill, said there's been enough vetting of the project in more than four years and it was time to approve the pipeline.Keystone XL needs federal approval as a cross-border project.Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said Obama was the last obstacle to Keystone XL."The Northern Route Approval Act makes the Keystone XL pipeline a reality," he said in a floor statement. "It declares that no presidential permit shall be required to approve this pipeline and prevents the Obama administration from imposing further delays."The president's Office of Management and Budget said Obama would veto the legislation although, with the Senate said to be unlikely to consider such legislation, the White House may not have to resort to a veto.Supporters of Keystone XL say it would ensure North American independence and create tens of thousands of jobs. Opponents say pipelines are too prone to spills and heavy Canadian crude oil, the type designated for the pipeline, carries too many environmental risks.Oil Change International, an opponent of the pipeline, reports that members of Congress who supported the act took six times more in campaign contributions from the oil industry than did opponents.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, May 2 (UPI) -- Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Andre Ethier says he'll take the single that stretched his hitting streak to 27 games but downplayed its significance.In the seventh inning Sunday, Ethier lined a 1-0 pitch that bounced off the outstretched glove of diving San Diego first baseman Brad Hawpe and rolled back toward second base, allowing Ethier to reach first easily. The hit moved him within four games of the longest hitting streak in Dodgers history, set by Willie Davis in 1969. Ethier is now tied with Duke Snider (1953) and Joe Medwick (1942) and is two games short of the 29-game streak Zack Wheat put together in 1916.It took a few moments, before the scoreboard flashed "base hit" for Ethier and the crowd could cheer, MLB.com reported."If they put a hit, they put an error, whatever," Ethier said. "I'm not going to throw my hands up or anything like that. ... Just trying to figure out a way to get the job done and get on base and get things going and rolling. I would have taken a walk, error, hit anything that gives us a chance to start scoring runs, especially in a ballgame like that where not much offense is being shown."The Dodgers lost the game 7-0. Ethier's still just over halfway to Joe DiMaggio's major league mark of 56 straight in 1941, a fact not lost on the 29-year-old Dodger."There's one reason to talk about the streak and that's because of breaking it," he said. And let's be real here -- we're not even halfway there. I don't understand what the big deal is."

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 29 (UPI) -- Moscow needs "solid legal guarantees" that a European missile defense shield wouldn't alter the balance of power, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says.Speaking Tuesday before the 66th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the top Russian diplomat said the potential of a U.S.-backed missile defense system in Europe to compromise Moscow's security is "far too serious" to gloss over.Dismissing verbal assurances by the United States and NATO that such a European system wouldn't undermine the continent's strategic stability as "not enough," Lavrov declared Moscow needed such assurances in writing."We need solid legal guarantees that missile defense potential will actually be adequate to the declared objectives and will not disrupt global and regional balances," he said."This equally holds true both for Europe and for the Asia-Pacific region, where ballistic missile defense is becoming a factor that affects the strategic environment."Lavrov reiterated Russian fears that a missile defense based in Eastern Europe and Turkey -- which the West says is needed to counter threats from Iran and the Middle East -- could be used to target its own nuclear deterrent force of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Russia and NATO have been talking since last year to reconcile conflicting visions of European missile defense.Moscow prefers a single system covering all of Europe that would be operated jointly by Russia and NATO with full interoperability. NATO, however, backs two independent systems that would exchange information.Lavrov said it is ultimately the halt of the spread of nuclear weapons that will bring security to Europe and elsewhere. To that end, he called for the "universalization" of the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Israel, Pakistan, India and North Korea aren't signatories.He also called for a strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards system and the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which Indonesia, Iran, Egypt, China, Israel and the United States have signed but not ratified.The Russian foreign minister's speech came only hours after the country's deputy defense minister reported continued slow going in negotiations between Moscow and NATO in the missile shield talks.Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov said in New York that although Russia was "ready for compromises within reason" on the issue, "no breakthrough decisions" had been made, RIA Novosti reported."Our U.S. partners continue implementing their plans to create the European segment of the U.S. missile defense system," Antonov said.NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said last week he expected Russia and the Western military alliance to agree on missile defense at its May 2012 summit in Chicago.Antonov claimed Washington, rather than NATO, is quickly driving the establishment of the anti-missile shield at "a pace that strongly exceeds the discussions between Russia, NATO and the United States."Turkey has agreed to host an early warning radar as part of the missile defense shield against and Poland will install other elements by 2018. Romania and the Czech Republic would also host parts of the system under the "European Phased Adaptive Approach" plans.

| License Photo	Whatever the White House and Congress may work out to avert the "fiscal cliff," it would be just a downpayment on a wider tax overhaul -- and don't think the middle class is going to escape unscathed in the broader deal.For years, the nirvana of tax reform has been the flat tax. In the '90s, Steve Forbes was a vocal proponent of an across-the-board 17 percent tax on all personal and corporate earned income during his short-lived presidential bid. More recently, Herman Cain touted his 9-9-9 proposal: a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business transactions tax and a 9 percent federal sales tax that eventually would become a 0 percent income tax, 25 percent corporate income tax and 15 percent federal sales tax. No separate Social Security or Medicare levies.The odds on adopting any flat-tax proposal are long. It would need to eliminate all deductions and loopholes, each of which is coveted by one constituency or another.Three of the most popular -- and expensive from the government's point of view -- are the mortgage interest-state property tax, charitable giving and retirement savings deductions/shelters. Analysts predict all are likely to be cut in any tax overhaul.The mortgage interest deduction costs the federal government $86.9 billion a year. Couple that with $50.7 billion for property taxes and you've reduced the federal budget deficit by more than 10 percent if both go away. Charitable giving? $50 billion.Those deductions might save the feds $181.6 billion, but at what cost?The real estate industry says eliminating the mortgage and property tax deductions would devastate the housing industry at a point when it's just beginning to recover from the recession.The National Association of Realtors predicts elimination of the mortgage interest-local property tax deductions would reduce home equity 15 percent and in time lead to a loss of 250,000 to 350,000 jobs because people who buy new homes also need appliances, carpeting and other items, making up 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Instead, NAR suggests, cap the deduction and just eliminate it for second homes.Bob Pozen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has suggested a $500,000 cap on mortgages eligible for the deduction or a tax credit for homeowners who don't itemize earning $50,000 to $100,000, World Property Channel reported.Those involved with non-profit organizations say eliminating the deduction for charitable giving threatens to choke off the $300 billion donated annually, drying up needed resources for those least able to make it on their own."If this benefit goes away, who's going to pick up the slack?" asked the Rev. Larry J. Snyder, president of Catholic Charities USA, in an interview with The New York Times. "Definitely not the government. It's the only deduction that directly impacts community benefit. Cutting it -- it defies the logic of cutting, I think."The White House last week pretty much nixed eliminating the deduction for charitable giving."It's hard to imagine that Democrats or Republicans would vote to eliminate the charitable tax deduction," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.A much bigger prize is the money taxpayers shelter from taxes in 401(k) retirement plans offered by their employers. Experts estimate 80 percent of workers take advantage of the plans at companies where they're offered, each sheltering as much as $17,000 (it's going up to $17,500 shortly) annually from immediate taxation."The single most important factor in determining if a worker is saving for retirement is whether or not there is a plan at work," Brian Graff, executive director and chief executive officer of the Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries, told Politico. "We understand Congress needs to reduce the debt and raise revenue but raiding the tax incentives for 401(k) plans will put American workers' retirement security at risk."The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates eliminating the ability to shelter retirement savings from immediate taxation will cost the federal government $162.7 billion in 2014.The benefit is far from safe. As long ago as 1986, tax code writers eyed it -- and that was just eight years after it became available. In his 2013 budget, President Obama proposed eliminating the shelter for those earning more than $250,000 a year.Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., told Politico eliminating the deduction would be a mistake."I still prefer using the tax system to promote savings," Neal said. "I think there is substantial evidence -- whether it's the use of the 401(k) or the individual retirement account -- that it has worked."And that brings us back to the "fiscal cliff" to which Washington is speeding.Obama has offered a $4 trillion package: $1.6 trillion in new revenue -- $950 billion to be collected by allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire on incomes of more than $250,000, with the rest coming from the elimination or reduction of deductions and loopholes -- and $2.4 trillion in spending cuts. House Speaker John Boehner has offered a sentence: $800 billion in new revenue to come from closing loopholes and eliminating deductions, no specifics, spending reductions to come from entitlement reform.Republicans rejected Obama's plan; the White House turned down Boehner's plan. But by the end of last week, Obama and Boehner were at least talking by phone, presumably discussing specifics.White House spokesman Jay Carney -- and the president himself -- emphasized last week any deal will have to include a tax increase on the wealthy although Carney said Obama is not "wedded" to every aspect of his proposal.But as former President Bill Clinton said, it all comes down to the numbers, arithmetic.Jason Furman, principal deputy director of the National Economic Council, walked reporters last week through why just closing loopholes and eliminating deductions won't work by themselves."It's always a little bit like Jell-O," Furman said. "You look over here, the problem with this one; well, how about this one; the problem with that could fix this, and you go back to the first one."Simply limiting deductions to $25,000 sounds good, but high-earners could hit that with just mortgage interest and property taxes alone, eliminating the incentive for charitable giving, Furman said. Plus, it would hit 17 million members of the middle class. So, scratch that."In the president's proposal you have the decoupling that gets you $950 [billion], and then he has an additional proposal where he takes the value of tax deductions and other tax expenditures and limits their value to 28 percent, which is what you'd get if you were upper-middle class -- in effect, you'd get 28 percent value for all of those," Furman said. "And so he trims them across the board and he saves several hundred billion dollars with that proposal."Carney said a deal will be reached once "Republicans are ready to acknowledge that rates are going up... for top earners.""If the Republicans believe that they have an alternative proposal that achieves the kind of revenue that's necessary, they ought to put it on paper," Carney said. "And I think the reason they haven't is because they know, as Jason has just explained, that there isn't a plausible proposal that produces the amount of revenue necessary that could pass Congress or that makes economic sense."

| License Photo	ROME, May 17 (UPI) -- A majority of Italians surveyed in a poll released Monday said Roman Catholic priests should be allowed to marry. The poll by Demos came as bishops in Austria asked the Vatican to hold discussions on the issue of priestly celibacy, The Times of London reported.In the poll, 65.9 percent of Italians interviewed said they were "very much" in favor or "fairly" in favor of abolishing the church's celibacy rule and 22 percent said they were opposed to priests marrying.The survey suggested confidence in Pope Benedict XVI in Italy had dropped from 53.7 percent in 2007 to 46.6 percent now. The poll suggested confidence in the church had dropped from 59.2 percent a decade ago in Italy to 47.2 percent now. Overall, 62 percent said the church had minimized or hidden clergy sex-abuse scandals. Eighteen percent said criticism of the church over sex abuse was "unjustified" and 13 percent said the church had handled the problem "adequately."Sunday, 200,000 people filled St. Peter's Square in a show of support for the pope, who called the rally a "beautiful and spontaneous show of faith and solidarity."

JUBA, South Sudan, Dec. 20 (UPI) -- Two members of the United Nations peacekeeping force in South Sudan were killed in an attack on a base, officials said Friday. Another peacekeeper was injured in the fighting Thursday in Akobo Town, the U.N. mission said in a statement. The bodies of the dead were brought to Juba. The U.N. troops in Akobo are from India, officials said. The attackers were young men from the minority Lou Nuer group, the U.N. said. UNMISS, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan, said it sent four helicopters to rescue personnel from the Akobo base in Jonglei state, the New York Times reported. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement he was "appalled" to learn of the attack on the Akobo base and called on government and opposition forces to respect the rights of civilians and ensure their safety and security. "UNMISS is doing everything it can, within its means and in a very fluid situation, to protect civilians, as well as United Nations and international personnel on the ground," Ban said. "There are indications that civilians may have been killed and wounded in the attack, but this remains to be verified. Should these reports prove true, those responsible must be held accountable for their crimes." President Obama, in a letter to Congress Thursday, said 45 U.S. troops were deployed to South Sudan to support "the security of U.S. personnel and our embassy" and would remain in-country "until the security situation becomes such that it is no longer needed."In a statement Obama, noting South Sudan elected to become a country in 2011, now "stands at the precipice.""Too much blood has been spilled and too many lives have been lost to allow South Sudan's moment of hope and opportunity to slip from its grasp," the statement said. "Now is the time for South Sudan's leaders to show courage and leadership, to reaffirm their commitment to peace, to unity, and to a better future for their people." The country has been in turmoil since Sunday when President Salva Kiir accused soldiers loyal to former Deputy President Riek Machar of a coup attempt, which Machar has denied.Reports indicate hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting since Sunday.The U.N. mission said it has has more than 6,800 troops and police in South Sudan."Violence is spreading and could spread even further and we need all South Sudanese leaders and political personalities now to immediately appeal [for] calm and call on their supporters to suspend hostilities," Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said during a news conference at U.N. headquarters in New York. "Political dialogue is the only way to prevent further escalation." Britain sent a second plane to Juba, South Sudan's capital, Friday to evacuate British nationals, the Wall Street Journal reported. Britain sent a first plane Thursday.At the time of the assault, the Akobo base housed 43 Indian peacekeepers, six U.N. police advisers, two civilians and about 30 South Sudanese who had sought refuge from the fighting in the area, the United Nations said. The mission said 34,000 people had taken refuge at its facilities throughout the country. In Geneva, Switzerland, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said an estimated 20,000 people, mainly women and children, were camped at a U.N. facility in Juba. Others are reported to be fleeing for fear of attack by rival groups.
