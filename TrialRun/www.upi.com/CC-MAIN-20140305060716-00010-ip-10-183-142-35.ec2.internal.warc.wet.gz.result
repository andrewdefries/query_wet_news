WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- A U.S. home builders confidence index fell in October after a prolonged climb, the National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday.The index of confidence among building professionals in an industry battered during the recession reached a nearly eight-year peak in August, then turned flat in September.But in October, the index gave up 2 points and September's reading was revised downward, the trade group said.The so-called NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index settled down to a reading of 55, the monthly report said."A spike in mortgage interest rates along with the paralysis in Washington that led to the government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the nation's debt limit have caused builders and consumers to take pause," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a statement.

CINCINNATI, Oct. 23 (UPI) -- Officials at the Kroger Co. chain of U.S. supermarkets said they will no longer sell sprouts due to the potential food safety risk such as Salmonella. Payton Pruett, Kroger's vice president of food safety, said sprouts present a unique challenge because pathogens -- Salmonella, Listeria and E. coli. -- might reside inside of the seeds where they cannot be reached by currently available processing interventions."After a thorough, science-based review, we have decided to voluntarily discontinue selling fresh sprouts," Pruett said in a statement. "Testing and sanitizing by the growers and safe food handling by the consumer are the critical steps to protect against food-borne illness. Out of an abundance of caution, the Kroger Family of Stores will no longer sell fresh sprouts or procure other foods that are produced on the same equipment as sprouts."Pruett said the company was open to revisiting this policy when new technologies and practices show that farmers can consistently produce sprout seeds that do not internalize pathogens, and when sprout processing environments can be enhanced for safety and cleanliness. Deliveries of sprouts into Kroger distribution centers and stores was discontinued Monday.

LICKDALE, Pa., Aug. 16 (UPI) -- The owner of a Pennsylvania restaurant that closed this year said he is seeking to sell a mounted polar bear, but the item isn't allowed to leave the state.Dave DeWees, who owned the Woods Creek Grill restaurant outside of Lickdale before it closed its doors earlier in the summer, said he is seeking to sell the 8-foot-tall mounted female polar bear, but there are laws governing the sale of the endangered species, Pennlive.com reported Friday.The bear was shot by Easton, Pa., Dr. John Reganis on a hunting trip in Alaska in 1967. DeWees bought it at an auction after Reganis died.DeWees said laws have changed since Reganis' hunting trip, but he is able to sell the bear because Reganis kept detailed documentation of his hunt and the bear's mounting. However, he said endangered species laws prevent the buyer from taking the bear across state lines, meaning it must remain in Pennsylvania."TAXIDERMY: Polar Bear, 8'x6" Polar Bear, Large life sized Brown Bear, Large Elk Number 3 non typical in the world, Buffalo half Mount," a newspaper ad for the piece reads.

WASHINGTON, July 19 (UPI) -- Abdul Qadeer Khan, Pakistan's national nuclear hero, was also a nuclear black market pariah. He sold and smuggled bomb-making secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya, and was put under house arrest by former President Pervez Musharraf for five years (2004-09).This week, A.Q. Khan was back in business -- to pull his country out from under what he called "the slavery of the United States." He had a receptive audience of tens of millions as the latest Pew Foundation survey indicates three out of four Pakistanis agreeing the United States is their "main enemy."In 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush conferred on Pakistan the title of "major non-NATO ally."A metallurgist by training, Khan stole nuclear bomb making secrets from the Netherlands where he was working and fathered Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, the first Islamic nation to acquire one.Pakistan's first nuclear bomb test in 1998 came only two weeks after India detonated its first five nuclear explosions.Following his release from house arrest three years ago, Khan, 75, quietly went to work off stage to form a coalition of former military leaders and prominent anti-U.S. politicians.Khan's new political party is named "Tehrik-i-Tahaffuz Pakistan," which means "Movement to Protect Pakistan." There is already another TTP -- Tehtik e Taliban Pakistan -- which stands for the "Black Tornado."Khan will serve as "patron in chief" of the new party. Addressing his new anti-American flock, he said, "I never wanted to join politics but when your country is on the verge of total collapse, it is not right to remain a spectator."Incompetent rulers have destroyed our country," he said, pinning the blame on former Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, convicted last April of contempt of court for refusing to ask Swiss authorities to reopen corruption proceedings against President Asif Ali Zardari, husband of the late Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated Dec. 27, 2007.Khan described Gilani as former head of the "thief family."Zardari has already served 11 1/2 years in prison for massive corruption that was never proved.Last month, Raja Pervez Ashraf replaced Gilani as prime minister pending national elections before February 2013.Khan has left no doubt that he expects to be the next president of Pakistan. And he has already picked the man he wants as prime minister: Imran Khan, chairman of Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement of Justice Party), dubbed Pakistan's Ron Paul, and one of the world's eight all-time great cricketers. He recently canceled a U.S. lecture tour.Provided his "grateful nation" wants him as president, A.Q. Khan said he wants Imran Khan as prime minister.The most powerful opposition leader is former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who was convicted of hijacking and treason in 1999. Sharif, then in his second term as prime minister, refused to let an airliner carrying his dismissed military chief, Musharraf, to land in Pakistan on his return from a conference in Sri Lanka.Runways had been scattered with obstacles, which the army removed, allowing Musharraf's plane to land with less than 5 minutes of fuel in its tanks. The army then deposed Sharif in a bloodless coup.Musharraf became president and Sharif was convicted of hijacking and treason, sentenced to life in prison.A compromise was negotiated -- Sharif is immensely wealthy -- and he was allowed to seek refuge in Saudi Arabia, provided he stayed out of politics for the next 10 years. He has been cleared of all charges -- and Musharraf is now in self-imposed exile.As head of the "Pakistan Muslim League (N)," Sharif has been prime minister twice and has been biding his time for a return to high office.Imran Khan is certainly more popular than Sharif -- but Sharif has more political clout. He was arguably the most powerful prime minister in the country's 65-year history.A.Q. Khan and Gul together have a wide circle of friends and supporters whose principal objective is to move the United States and its NATO allies out of Afghanistan, coupled with a de facto alliance with Taliban to maneuver the United States out of Afghanistan, in effect sealing victory for Taliban, whom they believe they can control.When and if the anti-U.S. coalition moves as a cohesive front, and takes over Pakistan from the top down, they will be faced with a quagmire of seemingly insuperable crises. These range from banned terrorist networks operating increasingly above ground to an economic disaster in a nuclear power.It all adds up to something bigger than all the combined threats now facing the remainder of the moderate democratic world.This is no Vietnam redux. It is bigger than all the combined threats facing the moderate world.

NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 12 (UPI) -- A retired Navy officer in Virginia accused of attempting to pass secrets to FBI agents posing as Russian spies has been denied bond by a federal judge.Lawyers for Robert P. Hoffman II, 39, of Virginia Beach, told Magistrate Judge Douglas E. Miller undercover FBI agents entrapped Hoffman, setting him up despite an attempt to confess what was happening, The Virginian Pilot of Norfolk, Va., said Wednesday.The FBI says Hoffman traveled to an eastern European country recently, where his behavior raised red flags, though they wouldn't elaborate on what precisely he did there. They subsequently sent a letter purporting to be Russian agents, asking if Hoffman, a Navy cryptologist for 20 years, would provide "technical assistance."Hoffman allegedly assembled information about Navy submarines from memory and left them in drop locations specified by the undercover agents. It was unclear whether the undercover agents offered or paid Hoffman but prosecutors said at one point Hoffman made oblique references to killing people for money, the newspaper reported.Hoffman's lawyers said he went to the Norfolk, Va., FBI field office during the time he was being investigated and tried to confess what was happening. He offered to help the FBI track down the Russian agents"Where's the intent" to commit a crime, Hoffman's attorney Keith Kimball asked. "He's going to the FBI to tell them what's going on."Hoffman is set to be arraigned Dec. 19.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 2 (UPI) -- Secretary of State John Kerry, stressing U.S. commitments to South Korea and Japan, said Washington will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state.Kerry, speaking to reporters after meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, answered questions about North Korea's latest decision to restart its nuclear facility."I'm not going to speculate on what the intent is or whether there's a strategy or not a strategy," Kerry said, a State Department transcript showed. "The bottom line is very simply that what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un has been choosing to do is provocative, it is dangerous, reckless, and the United States will not accept DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea) as a nuclear state."And I reiterate again the United States will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies, Korea and Japan. We are fully prepared and capable of doing so, and I think the DPRK understands that."Kerry said at the same time the developments in the region are not being taken lightly, "which is precisely why the President made the decision to redeploy missile defense with respect to the United States itself as well as to take other preparations in the region and to send a very clear signal to our allies and the North alike that the United States will defend our allies and that we will not be subject to irrational or reckless provocation."The simple way for North Korea is to rejoin the community of nations and make it clear they want to pursue a peaceful path, he added.Asked if he believed the North would restart its Yongbyon nuclear facility as announced, Kerry said such a step would be in "direct violation" of its international obligations."So we'll have to wait and see what happens with respect to that, but it is a direct violation of their international obligations and would be a very serious step," he said.

LONDON, July 8 (UPI) -- A suspected terrorist arrested near the site of the London Olympics allegedly had ties to al-Qaida, a source told The Sunday Telegraph.The suspect, known only a CF, is only 24 but allegedly has tried to recruit Britons to join the radical Islamist cause and had previously tried to travel to Afghanistan for terrorist training.CF is also suspected of being a veteran of the Somali extremist group al Shabaab. A Home Office lawyer told the newspaper CF allegedly wanted to "re-engage in terrorism-related activities either in the U.K. or Somalia."The Sunday Telegraph said CF was picked up after allegedly passing through Olympic Park five times despite a ban on such traffic in the run-up to the games. Officials called his detention the most serious security alert yet at the venue.His arrest was disclosed shortly after 14 suspects were arrested on charges related to alleged terror plots in Britain.

ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 8 (UPI) -- The Greek Parliament Sunday passed a national budget for next year that the prime minister said was based on a modest economic recovery.Prime Minister Antonis Samaras told Parliament before the vote that next year "will be a year of recovery after six painful years of recession."The spending plan, which had the support of a conservative and socialist coalition, passed on a vote of 153-142.The Wall Street Journal reported the budget was based on a larger-than-expected government surplus, which should bolster Greece's position in upcoming negotiations with major European creditors. The plan, however, includes additional cuts to public health programs and increased property taxes.The additional spending cuts and tax hikes, however, have yet to be approved by Parliament. Some lawmakers have warned that their support for the budget was intended to keep the government functioning and that public support for another round of austerity was wobbly, the New York Times reported.A key leftist lawmaker recently accused creditors of pushing austerity to the point it was creating a humanitarian crisis in Greece; however, influential European leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel have urged the Athens government to stay the course despite the political headwinds, the Times said.
