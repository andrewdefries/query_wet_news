WASHINGTON, April 22 (UPI) -- Regulating pollutants discharged from power plants provides a vital benefit to the health of the U.S. public, the American Public Health Association said.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed measures to reduce water pollution in areas near power plants. Facilities would be required to install new pollution control measures through 2022.EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe said the agency was waiting for industry response but said less than half of the 500 or so coal-fired plants in the United States would be directly affected because of technology already in place."Reducing the pollution of our waters through effective but flexible controls such as we are proposing today is a win-win for our public health and our economic vitality," he said in a statement.APHA Executive Director Dr. Georges Benjamin said pollutants tied to the power sector, like heavy metals, are a direct threat to human health."Keeping our water safe and clean is critical to ensuring the health of our people and communities," he said. "Toxic heavy metals have no place in our drinking water or on our dinner plate."The EPA's proposal would set federal limits on pollutants like lead and mercury that are discharged from power plants. Some heavy metals are toxic to the nervous system and may cause cancer.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, April 6 (UPI) -- U.S. actress Drew Barrymore said "it sucks" to give up film directing to be a mom, but she feels more focused on the career she still has.The "Charlie's Angels" star admitted Thursday in Los Angeles she can't act, direct, produce, run two businesses and be a mom at the same time."I can't and I don't," she said at Lucky's Fashion and Beauty Blog Conference. "It sucks when you've worked really hard for certain things and you have to give them up because you know that you're going to miss out on your child's upbringing, or you realize that your relationship has suffered."Barrymore said she's had to give up directing so she can spend more time with Olive, her 6-month-old daughter with husband Will Kopelman, People magazine reported."It was heartbreaking to let it go, but it was a clear choice," Barrymore said. "I was raised in that generation of women can have it all, and I don't think you can. I think some things fall off the table. The good news is, what does stay on the table becomes much more in focus and much more important."When she does have to work away from her daughter, she said she feels "guilty all the time.""But you combat it by being a superhero. When you go out there in the world you have to remember, 'I'm doing the best I can, I'm doing it for them, and I'm going to be there for them too. I'm just going to figure out the balance,'" she said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday approved a bill boosting the number of customs agents at the nation's borders and giving them better technological tools.The committee's version of H.R. 3129, the Customs Border Protection Act of 2001, now heads to the House floor after passing 20-14 along party lines. The bill would increase the U.S. Customs Service budget to $5 billion over the next two years. Efforts to prevent air- and sea-borne smuggling would get a little more than $180 million in each of the next two fiscal years.H.R. 3129 gives Customs an additional $25 million in FY 02 to hire about 285 more officers to more fully staff U.S.-Canada border crossings and ports. The agency would get more than $90 million in FY 02 to purchase and deploy advanced X-ray machines, communications gear and surveillance equipment at Mexican, Canadian and Gulf Coast sites. The bill provides $9 million for maintaining the systems during FY 03.The agency's noncommercial operations would get $886 million in fiscal year 2002 and $909 million the following year, while commercial operations would get about $1.6 billion both years. More than $600 million of the commercial operations funds would go towards creating an advanced computer system for handling border-crossing paperwork and providing a nationwide view of import-export activity. The bill also requires airlines to share computerized passenger and cargo information with Customs to help the agency spot high-risk situations.The bill's most controversial anti-terrorism provisions involve the agency's search powers and protection from legal liability. H.R. 3129 would expand Customs' officials inspection rights covering ordinary U.S. mail leaving the country, in order to detect and stop weapons of mass destruction or attempts at money laundering. Committee Democrats raised worries about such broad search authority, but Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said Customs officers wouldn't be able to actually read mail without a search warrant.The bill would also protect Customs employees from civil suits filed in connection with searches and inspections, as long as the officers "performed the search in good faith." The agency says judges need such a measure in order to swiftly throw out frivolous lawsuits.Several Democrats, including Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., objected, saying the bill's language could protect officers involved in racial profiling and other misconduct. The committee eventually rejected an amendment from Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., to remove the provision from the bill.Another major point of dissention dealt with revamping Customs officers' overtime and night shift pay policies. Currently, officers are limited to $30,000 of combined overtime and premium pay per year, but H.R. 3129 would exclude premium pay from the cap and give the Customs Commissioner authority to waive the cap in limited cases.As for nighttime differential pay, if a customs officer currently works most of a shift before 8 a.m. or after 5 p.m., the officer receives extra pay for the entire shift. The bill would limit premium pay to actual hours worked outside the 8-5 timeframe. The premium itself would rise to at least 18 percent of base pay for work between 5 p.m. and midnight, and to 25 percent for work between midnight and 8 a.m.Committee Democrats, led by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., objected vociferously to the reallocation, pointing to Customs estimates that 2,500 officers, about one-third of its staff, would see smaller paychecks as a result. Under questioning from Stark, Deputy Assistant Customs Commissioner Richard Quinn said the agency didn't ask for the pay changes, and had no opinion on the reallocation.Thomas pointed out that Customs employees could choose shifts with full differential pay if they want to maintain their income level. Quinn told Thomas that Customs didn't expect the change to affect its operations, but Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., wasn't satisfied with that answer.Matsui quizzed Quinn on which airport staffs might feel the biggest impact from the reallocation. After lengthy consultation with agency staff, Quinn said the arrival times of European flights mean officers at East Coast airports such as JFK International in New York City would probably be most affected by the change. After lengthy additional debate, the committee rejected Stark's amendment to remove the reallocation from the bill on a party-line, 20-13 vote.

HOMS, Syria, April 29 (UPI) -- The newly appointed head of the U.N. observer mission to Syria arrived Sunday amid increasing bloodshed.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood of Norway will head the observer mission consisting of about 30 monitors, which will grow to 300 in the coming month, CNN reported."This is a matter of utmost urgency for the United Nations and all efforts are in place to make sure that we get the people on the ground as quickly as possible. ... Apart from Damascus, we have permanently based observers in Homs, Hama, Deraa and Idlib, so this process will continue," said Neeraj Singh, the observer team's spokesman.Despite a cease-fire agreement put in place by the United Nations April 12 as part of a six-point peace plan, security forces continue to target civilians and opposition forces, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. At least six people died in Syria Sunday, the group said, including a father and son found dead in their Homs home.The United Nations estimates about 9,000 people have died since March 2011 when the Syrian government began cracking down on demonstrations against President Bashar Assad's regime. Opposition groups put the death toll closer to 11,000. At least 700 people have been killed since the April 12 cease-fire, CNN reported.

Jan. 21 (UPI) -- Beyonce, who serenaded Barack and Michelle Obama through their first dance at the Neighborhood Ball four years ago, will sing the National Anthem at the president's inauguration Monday. Ahead of the momentous performance, Beyonce posted photos of her preparations on Instagram and Tumblr. In one photo, Beyonce holds the "Star Spangled Banner's" sheet music. She also snapped a photo of the tape marks where the Obamas and Bidens are supposed to stand.The 31-year-old singer earlier spoke about how much the opportunity meant to her."Every time I am overworked and in a stressful situation, I always think about moments like this," Beyonce told Zap2It Friday. "And it makes everything worth while.""I can't really think about it until it is over. It is too much! There is no way I would be able to sing," she said. Here's Beyonce's incredible performance of Etta James' "At Last" in 2009. Follow @KateStan and @UPI on Twitter.

Cheryl Ladd (born Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor; July 12, 1951) is an American actress, singer and author. Ladd is best known for her role as Kris Munroe in the television series Charlie's Angels, hired amid a swirl of publicity prior to its second season in 1977 to replace the departing Farrah Fawcett-Majors. Ladd remained with the show until its cancellation in 1981.
Ladd was born Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor in Huron, South Dakota, the second daughter of Dolores (née Katz), a waitress, and Marion Stoppelmoor (1929–2001), a railroad engineer. She married fellow actor David Ladd, son of the famous actor Alan Ladd, with whom she had a daughter, Jordan. She took his surname as her own, which she kept after their divorce. She has been married to music producer Bryan Russell since 1981, and has a stepdaughter, Lindsay Russell. Ladd is a celebrity ambassador for the child abuse prevention and treatment non-profit Childhelp.
Ladd initially came to Hollywood in 1970 to begin a career in music (she was known as "Cherie Moor" when she was the singing voice of Melody on Hanna-Barbera's Josie and the Pussycats animated series). She soon began to land non-singing roles in commercials and episodic television - including guest appearances on shows such as The Rookies, The Partridge Family and Happy Days. The Charlie's Angles series made her an overnight star, and Ladd took the opportunity of her sudden popularity to further pursue her musical interests, guest-starring in musical-comedy variety series and specials, performing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl XIV in January 1980, and releasing three albums, enjoying a Top 40 Hot 100 single and a Gold record. In September 2000, Ladd starred on Broadway, taking over the title role from Bernadette Peters in a revival of Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun. She played the role until January 2001, when Reba McEntire took over.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
