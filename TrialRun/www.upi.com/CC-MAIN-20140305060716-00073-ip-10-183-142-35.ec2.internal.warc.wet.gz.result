WASHINGTON, July 11 (UPI) -- Oil imports into the United States next year should be at their lowest level in nearly 20 years, the Energy Department said.The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department, said imports of crude oil and other petroleum products have been falling steadily since 2005.New technologies in drilling have unleashed oil and natural gas reserves in underground shale formations previously out of reach for energy explorers in states like Texas and North Dakota. Offshore, the EIA said in a short-term outlook published Wednesday oil production from the Gulf of Mexico is increasing as well."EIA expects U.S. crude oil production to rise from an average of 6.5 million bpd in 2012 to 7.3 million bpd in 2013 and 8.1 million bpd in 2014," the short-term report stated. Oil production from the Gulf of Mexico is expected to increase from 1.3 million bpd in 2013 to 1.4 million bpd by 2014.The EIA said U.S. crude oil production in May was the highest since 1992 at 7.3 million bpd. The agency said it expects the net import share of crude oil and petroleum production to fall to 31 percent of the energy mix in 2014, which would be the lowest level since 1985.The Interior Department is expected to hold a lease sale for unexplored areas in the Gulf of Mexico next month.

HATFIELD, England, April 26 (UPI) -- A distant star much like the sun may have as many as nine planets and possibly more, a record for the most extrasolar planets yet found, astronomers say.About 127 light years from Earth, the star HD 10180 was previously determined to have five confirmed planets and two candidate worlds. New analysis has confirmed the two candidate planets and suggests the sun-like star may have another two orbiting it.If so, the total of nine would outnumber our own solar system total, at eight planets after the "demotion" of Pluto to the status of dwarf-planet."The data indicates that there are not only seven but likely as many as nine planets in the system," Mikko Tuomi, an astronomer at the University of Hertfordshire in Britain, told SPACE.com. "The two new planets appear to have orbital periods of roughly 10 and 68 days and masses of 1.9 and 5.1 times that of Earth, which enables the classification of them as hot super-Earths, i.e. planets with likely scorchingly hot rocky surfaces."Tuomi analyzed observations collected between November 2003 and June 2010 at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.More research will be required to determine whether the final two planets are bona fide worlds and not false signals, he said."While the existence of the larger of these two is well supported by the data, the signal corresponding to the smaller one exceeds the detection threshold only barely, which gives it a very small but non-eligible probability of being a false positive," Tuomi said.

| License Photo	HAMBURG, Germany, Aug. 15 (UPI) -- Germany is reopening an investigation of Facebook, saying the social network was illegally compiling a vast photo database of users without their consent.The data protection commissioner in Hamburg said Wednesday he had reopened his investigation, suspended in June, after repeated attempts to persuade Facebook to change its policies about its use of facial recognition technology had failed."We have no other option but to reopen our investigation," Johannes Caspar told The New York Times. "We have met repeatedly with Facebook but have not been able to get their cooperation on this issue, which has grave implications for personal data."Facebook's use of recognition software to compile a photographic database of human faces from images uploaded by users has been criticized in Europe, where data protection laws require users to give explicit consent to such practices.However, Facebook makes the facial recognition system the default and requires users to opt out instead.Caspar said he wants Facebook to destroy its database of faces collected in Germany and revise its Web site to obtain the explicit permission of users to collect biometric data of their faces.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 30 (UPI) -- Lawrence Tynes kicked a 32-yard field goal with 63 seconds remaining Wednesday to give the New York Giants a 6-3 exhibition win over New England.In a game that contained much less drama than their Super Bowl matchup last season, New York quarterback Eli Manning played into the second quarter while completing 4-of-8 passes for 29 yards. The Patriots' Tom Brady did not take part in the final exhibition contest.New York receiver Hakeem Nicks, who broke his right foot in May, made his preseason debut and caught one pass for six yards.The majority of New England starters sat out the game. Jeff Demps had six carries for 15 yards and caught three passes for 31 yards. The teams combined for 18 punts.New York finished the exhibition campaign with a 2-2 record and will open defense of its NFL title next Wednesday at home against Dallas. New England (1-3) begins its season on the road against Tennessee Sept. 9.

CAIRO, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Egypt's military-led regime has given its security services wide-ranging powers amid widening political upheaval, raising fears the country is reverting to the police state it was before the 2011 pro-democracy revolution that toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak.Since the July 3 military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's first freely elected president, the Arab world's most populous nation has been in turmoil amid massive protests by pro-Morsi Islamists.More than 800 people have been killed in recent weeks, most of them protesters slain by police gunfire in a heavy-handed crackdown by the regime. One was a son of Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie, gunned down with 95 other people in an afternoon of clashes Aug. 16.Badie and 50 other Brotherhood figures have been arrested and thrown in prisons where Mubarak incarcerated tens of thousands of Islamists during his 30-year-rule.The Brotherhood, formed in 1928 and the godfather of all the radical Islamist groups across the Muslim world, has won all five elections held since Mubarak was deposed Feb. 11, 2011.The regime is also grappling with a worsening jihadist insurgency in the vast Sinai Peninsula that last week triggered a major offensive by the army with tanks and airstrikes.Authorities have blamed the Brotherhood for a series of bomb attacks and plots, including a Sept. 5 attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim near his Cairo home.Ibrahim, a key figure in the security apparatus, announced in July several controversial police units, nominally disbanded after Mubarak's ouster, were being restored to help counter the widening Islamist-led unrest.At the same time, interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi was given the power to impose a state of emergency, a pillar of Mubarak's rule. He proposed disbanding the Muslim Brotherhood, raising the stakes in what has become a bloody struggle between the state and the Islamists for control of the country.The restored police units include the State Security Investigations Service, or Mabhith Amn al-Dawla, the most notorious of Mubarak's hated police apparatus and a symbol of repression.Several other units that specialized in hunting down Islamists, -- outlawed from the 1950s during the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser until Mubarak's fall -- and all those who opposed the state, were also reconstituted.In March 2011, all these organizations were replaced with a new National Security Service, which was supposed to be transparent and accountable.Perhaps ominously, Ibrahim referred to the NSS by its Mubarak-era name."These units committed the most atrocious human rights violations," said Aida Seif al-Dawla, a leading human rights activist and the head of a group that aids victims of state brutality. "Incommunicado detentions, killings outside the law. These were the units that managed the killing of Islamists during the 1990s. It's an ugly authority that has never been brought to justice."Liberals are increasingly alarmed at the way the military regime, headed by army chief of staff Gen. Ahmed-Fattah al-Sisi, now characterizes the security operations as aimed at "fighting terrorists" rather than political activists.That catch-all strategy has heightened concerns about the return of the brutal security state that existed under Mubarak, who ruled for 30 years before he was driven from power in the Arab Spring uprising of 2011.There are suspicions that the "Deep State" -- secretive, illegal groups within the state apparatus -- are behind many recent violent incidents, seeking to stoke up public anger against the Islamists and those who question the state.The resurrected Mabhith Amn al-Dawla is frequently mentioned in this regard.The Aug. 17 release of Mubarak, who'd been imprisoned since his downfall, convinced many Egyptians that the democratic objectives of the 2011 revolution have been shredded in the turmoil that has gripped the country since that uprising.It was, after all, the same military that forced Mubarak to step down in 2011.Al-Sisi, hailed by many Egyptians as their savior from Islamist tyranny, insists he doesn't want to be president.International affairs commentator David Gardner, an old Middle East hand, cautioned, "The army, the country's paramount institution ... is clearly determined to secure its power, privileges and prestige in the country's political and economic affairs -- just as it did, not just under Mubarak but with Morsi."

RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 28 (UPI) -- The Virginia Legislature is taking up a bill that repeals a 19th-century ban on unwed couples living together, a lawmaker said.The "shacking up ban" has been on he books since 1877, said state Sen. Adam Ebbin, who is sponsoring its repeal. It terms such behavior as lewd and lascivious conduct, punishable by a $250 fine for the first offense and a $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail for repeated offenses -- though it hasn't been enforced in ages, the (Norfolk) Virginian Pilot said Monday.The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled such state laws unconstitutional and state courts in Virginia have followed suit.Ebbin's bill was voted unanimously out of committee and will proceed to the full Senate for a vote before being forwarded to the House of Delegates for consideration. Ebbin estimated 140,000 Virginians live with an unmarried partner.

Feb. 4 (UPI) -- There are many mysteries surrounding the events that took place during Sunday's Super Bowl XLVII, among them, is whether or not Beyonce flashed an Illuminati sign while performing Destiny's Child's hit "Independent Women," along former band mates, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland.While the trio was delivering the "The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it, 'Cause I depend on me," line (at the 00:55 mark in the clip) Beyonce clearly flashed a diamond-like shape with her hands, but not because she's part of the Enlightenment-era secret society group, The Illuminati, but because that is the Roc-A-Fella records sign, coined by her husband Jay-Z and his BFF, Kanye West.So for those conspiracy theorists out there who thought Bey had teamed up with the Illuminati to engineer one of the biggest Super Bowl mishaps ever, think again. She was just channeling her hubby's gang sign that "symbolizes anything pertaining to the Roc."
