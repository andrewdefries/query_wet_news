| License Photo	TEL AVIV, Israel, April 3 (UPI) -- The expected reconciliation between Israel and Turkey could lead to a ground-breaking strategic energy partnership in the politically turbulent eastern Mediterranean, analysts say.This would center on the former allies, the two most powerful non-Arab states in the Middle East, ending a three-year separation that will see Israel pumping its new-found offshore natural gas resources to Turkey via an undersea pipeline for sale in energy-hungry Europe.But there would be a geopolitical downside: hydrocarbon wannabes Cyprus and Lebanon could find themselves hard put to market their offshore gas reserves on which they're pinning their economic future.Even so, officials on both sides are talking about how the surprise olive branch proffered by hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu March 22 removed the major obstacle for the joint development of vast gas fields discovered in the eastern Mediterranean since 2009.Netanyahu, pressed by U.S. President Barack Obama to end the rift with Turkey, formally apologized for the Israeli navy's May 31, 2010, interception of a Turkish-organized humanitarian flotilla bound for the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip.Naval commandoes killed nine Turks in the action in international waters.Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan broke off relations with Israel, demanding an apology and compensation for the victims' families.Netanyahu stubbornly refused to concede Israel was culpable, despite an international outcry against the Jewish state that erupted when it invaded Gaza in December 2007 in a bid -- futile as it turned out -- to crush the ruling Palestinian Hamas movement there.The confrontation between the two military heavyweights, which also dated from the Gaza incursion, was a major setback for U.S. policy in the region at a time when American influence was waning in the aftermath of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.The Americans have been pressing the two sides, both longtime U.S. allies, to patch up their differences amid a cascade of crises in the region, including a U.S.-Iran stand-off in the Persian Gulf and the civil war in Syria that threatens to totally destabilize the region.The Financial Times quoted a senior Turkish official as saying the rapprochement made the idea of a gas pipeline from Israel to Turkey "a much more viable" prospect.Turkey, with no energy resources of its own, wants to become the main east-west energy hub between Russia and Europe.Indeed, Israeli sources say the economic gains that restoring relations with Ankara are likely to bring were central to Netanyahu's decision to end the rift.Israel has two major deep-water gas fields off its northern coast that contain a total of at least 25 trillion-27 trillion cubic feet of gas.Production from the Tamar field, the first discovery in 2009, began Saturday. It holds at least 8 tcf. The larger Leviathan field further west contains some 16 tcf. These finds will transform the economy of Israel, which has had to import all its fuel.The Financial Times reported that the main investors in Israel, Nobel Energy Inc. of Houston, and its main local partner, Delek Energy, "have in recent weeks sounded out possible customers in energy-hungry Turkey, but until now the countries' rift appeared to preclude progress."Oxford Analytica observed that Erdogan "does not like Israel but Turkey's national interest takes precedence over his personal antipathy."By reconciling with Israel, he hopes Washington will drop its objections to his burgeoning links with Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish zone.U.S. oil majors there are poised to develop the enclave's reserves of 45 billion barrels of crude despite Baghdad's bitter opposition and Washington's fears that will mean the breakup of the Iraqi state the Americans established after the 2003 invasion.None of this will benefit Cyprus, gripped by a toxic economic crisis even though the island's sitting on large gas fields, or Lebanon, which is moving toward issuing licenses to drill for its estimated reserves of 25 tcf.Israel and Cyprus had talked of jointly exporting to Europe via Greece but it's financially on its knees as well.Whether Cyprus and Lebanon find hooking into that pipeline to be their only feasible export plan remains to be seen.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (UPI) -- More signs point to drug-importation legislation making it through this session of Congress -- but it is not a sure thing. Concerns over safety remain among Republicans, even as the political pieces are falling into place for a bill to reach President Bush's desk.Republicans slowly have moved to support legalized importation, which Democrats latched onto after they lost control of the Medicare prescription-drug movement to President Bush, who now claims the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 as a domestic-policy centerpiece. Faced with embarrassment for allowing the Republicans to push through their pet project, Democrats looked over the MMA's shoulder and found rising costs of prescription drugs not only for seniors, but for all Americans.Buses loaded with seniors heading to Canada to purchase medicine more cheaply, a wide-open Internet touting cheap Viagra and painkillers to anyone with a credit card, and pharmaceutical industry profits ever on the rise made for an acceptable consolation prize for Democrats. Legalizing drug importation from Canada and European countries would bring prices down for everyone, ensure the safety of drugs, reduce problems of drug counterfeiting and unregulated Web pharmacies and, though not imposing true price controls, take Big Pharma down a notch.At some point in the argument last year, Republicans began to realize Democrats were not backing down and were getting support from seniors who could not afford their prescription drugs.The GOP throughout 2004 also could not come up with the evidence -- not thousands or hundreds or tens or even a handful of deaths among Canadians who took prescription drugs purchased from Canadian pharmacies. Not to mention those U.S. seniors were suffering no adverse effects from prescriptions they obtained north of the border, either.The safety issue touted by the administration fell on deaf ears and even Tommy Thompson, then the Health and Human Services Secretary, said Bush should not stand in the way of importation legislation.The result is S. 334, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2005, which has some 30 bi-partisan co-sponsors in the Senate. They include Republicans Charles Grassley of Iowa and Trent Lott of Mississippi, and Democrats Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.The companion bill in the House, H.R. 700, introduced by a Republican, Jo Anne Emerson of Missouri, has only eight sponsors but they include fellow Republicans Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida, Anne Northup of Kentucky and Zach Wamp of Tennessee. Independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont also is a co-sponsor, along with Democrats Marion Berry of Arkansas, Dennis Moore of Kansas, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Thomas Allen of Maine.Another importation bill on the docket is S. 109, the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2005, introduced by newcomer Republican David Vitter of Louisiana, who championed the bill after winning the seat left vacant with the retirement of Democrat John Breaux. This bill is co-sponsored by fellow freshmen Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina and John Thune of South Dakota. On the Democrat list, newcomer Ken Salazer of Colorado also is a co-sponsor. The House companion bill, H.R. 328, also introduced by a Republican, Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, has 85 co-sponsors from both parties -- including some who also co-sponsored H.R. 700.These bills are working their way through the committee process -- not necessarily always on their own, but because of political wrangling on other issues. Supporters really are not quibbling as long as one version passes both chambers. "If their bill was on the Senate floor for passage right now I would enthusiastically speak for it, vote for it," Vitter told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions or HELP Committee Tuesday during a hearing on Dorgan's S. 334.Though S. 109 differs from S. 334 in its mechanics, Vitter said, "I stand shoulder to shoulder on the broad issue with all of my colleagues here."HELP Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said the committee "will do something on drug importation" and Dorgan testified, "I believe we have the votes to pass this in the House and the Senate." Enzi also recently won unanimous Senate approval of a budget bill amendment that would set up a fund for implementing the safe importation of drugs.Even with Republican and Democrat agreement that drug importation will go through, it does not mean the process will be easy. The Bush administration is not onboard and Tuesday's hearing brought out two trouble spots in supporters' arguments: Food and Drug Administration regulation and parallel trading.S. 334 spells out how pharmacies and wholesales that would import drugs into the United States would have to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration -- calling for registration and FDA inspection of non-U.S. facilities.Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said the bill replaced long-standing regulations that guarantee the safety of U.S. drugs with a "new regime" and demanded the sponsors explain a section entitled "Manufacturing changes."Bill co-sponsor Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, responded that because legal importation would be new to FDA "I'd expect there would be a change in regime.""These are critical issues to the consumers of America," an irritated Gregg shot back. "What does it mean?"Gregg than reclaimed his time and did not allow Snowe to finish her answer, but Dorgan tried to smooth things over by saying the bill sets up a closed system where only FDA-approved drugs made in FDA-approved facilities would be imported -- essentially the same process as currently used."We don't propose to change any of that," Dorgan said."I don't know what that means and the FDA doesn't know what that means," Gregg said. "It's going to have a huge impact on the drugs coming into this country."The importation supporters' argument, that the European Union system of parallel trading -- when consumers can import drugs from any other member country, e.g., from England to Spain or from Italy to France -- is safe and effective, was shot down by U.K. consultant Graham Satchwell, an expert on pharmaceutical fraud and counterfeit drugs. Satchwell, author of "A Sick Business - Counterfeit Medicines & Organized Crime," testified the United Kingdom has more parallel trading because it has higher drug prices than other EU countries. He called it a perfect way to smuggle counterfeit products through legitimate channels."There is no one European body that a dealer can check to see if the drug has a license or not," Satchwell testified. "Each U.K. trader would have to speak every European language."Satchwell also said parallel trading means medicines can change hands 20 times in the distribution chain, "making product recall practically impossible."His written testimony noted a 2004 survey showed of 300 imported medicines examined, 25 percent should have failed on safety reasons and 50 percent because of poor quality of the product.Dr. David Kessler, a former FDA commissioner and now at the University of California-San Francisco, said the debate in the United States is not about establishing importation because that already is occurring."The current system is out of control," he testified, "There is virtually no reliable way for consumers to know if an Internet pharmacy outside the United States is legitimate."He said S. 334 would "give FDA a way to assess whether drugs distributed in other countries meet FDA standards."Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Executive Vice President Russel Bantham did not testify before the panel, but issued a statement disagreeing with supporters of the bill."Unfortunately many of the witnesses at today's HELP Committee hearing failed to give a complete picture of the dangers involved with their legislation," Bantham said. "The Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2005 is nothing but a bait and switch scheme. This bill would allow importing drugs not only from Canada, but from more than 25 other countries, including Latvia, Estonia and Slovakia. According to recent polls, an overwhelming majority of seniors oppose importing drugs from foreign countries other than Canada. Worst yet, the Canadian government has said many times that it takes no responsibility for the origin, safety or effectiveness of medications destined for the U.S."Kennedy summed up the emotional issue of how double-digit percentage increases in prescription drugs have hurt Americans -- especially seniors. He noted a study published in Health Affairs that found 25 percent of America's seniors went without needed medications because they couldn't afford them."We have a real crisis for real people, for real families," Kennedy said "It's the responsibility of Congress to see that it (importation) can be done safely." The administration's task force on drug importation last year decided such a system would not be safe -- and Bush has not backed away from that assessment. Whether he would veto drug importation legislation is uncertain -- but given the public support for it such a move could have repercussions at the state level for Republican lawmakers.--E-mail: ebeck@upi.com

| License Photo	LONDON, June 13 (UPI) -- The British and Emirati governments said Thursday they were investing $2.7 million to finance a refugee camp in Jordan for Syrians displaced by civil war.The British and Emirati governments said they were coordinating their efforts to support operations at a Jordanian refugee camp near the Syrian border.A string of human rights reports published this week focus on the challenges facing women and children displaced by or directly affected by the Syrian civil war.British Minister for International Development Alan Duncan said the Emirati partnership would help thousands of children who were forced to flee their homes in Syria to neighboring Jordan."Week after week, we have seen the number of refugees fleeing Syria continue to grow. Inevitably, it is children who suffer most," he said in a statement Thursday.The U.S. State Department said Wednesday it was easing sanctions in Syria to facilitate the delivery of non-military goods "to liberated areas of Syria for the benefit of the Syrian people."The waiver for goods originating from the United States extends to items used for agricultural production, software and technology. The export of food and medicine doesn't require a special license.U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Thursday there were 92,901 documented cases of individuals killed during the civil war from its beginning in March 2011 to the end of April."The constant flow of killings continues at shockingly high levels," she said in a statement.

MADRID, May 25 (UPI) -- Spain mulled creating a state-owned superbank to absorb failing banks, while in Greece a financially ruined man and his 90-year-old mother committed suicide.Luis de Guindos, Spain's minister of the economy and competitiveness, told reporters the possible superbank would absorb Spain's now-nationalized No. 4 bank, Bankia SA conglomerate -- formed from seven struggling regional savings banks in December 2010 -- and other troubled banks.Three banks being considered -- banks whose near-insolvency is largely due to unsound real estate lending -- include No. 4 savings bank, CatalunyaCaixa, year-old Novagalicia Banco and No. 6 commercial lender, Bank of Valencia, the Spanish daily El Pais reported.Madrid had planned to put at least CatalunyaCaixa and Novagalicia up for auction but is leaning against doing so because it believes it won't get enough money for them, the newspaper said."In the end run, the objective is to clean up the Spanish financial system," de Guindos said. "The government is taking stock. All options are open."Spaniards, like Greeks, are pulling money out of Spanish banks and transferring it to banks in other countries -- with some people converting their money into non-euro currencies -- amid growing fears Madrid will not be able to support Spain's struggling banking sector, The New York Times reported.Some worry Spain will be forced to leave the eurozone -- as many fear Greece will do -- and re-adopt its old currency, the peseta, the newspaper said.In Spain about 4.3 percent of bank deposits, or about $51 billion, has left the country in the past year. In Greece, nearly one-third of the country's bank deposits have left the country in the past two years.Spain's national deposit insurance fund is virtually bankrupt, the Times said.In central Athens, a 60-year-old unemployed musician and his 90-year-old mother leaped to their deaths from their apartment building's fifth-floor roof Thursday, witnesses said.Witnesses told Athens News the pair held hands while jumping, while others, quoted by Greece's NewsIt Web site, said Antonis Perris pushed his Alzheimer's-plagued mother from the roof first, and then jumped.Perris wrote on the blog stoixoi.info Wednesday night his mother, whom he had taken care of for 20 years, began having schizophrenic fits recently and no nursing home would accept her.The two lived together on the mother's $426 pension, NewsIt said.

Feb. 8 (UPI) -- Emma Watson is definitely on 'Team Bella.' In a recent interview with Vanity Fair Italy the 'Harry Potter' star went on the record about Kristen Stewart's affair with Rupert Sanders and how the media managed to distort it all."Those who criticized her are the same people that think that being rich and famous is like being covered in some kind of magic powder that makes life perfect: Nothing can go wrong in your wonderful world," Watson said. "For these people, Kristen deserves all the bad things that have been thrown at her because she had an amazing life and she ruined it."Watson went on to say Stewart's mistake is a common one for people her age and that it was the media who blew the entire thing out of proportion.“I don’t know how to explain it, but it sure isn't perfect. I thought that the media picked on her in a very horrible way. Kristen is human, just like everybody else, and she’s so young. Everyone makes mistakes, everyone. It’s not fair to consider them matters of public interest.”Nevertheless, the 22-year-old actress can understand why the public was so upset. “On one hand, I can understand why it happened: people felt really involved in her relationship with Robert Pattinson. But it’s also true that they both have done everything in their power to keep their relationship as far from the public eye as possible.”

Hawes played center at Seattle Prep, an elite college-prep school in Seattle, WA. The team won the state championship for the 2005–2006 season and Hawes was named the tournament MVP.
