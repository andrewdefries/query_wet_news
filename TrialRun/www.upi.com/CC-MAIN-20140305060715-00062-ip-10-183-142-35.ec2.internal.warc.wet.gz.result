MOSCOW, June 20 (UPI) -- Utilizing natural gas from Russia would spark socioeconomic development in countries near its eastern border, Russian energy company Gazprom said.Top executives from Gazprom met with Asian officials in Moscow to discuss its move into the Asia-Pacific region."Natural gas utilization by the residential, industrial and power generation sectors of Russia's eastern regions would trigger their socioeconomic development," a statement from Gazprom read.The company said it was "intensely developing" its resource base and transmission capacity in the region.The Yamal Peninsula in Russia's Far East is set to become a new production center for processing of liquefied natural gas. The development of the Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok pipeline and other LNG hubs in the region are top developmental priorities, the company said.More than 85 percent of LNG deliveries from Gazprom were to Asia-Pacific countries in 2011.Gazprom has focused more intently on Asian economies as European partners take steps to break the Russian grip on the regional energy sector.

LOS ANGELES, June 20 (UPI) -- Producer Bill Lawrence says his U.S. TV series "Scrubs" will undergo a significant transformation when it comes back for its ninth season.Lawrence said instead of focusing on the comedic side of hospital life, the ABC sitcom will be primarily focused on stars John C. McGinley and Donald Faison serving as teachers at a medical school, Entertainment Weekly reported online Friday."It's going to be a different show, Lawrence said of his series, which shifted from NBC to ABC for its eighth season. "It'll still be life-and-death stakes, but if the show is just 'Scrubs' again in the hospital with a different person's voice-over, it would be a disaster and people would be mad."The new season will also see the introduction of new characters as "Scrubs" stars Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke and Judy Reyes and others will only make guest appearances."Med students in their first three years have to spend anywhere from 10 to 50 percent of their time at a hospital," Lawrence said of the plot shift. "And that's when you'll see some of the (original cast members)."

| License Photo	BALTIMORE, Nov. 6 (UPI) -- U.S. government health officials issued a final rule to increase payments to primary care physicians who treat Medicare patients next year.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also said there is a new policy to pay a patient's physician or practitioner to coordinate the patient's care in the 30 days following a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay."Recognizing the work of community physicians and practitioners in treating a patient following discharge from a hospital or nursing facility will ensure better continuity of care for these patients and help reduce patient readmissions," a statement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said."The changes in care coordination payment and other changes in the rule are expected to increase payment to family practitioners by 7 percent -- and other primary care practitioners between 3 percent and 5 percent -- if Congress averts the statutorily required reduction in Medicare's physician fee schedule."The final rule also included a required 26.5 percent across-the-board reduction to Medicare payment rates for more than 1 million physicians and non-physician practitioners under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997's sustainable growth rate methodology.However, Congress has overridden the required reduction every year since 2003, health officials said."The Obama administration is committed to fixing the sustainable growth rate update methodology and ensuring these payment cuts do not take effect," officials of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. "Predictable, fiscally responsible physician payments are essential for Medicare to sustain quality and lower healthcare costs over the long-term."

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 28 (UPI) -- Canadian and U.S. biologists say they have, for the first time, successfully tracked juvenile salmon in both rivers and oceans.The achievement, officials said, was made possible by newly developed miniature tagging and tracking technologies that can follow small salmon over vast distances."It may have been one of humankind's first ponderings: the fish that got away -- where they come from, where they go and what happens to them in between," said Jim Bolger, executive director of the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project, part of the International Census of Marine Life and based at Canada's Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Center."Until now it has been difficult to follow small animals in vast oceans and it has only been possible to infer their movements using very indirect methods," he said. "Thanks to new sound-emitting tags about the size of an almond, combined with an extensive coastal network of underwater detectors from Alaska to California, several mysteries of fish migration and survival may soon start to unravel."A paper in the journal PLoS Biology describes one of the first applications of the technology -- comparing the survival of young salmon in dammed and un-dammed rivers.

France is up 2-0 in that series.Mayer missed out on five break opportunities but used success in the tiebreakers to take a 2-0 set lead. Lopez used the first two breaks of the match to win the third set and four off four more break points in forcing a fifth set.Mayer -- on his 10th try -- finally finished off a break opportunity and then held on for the 2-0 series lead.Kohlschreiber didn't allow Bautista Agut a break chance the entire match, winning 72 percent of the points on serve. He converted five of his eight break chances, including two in the final set.

TEHRAN, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Iran is flexible on its nuclear issue but hasn't been rewarded with a sense of optimism about the way forward, an Iranian commander said Wednesday.Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted by Iran's semiofficial Fars News Agency as saying the Iranian government entered nuclear negotiations with "heroic flexibility" but "we cannot be optimistic."Members of the P5-plus-1 -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany -- met Tuesday with their Iranian counterparts in Vienna to discuss Iran's nuclear program. Prospects were dimmed by expressions of frustration from both sides.The U.S. State Department said Monday securing an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program "will be tough" and the road ahead will have "some ups and probably many downs."The Iranian government expressed frustration with a U.S. position that a military option is on the table if Iran goes back on an agreement to curb its nuclear research activity in exchange for relief from some economic sanctions. Iran is suspected of pursuing technology needed to develop a nuclear weapon, an allegation it denies.

NEW YORK, Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Prosecutors said New York City's so-called "cannibal cop" exchanged emails with a Pakistani man in a plot to take a woman to India to rape and cook her.On the third day of Gilberto Valle's federal trial, FBI agent Corey Walsh read aloud email and electronic-chat discussions between Valle and a 35-year-old Pakistani man identified as Aly Khan, CNN reported.The two met on a fetish website and allegedly discussed ways to kidnap, cook and eat women, the New York Post reported."I would actually love to cook a girl alive over an open fire," Valle wrote Khan, Walsh said.Valle apparently made plans in the emails to take then-fiance Kathleen Mangan to India where he and Khan would repeatedly rape her, then cook and eat her, the Post reported."If you bring her here, i promise i will make a good meal for you," Aly Khan wrote in January 2012."She is a sweet girl," Valle wrote back. "I like her a lot. But I will move on."Mangan married Valle about six months later, but fled the home she shared with him after discovering evidence on their shared computer of Valle's desire to "slow cook" and eat women she knew. Valle, 28, faces charges he conspired to torture and eat women. He was arrested on a conspiracy to commit kidnapping charge Oct. 24. Defense lawyer Julia L. Gatto said the electronic conversations were "pure fiction," saying "Gil is guilty of having bizarre thoughts and foolishly sharing them on an Internet [chat] with others. ... There's no crime here, just very disturbing, shocking thoughts."

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- Unidentified men attacked a Democratic Republic of Congo refugee camp early Sunday, raping women and looting the facility, a U.N. official said. Simplice Kpandji, a U.N. spokeswoman, said she didn't know whether anyone at the Mugunga III camp had been killed, CNN reported. The camp, which houses more than 30,000 refugees, is about 6 miles from Goma, the city that has been the center of fighting between the M23 rebels and government troops. Kpandji said officials were working on gathering more information to identify the attackers.U.N. monitors determined that rebels had withdrawn from Goma, more than a week after seizing the city from government forces, just as word came of the attack on the camp.The United Nations and Goma residents accused the M23 rebels of looting, and witnesses said government troops also looted as they fled Goma last week.The United Nations welcomed M23's move, but said the group must cease military activity and stay outside of Goma."We welcome [the M23s'] withdrawal, but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile," Kieran Dwyer, a spokesman for U.N. peacekeepers, said.

| License Photo	March. 27 (UPI) -- Audiences got to know Kendall Jenner as a pre-teen on "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," but the 5-foot-10 17-year-old has her eye on the fashion world.In the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar Arabia, Jenner, who signed with Wilhelmina Models in 2010, opens up about growing up in the public eye and facing critics who say she's too thin. "I'm constantly criticized for being too skinny," Jenner said. "I'm trying to gain weight but my body won't let it happen." "What people don't understand is that calling someone too skinny is the same as calling someone too fat," she added. "It's not a nice feeling."Jenner also said that life on reality television helped her overcome her habitual shyness."I used to be so shy. I used to never talk, just sit back and do my thing," she told the magazine. "I am still pretty shy, but I've gotten much better because I'm always on set for photo shoots and I'm always filming with my family."Kendall's Harper's spread has been a hit with her half-sisters -- Kim Kardashian weighed in on her blog, calling Jenner's work "stunning." "She did an amazing job and the photos turned out absolutely gorgeous."(Harper's via E!)

Wiki
Giorgio Napolitano (Italian pronunciation: ; born 29 June 1925) is an Italian politician and former lifetime senator, the 11th and current President of the Italian Republic. His election took place on 10 May 2006, and his term started with the swearing-in ceremony held on 15 May 2006. He is the first President of Italy to have been a member of the Italian Communist Party.
Giorgio Napolitano was born in Naples. In 1942 he matriculated at the University of Naples Federico II. He adhered to the local Gioventù Universitaria Fascista ("University Fascist Youth"), where he met his core group of friends, who shared his opposition to Italian fascism. As he would later state, the group "was in fact a true breeding ground of anti-fascist intellectual energies, disguised and to a certain extent tolerated".
A theatre enthusiast since high school, during his university years he contributed a theatrical review to the IX Maggio weekly magazine, and had small parts in plays organized by the Gioventù Universitaria Fascista itself. He played in a comedy by Salvatore Di Giacomo at Teatro Mercadante in Naples. Napolitano dreamed of being an actor and spent his early years performing in several productions at the Teatro Mercadante. He later measured himself against Joyce and Eliot.
