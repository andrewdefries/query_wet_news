NEW YORK, Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Oil and natural gas contractor Halliburton announced it was looking to develop a greener process to coax natural gas out of shale formations.The United States, Poland and Ukraine are world leaders in shale gas deposits, with analysts saying those reserves could help secure each country's energy future.Energy companies use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to coax natural gas out of shale formations. The chemicals used in fracking fluid have raised concerns of environmentalists because of possible water contamination.Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Dave Lesar was quoted by the Platts news service as telling an energy conference in New York that his company was looking at fracking fluids that were considered safer for the environment.Lesar recognized that water "is an emotional issue," adding one of the proposed ingredients is a common fixture in off-the-shelf cake mixes."Who can argue against these chemicals if they go into our food every day?" he asked.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in February said eight of the nine companies that practice fracking voluntarily handed over information to help the agency examine the practice. It had to subpoena Halliburton for its records, however.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Sept. 6 (UPI) -- Hollywood's Columbia Pictures reportedly has hired the co-executive producers of "The Office" to write a third "Ghostbusters" movie.Variety.com said the project being penned by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky would ideally reunite Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson, the stars of the first two installments. However, the studio doesn't plan to make any deals with the actors until it has a script in hand, the entertainment industry trade newspaper said.Hudson, who recently lent his voice to a video game based on the 1980s paranormal comedies, told UPI in December 2007 that he was up for doing a third movie."Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, I know they want to do another film," Hudson said. "It would be great if we could get back together again."Ivan Reitman, the director of the first two movies, told UPI in July 2006: "What makes me nostalgic for 'Ghostbusters' is to work with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis; that was the joy of working on 'Ghostbusters' and 'Ghostbusters II.' They've become old friends. That's what you miss. It's not staging a marshmallow man walking down Columbus Circle; that's a pain in the ass. It's much better getting (the actors) all in a room and doing something funny."

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Feb. 4 (UPI) -- A U.S. advocate for safe and secure schools says there is no foolproof system for identifying potentially dangerous students, but there can be warning signs. Ronald D. Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center, said the center tracked U.S. school-associated violent deaths from 1992 to the present and identified common behaviors that could indicate a youth's potential for harming him/herself or others. Characteristics identified by the National School Safety Center include:-- A history of tantrums and uncontrollable angry outbursts.-- Resorts to name calling, cursing or abusive language.-- Habitually makes violent threats when angry.-- Previously brought a weapon to school.-- A background of serious disciplinary problems at school and in the community.-- A background of drug, alcohol or other substance abuse or dependency.-- Being on the fringe of his/her peer group with few or no close friends.-- Being preoccupied with weapons, explosives or other incendiary devices.-- Previously been truant, suspended or expelled from school.-- Displays cruelty to animals.-- Little or no supervision and support from parents or a caring adult.-- Witnesses or been a victim of abuse or neglect in the home.-- Bullied and/or bullies or intimidates peers or younger children.-- Tends to blame others for difficulties and problems s/he causes her/himself.-- Prefers TV shows, movies or music expressing violent themes and acts-- Reads materials dealing with violent themes, rituals and abuse.-- Reflects anger, frustration and the dark side of life in school essays or writing projects.-- Involved with a gang or an anti-social group on the fringe of peer acceptance.-- Often depressed and/or has significant mood swings.-- Threatens or attempts suicide.These characteristics should serve to alert school administrators, teachers and support staff to address needs of troubled students through meetings with parents, provision of school counseling, guidance and mentoring services, as well as referrals to appropriate community health/social services and law enforcement personnel, the center said.

DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 31 (UPI) -- U.S. physicians bring up sex in 65 percent of annual visits with their teen patients, but the conversations average less than 36 seconds, researchers say. Lead author Stewart Alexander, an associate professor of medicine at Duke Medicine, along with colleagues at Duke, Indiana University School of Medicine, Ohio State University and Purdue University, said annual physical checkups are prime opportunities for doctors to discuss sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy prevention."It's hard for physicians to treat adolescents and help them make healthy choices about sex if they don't have these conversations," Alexander said in a statement. "For teens who are trying to understand sex and sexuality, not talking about sex could have huge implications."The researchers gathered audio recordings of annual visits, including camp and sports physicals, for 253 adolescents. The teens, ages 12 to 17, visited pediatricians and family medicine physicians at 11 clinics in North Carolina.The researchers found physicians brought up sex in 65 percent of visits, with conversations lasting an average of 36 seconds. The other 35 percent of visits did not mention sex. The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, found none of the adolescents initiated discussions on sex -- reinforcing the need for physicians to start the conversation."We saw that physicians spent an average of 22.4 minutes in the exam room with their patients. Even when discussions about sex occurred, less than 3 percent of the visit was devoted to topics related to sex," Alexander said. "This limited exchange is likely inadequate to meet the sexual health prevention needs of teens."The study found when physicians asked them questions about sex, about half of the teens responded to yes or no questions with limited discussion, and just 4 percent of teens had prolonged conversations with their doctors concerning sex, sexuality or dating. The researchers also found that older teens were more likely to talk about sex in their visits than younger teens, despite the fact that current guidelines recommend doctors start these conversations in early adolescence before teens are sexually active."There's a saying that it's always better to have the conversation two years too soon than one day too late," Alexander said. "If you're one day too late, the teens may already be engaging in sexual behaviors that have consequences for them."Longer visits and confidentiality both raised the chances that sex was mentioned, Alexander said. "Although adolescents have access to information on sex from a variety of sources, physicians could do more in support of teens' healthy sexual development," Alexander said. "Initiating conversations demonstrates to adolescents that talking about sex is a normal part of a checkup, and may open the door for more extensive discussions."

July 19 (UPI) -- Yet another company is distancing itself from Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star accused of murder.Trading card and memorabilia company Panini said it "painstakingly removed" Herndandez stickers from 500,000 of its sticker books, and will replaced them with stickers of Tim Tebow.While the stickers typically come in separate packs, Panini included a starter set of 10 to come with the books. They said it was by coincidence that Hernandez was one of those 10 players.The one million Tebow stickers will be handed out at events, or customers can send a self-addressed envelope to Panini to receive a replacement."We felt strongly that making these changes was the right thing to do, for Panini and our products but, more importantly, for our fans and collectors," said Jason Howarth, Panini's vice president of marketing.The Pro Football Hall of Fame recently removed an award-winning image from its display. EA Sports erased Hernandez from upcoming video game releases Madden 14 and NCAA 14.

SEOUL, Jan. 15 (UPI) -- A string of visits to North Korea by foreign officials and private media executives is part of Pyongyang's efforts to improve its image, a scholar said.John Daniszewski, the vice president for the Associated Press, arrived in North Korea this week. His visit follows a tour from Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.The Yonhap news agency in South Korea said there was speculation that Pyongyang may be trying to send conciliatory messages to the international community given recent concerns expressed about its nuclear ambitions."There seems to be a move to use the visits and foreign exchanges to bolster the country's image," Yoo Ho-yeol, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, told Yonhap.North Korea deployed a three-stage rocket Dec. 12 as part of a program the government said was for peaceful space research. Washington and its allies, however, said it was a de facto attempt to test ballistic missile technology. Similar launches in 2006 and 2009 coincided with North Korean nuclear tests.Yonhap reports that it's unusual for Pyonyang to host this many foreign visitors. The reported image overhaul comes as U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay expressed frustration with the government's human rights record. She called for an independent probe into the situation, saying nuclear concerns often overshadow other pressing issues regarding North Korea.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Al-Jazeera agreed to buy the struggling Current TV current affairs channel partly owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and start a 24-hour news channel.Time Warner Cable Inc., the No. 2 U.S. cable operator, immediately said it would drop the channel.The sale's purchase price was undisclosed, but people with knowledge of the deal told The New York Times it was around $500 million, meaning Gore would receive about $100 million for his 20 percent Current ownership.Al-Jazeera, owned by a Qatar government media subsidiary, said it plans to shut down Current, based in San Francisco, and start an English-language news channel in New York called al-Jazeera America.The channel, which the Times said would likely be available in more than 40 million homes, would start later this year, with newscasts emanating from both New York and Doha, Qatar, al-Jazeera said.Roughly 60 percent of the programming would be produced in the United States, with the balance coming from al-Jazeera's Doha-based English-language international news channel, al-Jazeera English.Al-Jazeera -- which already has bureaus in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago -- intends to open several more in other U.S. cities and double its U.S. staff to more than 300 employees.Current co-founder lawyer-businessman Joel Hyatt said in a letter to Current employees -- including some who are expected to lose their jobs -- that he, Gore and the other Current owners agreed to sell to al-Jazeera in part because "al-Jazeera was founded with the same goals we had for Current," including "to give voice to those whose voices are not typically heard" and "to speak truth to power."He said he and Gore would join the al-Jazeera America advisory board.Al-Jazeera said in a statement it wanted to start the U.S. news channel because almost 40 percent of al-Jazeera English's global online viewing comes from the United States."U.S. viewers have clearly demonstrated that they like the way al-Jazeera provides ... news," Director General Ahmed bin Jassim al-Thani said.Al-Jazeera first went on the air Nov. 1, 1996, as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel and has since expanded into a 24-hour news network with several outlets, including Web and specialty TV channels in multiple languages.It also plans to start Turkish-language al-Jazeera Turk this year, it said.The network became known in the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks for its Arabic-language outlet, which aired videos of Osama bin Laden.Since then, al-Jazeera English, which started in 2006, has gained recognition for its international coverage, although U.S. cable and satellite distributors have largely refused to carry the channel, the Times said, so it is available on television only in several U.S. cities.The Times said al-Jazeera executives convinced Gore, Hyatt and the other Current owners it had the journalistic strength and financial backing to compete head-to-head with CNN and other U.S. news channels.Current was started Aug. 1, 2005, after Gore and Hyatt bought small U.S. cable news channel Newsworld International from France's Vivendi Universal, now Vivendi SA.The channel remained fairly obscure, showing viewer-submitted videos and documentaries, but broke through somewhat in 2011 when it shifted its format and hired Keith Olbermann, who brought his popular MSNBC program "Countdown" to the network.Olbermann went on the air June 20, 2011, and was fired March 30, 2012, replaced by former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer.Current made ratings headway but on a typical night last year still only attracted an average viewership of 42,000 households, Nielsen Media Research said.By contrast, Time Warner Inc.'s CNN has averaged about 700,000 households during prime time since late September, and Fox News Channel drew about 1.9 million, Nielsen said. Time Warner Cable, the largest cable provider in New York and Los Angeles, took advantage of a change-in-ownership clause and said in a statement Wednesday night it would remove the service "as quickly as possible.""Our agreement with Current has been terminated and we will no longer be carrying the service," the cable provider said.It earlier warned it might drop Current because of its low ratings.

MANILA, Philippines, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- At least 15 Islamist extremists were killed Thursday when the Philippine military bombed a terrorist hideout on the island of Sulu, officials said.In the attack, conducted with aid from an unmanned U.S. drone spy plane, two military planes struck the hideout and those killed included three senior terrorist leaders, PhilippineInquirer.net reported.The senior leaders killed were identified as Abu Sayyaf commander Umbra Jumdail, also known as Abu Pula, and Jemaah Islamiyah leaders Zulkifli bin Hir and Abdullah Ali, who uses the guerrilla name Muawiyah Anjala, military spokesman Col.

Dec. 17 (UPI) -- JetBlue has pitched in to help the family of one of the children slain in Newtown say their last goodbyes.The first funerals of the children murdered at Sandy Hook school took place Monday, just three days after they were killed. Not every member of the families of Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both 6, would be able to fly to Connecticut on such short notice. Noah's aunt, Victoria Haller, lives in Seattle and wouldn't make the funeral but hoped to write letters to be buried with her nephew. Even overnight post wouldn't be fast enough for the letters to reach Newtown in time for Noah's funeral, so a friend of Victoria's wrote to several airlines in the hopes that they could get help."A few got back to me and said 'No can do,' but JetBlue wrote back in ten minutes and said 'Send us her contact info,' the friend wrote on Facebook. "Within minutes, they had set up to get the letters on a red eye so the family could have them in the morning.""They didn't have to do anything, but to that family, they did everything." Haller, using the hashtag #LoveForNoah tweeted out her thanks to the airline.@vdog Again, we here at JetBlue find it a privilege and an honor to have been a part of this. #LoveForNoah from our family to yours!^KG— JetBlue Airways (@JetBlue) December 17, 2012
JetBlue's Twitter has been flooded with people expressing their thanks and respect for the gesture.The Facebook post:
