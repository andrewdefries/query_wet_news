LONDON, May 31 (UPI) -- The government of Ghana approved a development plan for an offshore oil installation that will start production as soon as 2016, Tullow Oil announced.Tullow said Ghana issued its formal approval for the development of the offshore Tweneboa-Enyenra-Ntomme, or TEN project."This is an important project that will give Ghana its second major offshore development," Tullow Oil Chief Executive Officer Aidan Heavey said in a statement.TEN is designated for the Tano project about 35 miles off the coast of Ghana. It's about 18 miles from the giant Jubilee oil field. Tullow said last month that a test of its floating production, storage and offloading associated with Jubilee indicates a capacity of more than 125,000 barrels of oil per day.The TEN project should deliver first oil by 2016. At its peak, it would produce about 80,000 bpd. Development includes plans for as many as 24 wells connected to an FPSO moored in deep Ghanaian waters.Oil companies ranging from Italy's Eni to U.S. explorer Hess Corp. have announced recent successes offshore Ghana. French supermajor Total said a discovery offshore Ivory Coast might be connected to the basin housing Jubilee.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, March 22 (UPI) -- Director Lynne Ramsay and actor Jude Law have quit "Jane Got a Gun" just as the film was to start shooting in New Mexico, The Hollywood Reporter said.Law had joined the cast after Michael Fassbender left the Natalie Portman-starring, $15 million western, due to scheduling delays. Law left the production because he had wanted to work with Ramsay and she was no longer directing the project."Warrior" filmmaker Gavin O'Connor has since replaced Ramsay as director, but Law's role hasn't yet been re-cast.The Hollywood Reporter said there are conflicting accounts of why the production is having so many problems.One scenario is that producers hadn't presented Ramsay with an approved schedule, script or budget just days before shooting was to begin this week. Another theory is Ramsay was revising the screenplay herself and failed to deliver a shooting script on schedule, the entertainment industry trade newspaper said.

CALGARY, Alberta, Aug. 23 (UPI) -- A Canadian national park in Alberta said is has reopened a hunting trail closed temporary when a grizzly bear was found eating a black bear carcass.Steve Michel, a human-wildlife conflict specialist with Banff National Park, said the Sundance Canyon trail was closed immediately when hikers discovered the "bear-eat-bear" scene Aug. 10 and officials investigated the incident, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Friday."Grizzly bears are opportunistic hunters," he said. "They will take advantage of any food source that presents itself."Michel said he was aware of at least four prior incidents involving grizzly bears hunting, killing and eating the smaller black bears."It may not be as rare as we think it is," he said. "But it is rare that we actually are able to document it. We tend not to know about it all.""We know it's a dog-eat-dog world out there, but we're finding out it's a bear-eat-bear world as well," Michel quipped.Michel said bears are coming closer to areas where humans commonly visit because of the presence of buffalo berry patches, which the bears use to put on weight for the coming fall.

ZAGREB, Croatia, May 15 (UPI) -- China and Croatia vowed over the weekend to strengthen economic and political ties as the two countries marked 20 years of diplomatic relations.Croatian President Ivo Josipovic and Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao exchanged messages of congratulations Sunday on two decades of friendly international ties, which have included an ambition by Zagreb to serve as China's gateway to Eastern Europe.The renewed commitment to stronger relations comes as Chinese shipping group COSCO is considering a $5 billion investment in the Croatian port of Rijeka with the aim of turning it into China's transport link to Europe -- its biggest trading partner.In the weekend messages, Josipovic said Croatia was "a reliable friend for China in southeastern Europe" and predicted Beijing "would have one more partner and ally in the European Union" after Croatia's entry into the regional bloc in 2013, the state-owned Chinese news service Xinhua reported.The Croatian leader said he hoped "Croatia and China would continue to advance their cooperation and further cement their friendship," which was officially launched May 13, 1992.Hu said two decades of diplomacy between the countries had seen the development of "high-level exchanges, deepened political trust (and) expanded cooperation in economy and trade," while reaping "bumper harvests in cooperation in areas such as culture, education and tourism."A big part of the two countries' relationship has been China's steadfast support for Croatia's accession to the European Union, which Beijing says will play a prominent role in promoting China-EU relations. "I believe by joining the European Union, Croatia will create new opportunities for growth not only for Croatia but also other countries in the region while opening new space to cultivate the relations between China and the southeastern European nations," Hu said during a 2009 trip to Zagreb.Already a popular destination for Chinese tourists, Croatia could also soon have thousands of Chinese workers in the country should COSCO follow through on its interest in the Adriatic port of Rijeka.A Chinese labor force of up to 20,000 workers would be stationed there under plans discussed last month by top COSCO executives and Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, multiple local reports indicated.Milanovic said the details of a Chinese investment in Rijeka would be addressed in due time and assured residents any stationing of foreign workers would be done in accordance with the country's immigration laws, the Croatia daily Free Dalmatia reported."We are talking with the potential partners" about the $5 billion proposal, which would also include the rebuilding of a major railroad line between Rijeka, the capital Zagreb and the Hungarian border, the prime minister told reporters April 26 in Warsaw, when Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao met with leaders of 16 Central and Eastern European countries.But, he added, "nobody will get these jobs without a public tender that sets clear, transparent and predictable conditions.""We are a state of law and will soon enter the EU," Milanovic said. "When we talk about any jobs, then the rule is public tender and bids for the concession, like every other business."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Republicans are pushing the U.S. education system "backwards," President Barack Obama charge Saturday as the White House released a report on the issue.The report notes 300,000 jobs in education have been lost since the recession officially ended in June 2009, boosting student-teacher ratios 4.6 percent and rolling back gains that had been made since 2000. Thousands more education jobs are on the line with discretionary spending cuts proposed by Congress, the report said."That's backwards. That's wrong. That plan doesn't invest in our future; it undercuts our future," Obama said. "If we want America to lead in the 21st century, nothing is more important than giving everyone the best education possible -- from the day they start preschool to the day they start their career."The report, "Investing in our Future: Returning Teachers to the Classroom," blames budget cuts at the state and local level for the loss of teachers"Analyses from independent academic experts confirm what we know from common-sense: that laying off teachers, increasing class sizes, eliminating critical programs, shortening the school week or shortening the school year all mean that our students receive less attention and fewer chances to achieve in their education," the White House said in a release."President Obama has proposed a plan that would prevent teacher layoffs, invest in comprehensive reform and strengthen public education. The President's plan would provide $25 billion to prevent layoffs and support hundreds of thousands of teacher and other education jobs. "Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress continue to block critical investments in the education of our children and the economic security of our nation as a whole."

WEBSTER, N.Y., Dec. 24 (UPI) -- A gunman who served time for killing his grandmother set a trap for firefighters in Upstate New York Monday and opened fire, killing two, police said.William H. Spengler Jr. 62, the alleged shooter, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head outside the burning home in Webster, The (Rochester) Democrat and Chronicle reported.The dead firefighters were identified as Lt. Mike Chiapperini, 43, and Tomasz Kaczowka. Chiapperini was a volunteer firefighter and the public information officer for the Webster Police Department. The two were among the first to arrive at the fire, which broke out at 5:45 a.m., The Democrat and Chronicle reported.Two other firefighters, Joseph Hofsetter and Theodore Scardino, were injured. They were reported in guarded condition at Strong Memorial Hospital. Greece police officer Jon Ritter, who was driving near the scene, suffered a shrapnel injury to his arm and left chest."These people get up in the middle of the night to fight fires. They don't expect to be shot and killed," Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering told a news conference.Police said Spengler spent 17 years in prison for the beating death of Rose Spengler, 92, in 1980.Because firefighters were unable to fight the fire after the shooting started, seven other homes also were engulfed in flames and were destroyed.Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman each sent condolences in separate statements."As this investigation unfolds we stand with our partners in law enforcement to ensure that lethal weapons are out of the hands of dangerous people," Schneiderman said.

| License Photo	CAIRO, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- The Muslim Brotherhood claimed its political party won the majority of runoffs in the first round of Egypt's parliamentary election.Meanwhile, representatives of several political parties and organizations said Wednesday they will move their demonstrations from Tahrir Square to outside a government building to protest the appointment of Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, saying he doesn't represent them, al-Masry al-Youm reported.Al-Masry al-Youm reported Ganzouri's cabinet, sworn in Wednesday, includes 12 ministers from former Prime Minister Essam Sharaf's cabinet, including ministers of foreign affairs, international cooperation, industry, military production and petroleum.Ganzouri, 78, who was brought out of retirement to lead a interim government two weeks ago, named as the new interior minister Maj. Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim. Ibrahim is seen as the architect of the forced evacuation of Sudanese refugees protesting in Mostafa Mahmoud Square in Mohandiseen in December 2005, which resulted in the deaths of 25 people, including several children. The refugees had been protesting outside the offices of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to demand the right to asylum in European countries.Maj. Gen. Ahmed Anis, who had headed the Morale Affairs Department of the armed forces, became the new minister of information, which critics called an effort by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to maintain control of the media.Government officials called the new cabinet a "national salvation government," a term that had originally been used to refer to the transitional civilian government proposed by pro-democracy activists and political figures who sought to end military rule during clashes in and around Tahir Square late last month. The civilian government, as conceived, likely would have taken on executive powers of government now held by the military council, al-Masry al-Youm said.But the military rejected the civilian government, instead accepting the resignation of Prime Minister Essam Sharaf and replacing him with Ganzouri. Pro-democracy activists continue to demand an end to military rule.Official election results aren't expected until Thursday, but the Freedom and Justice Party said it had won 36 of the 56 seats available in the first round of voting since Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February, the BBC reported.Early polling indicated the group won nearly 37 percent in runoffs Monday and Tuesday. Four seats were won outright in last week's voting, leaving 52 to be decided. Voting in the remaining two-thirds of electoral districts will occur later this month and in January.Muslim Brotherhood official Mohammed Badie said the Freedom and Justice Party would form a coalition if it won the elections."We will not rule Egypt alone. Parliament will include all the colors of the rainbow that must agree on one direction, one goal," he said during an interview with al-Mehwar, a private television station.The ultra-conservative Salafist al-Nour Party was second with 24 percent of the vote, followed by the secular Egyptian Bloc with 13.4 percent, the liberal Wafd Party with 7.1 percent, the moderate Islamist Wasat Party with 4.3 percent and the Revolution Continues, a group formed by youth activists who helped drive out Mubarak, with 3.5 percent, preliminary results indicated.During a news conference Tuesday, Ganzouri, prime minister from 1996 to 1999 under Mubarak, called on political parties and forces to unite.The 20-member Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak's ouster, promised to decree head-of-state powers to Ganzouri "except those concerning the judiciary and armed forces," Ganzouri told a news conference Tuesday night.

Dec. 17 (UPI) -- One little girl, a Sandy Hook first grader, became the sole survivor of her class when she played dead, lying among her classmates as Adam Lanza shot and killed the rest.Before the full extent of the horror of the Sandy Hook massacre was known, reports of a little girl, fleeing the school with a bloody face but otherwise uninjured, were the first indication something awful had happened inside.According to pastor Jim Solomon, who spoke with the girl and her family for grief counselling, she is the sole survivor of her class because she pretended to be dead while laying among her slain classmates.Solomon said she lay still on the floor until she felt it was safe to run away.#Newtown update: A witness told News 8 she saw 1 child had a bloody face, another with a hand injury. Still nothing confirmed by police.— WTNH News 8 (@WTNH) December 14, 2012
"She ran out of the school building covered from head to toe with blood and the first thing she said to her mom was, 'Mommy, I'm OK but all my friends are dead'," Solomon told ABC News.Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.Adam Lanza, 20, allegedly shot and killed 26 people--20 of them first grade children--in Sandy Hook Elementary School after first murdering his mother, Nancy Lanza.

Wiki
Christian Ehrhoff (born July 6, 1982) is a German professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is known primarily as an offensive defenceman with strong skating and shooting abilities.
Before playing in the NHL, Ehrhoff spent several years playing professionally in Germany, starting with EV Duisburg of the third-tier Oberliga and the Krefeld Penguins of the premiere Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He spent three years with Krefeld, winning the German championship in 2003. Selected 106th overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, Ehrhoff moved to North America for the 2003–04 season. He spent one-and-a-half seasons with the Cleveland Barons, the Sharks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, before joining San Jose on a full-time basis for 2005–06. After being traded to the Canucks in August 2009, he won two consecutive Babe Pratt Trophies as the team's top defenceman. Internationally, Ehrhoff has played for the German national team in numerous tournaments, including three Winter Olympics, four World Championships and a World Cup.
Ehrhoff was born and raised in Moers, a city on the left bank of the Rhine. His father, Achim, is a drummer in a band. Ehrhoff first played hockey at the age of six, deciding to play the sport after watching an NHL game on television. As his hometown did not have a hockey program, he played minor hockey 20 kilometres away in the Krefeld Penguins' system. He won a national championship with the club around the age of 12; Ehrhoff has recalled scoring in the final on a penalty shot. Following the NHL growing up, Ehrhoff has singled out Wayne Gretzky, Pavel Bure and Uwe Krupp as his childhood heroes. He was inspired to play in the style of an offensive defenceman after watching a video of Bobby Orr as a 10-year-old.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
