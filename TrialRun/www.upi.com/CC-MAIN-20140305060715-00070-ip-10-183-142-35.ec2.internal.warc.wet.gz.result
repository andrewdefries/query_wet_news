ATLANTA, Aug. 15 (UPI) -- CNN terrorism expert Peter Bergen told U.S. online users Osama bin Laden is likely in Pakistan, not chronically ill, living frugally and avoiding ATMs.Building up to CNN's documentary, "In the Footsteps of bin Laden," airing Aug. 23, Bergen answered questions about the mysterious al-Qaida leader.Like Eric Rudolf, the Atlanta Centennial Olympic Park bomber, bin Laden could be close by the U.S. military, yet able to hide if he has a support network and makes no "stupid mistakes," Bergen told questioners.Tracing financial transactions won't work if bin Laden isn't spending money. "He's lived a kind of monk-like life for a long time," Bergen said. "And he certainly isn't making cash withdrawals that can be traced."The way the terror leader operates doesn't require much money and he may be able to live on donations, Bergen said.The United States had its opportunity to catch bin Laden at the battle of Tora Bora, but didn't have enough troops, he said, adding Pakistan won't allow the U.S. military to go in to capture him now.Bergen said the best way of finding him is to trace the origin of the audio and videotapes he releases, mostly to Al-Jazeera.

ALEXANDRIA, Va., May 6 (UPI) -- Sixty-one percent of U.S. adults -- 79 percent of women -- would rather get a good night's sleep than have sex, a U.S. survey indicates. The survey by the Better Sleep Council found that nearly half of Americans fall asleep somewhere other than their bed at least once a week, and about 11 percent fall asleep somewhere other than their bed every day -- some in dangerous places. "We were stunned by some of the survey responses," Karin Mahoney, director of communications for the Better Sleep Council, said in a statement. "One man fell asleep on a rooftop. Another man fell asleep while interviewing a job candidate. There was a teacher who fell asleep at the podium in front of her class. Clearly, people are sleeping just about everywhere except where they should be -- in their own beds."However, 77 percent of people surveyed said they'd give up something to get a better night's sleep. Thirty-one percent said they would give up watching TV, 23 percent would give up time spent on computers and social media, while16 percent would give up either exercise or going to church."People who don't get enough sleep can suffer from poor performance at work or school to depression, diabetes, heart disease and other ailments," Mahoney said. No survey details were provided.

He succeeded coach Scotty Bowman who retired.WLNS-TV, Lansing, Friday said it had confirmed Lewis would be officially relieved of his duties amid published reports the Wings were considering offering the head coaching position to Mike Babcock.Babcock recently turned down a one-year contract with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, who reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 2003, according to The Sports Network.

LONDON, April 11 (UPI) -- "Aggressive rhetoric" from North Korea following its February nuclear test only serves to isolate the country, a statement from G8 ministers in London said.London hosted a meeting for foreign ministers from the Group of 8. The group issued a statement condemning "in the strongest possible terms" North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.The G8 consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia.North Korea is said to have missiles ready for launch. A government statement published by South Korean news agency Yonhap warned of imminent war."War can break out any moment and what remains to be done is merciless punishment of the enemies," the English-language statement read.North Korea's war rhetoric has escalated since the February underground nuclear test, said to be part of an anti-U.S. agenda. The U.S. military has responded defensively, though officials said the latest crisis is part of a North Korean pattern."We have seen this kind of bellicose rhetoric, these kinds of provocative statements consistently," White House spokesman Jay Carney said earlier this week.G8 foreign ministers said, in a joint statement, they were concerned not only by North Korea's human rights record, but its recent defiance of the international community."Ministers confirmed their commitment to the goal of lasting peace and the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner," the joint statement said. "They condemned North Korea's current aggressive rhetoric and confirmed that this will only serve to further isolate North Korea."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, April 10 (UPI) -- A century after the British luxury liner Titanic sank in the Atlantic, two new studies reveal rare states of nature may have played major roles in the tragedy.In the early hours of April 15, 1912, the Titanic, on its maiden voyage out of England, collided with an iceberg and sank, taking 1,500 lives with it.Blame for the disaster has been put on everything from an inept crew to shoddy rivets holding the ship's metal plates together.However, two recent studies say natural forces may have created conditions perfect for the looming iceberg to go unnoticed, The New York Times reported Monday.The first study, by researchers at Texas State University-San Marcos and Sky & Telescope magazine, found the Earth to have been unusually close to both the sun and moon in the time period leading up to the nautical disaster, creating large amount of ice in the Titanic's path, including the deadly iceberg.Researchers suggested high tides created by the gravitational pulls of the sun and moon between December 1911 and February 1912 sent masses of icebergs normally gathered along the coastlines of Labrador and Newfoundland into the North Atlantic shipping lanes."We don't claim that our idea is conclusive," Dr. Donald Olson, a physicist at Texas State, but he added the team continued to find new supporting evidence after the publication of the study in Sky & Telescope's April issue."We found there had been remarkable tidal events around the globe -- in England and New Zealand," he said.The second study, by research Tim Maltin of London, suggests the icy waters the Titanic sailed through were ideal conditions for cold mirages, which occur when cold air bends light rays downward, which distorts horizon lines.Maltin cited three lookouts aboard the Titanic who reported the distant view as being "hazy," which he said he believed to be an effect of a cold mirage."There were no heroes, no villains," Maltin said. "Instead, there were a lot of human beings trying to do their best in the situation as they saw it."Maltin's book, "Titanic: A Very Deceiving Night," is to be released this week as an e-book.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 30 (UPI) -- Sandy, now a post-tropical cyclone, was blamed for at least 39 U.S. deaths and its capacity for damage was nowhere near over, officials said Tuesday.Authorities blamed the storm for at least 15 deaths in New York, three in New Jersey, three in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, two in Connecticut, two in Virginia, one in West Virginia and one on the HMS Bounty replica tall ship. At least one death in Canada was attributed to the storm. Earlier, 67 people died in the Caribbean, bringing the storm's overall death toll to 107.Sandy, which left at least 7 million people without power and an undetermined number evacuated from their homes, was weakening over Pennsylvania Tuesday, with top sustained winds of 45 mph, the National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center said in its 5 p.m. EDT advisory.The center of the storm was about 50 miles east-northeast of Pittsburgh. Sandy was moving west-northwest at 10 mph and was expected to turn northwest across western Pennsylvania Tuesday night and then move northward into Canada Wednesday.The HMS Bounty, a 180-foot sailboat, is shown submerged in the Atlantic Ocean during Hurricane Sandy approximately 90 miles southeast of Hatteras, N.C., Monday, October 29, 2012. UPI/Tim Kuklewski/Coast GuardLicense photo | PermalinkNational Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said in a midday conference call with reporters Sandy's impact along the U.S. East Coast had lessened, but flooding of 2-4 feet was expected in some spots at high tide and wind speeds were "fairly strong" as far west as Lake Michigan.Knabb said further power disruption could occur Tuesday and "it will take well into [Wednesday] for all of the weather to clear out of the United States."He said river flooding will be a risk over a large area, particularly in the New Jersey-New York area, because "there is still a lot more rain that could fall.""I don't want anyone to think the event is anywhere near over," he said.U.S. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Robert Parker said seas in excess of 20 feet have been recorded on Lake Michigan, and some shipping has been affected because so much water is being displaced, making shipping channels shallower than normal.Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate said response efforts are focusing on life-saving, as well as power restoration, which he said is a public safety issue. He said federal, state and local efforts are also prioritizing getting healthcare systems back online.Fugate cautioned the public to be careful during the cleanup and rebuilding following the storm."The recovery oftentimes results in more deaths and injuries that occur during recovery activities," he said.President Barack Obama went to American Red Cross headquarters in Washington and cautioned, "This storm isn't over yet."The president called the storm "heartbreaking for the entire nation" and told those affected by the storm, "America is with you."He said he has told government officials to do whatever must be done to get help to people as quickly as possible -- with "no bureaucracy. No red tape."During a call Obama held with governors and mayors from affected areas, several governors offered assistance to hard-hit states, the White House said."The president also made clear that his team is working to identify any additional assistance that could further help the state, local, and private sector efforts to bring power back online faster, and that his team would continue aggressively towards this goal," the White House said.U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Tuesday he will make $13 million in emergency relief funds immediately available to New York and Rhode Island.The $13 million represents 100 percent of funding the states requested -- $10 million in New York and $3 million in Rhode Island -- the Transportation Department said.LaHood said the requests were just the first to arrive at the department, and he expects other states to apply for emergency relief funding in the coming days."President Obama has directed us to immediately help restore vital transportation infrastructure following this unprecedented and devastating storm -- and that's exactly what we're doing," LaHood said.The president Tuesday declared a major disaster exists in Connecticut and ordered Federal aid to supplement state, tribal and local recovery efforts in the area, the White House said.Obama will travel to New Jersey Wednesday, where he and Gov. Chris Christie are to inspect damage, talk with people affected by the storm and meet with first responders.Sandy left in its path darkened skylines, fires, trees tossed about and streets that became canals. Floodwaters gushed into New York's subway tunnels and scattered parts of the famed Atlantic City, N.J., boardwalk.Authorities scrambled boats and high-water vehicles to rescue residents trapped in several towns after a berm broke in Moonachie, N.J.Christie called the devastation to the shorelines of the Garden State, where Sandy made landfall Monday evening, "unthinkable" and asked residents to exercise patience and not return to their homes yet to inspect the damage."I know people want to inspect their homes on the barrier islands, but at this point it is unsafe," Christie posted on his Twitter page. "Please be patient."New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo echoed those sentiments: "If you have been evacuated from #Sandy, return home only when officials say it is safe."New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority reported on its Twitter page a boat was resting on the tracks at one station.The MTA said it will resume limited bus service Tuesday at 5 p.m., with fares for passengers being waived until further notice.MTA Chairman Joseph J. Lhota said in an interview with WNYC, New York, public radio, the city's mass transit system likely would be restored "in pieces and parts" in the next few days."We're going to try to be creative," Lhota said.Governors have declared states of emergency. President Barack Obama signed major emergency and disaster declarations for many states overnight, paving the way for federal assistance. He met with disaster officials again Tuesday morning to assess the situation and monitor recovery efforts.In Connecticut, CNN reported some residents trapped in their houses by floodwaters received this text message from the state's Emergency Management Office:"If u find urself surrounded by H2O, call 4 help if u can & then get 2 highest level of home. Hang a white sheet out a street side window."The water tanker John B. Caddell ran aground in Staten Island, WABC-TV, New York, reported.An estimated 7.5 million customers were without power in 15 states and the District of Columbia, CNN said, based on numbers it compiled from local power providers.More than 15,000 flights have been canceled since Sunday because of Sandy, flight tracking site FlightAware.com said.Amtrak said on its Facebook page it would assess damage to its tracks and then decide when service would be restored.In West Virginia, where 2-3 feet of snow was forecast, the governor's office asked that only essential state employees report for work.Forecasters said numerous weather watches and warnings -- including high-wind warnings, storm warnings, blizzard warnings, winter storm watches and warnings, and flood and coastal flood watches, warnings and advisories -- were posted for much of the eastern United States.New York officials said the Manhattan, Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Ed Koch Queensboro bridges would reopen Tuesday, The New York Times reported. The Tappen Zee Bridge already had reopened.A spokesman for Consolidated Edison said Tuesday much of Manhattan could be without electricity for several days after an explosion at a substation on the East River Monday.NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital said it was accepting patients evacuated from other area hospitals, and had canceled all elective procedures and surgeries scheduled for Tuesday."Our emergency rooms and dialysis centers are fully operational," the hospital said in a statement. "Patients should confirm all scheduled appointments with their physician's office."A backup power system failed at NYU Langone Medical Center Monday night, forcing the evacuation of all patients, the Times said.Medical center officials said the hospital began transporting 215 patients to other facilities Monday evening and was still transporting some early Tuesday.CNN reported 3 feet of water flowed onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange building, a first. The stock exchange, which has been closed for two days due to the storm, said Tuesday it will reopen Wednesday.At least 80 homes burned to the ground in one neighborhood of Queens, fire officials said, though the cause of the blaze was not immediately released.New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority said seven subway tunnels were flooded, the Metro-North Railroad lost power along some lines, the Long Island Rail Road evacuated its West Side Yards and sustained flooding in one tunnel, the Hugh L. Carey (Brooklyn Battery) Tunnel was flooded, and the Queens Midtown Tunnel took on water and was closed. Six bus garages were disabled by high water.Some smaller cities north of New York were spared the brunt of the storm but still experienced severe flooding.Kingston, N.Y., was forced to shut down a sewage treatment plant for about 9 hours after a Hudson River tributary overflowed its banks early Tuesday and breached 7-foot-high berms around the plant, causing a transformer to blow out, city officials said. Officials evacuated residents from waterfront apartments and condominiums. The city is at the confluence of the Hudson River and Rondout Creek tributary.The storm could cause $10 billion to $20 billion in total economic damages and $5 billion to $10 billion in insured losses, catastrophe-risk modeling firm EQECAT said.

NEW ORLEANS, July 23 (UPI) -- First lady Michelle Obama told a Mexican-American activist group Tuesday that curbing childhood obesity begins at home but also requires access to healthcare.Obama told the National Council of La Raza convention in New Orleans that implementing healthcare reform in the United States was a big step forward in creating healthy families."Simply passing the Affordable Care Act was not the goal," Obama told the gathering. "The goal is to get folks to sign up for insurance so they have the care they need to stay healthy. As leaders in our communities, we are going to need your help to make this happen."Obama said while grocery companies, restaurants and individual families are becoming more pro-active in targeting obesity, children still require the ability to see a doctor regularly. "While making the right choices in the store and off the menu is critical, it is not enough," she said. "We all know that if we truly want to raise healthy children, we need access to quality, affordable healthcare -- including the regular checkups and screenings our kids need to stay healthy."La Raza continued its conference in New Orleans the day after the organization heard from a U.S. lawmaker who said Latino communities could expect to hear a lot about immigration reform this summer.Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said during a panel discussion that a spate of meetings in various congressional districts nationwide during next month's August recess, CBS News said.Although the House is controlled by Republicans, Gutierrez predicted immigration reform had enough bipartisan support to pass in the lower house. "I am very confident about our chances for immigration reform, even if the road ahead looks difficult sometimes," Gutierrez said. "We have unity among Democrats like I have never seen before and there are dozens and dozens of Republicans who will vote with us to resolve this issue in a bipartisan manner."

| License Photo	HARARE, Zimbabwe, Aug. 1 (UPI) -- Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai charged the presidential election was rigged by his rival, President Robert Mugabe, a charge Mugabe's party denies.Tsvangirai, during a news conference, called Wednesday's polling a "huge farce" and declared it "null and void" as an observer group said up to a million people were barred from casting ballots, the BBC reported Thursday.Mugabe's Zanu-PF party, which has begun claiming victory, denied the accusations and said voting went smoothly.The head of the African Union observer mission, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, said his initial assessment indicated the vote was free and fair. Other regional observers also praised the peaceful nature of the election, the first presidential balloting held in Zimbabwe since 2008 when violence erupted.The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has five days to declare a winner.Speaking at the Movement for Democratic Change headquarters in Harare, Tsvangirai said, "Our conclusion is that this has been a huge farce. The credibility of this election has been marred by administrative and legal violations which affected the legitimacy of its outcome.""It's a sham election that does not reflect the will of the people," he said.Monitors from the Zimbabwe Election Support Network earlier said the poll was "seriously compromised." In a statement, the network said potential voters were turned away from 82 percent of polling stations in urban areas, where support for Tsvangirai is strong. The percentage of voters denied ballot access in areas considered Mugabe strongholds was lower.Zanu-PF spokesman Psychology Maziwisa denied many voters were deliberately barred from registering. He admitted to some irregularities, stressing the two main parties were both affected."You've got to bear in mind that that was partly due to the fact that resources were not being made available by the finance minister who is Tendai Biti, who comes from the Movement for Democratic Change party," Maziwisa told the BBC."If you look at the Zimbabwean situation you can only come to one conclusion," Maziwisa said. "And that is that over the last four years we've made a lot of effort to make this environment in Zimbabwe as conducive as it possibly can [be] for an election that is free and fair."Mugabe, 89, pledged to step down after more than three decades in power if he loses to Tsvangirai.Mugabe and Tsvangirai have shared governance since 2009 through an agreement brokered to end the deadly violence that broke out following a disputed presidential election in 2008.A presidential candidate must garner more than 50 percent of the vote to be declared the winner. If no candidate reaches that threshold, a runoff will be held Sept. 11.

Wiki
Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE (born 7 January 1985) is a British Formula One racing driver from England, currently racing for the McLaren team, and was the 2008 Formula One World Champion.
Hamilton was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. In December 1995, at the age of ten, he approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards ceremony and told him, "I want to race for you one day ... I want to race for McLaren." Less than three years later McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to their Young Driver Support Programme. After winning the British Formula Renault, Formula Three Euroseries, and GP2 championships on his way up the racing career ladder, he drove for McLaren in 2007, making his Formula One debut 12 years after his initial encounter with Dennis. Coming from a mixed-race background, with a black father and white mother, Hamilton is often labelled "the first black driver in Formula One".
In his first season in Formula One, Hamilton set numerous records, while finishing second in the 2007 Formula One Championship, just one point behind Kimi Räikkönen. He won the World Championship the following season, ahead of Felipe Massa by the same margin of a single point. Clinching the crown thanks to passing the dry tyre-shod Timo Glock in the wet on the final lap, to take the necessary fifth position. Following that, prestigious motorsport weekly Autosport dubbed him as Last Lap Lewis. He has stated he wants to stay with the McLaren team for the rest of his F1 career.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
