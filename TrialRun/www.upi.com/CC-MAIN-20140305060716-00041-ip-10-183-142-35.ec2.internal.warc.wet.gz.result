YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia, Sept. 25 (UPI) -- Russian energy company Gazprom is in a strategic position to capitalize on the growing natural gas demand from Asian economies, its deputy chairman said.Gazprom Deputy Chairman Alexander Medvedev led a delegation to take part in an oil and natural gas conference under way in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East.Gazprom operates Russia's only liquefied natural gas plant at Sakhalin Island, in the Sea of Okhotsk. Medvedev said Gazprom was in a unique position to capitalize on demands from Asian markets given its strategic energy position in the region."At a time when a growing demand is expected in Asia, Gazprom is ready to make a substantial contribution to providing the reliable eco-friendly energy supplies to consumers in the region for fulfilling their needs, therefore strengthening the company's presence in the Asia-Pacific energy market," he said in remarks published Tuesday.Medvedev said Russia is one of the largest natural gas producers in the world and 90 percent of its unconventional gas reserves are situated in the Far East.He said Asian economies, particularly China and India, may demand an extra 2.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year by 2035.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Nov. 12 (UPI) -- Hugh Jackman is getting good reviews from the critics this week as he begins his one-man show on Broadway.The "X-Men" star focuses on his own life in "Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway," but the Los Angeles Times said the seeming minutia seems to work with the audience."But for the show's 120 minutes, Jackman makes just about everyone sitting in the Broadhurst Theatre feel as if the show is all about them," the Los Angeles Times observed Saturday.Jackman digs into the musical-theater songbook for works by composers ranging from Rogers-and-Hammerstein to Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. The tunes follow a book that has Jackman reminiscing about his career back to his high school theater days.The Times said the show is a long way from Jackman's leading-man and action-hero roles in Hollywood but seems to fit him well."With nothing more the some finely tailored pants and an onstage band, Jackman delivers as many genuine thrills as hundreds of millions of dollars worth of (computer generated) effects," the review said. "He's a throwback to stars such as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, who delivered special effects that the Hollywood of the 21st century has forgotten how to generate."

WAHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 3 (UPI) -- Wood is the greenest building material, yielding fewer greenhouse gases than other common building materials such as concrete and steel, a U.S. report says.A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis of dozens of scientific studies found 2.1 tons of greenhouse gases were saved for each ton of carbon in wood products vs. non-wood materials, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday."This study confirms what many environmental scientists have been saying for years," U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. "Wood should be a major component of American building and energy design."During a 100-year span, net greenhouse gas emissions of wood-based homes were 20 percent to 50 percent less than for homes built with concrete or steel, the report said."The argument that somehow non-wood construction materials are ultimately better for carbon emissions than wood products is not supported by our research," David Cleaves, the U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Adviser, said. "Trees removed in an environmentally responsible way allow forests to continue to sequester carbon through new forest growth. Wood products continue to benefit the environment by storing carbon long after the building has been constructed."

BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 11 (UPI) -- Any action by Western adversaries of Iran to block its nuclear progress is likely to come to a dead end, the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon said.Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Qazanfar Roknabadi announced that Beirut is hosting a one-week exhibition on Iranian technological and scientific advancements.The event coincides with what Iran dubbed National Day of Nuclear Technology, announced early this week. Roknabadi said Iran's nuclear achievements were the cornerstone of its scientific progress. Any effort to undermine that progress is "doomed to failure," he said, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reports.Iran announced this week it was moving to develop its domestic nuclear programs further by processing yellow cake uranium at a facility near the central Iranian city of Ardakan. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said this week that Iran is a nuclear power.Two days worth of negotiations in Kazakhstan concluded last weekend with few breakthroughs. Catherine Ashton, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, said both sides were "far apart" on the substance of the nuclear debate.Iran is suspected of pursuing the technology needed to manufacture a nuclear weapon. The Iranian government denies the allegation, saying it has a right to a peaceful nuclear program as a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced a bill Thursday to ban more than 150 types of semi-automatic weapons with military-style features.In addition to banning the manufacture, sale, transfer or importation of semi-automatic rifles and pistols that can accept detachable magazines and have at least one military feature, the legislation -- titled "The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013" -- would ban magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition and place new security requirements on people who already own such weapons, The Hill reported.It would also apply to semi-automatic rifles and handguns with fixed magazines capable of carrying more than 10 rounds, and all semi-automatic shotguns with folding or detachable stocks, pistol grips, forward grips or fixed magazines with room for more than five rounds, The Hill said.Assault weapons ban: See a list of all the proposed banned weaponsIt exempts assault weapons that are "lawfully possessed" as of the date the bill is enacted, but sales of exempted weapons would be subject to background checks."No weapon is taken from anyone," Feinstein said. "The purpose is to dry up the supply of these weapons over time."Feinstein said getting the bill through Congress will be "an uphill battle," but she said it would be "a battle worth having.""We must balance the desire of a few to own military-style assault weapons with the growing threat to lives across America," she said.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week signed into law a state ban similar to Feinstein's proposed measure.National Rifle Association President David Keene said Wednesday New York's ban on assault weapons was likely unconstitutional and his organization planned to file a "notice of claim" against the state -- the first step toward a possible lawsuit."A so-called assault-weapons ban in today's world is probably unconstitutional," Keene told radio station WGDJ, Rensselaer, N.Y., citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 2008 ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which he said prevents the government from banning "commonly used firearms."Associate Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion for the majority provided Second Amendment protection for commonly used and popular handguns, but not for atypical arms or arms used for unlawful purposes, such as sawed-off shotguns.White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Thursday it will be difficult to win congressional passage for some of President Barack Obama's proposals on gun control but that "doesn't mean that we should not work aggressively to achieve them. There's broad public support for taking action."Obama has said a top priority is to get "an assault weapons ban that is meaningful" passed this year. Carney noted none of Obama's proposals "would take a gun away from a single, law-abiding American citizen."The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., provided the backdrop for the Feinstein bill as Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, as well as Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty, whose district includes Newtown, joined Feinstein in introducing the measure.Twenty students and six staff members at the elementary school were killed in the Dec. 14 attack. Among the weapons Adam Lanza had was an assault rifle.Co-sponsors also include the second- and third-ranking members of the Senate Democratic leadership, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Chuck Schumer of New York.The U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Police Foundation and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators have endorsed the bill introduced Thursday, The Hill said.Blumenthal told Hearst Newspapers the new bill would "be a more stringent measure than the assault weapon ban that existed from 1994 to 2004."He said the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would work hand-in-hand with heightened school security and mental-health reform."This measure is a significant first step as part of a comprehensive program," he said.The bill introduced Thursday has no sunset clause, unlike the bill Feinstein wrote -- and Congress passed -- in 1994. It expired in 2004.Critics of the 1994 ban have said it was ineffective because gun companies simply re-engineered weapons to get around its requirements.

| License Photo	LONDON, April 12 (UPI) -- As the world's major powers prepare to discuss Iran's nuclear program, experts are arguing the legality of a potential Israeli and U.S. military strike on Iran.Anthony D'Amato, a professor of international law at Northwestern University, has said the use of force by Israel and the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons would uphold international law, Britain's The Guardian reported Thursday. The United Nations charter recognizes the right to self-defense in the event of an imminent attack, though some experts wonder at the precise meaning of word "imminent," the newspaper said."Iran says it wants to push the Israelis into the sea and that they are constructing nuclear weapons. That's enough for me to say that cannot be allowed. If the U.S. or Israel takes the initiative to block that action, it can hardly be said to be violating international law. It can only be preserving international law for future generations," he said.Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional law professor at Yale, said he's skeptical about the claim of imminent threat."The idea that the United States is under imminent threat from Iran is preposterous. It is not preposterous that Israel's under threat from Iran. It just isn't imminent," he told The Guardian."Similarly, this is not a case having to do with the war on terror. It's a case in which one sovereign feels threatened by another sovereign. It's just the kind of thing that has been happening for a very long time and it was precisely this kind of anticipatory anxiety generating wars that the League of Nations and then the United Nations was intended to respond to," he added.Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported representatives of the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia gathered in Istanbul, Turkey, for nuclear talks are not all on the same page when it comes to determining the best way to keep Iran in check."We really do not have a common view of what's the real offer to be made to Iran to bring it to serious negotiations," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said while in Washington this week.Ryabkov said the six nations do agree it would be "disastrous" for Israel to conduct a military strike against Iran."We are all for a diplomatic solution," he said.An unidentified senior U.S. official was among diplomats who downplayed the differences of opinion among the various players."All are in agreement on the core principles," the U.S. official said.

Jan. 15 (UPI) -- Lady Gaga -- no stranger to questionable wardrobe choices -- wore assault rifles on her bra during a concert in Vancouver Friday, according to the New York Post, just one day after Vice President Joe Biden's met with various groups on the gun control issue. Gaga wore similar lingerie on the cover of Rolling Stone in 2010, but that was before the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre reignited the debate over gun violence. Gun rights advocates have also accused Hollywood and the media for it's frequent and reckless portrayal of gun use. PolicyMic's Tom McKay called the outfit "tasteless and inappropriate." "It rubs salt in the wounds of pro- and anti-gun advocates, and much trashier, the wounds of a despondent and horrified community that just lost 20 of its children," McKay said. “I think it is gun porn,” Ladd Everitt, of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said.“It’s almost like she’s telling her fans, ‘The only way I can stimulate you is to show you guns and violence.’
