SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- A San Francisco parenting Web site said its annual survey of registered infants found Aiden was the top name for boys and Sophia topped the list for girls.BabyCenter.com said its survey of the 350,000 babies registered on the site as born in 2010 found Aiden topped the boys' list for the sixth year, followed by Jacob, Jackson, Ethan, Jayden, Noah, Logan, Caden, Lucas and Liam.The Web site said Sophia knocked last year's top girl's name, Isabella, into second place, followed by Olivia, Emma, Chloe, Ava, Lily, Madison, Addison and Abigail.The BabyCenter editors said they also saw a strong influence on this year's list from pop culture, with names from TV series "Glee," including Finn and Quinn, rising rapidly, as well as influences from "Mad Men" and Disney films."Thirty-six percent of BabyCenter moms say they find name inspiration in famous people and characters. This is the first time we've seen parents really own up to the influence of pop culture," said Linda Murray, BabyCenter editor in chief. "Celebrities are our royalty, and consciously or unconsciously, parents want a bit of that shine to rub off on their kids."

June 11 (UPI) -- Scientists at The University of Nottingham have discovered a previously undetected layer in the human cornea, the clear lens at the front of the eye.The find, described in a study published in the journal Ophthalmology, could help surgeons improve outcomes for patients undergoing corneal grafts and transplants.Scientists previously believed the cornea to be comprised of five layers, from front to back, the corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, the corneal stroma, Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium.The new layer has been called the Dua's Layer after Professor Harminder Dua who discovered it.Dua said in a release that the discovery "will mean that ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be re-written."The new layer is just 15 microns thick, while the entire cornea is around 550 microns thick, or 0.5mm. Despite being such a thin layer, it is incredibly tough -- strong enough to be able to withstand up to two bars of pressure.The scientists proved the existence of the layer by simulating human corneal transplants and grafts on eyes donated for research. During surgery, tiny bubbles of air were injected to gently separate the layers.The scientists then subjected the separated layers to electron microscopy and discovered the existence of Dua's layer.The new study may help surgeons better identify where in the cornea these bubbles are occurring during the operation. If they are able to precisely inject a bubble next to the Dua's layer, its strength means it will be less prone to tearing.The discovery will have an impact on advancing understanding of a number of diseases of the cornea, including acute hydrops, Descematocele and pre-Descemet's dystrophies."From a clinical perspective, there are many diseases that affect the back of the cornea which clinicians across the world are already beginning to relate to the presence, absence or tear in this layer."Scientists now believe that corneal hydrops, a bulging of the cornea caused by fluid buildup that occurs in patients with keratoconus, a conical deformity of the cornea, is caused by a tear in the Dua layer letting water in from the eye.

DURBAN, South Africa, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Ticket sales for the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament have been disappointingly slow, organizers said.The matches take place in Durban and Nelspruit, South Africa, next week and will apparently have plenty of empty seats.Durban's semifinal match with Mali Wednesday still had 19,000 tickets available Saturday and Nelspruit had 24,000 unsold seats, officials told the BBC.The Feb. 10 finals in Johannesburg were nearly sold out but the Confederation of African Football rallied fans to make it to the semis."We've got great stars here, the football has been great and we owe it to the continent to make sure the stadiums are full," said CAF Secretary-General Hicham El Amrani.The CAF was hopeful there would be a late surge in sales once the participants in the Nelspruit match were finalized after the weekend quarterfinals.

SEATTLE, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- An estimated 500,000 people turned out along a parade route in Seattle Wednesday, braving freezing temperatures to honor the Super Bowl champion Seahawks. The hours-long parade began at the Seattle Center, proceeded down Fourth Avenue past Westlake Park, and ended with a rally at a jam-packed CenturyLink Field.Former Seahawks receiving great and NFL Hall of Famer Steve Largent emceed the event, telling fans, "This city has won a championship before ... but it has never seen anything like what just went on through the streets of Seattle."Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said he wasn't surprised by Sunday's Super Bowl XLVIII victory over the Denver Broncos, the first in franchise history. "At the beginning of the year, we knew we could get here. Everybody put all the work in, right from training camp," he said. "When I came here, I talked about winning multiple Super Bowls. And you can't win them all until you win the first. Our mindset from right now is to go about winning the next one."Fans along the parade route carried signs emblazoned with the number "12," signifying the "12th man" of the Seattle crowd, considered the loudest in the league.

HERNDON, Va., April 30 (UPI) -- In the fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood," a young girl almost gets eaten by a wolf disguised as her grandmother. The moral of the story: Be careful whom you trust.Learned early by children, the moral isn't always retained by adults. Scams often victimize those too trusting.When honest endorsers naively lend their high-profile name to such a scam, investors foolishly assume their investment is safe. But those blindly accepting endorsements as gospel without independent investigation court disaster.Investigative responsibility especially arises when endorsers promote investments outside their expertise parameters, such as churches sanctioning political party agendas effecting U.S. national security.Such an endorsement was given by the Presbyterian Church (USA). It is a political scam artist's dream.The church's intentions are good -- seeking to embrace another religion in an act of equality. But it fails to recognize the threat this other religion poses to Presbyterianism's future existence -- a religion hiding a deadly political agenda it silently promotes.The religion is Islam. It lacks tolerance for non-Muslims under a religious/political system of laws known as "Shariah" -- so adverse to the U.S. Constitution, supporting one system excludes the other.Islamists predicted in a strategy document they wrote, Americans will awaken too late to realize the Constitution has been targeted.Before embracing Islam as a religion amongst equals, the Presbyterian Church needs to understand how Islam's Koran views all other religions.Concealed within Islam is a political belief system of superiority (Koran 3:110, "You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind"), entitling its believers alone to human rights -- limited as they are. Presbyterian Church leaders opening their arms in a show of tolerance fail to understand Islam's sinister designs to displace Presbyterianism, and all other religions, based on this belief.Hard to believe? These designs are recorded in a 1991 strategic document Islamist leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood wrote explaining how to topple U.S. democracy by paralleling Prophet Muhammad's successful actions in imposing Islam upon others 14 centuries ago.Discreetly circulated, the strategy paper seeks to use America's penchant for tolerance and political correctness against it, slowly replacing the U.S. Constitution with Shariah. "Shariah creep" is already making headway!Found stored in a hidden sub-basement during the 2004 search of a Muslim leader's U.S. home, the documents are most telling concerning the strategy's success -- evidenced today by the Presbyterian Church's endorsement of various Islamic Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated entities (including unindicted co-conspirators in a fraud case that funneled money to terrorist groups).Similar to Muhammad's seventh century successful strategy, Islam's modern era assault strategy involves three "jihads.""Stealth jihad" is applicable when Muslims find themselves a minority seeking to plant Islam's seed among a majority non-believer community.For Muhammad, it began when living among pagans in Mecca. It involves the "peaceful" promotion of Islam, assuring the majority of its tolerance to co-exist with other religions. Koran (109:6) says, "You shall have your religion and I shall have my religion."Meanwhile, as did Prophet Muhammad, Muslims plot victory over non-believers, pretending to be friendly but lying about Islam's true intentions. Lying is a sin for Presbyterians but isn't for Muslims under "taqiyya," allowing deception to further Islam's influence.Stealth jihad's endgame is to intimidate the majority into feeling guilty Muslims are victimized -- guilt allayed by then granting Muslims protected status over other religions.This approach failed with Mecca's pagans who kicked the Muslims out for belittling their religion but did win Muhammad sympathy among Medina's non-believer majority who provided protection upon his arrival. This gave Muslims time to increase their numbers and resources, gaining influence while so protected."Defensive jihad" follows, allowing Muslims to violently defend any attacks—whether military or verbal.In his day, while enjoying Medina's protective umbrella, Muhammad initiated this jihad by attacking Mecca's pagans, claiming they had "attacked" Islam by rejecting it. He used assassins to silence critics.Medina's majority began awakening -- too late -- to the fact neither Muhammad nor Islam were peaceful. The Islamic seed growing in Medina became a vine choking the rights of the majority as Muhammad imposed Islam upon them, opening the door for the final jihad.Now a majority with political power, Muslims employ "offensive jihad" by aggressively focusing violence upon all non-believers, including those who protected them earlier and even those who had never attacked. Koran 9:73 states, "Strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them." Despite non-believers' non-aggression, Islam finally reveals its true colors as a non-peaceful religion declaring (Koran 3:151), "Soon shall We cast terror into the Hearts of the Unbelievers."The tolerance Muslims espoused as a minority vanishes when they become a majority, demanding non-believers submit to Islam by paying a tax or converting. This is observed today as most Muslim countries ban non-believers, prohibiting them from practicing their own faith -- contrary to the Presbyterian Church's policy.Transitioning from stealth to offensive jihad, the Koran changes tunes. Gone from the latter is the "Kumbaya" of the former; allegations of Muslims' false victimization give way to real victimization of non-Muslims to "convert or die."Islam is built upon a platform of hypocrisy, deception, human rights rejection for non-believers and violence (demanding death for apostates, contrary to any other religion's practices).Culling extremists from the supposedly majority peace-loving Muslim herd is difficult as taqiyya allows deception, raising the question whether moderates are wolves in sheep's clothing. If Islam is peaceful, moderates have much explaining to do about a Koran strongly revealing a contrary view.The Muslim Brotherhood's strategy is its blueprint for overcoming democracies throughout the West -- only differing on timing. The United States is in stealth jihad; Europe is in defensive jihad; offensive jihad is yet to come.But, as extremists boldly declare, Islam's flag one day will fly over the White House.The chameleon changes color to deceive predators. Islam changes color to deceive non-believers. Little Red Riding Hood proved capable of sensing such deception. Will the West prove equally as capable?--(Lt. Col. James G. Zumwalt, a retired Marine infantry officer, served in the Vietnam war, the U.S. invasion of Panama and the first Gulf War. He is the author of "Bare Feet, Iron Will--Stories from the Other Side of Vietnam's Battlefields," "Living the Juche Lie: North Korea's Kim Dynasty" and "Doomsday: Iran--The Clock is Ticking." He frequently writes on foreign policy and defense issues.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (UPI) -- The most common county-to-county moves are south and east from Los Angeles County and from Miami-Dade north to Broward, the U.S. Census Bureau said Wednesday.But Arizona's Maricopa County, basically Phoenix and its suburbs, appears to have the most mobile residents, demographers said. Maricopa residents reported moving there from 993 counties and moving out to 1,156 counties. Curiously, the same counties were both the most common places of origin and destinations for Maricopa: Coconino, Pimal and Pina in Arizona and Los Angeles and San Diego in California. The American Community Survey found that for 2005 to 2009 48.1 million U.S. residents moved, with 17.7 million changing counties. Nearly 50,000 people moved from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino on its east, making that the most popular county-to-county move. It was followed by Los Angeles to Orange County on its south, southeast from Los Angeles to Riverside, from Orange to Los Angeles and from Miami-Dade to Broward, the Fort Lauderdale area.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UPI) -- The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is warning taxpayers to guard against identity thieves out to steal individuals' tax return checks, a rising crime.CNBC reports the percentage of identity theft cases that center on stolen tax return checks has nearly tripled from 15 percent in 2010 to 43 percent in 2013. It's a relatively easy crime, with thieves only requiring a Social Security number and some basic biographical information to perpetrate it.Generally, identity thieves just make up bogus income amounts, file the returns electronically and hope they make it through the system. Then, when the taxpayer attempts to file a legitimate claim it is rejected by the IRS because records show the person has already been paid.Victims eventually receive their return but it can take awhile -- 180 days in many cases, the IRS said.CNBC reports the most effective safeguard is to file tax returns early to beat potential thieves to the punch."It really can be a race to the IRS," said Steve Toporoff, coordinator of the Identity Protection Program at the Federal Trade Commission. "[Thieves] usually don't have access to W-2 forms, so they just make up income numbers and hope their phony return gets through the process."

Dec. 14 (UPI) -- Following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., a crowd gathered in front of the White House for an impromptu vigil and to press President Obama to move on gun control.People held candles in remembrance of the 27 dead--including young 18 children--and signs saying "Today is the day," and "Wake up, disarm," in response to comments made by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney at the briefing Friday afternoon.I think it's important on a day like today to view this as I know the President, as a father, does; and I, as a father, and others who are parents certainly do -- which is to feel enormous sympathy for families that were affected and to do everything we can to support state and local law enforcement and to support those who are enduring what appears to be a very tragic event," Carney said. "There is I'm sure -- will be, rather, a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I don't think today is that day."

Wiki
Bella Savitsky Abzug (July 24, 1920 – March 31, 1998) was an American lawyer, Congresswoman, social activist and a leader of the Women's Movement. In 1971 Abzug joined other leading feminists such as Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan to found the National Women's Political Caucus. She famously declared "This woman’s place is in the House—the House of Representatives" in her successful 1970 campaign to join that body. She was later appointed to chair the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year and to plan the 1977 National Women's Conference by President Gerald Ford and led President Jimmy Carter's commission on women.
Bella Savitsky was born on July 24, 1920. Both of Bella’s parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants in the United States. Her mother, Esther, was a homemaker and her father, Emanuel ran the Live and Let Live Meat Market.
When Ms. Abzug was 13, her father died and she was told she would not be allowed to say the Mourner's Kaddish for her father in synagogue, where it is Jewish law for sons to say Kaddish (for 11 months after the death of a parent, although in Conservative and Reform communities both sons and daughters are permitted to say Kaddish). However, she did so as one of her first feminist actions because her father had no son.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
