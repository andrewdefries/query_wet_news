Sept. 4 (UPI) -- The evidence that the next iPhone will feature a fingerprint scanner is piling up, nearing the point of certainty.A photo of the so-called iPhone 5S home button components, leaked online by French tech site NoWhereElse, shows the part includes a "mysterious square element" that could be used to power the new feature.Rumors Apple was adding fingerprint technology to its flagship mobile device first started swirling last July, when the Cupertino tech giant acquired mobile security firm AuthenTec, which hold a number of fingerprint-scanning patents.Then, a developer working with the beta release of the iOS 7 software, which will ship with the new iPhone, noticed a folder buried in the code containing command strings for a fingerprint scanning process.Apple sent out invitations for its official fall event Tuesday, set to take place at 10 a.m. Pacific on September 10, where it is expected to unveil the next iPhone, as well as the less expensive iPhone 5C.

CHICAGO, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Evidence suggests corn played an important role in ancient Peruvian civilization 5,000 years ago, making it a true agricultural society, U.S. researchers say.Samples taken from pollen records, stone tool residues and fossilized feces suggest the food crop was actively grown, processed and eaten, adding weight to the argument Andean society was agricultural, not maritime-based, they said."If you look at the origins of civilizations around the world -- from Egypt to China and India -- they are all based on agriculture," study co-author Jonathan Haas of The Field Museum in Chicago said.Despite that, he said, many researchers have believed Andean early civilization was different and evolved from exploiting marine resources."That theory has now been the dominant theory since the mid-1970s but more data has become available saying that there are not just [coastal] sites but there are some big inland sites too," he told the BBC."People started to find corn at the inland sites, and the argument was that the corn was really a condiment and used for ceremonial purposes."The findings from his team's study "topples that notion" by showing corn, also called maize, and other agricultural crops were widespread at the archaeological study sites, Haas said.Although marine resources would have been an important source of protein, he said, "finding corn, beans, sweet potato and a number of other things in the diet -- that is an agriculturally-based society."

PITTSBURGH, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Chris Johnson pounded homers in the eighth and ninth innings Tuesday to break open a close game and rally the Arizona Diamondbacks past Pittsburgh 10-4.The D-backs trailed 4-3 heading into the eighth but forged a tie when Paul Goldschmidt, Justin Upton and Miguel Montero got consecutive hits off Jason Grilli (1-4). Johnson followed by belting the first of his two shots, a fly ball that just cleared the fence in right-center field for three runs.Arizona piled it on in the ninth as Montero stroked an RBI double and Johnson connected for a two-run blast, finishing with five RBI.The late outburst made a winner of Brad Ziegler (5-1), who go the final two outs of the seventh as the D-backs evened their four-game set with the Pirates at one win apiece.Stephen Drew went 3-for-4 with a solo homer and two RBI in the win.Andrew McCutchen drove in two runs and Starling Marte socked a solo homer for the Bucs.

ASUNCION, Paraguay, May 17 (UPI) -- It began as a Mercosur wrist-rapping of little landlocked Paraguay but an Argentine-Brazilian-Uruguayan diplomatic effort to isolate Asuncion is backfiring with more backlash against the trio from Paraguay's newly legitimized government.Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay mounted international diplomatic sanctions against Paraguay after its Congress jettisoned President Fernando Lugo last June and installed his deputy Federico Franco as caretaker president.Lugo, a former Catholic priest faulted for fathering several children from women in his flock and other alleged abuses of authority, was blamed for security failings that caused deaths of eight police officers and nine farmers in armed clashes.He resigned after a speedy impeachment but soon changed his mind and garnered enough left-wing Latin American support to trigger a crisis in international regional ties. Both the Mercosur trade bloc and Union of South American Nations backed him against Franco's caretaker regime, calling the takeover a coup.The Mercosur-Unasur faction also got Paraguay suspended from both organizations but failed to achieve similar sanctions in the Organization of American States, which upheld Asuncion's argument Franco would hold democratic elections, which he did.Tobacco magnate Horacio Cartes was elected president in May and will take over from Franco in August for a five-year term.Although Lugo was elected a senator in the May poll, Paraguayan politics are shifting right. Asuncion, while polite to its neighbors, is demonstrating firm resolve in changing the way it does business with neighbors.Argentina and Brazil share electricity from two dams located in Paraguay. For years Asuncion has claimed the partnership agreements over the dams are unfair and wants the terms revised to its satisfaction.In an Independence Day speech Franco condemned both Argentina and Brazil for exploiting its water resources and demanded Argentina pay more for surplus electricity and compensation for flooding damage to Paraguayan territory.The gigantic Itaipu hydroelectric complex supplies Brazil with almost 25 percent of its electricity needs. Argentina consumes most of electricity generated by the Yacireta dam over the Jasyreta-Apipe waterfalls in the Parana River.Both Argentina and Brazil claim Paraguay still owes them money spent on building the projects. Paraguay rejects the claims it owes Brazil $31 billion and Argentina $15 billion.Federico declared, "Here in this sacred place and on this day we affirm that Paraguay has long canceled the two binational dams' debt."He said Argentina needs to compensate Paraguay for flooding damage and for delayed payment of power bills.True Paraguayan independence will be achieved only when the country is treated as an equal partner by Argentina and Brazil and the financial matters are settled, Franco said.Paraguay aims to use more of its electricity and stop giving it at "rock-bottom" prices to neighbors, he added.Despite all the political upheavals Paraguay has been recording steady economic growth and sees improved prospects for its youth to discourage them for emigrating to find menial jobs in neighboring countries.

Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy	WASHINGTON, May 7 (UPI) -- The White House had "no update" Monday on U.S. President Obama's views on same-sex marriage, after the vice president and a cabinet member said they support it.Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex marriages and Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he personally supported same-sex marriages as well.Asked during the daily news briefing whether Obama has changed his mind, press secretary Jay Carney said, "I have no update on the president's personal views."Carney said Biden's comments made "the same point that the president has made previously: that committed and loving same-sex couples deserve the same rights and protections enjoyed by all Americans, and that we oppose any effort to roll back those rights."Duncan, the spokesman said, was asked about his personal views on the issue and he offered them."Obviously, this is an issue that many people have a view on and we respect the right of all people to have an opinion -- a personal opinion," Carney said.Asked if he had any insight into Obama's personal view on the issue, Carney said: "I think the president is the right person to describe his own personal views. He, as you know, said that his views on this were evolving and I don't have an update for you on that."Carney noted the administration opposes the Defense of Marriage Act and supports legislation to repeal it. The administration has stopped defending the constitutionality of a portion of DOMA in legal challenges.Biden told NBC's "Meet the Press" he is "absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And, quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that."He prefaced his remarks by saying: "I am vice president of the United States of America. The president sets the policy."When asked if the Obama administration would come out behind same-sex marriage in a second term, Biden said, "I don't know the answer to that."His remarks made Biden the highest-ranking White House official to embrace same-sex marriage, which is legal in six states and the District of Columbia but is unrecognized by the federal government.The Obama administration has endorsed civil unions but not marriage for same-sex couples.Continually pressed about Obama's view on same-sex marriages, Carney said, "I just don't have an update for you on the president's position."On his personal views, I can tell you that he is an absolutely committed support of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] rights. His record bears that out. It is an unparalleled record of support for LGBT citizens and their rights, and he's proud of it, and he'll run on it," Carney said. "And I think that it's important to remember when we talk about those accomplishments under this administration that they are far more than talking points: They are considerable, serious demonstrations of progress, important progress, progress that others would take away and reverse. This president's committed to not letting that happen."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Former Sen. Chuck Hagel Tuesday won Senate confirmation to be the new U.S. defense secretary.The Senate voted 58-41 to approve Hagel after earlier voting 71-27 to end a filibuster that had been blocking the final up-or-down vote.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the main opponent to President Obama's nominee, indicated two weeks ago Hagel might have given still-undisclosed speeches to "extreme or radical groups" or received money from foreign sources or defense contractors from 2008 to 2010.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., debunked Cruz's second accusation, saying Hagel complied with the committee's financial disclosure requirements and deserved to be confirmed as successor to Leon Panetta.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said before the vote that he didn't think Hagel was up to the job and called his worldview "dangerously misguided," The Washington Post reported. "I don't think we want a secretary of defense that has to learn on the job," Cronyn said.But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Hagel had emerged from the nominating process with his reputation intact despite the GOP criticism and filibuster."Twelve days later, Senator Hagel's exemplary record of service to his country remains untarnished," Reid said on the Senate floor before the vote. "Senate Republicans have delayed for the better part of two weeks for one reason and one reason only: partisanship."Last week 15 GOP senators asked Obama to pull Hagel's nomination. However, NBC News said, it since has become evident Republicans lacked the votes to further delay Hagel's confirmation by extended debate or filibuster.Hagel turned against the GOP by campaigning for Democratic Senate candidate Bob Kerrey in Nebraska last year. He also criticized President George W. Bush after the Iraq war became unpopular in 2006.His appearance before the Armed Services Committee was lackluster, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., calling it "the most unimpressive performance that I have seen in watching many nominees who came before the committee."

BERLIN, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- The East German Communist government, needing hard currency in the 1980s, allowed two pharmaceutical giants to test drugs on patients, a report says. For the drug companies, the government gave them a chance to evade strict controls on tests that were coming into force in western Europe, The Local.de reported. The testing was documented in a report, "Tests und Tote" or "Tests and the Dead," aired Monday on the German state broadcaster ARD.Hoechst AG and Sandoz, two West German companies, paid East Germany millions of deutschmarks for providing test subjects, the broadcast said. The patients involved were not told they would be getting untested medication or a placebo.Gerhard Lehrer died in a Dresden hospital where he was being treated for a heart attack in 1989, Der Spiegel reported. His wife says his doctor told him he was being given an effective, hard-to-get drug, but he became suspicious and told her before he died to keep some of the medication.When she had the pills tested, she learned her husband had received a placebo. ARD investigators learned Lehrer was part of a study for Ramipril, a drug designed to bring down blood pressure, that was being tested by Hoechst. Hoechst has since been merged into the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, which cooperated with ARD.The number of drug studies jumped from 20 in 1982, the report said, to 165 in 1988. But they stopped soon after when the East German regime collapsed and Germany was reunified.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9 (UPI) -- Jessica Simpson signed a Weight Watchers endorsement deal when she was still pregnant with her first child, daughter Maxwell, back in 2012. After giving birth to son Ace last summer, the 33-year-old singer, designer and mom of two has worked with the company to get back in shape for a new series of commercials. On Saturday, Simpson shared a behind-the-scenes photo of her upcoming ad. Wearing a form-fitting black dress, Simpson stands behind her chair. "Too proud to sit down!!" she captioned the image. Simpson told USA Today last December that two years of pregnancy "took a toll" on her body, but said she started trying to lose weight soon after Ace was born. "People are going to talk about this no matter what," she said of media scrutiny about her weight. "I might as well choose to live a healthy lifestyle.""It does get old having people harping on how much you weigh or your body after pregnancy," she added. "I need to feel comfortable in my own skin. People are going to pick me apart no matter what I do. I'm always going to have critics out there who will make a story out of something."
