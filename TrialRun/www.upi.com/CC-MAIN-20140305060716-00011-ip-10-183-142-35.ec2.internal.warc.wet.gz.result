NEW YORK, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- The richest people in the world got even richer in 2013, with U.S. software mogul Bill Gates leading the way, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicated.The aggregate net worth of the world's top billionaires was $3.7 trillion at the market close Dec. 31, the daily index of the world's 300 wealthiest individuals reported, with the top 300 adding $524 billion to their collective net worth.Of the 300 people who were in the final ranking of 2013, only 70 registered a net loss for the 12-month period, the index reported Thursday.Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Wash., increased his wealth by $15.8 billion to $78.5 billion, the index indicated, as shares of Microsoft rose 40 percent.Sheldon Adelson, political contributor and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp., was the second-biggest gainer in 2013, adding $14.4 billion to his net worth, the index said.The Bloomberg Billionaires Index said Gates reclaimed the title of world's richest person May 16 from Mexican investor Carlos Slim, who lost money in 2013 but still was among the rich who added to their wealth.Slim was $51 billion ahead of Jorge Paulo Lemann, Latin America's second-richest person and Brazil's wealthiest, the index indicated.

DENVER, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force has selected Lockheed Martin to develop a software planner that integrates air operations and missile defense systems information.Work on the planner, which will enable the service better situational awareness, comes under a U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center awarded worth about $8 million.Lockheed said the planner will be integrated into the U.S. Air Force Air Operations Center."This planner offers an unprecedented capability to analyze multiple sources of information to support rapid and efficient deployment decisions," said Rob Smith, vice president of C4ISR for Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global Solutions. "Our goal is to enhance situational awareness and facilitate collaborative planning for all combatant commands."Dissimilar weapon and sensor data, with map-based planning tools and decision aids, will be integrated into the system, allowing Air Combat Command operators to more rapidly plan missions. By integrating the missile defense data sources on to a common visualization platform, operators can easily generate and publish planning tactical operations documents to support creation of an area air defense plan, Lockheed said.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, June 4 (UPI) -- Hugh Bonneville is lobbying for the Rolling Stones to appear on an episode of his celebrated British costume drama "Downton Abbey," The Guardian reported.TVGuide.com said Bonneville is friends with Stones member Ronnie Wood and hopes the musicians will agree to guest star on his early 20th century-set series."Obviously, they wouldn't play themselves, but they could be a rag-tag bunch of traveling entertainers or even a circus act," a source told The Guardian. "It would be such a coup, and fun for the Stones. They really are huge fans of the show.""Apparently, they were stopping rehearsals on Sunday nights in time to get back to watch it... When Sybil passed away, Mick [Jagger] said to Ronnie [Wood], 'Sad to hear about the girl.' Ronnie replied, 'I haven't seen it yet -- I recorded it,'" "Abbey" cast member Laura Carmichael told the newspaper.

ALCOI, Spain, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- A Spanish woman was compensated $37,287 after workers at a hospital twice confused her with her roommate and tried to give her unnecessary treatments.The woman, whose name was not released, sued the Hospital Virgen de los Lirios in Alcoi after her November stay at the facility, Think Spain reported Tuesday.The woman said she received surgery for an intestinal problem and while she was recovering, staff unsuccessfully attempted to fit her with a catheter through her main artery. She said the attempt left her with serious nerve damage to her left shoulder.Hospital staff later realized the procedure was meant for the woman's hospital roommate.The woman said a nurse came into her room two days later and attempted to give her an enema, which she said seemed "illogical" given that a large part of her intestine had been removed.The woman refused the procedure and the nurse soon realized the enema was also meant for the roommate.The patient sued the hospital and was awarded $37,287 in compensation.

SEATTLE, March 10 (UPI) -- Even though Google glasses aren't even available yet, a Seattle bar has already banned them from its establishment, owners of the bar said. "For the record, The 5 Point is the first Seattle business to ban in advance Google Glasses. And [butt] kickings will be encouraged for violators," Seattle's 5 Point Cafeé said.Google is still developing the glasses, which can take pictures, videos and display directions and social conversations on the lenses, KIRO-FM, Seattle said. Dave Meinert, 5 Point owner, said he wants to preserve patrons' privacy, and that he doesn't want his customers to be secretly videotaped. The glasses will likely be available for purchase by the end of 2013, KIRO-FM said.

| License Photo	CHICAGO, Nov. 3 (UPI) -- About 60 people led by anti-Wall Street protesters heckled Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker during a speech in Chicago Thursday.Walker, who led efforts to eliminate collective bargaining rights for public workers in Wisconsin earlier this year, was interrupted repeatedly as he addressed business leaders at the Union League Club. He was talking about budget reforms and touted his efforts to balance Wisconsin's budget, the Chicago Tribune reported.The protesters chanted: "Union busting. It's disgusting" and "We are the 99 percent" for about 6 minutes before they were asked to leave. Walker, who is facing a union-led effort to recall him from office next year, told the departing demonstrators: "The bottom line is, no matter how loud you shout, the facts are the facts. The facts are that our reforms have worked and continue to work in the state of Wisconsin." He made a pitch for businesses and corporations to leave Illinois and relocate in Wisconsin.GALLERY: The latest from Occupy Oakland In Oakland, Calif., Thursday an Occupy protester was shot in the leg with a projectile fired by police and was carried off on a stretcher, witnesses said.However, the Oakland Tribune reported circumstances of the injury couldn't be confirmed and the victim's status was unknown.Real estate developer Phil Tagami told the San Francisco Chronicle he brandished a loaded shotgun after Wednesday's general strike to scare protesters away from a downtown building.He said no police were around when rioters tried to push their way into the landmark Rotunda Building near City Hall that recently underwent a $50 million renovation. The Chronicle said masked vandals spray-painted graffiti on the building and several others downtown on Broadway. A 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of obstruction and battery on a police officer. The Oakland Tribune said police made 80 arrests downtown and that five civilians and three officers were injured.Oakland police used tear gas and flash grenades to subdue the protesters who shut down the nation's fifth-largest port and took over a vacant building, authorities said. Thursday morning, truckers faced down protesters who had erected barriers at the Port of Oakland, and one trucker ran through the blockade and threatened to run down protesters, the Tribune reported. The protesters took down fences after meeting with the president of the International Longshoreman's Association.Elsewhere, police arrested 16 protesters at Washington Square Park in Rochester, N.Y., after midnight Thursday, first warning protesters would be arrested if they didn't leave the park by its 11 p.m. closing time, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 15 (UPI) -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told a House committee Wednesday he assumed the White House learned of the Associated Press subpoena "in the newspapers."Holder told Republicans on the committee the Justice Department does not inform the White House of ongoing investigations.He also said he didn't participate in the decision to subpoena phone records from the AP.Holder told the House Judiciary Committee, "I was recused in that matter. ... I am not familiar with the reasons why the subpoena was constructed in the way it was. ... [However] I have faith in the people who were responsible in this case."The subpoena for phone records of about 20 AP employees came in the investigation of media leaks of U.S. Justice Department information.Holder was questioned closely on the subpoena by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other Republicans.Holder said he withdrew from the process because "I am a fact witness in that I am a possessor of the information that was leaked." He confirmed that the subpoena process was overseen by Deputy Attorney General James Cole.The department hasn't revealed details of the leak investigation.U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said there was irony in that last year Republicans on the committee had "demanded an investigation of press leaks" and prosecution of media violators but now were lambasting the Justice Department for the leaks investigation.Goodlatte said in a statement the department should be involved in protecting free speech, not chilling it."Any abridgment of the First Amendment is very concerning, especially reports that the IRS targeted conservative groups for unwarranted scrutiny during an election year," Goodlatte said.Holder said Tuesday his department would open an investigation into whether Internal Revenue Service officials broke laws by singling out conservative groups.

JUBA, South Sudan, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- A South Sudan official says Sudan is increasing its troops in the contested Abyei area and moving many Arab nomads there to sabotage an upcoming referendum.Luka Biong Deng, co-chairman of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee, said the creation by Sudan of a humanitarian commission was done only to more easily settle members of the Misseriya tribe in the area, the Sudan Tribune reported Sunday.Deng said the unilateral creation of the commission violates a June 2011 agreement that specifies an interagency task force.Deng said United Nations peacekeeping forces in Abyei should report Sudan was in "clear violation" of the agreement by sending more troops into the region instead withdrawing them as required."The people of Abyei have suffered a lot," he said. "It is time for the international community to give them [the] support they deserve."South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, has accepted an African Union proposal to hold a referendum in October for the residents of Abyei to decide which country the region should join.The AU proposal would restrict the Misseriya from voting because they are not permanent residents of the area.

| License Photo	July 15 (UPI) -- Adidas has dropped sprinter Tyson Gay after he admitted to failed drug tests.The American 100-meter record holder is the second-fastest man in the world and promoted anti-drug athlete.Adidas ended their sponsorship contract with Gay shortly after the news broke."We are shocked by these recent allegations," a spokesman for Adidas said Monday. "Even if we presume his innocence until proven otherwise, our contract with Tyson is currently suspended."
Gay said he will pull out of the world championships next month in Moscow. Two other runners, Jamaicans Sherone Simpson -- an Olympic gold medalist and two-time silver medalist -- and Asafa Powell, the record-holder before Gay and fourth-fastest man in history, tested positive for banned stimulants.Gay was notified last week that he had failed the test with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, and he will have a second test as early as this week. Gay did not reveal which banned substance he had used, nor who provided it to him.He admitted it shortly after rumors arose on LetsRun.com, a site known for posting accurate rumors, posted about the test."I don't have a sabotage story. I don't have any lies. I don't have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on USADA's hands, someone playing games," Gay said. "I don't have any of those stories. I basically put my trust in someone and I was let down."
