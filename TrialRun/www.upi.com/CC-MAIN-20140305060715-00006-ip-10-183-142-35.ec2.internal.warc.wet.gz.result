TORONTO, Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The National Hockey League's union/owners' standoff is taking a major revenue toll on Canadian sports retailers, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.With all games through November already canceled, sports-reliant stores in Ontario and Quebec are reporting sales declines as high as 30 percent, the broadcaster said.The frustration is shown in a YouTube video posted by Alan Pearson, who owns Raxan Collectibles in Kirkland, Quebec.It's entitled "The NHL Destroyed My Business.""I've run my business for more than 20 years," he posted. "I've been paying royalties. And what do you guys do for the second time in eight years?"The 2004 season was canceled entirely over league and union disputes.Bob Reaume, who runs a self-named sports shop in Windsor, Ontario, said his sales were down by at least 30 percent.In big business, a major sponsor of hockey in Canada, brewer Molson Coors, said beer sales are down as a result of the standoff and will look for lost compensation from the NHL, the report said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UPI) -- Italian company Selex Galileo recently completed the first series of U.S. flight trials of its VigilX Airborne Enhanced Situational Awareness System.The system, which enables pilots to see in zero light conditions, was flown in a series of sorties on a U.S. Department of Defense trials helicopter and demonstrated its potential to provide an innovative capability to aid the operation of battlefield helicopters at night and in degraded visual environments."Achieving this milestone allows us to position VigilX in the U.S. marketplace, confirming the airborne performance of the system in battlefield helicopters and its potential value to the U.S. warfighter, which is always our goal," said William "Mac" Wilkinson, Selex Galileo's director, Special Operations Business Development.VigilX is a distributed aperture sensor system which processes inputs from a series of sensors distributed around an airborne platform to generate one integrated panoramic image, which allows the crew to "see through the hull" of the aircraft. It does so using a combination of infrared, low-light and visible-band cameras.The system supports simultaneous and independent interrogation of the outside environment by multiple crew members. The ultra-low latency of VigilX allows it to operate with modern helmet-mounted display systems, in addition to head-up displays and cockpit multifunctional displays.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 11 (UPI) -- DreamWorks Animation and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment say they donated $50,000 to an organization that supports U.S. school music and arts programs.In celebration of the soon-to-be released Blu-ray and DVD of the Tony Award-winning Broadway production of "Shrek the Musical," the companies made the donation to the non-profit National Association for Music Education, which will create five $10,000 grants to help save music and arts programs in schools. Schools are invited to enter to receive a grant for their school music program at www.ShrekDay.com.All entries must be received by Oct. 31, and following a random drawing, five schools will be announced as winners Nov. 4."Music is an essential part of every student's educational experience; it teaches cooperation, collaboration, creativity, and communication. It is important to support school music programs so children can enjoy the lifelong benefits of music study," Michael A. Butera -- executive director of National Association for Music Education and Give a Note Foundation -- said in a statement Thursday. "'Shrek the Musical' tells a story of love, friendship and finding your true self. The fact that the story is enhanced by music demonstrates the true power of musical expression. We're very grateful to DreamWorks Animation and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment for their support and generosity.""We are proud that our live theater experience can give back to the educational community through this grant program," said Bill Damaschke, chief creative officer at DreamWorks Animation, who also served as the producer of the Broadway show. "Full of high energy and fun, 'Shrek the Musical' is a great introduction for kids to experience the magic of live theater. The 'Shrek' franchise continues to entertain audiences in a number of different ways."

CHICAGO, Aug. 9 (UPI) -- Oswaldo Arcia completed a night of home runs Friday with a solo blast in the 10th inning that gave Minnesota a 3-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox.The Twins completed a sweep of a day-night doubleheader, having won the opener 7-5.All five runs in the second contest came on solo homers. Minnesota reached 51 wins for the season with the pair of victories, leaving only the White Sox and Houston having yet to reach the 50-win plateau in the American League.Chris Herrmann put Minnesota in front in the fourth inning, but Alexei Ramirez and Blake Tekotte hit their home runs in the fourth and sixth frames to give the White Sox the lead.The homer for Tekotte was his first in what has been a 47-game major league career spread over three seasons.Josh Willingham tied it in the eighth with his 11th homer of the season and Arcia came through in the 10th on the second pitch of the inning thrown by Dylan Axelrod (4-9).Brian Duensing (6-1) claimed the win after working a perfect ninth inning. Glen Perkins needed just nine pitches to retire the side in order in the 10th for his 28th save.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- The Obama administration is on the verge of botching an unprecedented opportunity.Prior to the remarkable joint U.S.-Russian initiative that established a process to dispose of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, the outlook for the region was grim. The only certainty was continuing violence that will kill tens of thousands and displace many more hundreds of thousands of Syrians.U.S. President Barack Obama had double checkmated himself by declaring that Syrian President Bashar Assad must stand down from office and then setting a "red line" around using chemical weapons.Following the chemical attacks that killed some 1,400 people on Aug. 21, Obama made two highly contradictory decisions.First, the president vowed to use force to deter and degrade Syria's chemical weapons. Next he elected to secure from the U.S. Congress the authority to use force.Fortunately, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's mention at a London news conference of Assad foregoing those weapons prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene and propose a joint U.S.-Russian initiative.The results have been a U.N. Security Council Resolution authorizing the disposal of Syrian weapons and the arrival of inspection teams from The Hague's Office for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Damascus and the United Nations.So far, so good -- maybe.What happens next could be breakdown, breakthrough and sadly and most likely, a botched opportunity.Given the logistical nightmare of actually disposing of the chemical agents and the possibility that Assad is using the weapons as a diversion to stall for time, breakdown could force Obama to reorder military action with or without congressional approval and opt for a policy of regime change. Worse, Moscow and Washington will blame the other for the failure and a new version of the old Cold War could break out.A breakthrough brings its own downsides. For Obama, actual elimination of Syrian chemical weapons will leave Assad in power. Arming and supporting a fractured opposition especially those that rejected the initiative to dispose of Syrian chemical weapons while allowing Assad to retain power will be difficult. So Obama needs an exit strategy.The most likely Obama exit strategy is to botch this opportunity. The chemical weapons inspectors seem to be making good progress in identifying and disposing of those weapons. And security appears, and that is the appropriate word, to be providing sufficient protection for the inspectors to continue their work.Hence, it is possible that if this condition holds and disposal is completed sooner than later, the Obama administration will claim victory and continue its current contradictory policies toward Syria and Assad that can only lead to greater bloodshed and violence.Cynicism aside, the opportunities afforded by this U.S. and Russian initiative are too important not to be exploited. Three are particularly relevant.First is improving U.S. and, by extension Western, relations with Russia. Cooperation in disposing of Syria's chemical arsenals including sharing joint technical capabilities and consideration of sending forces to bolster security for the transportation and disposal of these weapons can be great confidence building measures.Second, Iran has a role to play. Engaged through Hezbollah in Syria, Iran remains economically crippled by sanctions. The model of disposing of Assad's weapons could be a springboard for negotiations to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons with an ironclad verification scheme that might allow, with proper oversight, uranium enrichment below weapons grade.Such a negotiation would relieve many of the tensions and potential grounds for crisis and tragedy in the Persian Gulf including ending the sanctions.Third, if Iran foregoes nuclear weapons, and that can be guaranteed and verified, Israel has no legitimate reason to take unilateral military action. More to the point, with Iranian support, as well as that of the Sunni world, movement on redressing the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflicts with a two state, Israeli-Palestinian solution, however intractable, may be possible.Ironically, in an otherwise bleak and crisis filled picture of international dangers, removal and destruction of Assad's chemical weapons could, and the operative word remains "could," lead to changes as profound as the end of the Cold War and open a new and safer chapter in human history.The challenges are Herculean and the odds against exploiting this opportunity are stunningly long. But what is the alternative?Reality raises its ugly head. The American ship of state is adrift and badly foundering. The nonsensical pantomime in Washington over reopening government and raising the debt ceiling is Exhibit A. Moreover, the main and naive opportunity the White House sees is crushing the Republicans by assigning them blame for this fiasco, thereby winning the 2014 congressional elections and not making breakthroughs in the Middle East.Obama, you were bold in taking down Osama bin Laden. Be bold again. Do not botch this unprecedented opportunity with Russia!--(Harlan Ullman is senior adviser at the Atlantic Council in Washington and chairman of the Killowen Group, which advises leaders of business and government.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Monday indicated it has delayed a decision on whether to hear argument in any of an array of cases dealing with same-sex marriage.Eight challenges to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a similar Arizona law and California's Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, were considered during the high court's closed conference last Friday.But a check of the Supreme Court's docket Monday showed the cases have been rescheduled for a conference this Friday.DOMA, enacted in 1996, says federal benefits and considerations for married couples apply only to heterosexual unions. The Obama administration is enforcing the 1996 act, but is one of the main challengers in court.Section 3, which is targeted in all the DOMA cases, says, "In determining the meaning of any act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.""Although Section 3 of DOMA does not purport to invalidate same-sex marriages in those states that permit them," the administration told the Supreme Court in a petition brief it "excludes such marriages from recognition for purposes of more than 1,000 federal statutes and programs whose administration turns in part on individuals' marital status. ... Section 3 of DOMA thus denies to legally married same-sex couples many substantial benefits otherwise available to legally married opposite-sex couples under federal employment, immigration, public health and welfare, tax and other laws."California voters approved Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act, in 2008 with slightly more than 52 percent for, nearly 48 percent against. Prop 8 said in part, "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California."

BANGKOK, July 9 (UPI) -- Lawyers associated with Thailand's Democrat Party are trying to reverse last Sunday's election by asking a court to dissolve the Puea Thai Party.In legal papers filed Friday, lawyers argue that Puea Thai's campaign involved former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and other people who have been banned from politics, the Bangkok Post reported. Thaksin, who has been living in exile since he was ousted by a 2006 military coup, is the brother of Pheu Thai leader Yingluck Shinawatra, who is about to become prime minister.A spokesman for the Democrat Party said it is not involved in the legal challenge, The Wall Street Journal reported. Prompong Noparrit, a spokesman for Puea Thai, said Thaksin sometimes discusses politics with his sister and other party leaders. But he said Thaksin is in no way a leader of the party.Puea Thai won an outright majority of 265 seats in the 500-member Parliament. Some smaller parties have joined its coalition, bringing its majority to more than 300.

DAMATURU, Nigeria, Aug. 5 (UPI) -- A driver slammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into a Nigerian military convoy Sunday, killing at least five soldiers and himself, The Daily Times reported.The Nigerian newspaper said Patrick Egbuniwe, the state police commissioner, confirmed the attack in Damaturu in Yobe state, but did not provide a figure for casualties. The Daily Times cited an unnamed source for the death toll.Egbuniwe said the suicide bomber was in a sport utility vehicle being chased by a military patrol vehicle and the driver detonated his explosives when soldiers converged on him.Egbuniwe said the jihadist terrorist group Boko Haram was suspected to be responsible.The suicide blast came the day after the Nigerian navy said two of its personnel were killed and two others were injured in an attack by gunmen on an oil platform belonging to Sea Truck Oil Servicing Co, The Daily Times said. Commodore Kabir Aliyu, director of naval information, said four workers from Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Thailand, and three sailors were abducted in the attack off the coast of Bonny, Rivers state."We have not made any arrest yet. We are still trying to ascertain the true identities of the attackers and their motive," he said. "We are still searching."We have not established any contact with the attackers or the foreigners abducted."Nigeria's Leadership newspaper reported the emir of Fika in Yobe state, Muhammadu Abali Ibn Muhammadu Idrissa, avoided being killed Friday when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive nearby as he made his way out of a mosque.A witness, Mallam Garba Inusa, said a police officer lost an arm protecting Idrissa from the blast, which killed the bomber and wounded 18 other worshipers, Leadership said.A suspected suicide bomber was killed Thursday night in Kaduna when the improvised explosive device he was carrying detonated. There were no other reported injuries in that incident.

According to Buddhist scriptures, a child mature enough to protect fields from insects and birds is capable of choosing the path of “lamahood.” At times children as young as 7 or 8 are admitted to the austere discipline of the monasteries.
Situated at the foothills of the Himalayas, Bir, in Himachal Pradesh, India, is dotted with monasteries. This audio slideshow is an inside view into the lives of child “lamas” and their desires and aspirations.

He turned pro in 2000, plays left-handed, weighs 169 lb (76 kg) and measures 6'1" (185 cm).

He reached the semifinals of the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon in 2007, beating players such as the 5th seed Ivan Ljubičić. On April 19, 2010, Falla achieved his career high of #58.
The Colombian became the first player from his country to break into the Top 100 of the ATP Rankings since Mauricio Hadad in 1996. In 2006, Alejandro qualified a career-high six times into the main draw of ATP level tournaments. In his second tournament of the year, he reached the final of the Mexico City Challenger.

Wiki
Mohammed Atef (Arabic: محمد عاطف‎, Muḥammad ‘Āṭaf) (Born Sobhi Abu Sitta, also known as Abu Hafs) was the alleged military chief of al-Qaida, although his role in the organisation was not well-known by intelligence agencies for years. His death in November 2001 was one of the United States' largest and first victories in the War on Terror.
Atef served two years in the Egyptian Air Force and became an agricultural engineer. He was a police officer and a member of the group Egyptian Islamic Jihad before he moved to Afghanistan to repel the the Soviet invasion, while operating from Peshawar. He has been credited as having convinced Abdullah Azzam to abandon his life and devote himself to preaching jihad at this time.
Atef was sent to an Afghan training camp where he met Ayman al-Zawahiri, who later introduced him to Osama bin Laden.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
