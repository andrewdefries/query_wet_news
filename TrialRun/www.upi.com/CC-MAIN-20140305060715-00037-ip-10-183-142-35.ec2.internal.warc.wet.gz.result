STAVANGER, Norway, May 13 (UPI) -- Taking a stake in the Barents Sea from French supermajor Total provides an "interesting platform" for new opportunities, Norwegian major Statoil said.Statoil announced it reached a deal for an asset swap in the Barents Sea with Total. The companies trade 10 percent of their equity in the PL535 and PL395 areas of the Bjarmeland area in the central Barents Sea.Both parties have proved natural gas resources in the region."The Bjarmeland area has an interesting resource potential which may become important for future gas developments in the Barents Sea," Statoil exploration Vice President Gro Haatvedt said in a statement. "We believe that this transaction creates an interesting platform for future opportunities in this area."The Norwegian government needs to sign off in the deal before it's formalized.Norway is the largest oil producer in Europe and the second-largest exporter of natural gas after Russia.In July, Norway estimated parts of the area, about 200 miles north of Hammerfest, could hold as much as 250 million barrels of oil equivalent.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- Production of adult films will resume at the end of the week for performers who have tested negative for HIV, a trade industry group announced.In ending a two-week moratorium on filming, the group Free Speech Coalition said actors would now be required to be tested for the virus twice as often, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.All adult film actors must be tested every 14 days for the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, the organization said. Previously, testing was required every 28 days. Testing will be required again on or after Thursday for performers to return to work.Free Speech Coalition called for a moratorium last month after it said a 28-year-old porn actress known as Cameron Bay tested positive for HIV. After the moratorium was lifted, the actress's real-life boyfriend and fellow performer, Rod Daily, announced he had tested positive for HIV.The moratorium was reinstated after a third unnamed performer tested positive.

| License Photo	LONDON, Oct. 19 (UPI) -- Scottish tennis star Andy Murray says he almost missed being honored by Prince William at Buckingham Palace because of a random drug test.The testers made a surprise visit to his home Thursday morning, 5 minutes before his taxi was due, Murray told the BBC. Fortunately, Murray said, he had a skilled driver and made it to the palace on time for investiture with the Order of the British Empire.The prince, formally titled the Duke of Cambridge, was presiding at his first investiture. The queen normally does the honors but Prince Charles and Princess Anne sometimes step in.Murray said the prince seemed appeared calm for a first-timer."He seemed very relaxed and seemed to give everyone a lot of time," Murray said.William, who recently left active service with the Royal Air Force and became a first-time father, has been taking on more official duties.Another honoree Thursday was Kenneth Gibson, a school head from northeast England.Gibson was knighted -- with the traditional sword tap -- for transforming two failing schools."I found it all very overwhelming and was very nervous but he took I in his stride," Gibson told the Daily Express. "I told him that it was a huge privilege to be the first person to be knighted by him and he acknowledged it with a smile. I know there was some speculation in the press about him practicing so that he didn't chop anyone's ear of but he was absolutely fine."

SAN ANTONIO, June 13 (UPI) -- Dwyane Wade turned in his most productive game of the playoffs Thursday in leading Miami to a 109-93 win over San Antonio that deadlocked the NBA Finals.Wade had scored no more than 21 points in any of his previous 18 post-season contests this season, but he hit 14-of-25 from the field and delivered 32 points in Game 4 of the championship series.Miami regained home-court advantage by pulling even at 2-2. San Antonio will host the pivotal fifth game of the series on Sunday before the teams return to Florida for the sixth game on Tuesday. A seventh game, if needed, will be hosted by the Heat next Thursday.LeBron James, answering criticism for his lackluster play in this series, scored 33 points with nine of those coming in the closing minutes after the game had been decided.It was Wade, however, who carried the Heat as they pulled away in the early stages of the fourth quarter.San Antonio was within five to open the final period, but Miami began the quarter on a 13-7 run during which Wade scored eight points.Miami shot 53 percent from the field and forced 18 San Antonio turnovers.After hitting an NBA Finals record 16 3-pointers in Game 3, the Spurs were held to eight on Thursday. Five San Antonio players scored in double figures, with Tim Duncan producing 20, but the Spurs could not slow down the Miami offense.Chris Bosh contributed 20 points for Miami and Ray Allen had 14.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- The French government welcomed a recent decision by former colony Ivory Coast to ratify the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court."This important decision confirms the commitment of the states of the African continent to the fight against impunity," a statement from the French government read. "Ivory Coast thus becomes the 122th state party to the ICC statute."Youssoufou Bamba, Ivorian ambassador to the United Nations, delivered the instrument of ratification to U.N. headquarters last week."This most recent ratification brings to 34 the number of states parties in Africa, which is a sign of growing acknowledgement of the role of ICC in the global fight against impunity for the gravest international crimes," Tiina Intelmann, president of states parties to the Rome Statute, said in a statement.Former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo appeared Tuesday before the ICC. He was arrested in 2011 with the help of French peacekeepers and transferred to The Hague, before Ivory Coast ratified the Rome Statute.The court says Gbagbo may bear criminal responsibility for four counts of crimes against humanity for actions during violence that rocked the West African country following contested presidential elections in 2010.Gbagbo's government accepted limited ICC jurisdiction in 2003.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (UPI) -- First lady Michelle Obama wore a navy Thom Browne coat and dress ensemble to her husband's second inauguration ceremony Monday in Washington.The fabric was developed based on the style of a men's silk tie, the White House said.A jeweled belt that cinched the coat and her gloves were from J. Crew and her earrings were designed by Cathy Waterman. She wore Reed Krakoff boots.The White House said her outfit and accessories will go to the National Archives at the end of the inaugural festivities.Fashion consultant Tim Gunn told ABC News he like Michelle Obama's sense of style because she is "not a dress-up doll.""She is of her own mind, and she knows what she looks good in," said Gunn, a longtime mentor on the popular "Project Runway" reality series."Thom Browne is known for avant garde menswear," Gunn said. "I thought, Mrs. Obama is wearing Thom Browne to the inaugural swearing-in ceremony, but in fact it is magnificent."

MOSCOW, March 22 (UPI) -- Russian religious leaders said Thursday a protest performance by the female punk band Pussy Riot at Moscow's largest cathedral was insulting to all believers.Members of the Russian Interreligious Council released a statement asking members of the group "to come to senses and make public apologies," ITAR-Tass reported.Clad in brightly colored ski masks, the band stood at the altar at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior Feb. 21 and performed a version of what they called a "punk prayer" titled "Holy [expletive]," which included the line "Holy Mother, Blessed Virgin, chase Putin out." The band was detained briefly after the performance, RIA Novosti reported.The demonstration occurred less than a week before presidential elections in which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin won his bid for a third term as president.Pussy Riot is known for its controversial public protests. The band made headlines in January after a performance in Red Square calling for "Revolt in Russia.""The group with the indecent name insulted the feelings of believers of any creed, because the offense was committed at the place, where people are praying to the God," Andrei Glotser, representative of the Federation of Jewish Religious Communities in Russia, said Thursday.

| License Photo	Feb. 6 (UPI) -- After more than half a century overlooking the San Francisco Bay, Candlestick Park is finally getting ready to say its goodbyes.Owners of the stadium, the current home of the NFC champion 49ers, announced this week Candlestick would be dynamited, in a 30-second implosion, likely within weeks of the end of the coming football season, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.The 53-year-old stadium, which was originally built to host the San Francisco Giants, would have otherwise ended up empty next year: The baseball team moved out in 2000 after the construction of Pacific Bell Park (now AT&T Park) and the NFL team is slated to move into a new home at Santa Clara Stadium at the start of the 2014 season.Lennar Corp., which owns the property, plans to build a shiny new shopping, residential and office complex on the land."The best thing for our development and the neighborhood is not to have that hulking building sitting there empty," said Kofi Bonner, president of Lennar Urban.The city, which had feared it would be stuck with the bill of maintaining and aging and empty stadium, is relieved that plans to demolish 'The Stick' are finally in place.Says Phil Ginsburg, the head of city Rec and Park: "Everything has a life, and Candlestick has exceeded it."

Grand jury to probe priests and cover up
HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., April 11 (UPI) -- Wiki
Thomas J. Spota III is currently the District Attorney of Suffolk County, New York.
Spota has been the District Attorney since 2001, when he defeated three-time incumbent James M. Catterson Jr. He would be reelected in 2006 without any opposition. Spota has been active in the fight against the distribution of child pornography over the Internet. In 2003, Spota indicted twelve Suffolk residents who utilized, KaZaA, a file-sharing program to spread child pornography. As a result, Spota was called to testified before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on September 9, 2003 at a hearing concerning the building on "Pornography, Technology, and Process: Problems and Solutions on Peer-to-Peer Networks." Spota recommended a new federal task force and that legislation was needed to "attack the owners and the distributors of these programs, who are reaping enormous profits."
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Spota worked as a Suffolk prosecutor under District Attorney Patrick Henry. He then entered private law practice in Suffolk, representing clients including the Suffolk Detectives Association and other law enforcement unions.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
