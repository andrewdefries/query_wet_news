BEIJING, March 2 (UPI) -- The Chinese government said there are trillions of cubic feet of exploitable shale gas reserves in the country but it lacks the technology to explore it fully.The Chinese Ministry of Land and Resources said there was an estimated 886 trillion cubic feet of natural gas deposits in onshore shale reserves."China is rich in shale-gas resources, which are suitable for scaled development," the ministry said in a statement. "But the geological conditions are complex and our exploration technology, which lags behind advanced countries, requires innovation."The ministry said it discovered shale natural gas reserves in exploration blocks that could hold significant volumes of reserves. The country aims to start developing shale by 2015, though there are no commercial shale gas developments yet in China.Beijing aims to add more natural gas to its energy mix in an effort to control pollution. Shale gas could play a dominant role by 2020 if reserve estimates meet expectations, the government said.China Petroleum Corp. announced recently it landed a $900 million deal with U.S. energy company Devon to tap into shale natural gas reserves in the United States.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Sept. 15 (UPI) -- Production, launch and on-orbit activation of Boeing's seventh Wideband Global Satcom satellite has been authorized by the U.S. Air Force.The authorization came through a $1.09 billion contract modification that adds funding to the existing Block II follow-on contract for full production, launch and on-orbit activation and procurement of long-lead materials for an eighth satellite.Boeing said the authorization includes options for the full production, launch and on-orbit activation of satellites eight and nine. The additional orders are part of the WGS Block II follow-on contract awarded in August 2010. "With three satellites in operation today, WGS is already making a huge difference for the warfighter," said Craig Cooning, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems. "Satellites seven and eight will address the growing demand for high-data-rate services worldwide."The contract includes production, launch site activities and initial orbital operations and checkout for each satellite. Boeing is working with the Air Force on potential upgrades that would increase the satellites' capacity and operational flexibility.WGS is the U.S. Department of Defense's highest-capacity communications satellite system. The three satellites in orbit provide more than 30 times the communications capacity of the previous Defense Satellite Communications System constellation.

VARNAMO, Sweden, May 27 (UPI) -- Members of a Swedish family said they were shocked when an Indian elephant rammed their house while other elephants wandered in their garden.The Enoksson family of Varnamo said they woke up Sunday morning to discover the elephants, which escaped from a nearby circus, wandering around their yard, The Local.se reported Monday.The family said they started filming the creatures and one of the elephants became agitated and rammed into their home."We became very frightened and then we heard a crash in the wall of the house," Sofia Enoksson told the Aftonbladet daily.The family contacted police, who in turn contacted the circus."One hopes that they have a carer who can entice them with some carrots," said Goran Gunnarsson of the Jonkoping police.Aftonbladet said the circus reported being in control of the elephants.

CANBERRA, Australia, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Astronomers using a telescope in Australia to take the universe's temperature say it's cooled down just as predicted in Big Bang theory of its beginning.An international team from Sweden, France, Germany and Australia used the Australia Telescope Compact Array in New South Wales to measure how warm the Universe was when it was half its current age."This is the most precise measurement ever made of how the universe has cooled down during its 13.77-billion-year history," said Robert Braun, chief scientist for astronomy at space science at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.The astronomers looked at light coming from halfway across the universe, meaning the light started its journey in Earth's direction when the universe was half as old as it is today.They studied gas in a galaxy 7.2 billion light-years away being kept warm only by the cosmic background radiation, the glow left over from the Big Bang.The Big Bang theory of the birth of the universe holds that the temperature of cosmic background radiation should drop smoothly as the universe expands."That's just what we see in our measurements," said research leader Sebastien Muller of Onsala Space Observatory at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. "The Universe of a few billion years ago was a few degrees warmer than it is now, exactly as the Big Bang Theory predicts."

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, May 30 (UPI) -- Taking God's name in vain is a familiar profanity but could lead to the beheading of a Turkish barber in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, court records show.Currently awaiting appeal on his sentence, Sabri Bogday allegedly cursed during an argument with a neighbor who later complained to police, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.Bogday has been in jail for 13 months and Turkish President Abdullah Gul has asked Saudi King Abdullah to spare him. But, the Arab News Daily said it all may rest on arcane interpretations of Islamic religious law by fundamentalist Muslim judges.In a nation ruled by a strict Wahhabi brand of Islamic justice, public beheadings can be handed out for crimes including murder, rape and heresy. A lawyer says some judges consider it heresy and infidelity to take God's name in vain, and rule that the accused cannot repent. Others see it as disbelief, allowing the accused to retract what he has said and repent.

BALTIMORE, April 11 (UPI) -- A controversial opponent of same-sex marriage withdrew as the graduation speaker at Johns Hopkins University after students at the Baltimore school objected.Citing national media attention to his belief in traditional marriage, Dr. Ben Carson voluntarily withdrew as commencement speaker, The Washington Post reported Wednesday."My presence is likely to distract from the true celebratory nature of the day," Carson said in an email to Paul Rothman, dean of the Johns Hopkins medical school. "Commencement is about the students, and it is not about me."In a TV interview two weeks ago in which he supported traditional marriage as a "fundamental pillar of society," Carson said gays, pedophiles or people who practice bestiality "don't get to change the definition" of marriage.He later apologized for the remarks, but students petitioned to have him removed as commencement speaker.In his email, Carson said he was a victim of political correctness and expressed hope "the emphasis on political correctness will decrease and we will start emphasizing rational discussion of differences so we can actually resolve problems and chart a course that is inclusive of everyone."Carson announced last month he is retiring as head of the Johns Hopkins Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery.
