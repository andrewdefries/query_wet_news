BEIJING, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- South Korea and Japan said they are seeking alternative sources of oil to comply with U.S. demands that nations cut back on imports from Iran.Given Asia's dependence on oil from the Middle East, however, their cooperation is tentative. On Thursday, the South Korean government said it would look for alternative sources but insisted it would not sever ties with Iran completely, The New York Times reported Saturday.The government of Japan has expressed concern over the policy, but the president of JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corp., Yasushi Kimura, said the company, the largest oil refiner in Japan, was discussing increasing imports from Saudi Arabia and other nations.China is possibly on board with the sanctions the United States is using to pressure Iran to cease work on an alleged nuclear weapons program.U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is scheduled to visit China and Japan next week with a discussion of Iran high on his to-do list, the Treasury Department announced."It's a global chess game," said energy historian Daniel Yergin. "The major buyers are prudently beginning to make alternative plans to reduce their reliance on Iranian oil."China has already reduced the amount of oil it imports from Iran, but it is unclear if this is due to a price dispute or to comply with the international effort to pressure Tehran.Currently, 11 percent of China's oil comes from Iran."The Chinese have definitely cut back on long-term contracts, but we don't know exactly why. They may feel they will be able to buy cheaper on short-term markets if Iran were to lose its European customers," said Andy Lipow, an oil industry analyst in Houston.

In the wake of a suicide bomb attack Tuesday on a crowded Jerusalem city bus that killed 19 people and wounded at least 70 more, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, took credit for the blast.Israeli officials called it the deadliest attack in Jerusalem in six years.Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon immediately vowed to fight "Palestinian terror" and summoned his cabinet to decide on a military response to the organization that Sharon had once described as "the deadliest terrorist group that we have ever had to face."Active in Gaza and the West Bank, Hamas wants to liberate all of Palestine and establish a radical Islamic state in place of Israel. It is has gained notoriety with its assassinations, car bombs and other acts of terrorism.But Sharon left something out.Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat, but, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials, beginning in the late 1970s, Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years.Israel "aided Hamas directly -- the Israelis wanted to use it as a counterbalance to the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization)," said Tony Cordesman, Middle East analyst for the Center for Strategic Studies.Israel's support for Hamas "was a direct attempt to divide and dilute support for a strong, secular PLO by using a competing religious alternative," said a former senior CIA official.According to documents United Press International obtained from the Israel-based Institute for Counter Terrorism, Hamas evolved from cells of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928. Islamic movements in Israel and Palestine were "weak and dormant" until after the 1967 Six Day War in which Israel scored a stunning victory over its Arab enemies.After 1967, a great part of the success of the Hamas/Muslim Brotherhood was due to their activities among the refugees of the Gaza Strip. The cornerstone of the Islamic movements success was an impressive social, religious, educational and cultural infrastructure, called Da'wah, that worked to ease the hardship of large numbers of Palestinian refugees, confined to camps, and many who were living on the edge. "Social influence grew into political influence," first in the Gaza Strip, then on the West Bank, said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.According to ICT papers, Hamas was legally registered in Israel in 1978 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the movement's spiritual leader, as an Islamic Association by the name Al-Mujamma al Islami, which widened its base of supporters and sympathizers by religious propaganda and social work. According to U.S. administration officials, funds for the movement came from the oil-producing states and directly and indirectly from Israel. The PLO was secular and leftist and promoted Palestinian nationalism. Hamas wanted to set up a transnational state under the rule of Islam, much like Khomeini's Iran.What took Israeli leaders by surprise was the way the Islamic movements began to surge after the Iranian revolution, after armed resistance to Israel sprang up in southern Lebanon vis-à-vis the Hezbollah, backed by Iran, these sources said."Nothing provides the energy for imitation as much as success," commented one administration expert.A further factor of Hamas' growth was the fact the PLO moved its base of operations to Beirut in the '80s, leaving the Islamic organization to grow in influence in the Occupied Territories "as the court of last resort," he said.When the intifada began, Israeli leadership was surprised when Islamic groups began to surge in membership and strength. Hamas immediately grew in numbers and violence. The group had always embraced the doctrine of armed struggle, but the doctrine had not been practiced and Islamic groups had not been subjected to suppression the way groups like Fatah had been, according to U.S. government officials.But with the triumph of the Khomeini revolution in Iran, with the birth of Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorism in Lebanon, Hamas began to gain in strength in Gaza and then in the West Bank, relying on terror to resist the Israeli occupation.Israel was certainly funding the group at that time. One U.S. intelligence source who asked not to be named said that not only was Hamas being funded as a "counterweight" to the PLO, Israeli aid had another purpose: "To help identify and channel towards Israeli agents Hamas members who were dangerous terrorists."In addition, by infiltrating Hamas, Israeli informers could only listen to debates on policy and identify Hamas members who "were dangerous hard-liners," the official said.In the end, as Hamas set up a very comprehensive counterintelligence system, many collaborators with Israel were weeded out and shot. Violent acts of terrorism became the central tenet, and Hamas, unlike the PLO, was unwilling to compromise in any way with Israel, refusing to acquiesce in its very existence.But even then, some in Israel saw some benefits to be had in trying to continue to give Hamas support: "The thinking on the part of some of the right-wing Israeli establishment was that Hamas and the others, if they gained control, would refuse to have any part of the peace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place," said a U.S. government official who asked not to be named."Israel would still be the only democracy in the region for the United States to deal with," he said.All of which disgusts some former U.S. intelligence officials."The thing wrong with so many Israeli operations is that they try to be too sexy," said former CIA official Vincent Cannestraro.According to former State Department counter-terrorism official Larry Johnson, "the Israelis are their own worst enemies when it comes to fighting terrorism." "The Israelis are like a guy who sets fire to his hair and then tries to put it out by hitting it with a hammer.""They do more to incite and sustain terrorism than curb it," he said.Aid to Hamas may have looked clever, "but it was hardly designed to help smooth the waters," he said. "An operation like that gives weight to President George Bush's remark about there being a crisis in education."Cordesman said that a similar attempt by Egyptian intelligence to fund Egypt's fundamentalists had also come to grief because of "misreading of the complexities." An Israeli defense official was asked if Israel had given aid to Hamas said, "I am not able to answer that question. I was in Lebanon commanding a unit at the time, besides it is not my field of interest."Asked to confirm a report by U.S. officials that Brig. Gen. Yithaq Segev, the military governor of Gaza, had told U.S. officials he had helped fund "Islamic movements as a counterweight to the PLO and communists," the official said he could confirm only that he believed Segev had served back in 1986.The Israeli Embassy press office referred UPI to its Web site when asked to comment.

BAMAKO, Mali, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- Islamic extremists destroyed instruments and threatened to cut out the tongues of singers as creative expression is stamped out across Mali, musicians said.Foreign rebel groups and militants associated with al-Qaida seized control of northern Mali this year following a series of political upheavals. Human rights groups have accused rebels of war crimes, and now some musicians are saying the rebels are banning all music that isn't set to Koranic verses, The Washington Post reported Friday.Khaira Arby, one of the country's most celebrated musicians, told the Post religious extremists broke into her house and destroyed her instruments because her voice was a threat to Islam."They told my neighbors that if they ever caught me, they would cut my tongue out," she said.In Malian society, music is integral to important milestones in life -- from births, circumcisions and weddings, to prayers for rain, the Post reported."In northern Mali, music is like oxygen," said Baba Salah, one of northern Mali's most-respected musicians. "Now, we cannot breathe."

CALEDONIA, Ill., Feb. 4 (UPI) -- A trio of Illinois waitresses given $5,000 tips by a customer said the woman told them she was sent by God to help them.Amy Sabani, 25, Sarah Seckinger, 23, and Amber Kariolich, 28, said they had been sorting silverware at the Boone County Family Restaurant in Caledonia Saturday and chatting about their student loans, school ambitions and other financial matters when a female customer approached them with three $5,000 checks, the Rockford (Ill.) Register Star reported Tuesday."I want you girls to take these to help with school and everything else in life," the waitresses quoted the woman as saying. "Yes, you can take it. You put that in your pocket. God sent me here to help you."The waitresses said the woman, whose name they did not reveal, would not let them refuse the money.Matt Nebiu, owner of the restaurant, said he had seen the woman in the restaurant before, but she isn't a regular."I've never seen anything like this in 30-something years here," Nebiu said. "I've heard of it in other places, but not in this town or this area."

| License Photo	OSTRAVA, Czech Republic, Jan. 31 (UPI) -- Robin Haase posted a five-set win that allowed the Netherlands to leave Friday's play with a 1-1 tie against the Czech Republic in a Davis Cup first round.The Czech Republic is looking to be the first team to win three consecutive Davis Cup titles since the United States won five in a row over 1968-72.Haase grabbed the first point of this weekend's best-of-five series for the Dutch with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-1 decision over Radek Stepanek. World No. 7-ranked Tomas Berdych then made short work of Igor Sijsling, winning 6-3, 6-3, 6-0, and evened the match.Haase won just six more points than Stepanek in taking the fourth set but claimed almost two-thirds of those in the fifth set to outlast Stepanek and improve to 17-7 in Davis Cup singles matches.Stepanek has been a mainstay for the Czechs in their two titles runs -- but just as important has been Berdych, who didn't face a break point in his win Friday over Sijsling. Berdych dropped just 10 points in 12 games serving. He is 27-13 in Davis Cup singles.The Netherlands nominated a doubles team of Thiemo de Bakker and Jean-Julien Rojer to go against Czechs Lukas Rosol and Jiri Vesely in Saturday doubles match. But the Czechs often insert Berdych and Stepanek into the doubles match so a switch could be coming.They are also scheduled for Sunday when Berdych and Haas are to be the first match of reverse singles with Stepanek and Sijsling to follow.The winner of the Netherlands-Czech Republic series earns a spot in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against either Canada or Japan, which are tied 1-1 in their series this weekend. The quarterfinals are scheduled for April 4-6.

KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo, April 3 (UPI) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo signed an agreement with the United Nations to address rape as a weapon of war, a U.N. envoy on sexual violence said.Zainab Hawa Bangura, U.N. special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, said challenges to address the issue in DRC remained severe."I am concerned about the scale of sexual violence in conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but I have also been encouraged by the steps taken by the government and the work being done by the U.N. and other international and national actors," she said in a statement.The International Criminal Court last year issued an arrest warrant for DRC rebel leader Bosco Ntaganda on charges including rape and sexual slavery. He surrendered to the court in March.Bangura met in DRC with British Foreign Minister William Hague, who said the consequences of sexual violence in the country were unimaginable."The Congo cannot let its image be tarnished and taken hostage by criminals committing sexual violence," she added.The U.N. Security Council authorized an intervention brigade for its peacekeeping mission in DRC that has the authority to take on armed groups in the country. DRC rebels seized eastern territory last year and violence has since resurfaced.

Pope: End Syrian strifeVATICAN CITY, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- Pope Benedict XVI called for an end to fighting in Syria and the leader of the Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem called Christmas the "birth" of Palestine."I appeal for an end to the bloodshed, easier access for the relief of refugees and the displaced," Benedict said during his Christmas message, known as the Urbi et Orbi.Since an anti-government uprising in the country started in March 2011, about 45,000 people have died, the United Nations has estimated."May peace spring up for the people of Syria, deeply wounded and divided by a conflict which does not spare even the defenseless and reaps innocent victims," the pope said.Midnight Mass in Vatican City was held two hours early at St. Peter's Square to avoid tiring the 85-year-old pope, the BBC reported.In Bethlehem, Fouad Twal, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Jerusalem, said Christmas "is also a celebration of ... the birth of the state of Palestine."Twal alluded to the U.N. recognition of the Palestinian Authority as an independent sovereign state, Arutz Sheva reported. In November, the United Nations passed a resolution granting Palestine the status of a non-member observer state, similar to that of the Vatican.Syrian opposition says chemicals usedDAMASCUS, Syria, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- Syrian opposition groups say they have documented 18 incidents in which the regime has used chemical weapons. Quoting unnamed opposition elements in Syria, Israel Radio said Tuesday chemical weapons were used in the Damascus, Idlib, Homs and Hama areas, and are of a kind of gas not known to be in the regime's chemical weapons supply. The report said no international body has been able to certify the claims. Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon told Army Radio Israel is unable to confirm the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime."We do not have confirmation or proof that chemicals weapons have already been used," he said.The Russian embassy in Damascus said it is checking the reports, the Voice of Russia and the Interfax news agency said.Embassy spokesman Sergei Markov was quoted as saying the embassy "hasn't received any reports of this kind. We are looking into this information."Policeman injured in protests diesNEW DELHI, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- An Indian policeman, injured in protests related to the gang rape of a New Delhi student, died Tuesday, police said.Subhash Chand Tomar, 47, was injured Sunday when the continuing protests over the Dec. 16 gang rape of the 23-year-old woman in a moving bus turned violent. The condition of the rape victim, who was critically injured by six rapists, had deteriorated Monday night, her doctors said. Her condition was described as being "very serious and very critical."Thousands of protesters in New Delhi have been demonstrating at the sprawling India Gate war memorial area since the rape, forcing authorities to virtually shutdown several areas of the Indian capital.Tomar had been on ventilator after he was admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.Snowboarder killed by avalanche in SierrasTRUCKEE, Calif., Dec. 25 (UPI) -- A body found Monday under 2 feet of snow in California is believed to be that of a snowboarder who vanished during an avalanche, authorities said. The avalanche hit a skiing and snowboarding area at the Donner Ski Ranch near Lake Tahoe in the Sierras at about 9:30 a.m., KXTV in Sacramento reported. An employee said a skier reported a friend had disappeared while snowboarding in the area. Four hours after the avalanche, a dog belonging to the ski patrol identified what turned out to be the place where the missing man was buried. His body was under 2 to 3 feet of snow. Nevada County Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Jakobs said the identity of the man would not be released until family had been notified.Actor Charles Durning dies at 89NEW YORK, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- U.S. actor Charles Durning died of natural causes in New York. He was 89.With two Oscar nominations for a supporting role, including "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" and "To Be or Not to Be," Though not a household name, Durning appeared in numerous theater productions, movies and television films, The New York Times said.He was the crooked cop in the 1973 movie "The Sting," a dedicated assistant football coach in "North Dallas Forty," and a power broker in "True Confessions." He could play gruff, funny, combative or gentle, the newspaper said. Durning had numerous television credits and received nine Emmy nominations but never won.

MIAMI, Oct. 4 (UPI) -- Tropical Storm Karen was weakening in the Gulf of Mexico Friday, but the White House said federal resources are preparing to deal with the storm if necessary.Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami dropped a hurricane watch from the mouth of the Pearl River to Destin, Fla., replacing it with a tropical storm watch. Hurricane watches posted elsewhere were also discontinued, the center said.A tropical storm warning was in effect for Morgan City, La., to the mouth of the Pearl River, and a tropical storm watch was posted for metropolitan New Orleans, Lake Maurepas, Lake Ponchartrain in Louisiana and from the mouth of the Pearl River to Indian Pass, Fla.Karen, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, was about 205 miles south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River and 230 miles south of Morgan City, La., moving north-northwest at 7 mph, the NHC said in its 10 p.m. CDT advisory.Karen was forecast to turn north with a decrease in forward speed Saturday before gradually turning to the northeast and gaining forward speed Sunday. On its forecast track, the center is expected to be near the coast within the tropical storm warning area Saturday night.Tropical storm conditions may occur in portions of the warning area Saturday afternoon.The combination of storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising water, forecasters said. Karen was expected to produce 4-8 inches of rain over portions of the central and eastern Gulf Coast through Sunday. Isolated amounts of as much as 12 inches of rain were possible.White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Friday President Barack Obama has been briefed on preparations for the storm."To ensure that needs are met based on applicable legal requirements and consistent with its contingency plan, [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] is recalling certain currently furloughed employees necessary to serve functions of the agency that protect life and property in preparation for the potential impacts of extreme weather, including Tropical Storm Karen in the Gulf of Mexico and severe weather in the central United States," Carney said.He said FEMA has activated its National Response Coordination Center in Washington and is "in close contact with local officials in potentially affected areas."
