DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 15 (UPI) -- A U.S. automobile executive said Ford Motor Company was reviewing vehicle mileage tests in the wake of a challenge to ratings listed for two hybrid cars.Automobile companies test their own fuel efficiency following federal procedures. But last week, Consumer Reports said it found the mileage ratings listed for the Ford C-Max hybrid wagon and the Fusion hybrid to be well off the mark. The C-Max, tested by the consumer magazine, achieved 37 miles per gallon, ten miles per gallon less than what was on the sticker. Consumer Reports said the Fusion achieved 39 mpg. It is also listed as able to achieve 47 mpg in fuel efficiency.Although an Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson declined to comment on whether it was discussing the tests with automakers, Ford's global product chief Raj Nair said, "We are working closely with industry to see if we need to change our hybrid testing procedures," The Wall Street Journal reported.Nair said mileage testing for hybrids was far trickier than testing a conventional gasoline-powered engine due to the many variables that come into play.The expression, "your mileage may differ," is particularly true for hybrids, Nair said.The variables include how fast a driver accelerates and what speed is maintained. The temperature outside also changes mileage for cars using battery power, he said.Fuel efficiency can also change depending on how many of the miles are driven on a highway and how many are driven under city conditions, the same as gas-powered cars. However, for hybrids it also depends how many of the highway miles were driven with the batteries running.If the batteries run first with the gasoline engine kicking in as electric power wanes, then a hybrid would get higher efficiency going from highway driving in the first part of a trip to city driving in the second part than it would if it traveled in the city first and on a highway second.Testing by Ford, following EPA recommendations, was done on stationary machine that simulates highway and city conditions. Consumer Reports, on the other hand, hits the road, testing cars on rolling hills, holding to a steady 65 mph when it tests cars on highways.

MCLEAN, Va., Oct. 15 (UPI) -- A new corporate name has been adopted by two companies that provide contract and acquisition support to the U.S. government.XL Inc. and Alon Inc., which merged last April, are now known as XLA."We are excited to come together today under a distinctive new name, XLA," said the company's chief executive officer, Lloyd Mustin. "The brand is a melding of two great company names and signifies the smooth transition to a new company culture in the six months since our merger. "Our customers should continue to expect outstanding work from XLA as we move forward under our new banner," he said. Along with a name, XLA features a new logo and website."Both companies have long been committed to delivering the highest quality service and work ethic, so it is fitting that XLA will be identified with the phrase Excellence Always," said Bill Weber, XLA president. "That is the ideal on which we are building our reputation, and we intend to live up to those words." Alion and XL, for nearly 30 decades, has worked with more than two dozen federal agencies for procurement of goods and services and in program management.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (UPI) -- She has impaled her last bloodsucker: "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" hung up her sharpened stake Tuesday after seven spectacular TV seasons and an astonishing impact on the American psyche.The show was technically innovative in no way. Despite its somewhat explicit subject matter it broke no taboos or so-called "new ground" that B horror movies have not done for many generations. Its acting, apart from its amazing star Sarah Michelle Gellar, was competent but not cosmic and was not required to be. Even its much-touted model of female empowerment, while highly significant, was an evolution rather than a revolution, building on the success of the equally alluring and martially invincible "Xena: Warrior Princess" with Lucy Lawless before it.Yet "Buffy" rated a farewell editorial appreciation in the editorial column of the New York Times Wednesday and the tribute was not misplaced. For if fiction is, as the great European semiotics scholar and novelist Umberto Eco said, a machine to generate multiple meanings then "Buffy" qualifies triumphantly. No American television series over the past decade, not even Matt Groening's still-magical "Simpsons" on Fox, not even "Friends" captured the confident, post-modernist teenager Zeitgeist of the Nineties so unerringly well.But "Buffy" with its perfect-proportion mix of comedy, satire and horror -- matched as skillfully as any bartender ever mixed a dry martini -- went far beyond that. The darker tone of the show's last few seasons perfectly matched the truly sinister shadows inexorably gathering over American life since the terrorist catastrophes of "9/11."In that respect, let us pray that "Buffy's" season finale will not prove prophetic -- which would be yet another ironic twist for a show which regularly outraged the more humorless guardians of public morality, not with its content, but with its mythical horror themes and symbolism.For Buffy's swan song did not disappoint. The show bowed out on an apocalyptic scale. The armies of hell in numbers sufficient to impress devotees of "Lord of the Rings" erupted in a final bid to engulf Sunnydale and the entire world. Buffy herself survived as did her Inner Circle supporting cast over the past seven seasons. But many Slayerettes did not. And the entire town of Sunnydale -- now as beloved and detailed a mythical location as the London of Sherlock Holmes or the Oxford of Inspector Morse -- instead went the way of J. R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth -- convulsed in cataclysm.The end symbolism, with Buffy and her friends escaping to safety by the skin of their teeth in a school bus was indeed a potent mixture of nightmares: the Columbine school massacre mixed with the destruction of the World Trade Towers. Nothing was left of Sunnydale -- that quintessential California suburban community -- except a raw, ugly and gaping hole in the ground. As the Hellmouth beneath the school imploded upon itself, Buffy herself survived only by leaping from building to building and then on to the top of rumbling old school bus while the earth swallowed all inches behind her. The images were eerily reflective of the crowds fleeing the crumbling dust clouds of the crumbling Twin Towers on Black Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001. Like "The Simpsons"' Groening, Buffy's creator and guiding genius Joss Whedon never sacrificed the purity or consistency of his vision for anything. The biggest joke of the series was not a joke at all. As has been -- and no doubt will continue to be -- endlessly noted, the monstrous vampire, bloodsucking nightmares haunting Sunnydale High School were a perfect metaphor for the genuine death traps of AIDS, violence and drugs stalking America's children in the superficially idyllic 1990s.For that decade, like the Fifties and the Twenties before it, saw superficial confidence, peace and prosperity rest uneasily like a thin crust over existential dread.Whedon intuited this perfectly from the word go. The critical reward he harvested from this seedling insight was a series that distilled the angst generated by this contradiction and crystallized it in the petty, comfortable social realities of the time, just as Sinclair Lewis located Babbitt and Philip K. Dick his existential wanderers in time and place in their defining small town American locales.At the end, this was all gone, as completely as the Great Depression annihilated Babbitt's Twenties Arcadia or one of Dick's innumerable nuclear holocausts was revealed to have obliterated the Fifties dream worlds of his protagonists. As Buffy and her friends noted in the shows surreal closing moments even the Starbucks and The Gap stores were gone. The Nineties were over at last!The end of the show generated enough new meanings to gladden Umberto Eco's heart. Buffy lives! Yet she is Vampire-Slayer no more. And she has had to bury some of the most cherished relationships of adolescence behind her.James Marsters haunting Spike died at the end, imploding the Hellmouth. Buffy finally told him she loved him. And Spike saw through the merciful lie, but thanked her for saying it anyway. Buffy, Willow and Xander were free at last to get on with their lives. But to do what? Surely everything else would be doomed forever to be a gray anti-climax after all that went before? That terrifying delusion is all too convincing when you are only 18 or 21 and about to step on the stage of your real life, as some of us still vaguely remember.At the end, as indeed was true throughout the show's epic run, the values and social examples set were the opposite of subversive. They were surprisingly wholesome, and even heroic. (It was no coincidence or minor thing that Buffy always wore a crucifix. That symbolism was never subversive. It was meant to matter.) Buffy saw her friends die in the horror of war, but not a meaningless war -- a war essential for the survival of all that was decent, just and good. It was an all too obvious and prescient metaphor for the evolving American zeitgeist since "9/11."And -- in the most revealingly moving touch of all -- those spoiled, insular, ridiculously petty Valley kids fought, sacrificed and died with an amazing courage and grace that surprised even themselves. It was as if "Friends" or the Fab Four of "Seinfeld" had suddenly morphed into "Band of Brothers."Now "Buffy" is gone while NBC's pompous, melodramatic, self-important "West Wing" staggers on for another season. "West Wing" reaped the critical plaudits and Emmies, yet its vision of the Executive Mansion was childishly self-indulgent and plain ludicrous. "Buffy", which never aspired to the imposing alleged factual accuracy of "West Wing" was obvious and unapologetic teen fantasy. Yet it caught and expressed inner truth. This is the way we lived.These were our fears. And this is how we dealt with them.One doubts whether coming generations of Americans will ever turn to reruns of "The West Wing" as they do to "The Honeymooners" or "Star Trek". But they will certainly watch "Buffy." Farewell, Vampire-Slayer! We won't forget you!

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UPI) -- The U.S. Justice and Commerce departments announced the creation of a National Commission on Forensic Science to guide local law enforcement nationwide.The 30-member commission will focus on creating national standards for certification, training and best practices for forensic crime labs across the country. It will serve as a resource for forensic scientists, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges in cases where "CSI" -- crime scene investigation -- technology is at issue."Forensic science is an essential tool in the administration of justice and needs to be continually evaluated as science progresses," said Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole. "Forensic science helps identify perpetrators, convict the guilty, exonerate the innocent, and protect public safety. This initiative is led by the principle that scientifically valid and accurate forensic analysis strengthens all aspects of our justice system." The Justice Department's representatives on the commission will seek to create a framework for labs to follow and institute common practices for all crime labs, a government release said.

UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 14 (UPI) -- There may still be crimes committed in the Sudanese region of Darfur that may be a concern for the international courts, the ICC prosecutor said.Fatou Bensouda, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, told the U.N. Security Council that there remains a general lack of progress in prosecuting those responsible for war crimes in Darfur. Crimes are still being committed there, she said."I must reiterate that these alleged ongoing crimes, similar to those already considered by the judges of the International Criminal Court on five separate applications, may constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide," she said.Khartoum is obligated to cooperate with the ICC under the terms of a U.N. Security Council Resolution passed in 2005, though it's not party to the Rome Statute that created the court in The Hague.Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is the subject of a 2009 arrest warrant issued by the ICC for war crimes committed in Darfur. An estimated 300,000 people have died there as a result of fighting between rebel forces and the government-supported Janjaweeed militia.Several former government ministers and rebel leaders are at large and subject to ICC warrants."It should be clear to this council that the government of Sudan is neither prepared to hand over the suspects nor to prosecute them for their crimes," said Bensouda.

ATLANTA, Nov. 12 (UPI) -- A woman forcefully held by Jacksonville, Fla., police while she was in premature labor may sue for unlawful arrest but not for excessive force, a court ruled.Melanie Dawn Williams, 28, was seven months pregnant and driving to a hospital on doctor's orders in 2005 when she ran a red light, a police report said.Two officers chased her to the hospital, tackled her in the emergency room and dragged her, handcuffed, back outside, the report said.Eventually a nurse came outside, found Williams bleeding from premature labor and insisted she be taken to the hospital's labor and delivery unit, where doctors successfully staved off labor.She spent 10 days in the hospital. The officers were disciplined, The (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union reported.One officer told internal affairs investigators Williams hadn't mentioned being pregnant until they handcuffed her, but a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said that didn't matter.It said that once they knew Williams was in medical distress, police had no right to make an arrest.But the judges said Williams could not pursue a separate excessive-force claim."Although we agree ... that the deputies' behavior was reprehensible, we disagree that the evidence supports a finding that the force was excessive," the judges said.The appeals court sent the case back to Jacksonville for further proceedings.

| License Photo	CHICAGO, Aug. 8 (UPI) -- A federal appeals court in Chicago ruled 2-1 Monday not to remove former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a defendant in a torture lawsuit.The suit was brought by two employees of Shield Group Security, Nathan Vance and Nathan Ertel, who say they were imprisoned in Iraq without charge and tortured by the U.S. military for three months after they alleged their company was paying off local officials for contracts.In 2006, the two men "were released from military custody without ever being charged with a crime. They then filed this suit for violations of their constitutional rights against ... Rumsfeld and other unknown defendants" under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the majority opinion said. "Plaintiffs seek damages from Secretary Rumsfeld and others for their roles in creating and carrying out policies that caused plaintiffs' alleged torture."Rumsfeld and the U.S. government moved to dismiss the claims, but a U.S. judge in Chicago allowed the claims for torture to proceed, citing the Fifth Amendment's substantive due process clause."We agree with the district court (judge) that the plaintiffs may proceed with their ... claims against Secretary Rumsfeld," the majority opinion said. "Taking the issues in ascending order of breadth, we agree first, applying the standards of (the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) that plaintiffs have alleged in sufficient detail facts supporting Secretary Rumsfeld's personal responsibility for the alleged torture. Second, we agree with the district court (judge) that Secretary Rumsfeld is not entitled to qualified immunity on the pleadings."The opinion said under U.S. law it "was clearly established in 2006 that the treatment plaintiffs have alleged was unconstitutional. No reasonable public official could have believed otherwise."The men are making "Bivens" claims, named after the Supreme Court ruling in 1971's Bivens vs. Six Unknown Named Agents."Next, we agree with the district court that a Bivens remedy is available for the alleged torture of civilian U.S. citizens by U.S. military personnel in a war zone," the opinion said. "We see no persuasive justification in the Bivens case law or otherwise for defendants' most sweeping argument, which would deprive civilian U.S. citizens of a civil judicial remedy for torture or even cold-blooded murder by federal officials and soldiers, at any level, in a war zone."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 24 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court goes to the dogs next term in two Florida cases involving police canines named Franky and Aldo, and the question: To sniff or not to sniff?Creaky groaners aside, the cases deal with a serious issue. The security of Americans in their homes and vehicles versus how far police can go when using dogs to determine the presence of drugs or other contraband.At stake is not just whether police can use a very effective tool to investigate and arrest felons, but the limits on law enforcement when it subjects anyone, guilty or innocent, to invasive sniffing or other types of surveillance.Supreme Court precedent on police snooping around the home might appear to be all over the map, but it does have a certain logic.In 2001's Kyllo vs. U.S., the high court ruled 5-4 police intrusion has limits. A federal government agent used a "thermal imaging device" to scan a triplex in Florence, Ore., without a warrant to determine whether marijuana was being grown.The scan showed Danny Kyllo's garage was hot compared to the rest of his home and the neighborhood, consistent with the high-intensity lamps typically used for indoor marijuana growing. A federal appeals court ruled the scan constitutional, saying Kyllo had shown no expectation of privacy.But the Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable searches and seizures.The Supreme Court majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, reversed the appeals court, saying when the "government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of a private home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a Fourth Amendment 'search,' and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant."In 2005's Illinois vs. Caballes, the high court ruled 5-3 (a seriously ill Chief Justice William Rehnquist took no part in the case) it was constitutional to make a vehicle search when a drug-sniffing dog alerts officers to contraband during a routine traffic stop.Justice John Paul Stevens, in the majority opinion, said the ruling "is entirely consistent with our recent decision that the use of a thermal-imaging device to detect the growth of marijuana in a home constituted an unlawful search. ... Critical to that decision was the fact that the device was capable of detecting lawful activity -- in that case, intimate details in a home, such as 'at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath.' .... The legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically distinguishable from respondent's hopes or expectations concerning the non-detection of contraband in the trunk of his car. A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment."Justice David Souter led the dissenters."I would hold that using the dog for the purposes of determining the presence of marijuana in the car's trunk was a search unauthorized as an incident of the speeding stop and unjustified on any other ground," he said.In one of the canine Florida cases coming up next term, the justices are being asked to decide whether allowing a dog to drug-sniff at the front door of a suspected grow house "is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause.""Probable cause" to suspect a crime is the threshold allowing a police officer to make an arrest, conduct a search or request a warrant from a judge.The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."Florida's Constitution reinforces that right in almost identical language, and includes a ban "against the unreasonable interception of private communications by any means."In November 2006, the Miami-Dade Police Department received a Crime Stoppers tip that Joelis Jardines was growing marijuana in his house. A month later, a police detective with members of a drug task force that included several U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agents conducted surveillance at Jardines' house.A canine officer went up to the front porch with Franky, who alerted by sitting down. After the dog left, the detective knocked on the door to get consent for a search, without response. He did smell marijuana, court records said, and heard the sound of a constantly running air conditioner -- in the officer's experience, a sign of a drug operation.Using the dog sniff and his own observations, a detective got a search warrant. The officers conducted a search and "seized numerous live marijuana plants. A DEA agent arrested Jardines as he attempted to flee through a rear door of the house," the state's petition to the Supreme Court said.Jardines was charged with trafficking in excess of 25 pounds of cannabis, a first-degree felony, and grand theft for stealing more than $5,000 in electricity from Florida for the grow lights.His lawyer argued the dog sniff and the detective's sniff violated the Fourth Amendment. The trial judge granted a motion to suppress the evidence, saying the initial search was illegal.Though an intermediate court reversed, the Florida Supreme Court also suppressed the evidence, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Illinois vs. Caballes. Where was the probable cause?"First, the dog 'sniff test' that was conducted in the present case was an intrusive procedure," the state supreme court said. " ... [T]he 'sniff test' was a sophisticated undertaking that was the end result of a sustained and coordinated effort by various law enforcement agencies. On the scene, the procedure involved multiple police vehicles, multiple law enforcement personnel, including narcotics detectives and other officers, and an experienced dog handler and trained drug detection dog engaged in a vigorous search effort on the front porch of the residence. Tactical law enforcement personnel from various government agencies, both state and federal, were on the scene for surveillance and backup purposes. The entire on-the-scene government activity -- i.e., the preparation for the 'sniff test,' the test itself and the aftermath, which culminated in the full-blown search of Jardines' home -- lasted for hours. The 'sniff test' apparently took place in plain view of the general public. There was no anonymity for the resident. "Such a public spectacle unfolding in a residential neighborhood will invariably entail a degree of public opprobrium, humiliation and embarrassment for the resident, for such dramatic government activity in the eyes of many -- neighbors, passers-by and the public at large -- will be viewed as an official accusation of crime," the state court opinion said. "Further, if government agents can conduct a dog 'sniff test' at a private residence without any prior evidentiary showing of wrongdoing, there is nothing to prevent the agents from applying the procedure in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner, or based on whim and fancy, at the home of any citizen. Such an open-ended policy invites overbearing and harassing conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that a 'sniff test,' such as the test that was conducted in the present case, is a substantial government intrusion into the sanctity of the home and constitutes a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. As such, it must be preceded by an evidentiary showing of wrongdoing."State officials told the U.S. Supreme Court in a brief besides ignoring Caballes, the Florida Supreme Court created "a new test for whether officers' conduct is a search. Seeking to avoid applying Caballes, the Florida Supreme Court fashioned a new test which focused on the surrounding circumstances rather than properly on the dog sniff itself. This new test, however, violates a plethora of this [U.S. Supreme] Court's Fourth Amendment cases. This court should disavow the Florida Supreme Court's newly formulated Fourth Amendment test."The other Florida dog case involves a valid traffic stop. Clayton Harris was stopped in Liberty County by a sheriff's deputy canine officer for driving on an expired license. The officer's dog Aldo sniffed and alerted for drugs on the driver's side, causing the deputy to search the interior of the car.The deputy said he discovered supplies to manufacture methamphetamine, which Harris admitted to making and using, the state said in a brief. After his lawyer's motion to suppress the evidence at trial was denied, Harris pleaded no contest and was convicted of possessing the restricted chemical pseudoephedrine with intent to use it to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of state law.But the Florida Supreme Court eventually ruled evidence that a dog has been trained and certified to detect narcotics, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish the dog's reliability for determining probable cause. State officials said the Florida court relied heavily on law review articles and an intermediate appellate court's decision in another case, which concluded that an officer who knows that his dog is trained and certified can only suspect that a search based on a dog's alert will yield contraband, and mere suspicion cannot justify a search.By holding a dog alerting to the residual odor of contraband may result in subjecting a person and vehicle to an invasive search when there are no drugs actually present, state officials said, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that a dog sniff is not a search as it only reveals the presence of contraband.The Florida Supreme Court thus effectively negated "the narcotics detection dog as an important crime fighting tool for law enforcement and society," state officials said.Neither case has been scheduled for argument, but will probably be heard some time before Christmas.

With her upcoming clothing line, Kelly Osbourne hopes to make shopping for plus-size clothes a little less miserable of an experience.	Posted By GABRIELLE LEVY, UPI.com | Sept. 5, 2013 at 12:16 PM | Updated Sept. 5, 2013 at 6:27 PM | 0 comments

| License Photo	Sept. 5 (UPI) -- Although she no longer needs them herself, Kelly Osbourne remembers what it's like to be a big girl struggling to find cute clothes in plus sizes.Now the "Fashion Police"-woman says her upcoming line of clothes aims to be all-inclusive, even for the ladies who need a few Xs on their tags."No one takes notice of a fat girl in fashion,” she said. "That’s the truth! It’s sad.""That’s why I love women like Beth Ditto who are doing their own clothes," she continued. "That’s why when my line comes out I’ll never make anything that won’t be translated to plus-size as well. Because everyone deserves to wear fashion."Fashion designers have notoriously struggled to (or just plain ignored) create quality, on-trend clothing for women above about a size 12. But recent efforts to improve plus size options, vary the range of body types shown in fashion magazines -- or at least shame clothes makers into doing better -- may, finally, be having an effect.

Wiki
Joshua David Bell (born 9 December 1967) is an American Grammy Award-winning violinist.
Bell was born in Bloomington, Indiana, United States, the son of a psychologist and a therapist. His mother is Jewish and his father a Christian. Bell's father is the late Alan P. Bell, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Indiana University, in Bloomington, a former Kinsey researcher.
Bell began taking violin lessons at the age of four after his mother discovered her son had taken rubber bands from around the house and stretched them across the handles of his dresser drawer to pluck out music he had heard her play on the piano. His parents got a scaled-to-size violin for their then five-year-old son and started giving him lessons. A bright student, Bell took to the instrument but lived an otherwise normal midwest Indiana life playing video games and excelling at sports, namely tennis and bowling, even placing in a national tennis tournament at the age of ten.
