CANBERRA, Australia, July 2 (UPI) -- Australia's controversial carbon tax, aimed at cutting the country's greenhouse gas emissions, went into effect on Sunday.Under the carbon plan, businesses which emit 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in other greenhouse gases will be charged $24 per ton. The government has identified 294 companies considered to be high emitters.In 2015 it converts to an emissions trading scheme with a floating price starting at a floor of $15.Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Sunday said her administration had "achieved a major milestone in its plan for Australia's clean energy future"She said the carbon price means that in 2020, Australia's carbon pollution will be at least 159 million tons less annually than it would be without the policy, equal to taking 45 million cars off the road.Australia is one of the world's highest per-capita emitters of carbon. "Today we take the next steps the country needs to make to keep our economy competitive, to protect our environment and to provide a cleaner Australia for future generations," she said in a statement.But conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott said that based on the government's own figures, the carbon tax will reduce Australia's gross domestic product by a cumulative total of $1 trillion by 2050, likening it to "shutting down the country for a year."In a statement Sunday, Abbott repeated what he has often said, that if elected -- in Australia's next federal elections that must take place before November 2013 -- he will quickly implement the Coalition's plan to abolish the carbon tax. "Unlike the prime minister, I mean what I say: There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead," Abbott said, referring to Gillard's about-face on the issue after she had said in her 2010 election victory that there would be no carbon tax under her administration.But Abbott's promise has created an environment of uncertainty, particularly in the business community."The questions around whether the scheme will be here in two years' time has stifled investment certainty," Elisa de Wit, head of climate change at law firm Norton Rose told The Guardian newspaper. Although companies are taking the necessary steps to comply with the tax, de Wit said, many of them are reluctant to invest too far into the future. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. cited a Nielsen poll that says two thirds of Australians do not support the tax.An earlier version of a carbon tax, proposed by Gillard's predecessor Kevin Rudd, eventually led to his downfall in June 2010.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- President Obama and some of the seven award recipients were targets of comedians' jokes Sunday night at the Kennedy Center Honors program in Washington. Ray Romano riffed off the President Obama's lackluster first campaign debate."Do you quit when you are down 1 to 0 in the World Series? No, you keep going," Romano said. "Do you quit when you are down 1 to nothing in the debates? No you keep going, you become the president!""It's very surreal that I am talking to the president and first lady ... .I really wish I had voted," he said.The honorees included TV host David Letterman, Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones, actor Dustin Hoffman, ballerina Natalia Makarova and bluesman Buddy Guy. "I lost my virginity to the first 2 minutes of 'Stairway to Heaven,'" Romano said, referring to the long-running Zepplin song. "I apologized for the next 11."Jimmy Kimmel called Letterman a "hero to every one of us in this room with the possible exception of those who came to see the ballerina.""When I was a teenager, Dave was my Justin Bieber," Kimmel said. Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey also feted Letterman, Baldwin with a Top 10 list -- a Letterman staple -- and Fey saying as a kid she couldn't figure out if Letterman was "a parody of a talk show host ... or a Midwestern goon that was just a little bit off."The Led Zeppelin band mates were honored by actor Jack Black who called the group the best band of all time, beloved by everyone "from Oliver Stone to Paul Ryan and everyone in between."Foo Fighters, Lenny Kravitz and Kid Rock performed musical tributes and Marakova was honored by dance performances. Morgan Freeman provided an emotional tribute to Guy, the longtime Chicago blues guitarist. He was followed by musical performances by Tracy Chapman, Jeff Beck and Bonnie Raitt.

WALFERDANGE, Luxembourg, April 16 (UPI) -- Being able to connect using social media, older frail people who are often forgotten are able to have some emotional contact, researchers in Luxembourg say. Dr. Anja Leist from the University of Luxembourg said with the rise of user-friendly devices such as tablets and other Web-enabled devices, older adults now engage more with online social networks, discussion boards and online forums. With successful use of a computer or Web-enabled device, older adults report enhanced feelings of control and self-efficacy, Leist said. "For me, it was interesting to learn that there is evidence for a large potential of social media in clinical practice. Older adults can use social media to access health-related information and engage in patient-to-patient or patient-doctor conversations," Leist said in a statement. "There are many online forums where people in difficult life situations, such as informal caregivers of a spouse with dementia or individuals with depression, can exchange thoughts as well as receive and provide social support. Other positive consequences are that lonely older adults can overcome loneliness through contact to family and friends and other users with similar interests."However, the negative consequences of social media use for older adults have yet to be investigated such as access to harmful information and misuse of personal data. The findings were published in the journal Gerontology.

FRESNO, Calif., May 19 (UPI) -- Police said they listened to two California men plan and carry out a car burglary when one of the men accidentally dialed 911 on his cellphone.It appeared a so-called butt dial landed the pair in jail after Fresno police followed the clues they overheard to the crime scene, ABCNews.com said Sunday."I have never heard of something like this," Police Sgt. Jaime Rios said. "There have been times where the dispatcher hears something like this, but never has a call come in before a crime being committed and staying on all the way to the end."Nathan Teklemariam and Carson Reinhart, both 20, allegedly spoke about scoring drugs as they drove around with the 911 dispatcher listening in.One of the voices on the phone mentioned having a hammer ready. A short time later, the sound of breaking glass was heard and one man reported finding a bottle of prescription medication.

CALGARY, Alberta, May 10 (UPI) -- The Keystone XL oil pipeline planned for the United States will have state-of-the-art leak detection systems on its network, a spokesman said.Pipeline planner TransCanada is awaiting a U.S. federal decision to build its pipeline to carry so-called tar sands oil to southern U.S. oil refineries.Critics of the pipeline worry that the type of oil designated for the pipeline is more corrosive than regular crude oil and therefore more likely to lead to a spill.TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard said issues raised by the Environmental Protection Agency and others didn't take the company's commitment to safety very seriously."Keystone XL will have a state-of-the-art leak detection system, and we will also evaluate new and evolving leak detection technologies to potentially augment the best-in-class leak detection capabilities of its current systems," he said.Since TransCanada started the review process roughly four years ago, spills in Michigan and Arkansas have raised concerns about pipeline safety. The Michigan oil spill in 2010 caused about 20,000 barrels of tar sands oil to seep into the surrounding environment. The March rupture of the Pegasus oil pipeline caused about 5,000 barrels of oil to leak.There have been roughly a dozen spills from the existing Keystone pipeline.Howard said TransCanada invested more than $1.4 billion in leak prevention technology from 2011-12.

| License Photo	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 29 (UPI) -- Will Power won the rain-delayed Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg Monday, picking up his second IndyCar victory in as many races.Power, who started from the pole position, was especially sharp in the second half of the 100-lap race. He grabbed the lead in the 74th lap and didn't trail after that.He finished 0.8 seconds ahead of Justin Wilson, driving for Dreyer and Reinbold Racing, with Power's Penske teammates Ryan Briscoe and Helio Castroneves third and fourth, respectively. Briscoe, who started in the 19th slot, set a race record by improving 13 places from start to finish.The race was postponed Sunday when rain left the street course under 4 inches of water.Power also won the season-opening race two weeks ago in Brazil. He is the first driver to win the first two IndyCar races of the season since Sam Hornish Jr. in 2001.

| License Photo	FRANKFURT, Germany, May 21 (UPI) -- For once Russian President Vladimir Putin got it right; it wasn't worth turning up at Camp David for the Group of Eight summit.On the most urgent issue of the day, one that has already cost global stock markets $4 trillion and which threatens a recession that could make 2008 look like a bump in the road, they simply agreed to differ. Their bland communique concluded with pious hopes that Greece should remain within the euro and an agreement "that the right measures are not the same for each of us."This is diplomat-speak for German Chancellor Angela Merkel digging in her heels and refusing any thought of a joint eurobond backed by the full weight of Germany and all the other eurozone partners. However beneficial the euro has been for the wondrous German industrial machine, Merkel stands firm on her conviction that European solidarity has its limits.Even the combined pressure of the other Western leaders at the G8 summit didn't move her. U.S. President Barack Obama stressed that the eurozone crisis was "of extraordinary importance." Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, the only trained economist among them and who was asked to lead the discussion Saturday morning on the global economy, stressed the need to restore demand, saying, "I think we should regard it more positively than the most conservative European authorities do."Grexit, the vogue term for a Greek exit from the euro, is slowly but surely becoming inevitable. The implications, for Europe and the global economy, are deeply alarming.A study by Barclays last week suggested that the immediate costs of a Grexit would be $371.5 billion for the eurozone members, of which Germany would be liable for around $108 billion, France for $80.8 billion, Italy for $71.5 billion and Spain for $47 billion.The first point here is that Spain, currently paying more than 6 percent interest to borrow money, doesn't have the $47 billion, and Italy, current paying almost 6 percent, would be very hard put to find it. And the new government of France's Francois Hollande would also face extreme difficulty.The second point thus follows; a Grexit wouldn't stop with Greece. The level of uncertainty such a disaster would inspire in world markets would freeze a great deal of economic activity. Banks would stop lending to one another, companies would stop investing, consumers would slow their spending as they all waited to see which would be the next shoe to drop. Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy would all come immediately into the crosshairs.Mark Cliffe of the ING finance group has looked at a best-case and worst-case scenario. Under the best case, in which a Grexit is sealed off from the rest of the eurozone and the European Central Bank floods the zone with money to keep the other target countries afloat, he sees a minimum 2 percent fall in output across Europe over the next two years. That would worsen unemployment, deficits and debts.Under the worst-case scenario, a disorderly breakup of the eurozone, Cliffe sees German output falling a dramatic 7 percent and, even outside the euro, British output dropping 5 percent.Given the latest reports of depositors moving money out of Spanish and Italian banks, this is probably optimistic. Assume that the European Central Bank does step in (since if it didn't, a Spanish debt default becomes horribly probable). The sums required to refinance Portuguese, Spanish and Italian and possibly French debts as they come due quickly head north from $1.27 trillion.So at the same time, the eurozone's national governments would be forced to find new money to bail out their stricken commercial banks, and they would have to find it from the European Central Bank. That sends the demands on the ECB heading north to $2.5 trillion.At the same time, governments have to finance national budget deficits or cut spending by draconian sums. The whole of Europe would be facing the dismal Greek spiral of rising unemployment and social misery, leading to lower tax revenues and bigger deficits. The ECB is now looking at something more than $3.8 trillion. Surging inflation would be just one result. And Angela Merkel could forget any prospect of re-election next year.And of course Europe isn't alone. The collapse in Europe's imports from China (the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Europe has dropped 40 percent since August) is intensifying the slowdown in China. The Chinese property bubble is deflating fast, with real estate sales in the first quarter of this year down 14.6 percent from a year earlier, a residential sales down 17.5 percent, even as the floor space for sale rose 47 percent. Foreign funding for Chinese property development was down 91 percent in March and 81 percent in April.The G8 meeting just inched up to the abyss but the world leaders involved refused to open their eyes. Operating on a political timetable, Angela Merkel says she is now waiting for the next Greek election next month. The markets may not be so patient.

| License Photo	NEWTOWN, Conn., Dec. 21 (UPI) -- The nation observed a moment of silence Friday to honor the victims of the Newtown, Conn., mass killing a week ago in which 27 people were fatally shot.As three more victims were to be buried, the head of the National Rifle Association blamed violence on the entertainment industry and called for federally funded armed police officers in every U.S. school.Adam Lanza burst into Sandy Hook Elementary School last Friday and opened fire, killing 20 children and six adults before killing himself. He had killed his mother, Nancy, before going to the school."20 beautiful children & 6 remarkable adults. Together, we will carry on & make our country worthy of their memory. -bo," President Barack Obama tweeted. The president took part in the moment of silence before leaving the White House to attend the funeral of Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.Bells at the National Cathedral and churches across the country, tolled 26 times to mark the 9:34 a.m. EST start of the massacre.A short time later, Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA, spoke to reporters and called for congressional funding to place armed police officers in every U.S. school. LaPierre took no questions from reporters in what had been billed as a news conference.The NRA issued a public statement this week saying its members were "shocked, saddened and heartbroken" by the massacre but had otherwise kept a low profile since the shootings. Its Internet presence went dark soon after the massacre.LaPierre said Friday the children at the Sandy Hook school were "utterly defenseless" against Lanza because there were no armed adults."Can't we afford to put a police officer in every single school?" he asked.LaPierre's speech was interrupted twice by protesters. A man was escorted out when he tried to shout down LaPierre with anti-NRA remarks, and a woman who unfurled a banner and accused the organization of having "blood on its hands.""Now, we must speak ... for the safety of our nation's children. Because for all the noise and anger directed at us over the past week, no one -- nobody -- has addressed the most important, pressing and immediate question we face: How do we protect our children right now, starting today, in a way that we know works?" LaPierre asked.LaPierre criticized laws that ban guns around schools and blamed the violence on the entertainment industry, especially video games and movies."The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," he said.Three more victims of the Newtown massacre were to be buried Friday. Lanza's mother was interred Thursday while Lanza's burial plans have yet to be finalized, CNN said.Obama again ordered flags to half-staff Friday.The Obama administration began an effort Thursday to change U.S. gun laws. Vice President Joe Biden met with Cabinet members and law enforcement leaders at the White House to start developing what Obama called "real reforms right now."More than 195,000 people signed an online White House petition in support of new gun control legislation.In a letter published Thursday in The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, first lady Michelle Obama said Americans "have been united in our grief" at the events in Newtown.She expressed admiration for "the first responders who risked their lives at a moment's notice; the educators whose devotion to their students shone brightest in one of our nation's darkest hours; the children who comforted each other despite their fear; the families coming together to support each other as they grieve."The first lady expressed pride at the outpouring of support from across the country."[Please] know that every minute of every day, we are thinking of you, and praying for you, and holding you and your families in our hearts as you begin the slow and wrenching work of healing and moving forward," she said.

Sept. 28 (UPI) -- Fox News has apologized for accidentally airing live coverage of a carjacker's apparent suicide, the tragic end to a high-speed car chase outside Phoenix, Arizona.In a statement, Fox News executive vice president Michael Clemente said:We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay. Unfortunately, this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen.Using helicopter footage from a local affiliate, the station began following the chase at around 3pm and continued covering it when the carjacker pulled off the highway and walked out into a field. "I'm just not sure about this," Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said over the footage as the man left his car. "This makes me a little nervous, I gotta tell ya." "Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off it!" Smith then shouted repeatedly to his control room as the network showed video of the man putting a gun to his head. After returning from an abrupt commercial break, Smith said that a technical mistake prevented the station's usual video delay from working. "We really messed up...that didn't belong on TV," he said. Here's Smith's on-air apology and explanation for what happened:Well, some explaining to do. While we were taking that car chase and showing it to you live -- when the guy pulled over and got out of the vehicle, we went on delay. So that's why I didn't talk for about 10 seconds. We created a five second delay, as if you were to bleep your back DVR five seconds, that's what we did with the picture we were showing you. So that we would see in the studio what was happening five seconds before you did so that if anything went horribly wrong, we'd be able to cut away from it without subjecting you to it. And we really messed up and we're all very sorry. That didn't belong on TV. We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on TV, and I personally apologize to you that that happened. ... That was wrong and that won't happened again on my watch and I'm sorry.Smith said that Fox News would update viewers on what happened Friday night on "The Fox Report." [Video via Mediaite]

Wiki
Bruce Edwards Ivins (April 22, 1946 – July 29, 2008) was a microbiologist, vaccinologist, senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland and a key suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks.
He died of an overdose of Tylenol in an apparent suicide after learning that criminal charges were likely to be filed against him by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an alleged criminal connection to the 2001 anthrax attacks. No formal charges were ever actually filed against him for the crime, and no direct evidence of his involvement has been uncovered.
At a news conference at the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on August 6, 2008, FBI and DOJ officials formally announced that the Government had concluded that Ivins was likely to have been solely responsible for "the deaths of five persons, and the injury of dozens of others, resulting from the mailings of several anonymous letters to members of Congress and members of the media in September and October, 2001, which letters contained Bacillus anthracis, commonly referred to as anthrax." On February 19, 2010, the FBI released a 92-page summary of evidence against Ivins and announced that it had concluded its investigation. The FBI conclusions have been contested by many, including senior microbiologists, the widow of one of the victims, and several prominent American politicians. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) who was among the targets in the attack, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), former Senator Arlen Specter (D-PA), Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ), and Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) all argued that Ivins was not solely responsible for the attacks. While not outright rejecting the theory of Ivins' involvement, Leahy has asserted that "If he is the one who sent the letter, I do not believe in any way, shape or manner that he is the only person involved in this attack on Congress and the American people. I do not believe that at all."	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
