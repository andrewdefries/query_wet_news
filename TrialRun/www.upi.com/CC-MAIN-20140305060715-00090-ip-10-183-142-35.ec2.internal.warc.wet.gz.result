| License Photo	BRUSSELS, Sept. 4 (UPI) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. Tuesday gave the European Union a negative credit rating, citing a possible "weakening of commitment" to the EU by member states.As European leaders held high-level talks on the region's debt crisis, Moody's said there had been a "deterioration of the creditworthiness of EU member states.""Additionally, a weakening of the commitment of the member states to the EU ... would be credit-negative," Moody's said.EU President Herman van Rompuy met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Tuesday, The New York Times reported. Van Rompuy was scheduled to meet separately this week with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and French President Francois Hollande, both of whom traveled to Berlin last week.Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras was scheduled to meet this week with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble.The discussions will center on Greek's request for an extension on repayment of $200 billion Athens has already received out of $300 billion the international community has pledged to loan to Greece if it meets fiscal targets. The European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission will report this month on Greece's progress meeting the targets.Merkel has praised the Greek government for its efforts to bring its budget into line. She said last week one of her goals is to keep Greece in the Eurozone.A second major discussion point is ECB President Mario Draghi's recent comment that he would be comfortable having the eurozone's central bank buy three-year government bonds.The ECB has previously said it would buy government bonds under the stipulation that the countries first request help from the European Stability Mechanism, the international funding facility developed to help debt-burdened eurozone countries.

BANGALORE, India, March 16 (UPI) -- India's main battle tank, the Arjun, will be fitted with an Indian-made automatic video tracker for locking onto targets until they are destroyed.Deepti Electronics and Electro-Optics, based in Bangalore, will supply the devices, a report by the BangaloreMirror.com newspaper said.Arjun tanks are fitted with French-made manual thermal imagers whereby the tank's navigator must constantly view a monitor or view-finder to locate targets, M.R. Sheshadri, a director of Delopt, said.Viewing monitors in a moving battle tank is difficult at the best of times, he said."By the time the information is passed on to the gunner, the target would have escaped," said Sheshadri, a former scientist with the Indian government's Defense Research and Development Organization."With the thermal imager, the navigator can track the enemy but he cannot lock on to it for that perfect strike."Delopt's automatic tracker also is designed as a line replacement unit -- it's one complete package that can be quickly removed for repairs or for replacement.A prototype of the device -- five years in development -- was successfully tested recently on Arjun tanks in the Pokhran test range, in the state of Rajasthan. A slightly modified version of the device will be handed over to the army in about a month, the Bangalore Mirror report said.During the trials, it detected fighter aircraft and missiles at a distance of 15-18 miles.Although the tracker can locate a number of targets, it can lock on to only one target at a time."We're working to incorporate a multiple-target engaging facility," Sheshadri said.Delopt won the contract through a tender put out by the DRDO.Around 50 of the Mark I Arjun tanks are in use, with the Mark II version undergoing trials this year.In May 2010, the army placed an order for another 124 units on top of the original order of 124 of the controversial tank that had been on the drawing board for more than 35 years.The current trials of the Mark II will include firing of the Israeli LAHAT missile, which has a range of 4-5 miles, the Press Trust of India reported in October.The Arjun's 120mm rifled main turret gun can fire the Israeli-made laser-homing anti-tank guided missile LAHAT, first in service in Israel in 1992 and was designed primarily for the Merkava tanks."Once Arjun Mark II comes out successfully through the integrated testing in June next year (2012), the production of the latest version of Arjun tanks will start in the Heavy Vehicles Factory," a DRDO source told PTI.The Arjun is made by Heavy Vehicles Factory in the specifically military manufacturing town of Avadi -- an acronym for Armored Vehicles and Ammunition Depot of India.Avadi is a coastal town of around 250,000 and about 15 miles from Chennai on the southeastern tip of India.The Mark II is being developed by the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment and will be in use from 2014.

Also expected to appear on the show along with Cissy and Bobbi Kristina are Whitney's sister-in-law and manager Pat Houston, her husband Gary and their daughter Rayah.Whitney Houston, a Grammy Award-winning pop music icon, accidentally drowned in a hotel bathtub Feb. 11 after using cocaine, authorities said.

Today is Sunday, April 13, the 104th day of 2008 with 262 to follow.The moon is waxing. The morning stars are Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. The evening stars are Mars and Saturn.Those born on this date are under the sign of Aries. They include Thomas Jefferson, third president of the United States, in 1743; Frank Woolworth, founder of the five-and-dime stores, in 1852; Alfred Butts, inventor of the game "Scrabble," in 1899; Irish playwright Samuel Beckett in 1906; Harold Stassen, former Minnesota governor who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination seven times, in 1907; author Eudora Welty in 1909; actor/singer Howard Keel in 1919; actors Lyle Waggoner in 1935 (age 73), Paul Sorvino in 1939 (age 69) and Tony Dow (Wally on "Leave It To Beaver") in 1945 (age 63); singers Al Green in 1946 (age 62) and Peabo Bryson in 1951 (age 57); band leader and Bruce Springsteen drummer Max Weinberg in 1951 (age 57) and actors Ron Perlman in 1950 (age 58) and Rick Schroeder in 1970 (age 38).On this date in history:In 1964, Sidney Poitier became the first African-American to win an Oscar for best actor, honored for his work in "Lillies of the Field."In 1965, Lawrence Bradford Jr., a 16-year-old from New York City, started work as the first black page to serve in either chamber of Congress.In 1972, the first major league baseball strike ended, eight days after it began.In 1984, Christopher Wilder, the FBI's "most wanted man," accidentally killed himself as police moved in to arrest him in New Hampshire. Wilder was a suspect in the deaths, rapes and disappearances of 11 young women in eight states.In 1987, the Population Reference Bureau reported that the world's population had exceeded 5 billion.In 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev gave Lithuania a two-day ultimatum, threatening to cut off some supplies to the Baltic republic if it didn't rescind laws passed since a March 11 declaration of independence.In 1991, an advance team of U.N. observers arrived in Kuwait City to set up a peacekeeping force along the Kuwait-Iraqi border.In 1992, construction workers breeched a retaining wall in the Chicago River, sending water flooding through a tunnel system connecting buildings in the downtown area.Also in 1992, Princess Anne, daughter of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, began divorce proceedings after a two-year separation from Capt. Mark Phillips.In 1997, Tiger Woods, 21, won the Masters Tournament, the youngest golfer to accomplish that feat and first African-American to win any of the four major professional golf tournaments for men.In 2004, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said in Beijing that the United States doesn't support independence for Taiwan.In 2005, as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty, Eric Rudolph pleaded guilty to four bombings that killed two people and injured more than 120. Among the attacks were bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and two abortion clinics. Rudolph was sentenced to life in prison.In 2006, the head of the U.N. nuclear regulatory agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, urged Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment "until outstanding issues are clarified."In 2007, a Bush administration official, unable to locate e-mail messages requested in the inquiry into firings of U.S. attorneys, said as many as 5 million messages may be lost. The spokesman said it could have happened by accident while changing systems. Federal law requires all White House e-mails to be archived for posterity.Also in 2007, U.S. regulators sought to determine whether a chemical was intentionally added in China to wheat gluten destined for pet food. Contaminated wheat gluten was in food reported linked to numerous deaths of dogs and cats in North America and prompted the recall of more than 90 brands of pet food.A thought for the day: "We cannot hold a torch to light another's path without brightening our own." Ben Sweetmand said that.

VIENNA, April 9 (UPI) -- A predicted 3-foot rise in sea levels by century's end will leave many land animals at risk of extinction in Southeast Asia and Pacific regions, scientists say.U.S. and European researchers said the risk of extinction is highest for species endemic to only on certain islands and already endangered species.The researchers' study encompassed the entire Southeast Asian and Pacific region with more than 12,000 islands and the distribution of more than 3,000 vertebrate species of birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.Climate change models indicate many islands and atolls in the study region will lose large parts of their land area and some islands will even become completely submerged."Some Pacific atolls stand to lose one-third of their land area with sea level rise of just one meter, and the species living there would be seriously at risk," study author Florian Wetzel of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said. "In contrast, other volcanic island groups and their resident species will incur area losses of just a few percent."The researchers said their study, one of the first to examine the potential impacts of a rising sea level on biodiversity, should lead to strong calls to take sea level increases into account when planning species conservation measures in the affected areas.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25 (UPI) -- ESPN said baseball announcer John Kruk was doing well after being carried out of the Dodger Stadium broadcast booth on a stretcher Sunday due to dehydration.The incident happened before the start of ESPN's broadcast of an interleague game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers.The Boston Globe reported Kruk, 52, was conscious as he was carried out of the booth on a stretcher.The network released a statement shortly after the incident indicating the former first baseman and outfielder was not in danger."John left the booth feeling dizzy and was diagnosed with dehydration," the statement said. "His vital signs are stable and he's in good spirits. We wish him a speedy recovery."ESPNBoston.com said Kruk was taken to a medical station within the stadium and was later cleared to return to his hotel after being advised to rest and drink fluids.USA Today and the Los Angeles Times reported the incident was linked to a diabetic condition.Kruk, who played for the San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, compiled a .300 career batting average with 100 homers and 592 RBI over 10 major league seasons from 1986-1995.He was hired as an ESPN baseball analyst in 2004.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 25 (UPI) -- The United Nations supports Beirut in its efforts to ensure stability and security in Lebanon is safeguarded, a U.N. delegate said.Derek Plumbly, U.N. special envoy to Lebanon, met in Beirut with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The security and political situation in Lebanon is tense following border clashes near Syria and an outbreak of gun violence in Beirut.Lebanese President Michel Suleiman announced plans to embark on efforts toward kick starting a political dialogue between rival political factions in the country."I know there is public concern about the manifestations of insecurity that have been seen over the past two weeks," Plumbly said in a statement. "But I believe they have also alerted all of us to the need to work together to sustain calm and stability in Lebanon at this time of turbulence in the region."Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, meanwhile, spoke Friday with Mikati to inform him 11 Lebanese men kidnapped this week in Syria were released to Turkish authorities, The Daily Star newspaper in Lebanon reported.Mikati's office reported the men were in good health and on their way to the Lebanese capital.Conflict in neighboring Syria is in its second year. Damascus before Lebanon's revolution in 2005 played a dominant role in the country's political affairs.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Republicans at congressional hearings pummeled U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to her handling of the Sept. 11 Libyan consulate attack.During House and Senate hearings on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Clinton conceded reforms are needed, but pushed back against GOP accusations the Obama administration misled the public about the attacks for political reasons.House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., told Clinton, "Security was not a high priority" at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed."Security requests were denied," Royce charged.Democrats have said congressional Republicans cut funding requested by the State Department for embassy security but Royce said the tragedy of Benghazi "was rooted in poor security," not in a lack of funding.He questioned why security assets were pulled from the region before the attack. Clinton said those assets were focused on the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, not the consulate in Benghazi.Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., accused Clinton of allowing the Benghazi consulate to "become a death trap" and said that was "malpractice."Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., pointed out news stories that department officials responsible for not passing on requests for more security to the highest levels were disciplined, and charged the stories were, "Not true!"Clinton said all four individuals "have been removed from their jobs ... [and] placed on administrative leave." She said federal regulations forbid removing someone because of "unsatisfactory leadership" and urged Congress to change those regulations.Democrats were more supportive. Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the ranking member, said instead of engaging in "gotcha" politics the committee should be working on solutions."Clearly mistakes were made, but let's make one thing perfectly clear, Barack Obama was not responsible for the Benghazi attack, just as George Bush was not responsible for the Sept. 11 [2001] attacks and Ronald Reagan was not responsible for the [1983 attack on the Marine barracks in Lebanon]," Engel said.He also raked Congress on funding."In the past two years alone, the administration's request for [security funding] has been cut by half-a-billion dollars," he said.Earlier Wednesday, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., blasted the administration and Clinton for what he called a failure to help Libya fight terror. McCain said there were plenty of warnings leading up to the attack on the anniversary of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but "with all these warnings, we didn't have a single Defense Department" force to come to the aid of the consulate in the event of an attack."I categorically reject your answers [about the events leading up to the Benghazi attack and the U.S. response]. ... The American people deserve answers and they certainly don't deserve false answers," McCain said.Clinton told McCain they would have to disagree on the facts, but, "Since March 11 congressional holds have been placed for many months on aid to Libya. ... We've got to get our act together between the administration and the Congress."Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., called the Benghazi attack "the greatest tragedy" since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and told Clinton he would have fired her if he had been president.Clinton told the panel every crisis should not be turned into a political football, but everyone should "be smart about this" and seek to prevent such tragedies in the future.Clinton said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice did not mislead the public about the Libyan terror attack.Rice told interviewers shortly after the Sept. 11 attack, the assault in Benghazi arose from a demonstration against an anti-Islamic film made in California. She has said she was using "talking points" provided by the intelligence community.The administration has since said the attack was a planned act of terror.Responding to Republican questions, Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: "People have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. ... Nothing could be further from the truth."When Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., accused Clinton and the administration of misleading the public on what motivated the attack, Clinton answered with a raised voice: "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk last night who decided to kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."She said State Department officials in Washington held off interviewing U.S. evacuees from Benghazi to avoid interfering with the FBI, which was talking to the evacuees as part of an investigation. She said the FBI was "following some very important leads" about who participated in the Benghazi attack.Clinton told the panel the administration did not know "until days after the attack" that there had been no demonstration. Investigators are still trying to pin down the exact events, she said.Clinton also told the panel she could not confirm terrorists killed in Algeria were involved in the Libyan attack."This information is coming from the Algerian government related to their questioning of certain of the terrorists that they took alive," she said. "We don't have any way to confirm it as yet, but I can certainly assure you, we will do everything we can to determine that."You may know that [FBI] Director [Robert] Mueller was just in the region meeting with leaders. He's very well aware that we have to track every one of these connections. And this will be a new thread that will be followed."The attack on an Algerian gas plant last week left at least 37 foreign hostages dead, Algerian officials said. Algerian forces killed at least 29 of the 32 kidnappers to end the hostage crisis.Clinton told the Senate panel she did not see requests for extra security in Libya prior to the Sept. 11 attack. She said she did not deny any requests, and procedures were being put in place that any future secretary would see such security messages.Clinton's voice broke with emotion as she talked about the families of the victims of the Benghazi consulate attack."I directed our response from the State Department," she told the panel.Citing an administrative review board report, she said there were "no delays in decision-making, no denials of support from the Pentagon or the administration ... the board said our response saved lives and it did."She also stressed that on the day of the attack, "In that same period, we were seeing violent attacks on our embassies" across North Africa. She cited a demonstration in Cairo in which protesters were trying to climb over the U.S. Embassy walls.Clinton said the United States must still be represented in dangerous places."Let me underscore the importance of the United States continuing to lead in North Africa and around the world," she said. "That is why I sent Chris Stevens to Libya. ... He knew the risks ... [but] they cannot work in bunkers and do their jobs. That's why we must do everything possible" to give them security.Clinton also said the attack didn't happen in a vacuum, citing the problems created within the security apparatus of the region caused by the various government revolutions.Clinton, her voice breaking, said to her the attack was personal, noting she stood beside President Barack Obama as the caskets of the four people killed in the attack, including Stevens, were returned to the United States.

BRUSSELS, June 1 (UPI) -- European governments must surrender more budget and regulatory power to a central authority for the euro to survive, the European Central Bank president said.The central bank for the 17 European Union eurozone countries is reaching the limits of its powers, Mario Draghi told members of the European Parliament."Can the ECB fill the vacuum left by the lack of euro area governance?" he asked. "The answer is no."Just as the economic crisis has shattered illusions about the sustainability of government debt, he told lawmakers Thursday, so too should it be changing illusions about the underlying structure of the euro currency."That configuration we had for 10 years, which was basically considered sustainable -- I should add in perhaps a myopic way -- is being shown now to be unsustainable unless further steps are undertaken," said Draghi, an Italian banker and economist who took over the job Nov. 1.Half-measures and delays have made the eurozone crisis worse, he said."Dispel this fog," Draghi said.Leaders must expand their vision and thought beyond their current understanding of "national interest" and realize that for their own interests and the sake of the economic and monetary union, they must surrender far more budget and regulatory power to a central authority, he said.He criticized Spain's slow response to its mushrooming banking crisis, highlighted by the recent nationalization of Bankia SA, a conglomeration of savings institutions.Spain's government has consistently failed to get a grip on its banking sector's problems, Draghi said."There is a first assessment, then a second, a third, a fourth," he said. "This is the worst possible way of doing things. Everyone ends up doing the right thing, but at the highest cost."Spain announced last week it would inject an additional $23.5 billion into Bankia, the country's fourth-largest lender, bringing Madrid's biggest bank nationalization to more than $29 billion.Spain said in February it would not need to spend more public money for its banks.The total amount Spain needs to prop up its banks is not known.The government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Thursday it had at least four months to raise the $23.5 billion, so it has time to explore funding options.Spain's central bank said Thursday $120 billion in capital -- about 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- had left the country in the first three months of 2012.

Jan. 16 (UPI) -- Radio host Howard Stern called 'Girls' show-runner/actress Lena Dunham a "little fat chick" during his Sirius-XM show last week, but following Durham's public acknowledgement of his comment, he has decided to apologize and even declared himself a fan of the show. It all began when Stern's wife, Beth Ostrosky recommended 'Girls' to the radio host given his soft spot for 'girl shows'."I like Sex and the City," Stern said during his radio show last week. "But this 'Girls' it's a little fat girl who looks like Jonah Hill and keeps taking her clothes off it and it kinda' feels like a rape. I don't wanna see that." Later on adding, "Then I learned that this little fat chick writes the show, directs the show, and that makes sense to me because she's such a camera hog that the other character barely are on."The host then continued to trash the show along with producer Gary Dell'Abate who also admitted to not liking it. In the week that fallowed, Stern's comments made the news, he got bombarded with fan hate, Dunham won two Golden Globes for 'Girls,' went on Letterman and acknowledged the radio host's remarks. Soon after, Stern decided to take it all back.While on the air Monday morning, the host said it had all been a "hatchet job", that his words had been taken out of context and that he felt bad because he actually really loves and enjoys 'Girls' and admires the girl who writes it. Adding that he would like to explain himself to Dunham on the air."It makes me feel bad that she's getting the impression that I somehow think she's just a talentless little fat chick," he said. But Dunham, a self proclaimed fan of Stern's, took no offense from his comments, in fact, she would like to have one of them carved on her grave. "I did find out that Howard Stern really hates [Girls]. I'm a Howard Stern fan, and really think he has earned the right to free speech and he should just go for it," Dunham told David Letterman on Thursday. "But he did say something that is so funny that I wanna get it on my gravestone: 'Congrats to her, It's so hard for little fat chicks to get anything going these days', I want my gravestone to say, 'she was a little fat chick and she got it going'."Dunham has not yet replied to Stern's 'it was all taken out of context' apology.
