| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 23 (UPI) -- Water problems, including water shortages, poor water quality and floods, during the next decade will contribute to instability in many countries important to U.S. security interests, a U.S. intelligence community report says.The Global Water Security report, prepared at the request of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last year, was compiled by the office of the Director of National Intelligence with contributions from eight intelligence organizations, including the CIA and the National Security Agency.At a State Department event Thursday to mark World Water Day, Clinton called the report's findings "sobering.""These threats are real and they do raise serious security concerns," Clinton said.The lack of adequate water will be a "destabilizing factor" for some countries that do not have the financial resources or technical ability to solve their internal water problems, the report says.Some 800 million people lack a safe supply of freshwater, the United Nations says.The report cited the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa as critical areas.Although "water-related state conflict" is unlikely in the next 10 years, the report says, it predicts that a number of states "will exert leverage over their neighbors."But as water shortages intensify beyond the next decade, the report warns, water in shared basins will increasingly be used as leverage. Furthermore, water could be used "as a weapon or to further terrorist objectives."Water projects could also be used by states as a way to obtain regional influence or to preserve their water interests.The report warns that terrorists or extremists "almost certainly" will target vulnerable water infrastructure to achieve their objectives.Citing over-pumping of groundwater to satisfy growing food demand, the report says, during the next decade, groundwater depletion in some agricultural areas, due to poor management, will pose a risk to domestic and global food markets.Noting that more than 15 developing countries generate 80 percent or more of their electricity from hydropower, the report says that water shortages are already affecting power generation.Clinton on Thursday also announced a new public-private group aimed at improving water security around the world, particularly in developing countries. Partners include the Coca-Cola Company, Procter and Gamble and the Rockefeller Foundation.Clinton said: "We believe this Water Partnership will help map out our route to a more water secure world: a world where no one dies from water-related diseases; where water does not impede social or economic development; and where no war is ever fought over water."

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has postponed the presentation of its Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award to Steven Spielberg.Spielberg was set to receive the honor Sunday at the Golden Globe Awards, but the event has been scaled down from its traditional scope and size to a news conference because of the Writers Guild of America strike against producers. The WGA said it would picket the ceremony if it was produced by a struck company, Dick Clark Productions, or televised by a struck company, NBC.The Screen Actors Guild announced its members would not cross a picket line to present or collect awards.Instead, the HFPA will announce its Golden Globe winners at a televised press conference Sunday in Beverly Hills, Calif.E! Online said the HFPA has decided to postpone the presentation of the special award to Spielberg until 2009, when he might be able to receive the award amid the pageantry of a traditional Globes ceremony.Among Spielberg's many critically acclaimed and popular films are "Schindler's List," "Jurassic Park," the Indiana Jones movies and "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial."

OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 29 (UPI) -- The tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine risk is similar to the tetanus and diphtheria vaccine for those ages 65 and older, U.S. researchers say. Hung Fu Tseng and his team at Kaiser Permanente Southern California found adverse events following the Tdap vaccination in seniors were mostly minor. "Although there is a small increased risk of injection site reaction following Tdap vaccination in the elderly, it is no more common than that following the traditional tetanus and diphtheria vaccine," Tseng said in a statement. The study involved 119,573 seniors who received the Tdap vaccine and the same number of people who received the traditional Td vaccine. Safety data were collected from seven U.S. health maintenance organizations. The study, published online in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, found the risk for adverse events following vaccination was comparable among both groups.The authors said the findings should allay any fears among older adults about the safety of the Tdap vaccine and prompt more doctors to urge across-the-board immunization, which is crucial in the wake of recent pertussis, or whooping cough outbreaks, such as those in Minnesota, Washington state, Wisconsin and elsewhere.Current recommendations call for infants older than 2 months, children, teens, adults -- including pregnant women, parents and healthcare workers -- and those age 65 and older to be vaccinated."Pertussis immunization is important, particularly since one of the most common sources of pertussis in infants is their relatives, including their grandparents," Tseng said in a statement. "We suggest that clinicians follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation and talk to older adult patients about vaccination against pertussis to protect themselves and their family members."

HILLSBOROUGH, N.J., May 6 (UPI) -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said his stuffed tiger, a gift from his late U.S. attorney general father, is being restored by a New Jersey expert also Robert Kennedy.Kennedy Jr. said his father gave him the stuffed Sumatran tiger as a consolation prize when he was a child because the family was unable to keep a pair of Komodo dragons, gifts to his father from Indonesia, at their home, The (Newark, N.J.) Star-Ledger reported Monday.He said he had previously attempted to have the tiger restored, but not all taxidermists are skilled in restoration."Restoration is a specialty. It's almost like restoring a piece of art in a museum," he said. "I'd heard Robert Kennedy was an extraordinary taxidermist who did extraordinary work."The like-named Hillsborough taxidermist said he is used to meeting people who share his name. He said he will recommend the restored tiger be kept away from pets and children in the future.

Getting the win at the Aegon lifts her to 22nd in the rankings, which matches her career high. She was 36th a week ago.Halep had been in one final each year from 2010-12 but had lost them all. Then, over the last two weeks, she pulled a clay-grass double, taking the WTA stop in Nuremburg, Germany, on June 15 on a slow clay court and on Saturday winning on the quicker grass courts of the Netherlands. That boosts her from 45th to 32nd, also a career high.The Top 10 is unchanged going into the 127th Wimbledon Championships. Tournament officials followed the WTA rankings in determining the seeds for the event, which began Monday.The WTA Top 10, with home country and rankings points:1. Serena Williams, United States, 13,6152. Victoria Azarenka, Belarus, 9,6253. Maria Sharapova, Russia, 9,4154. Agnieszka Radwanska, Poland, 6,4655. Sara Errani, Italy, 5,3356. Li Na, China, 5,1557.

| License Photo	SEOUL, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- South Korea's president said "the door for dialogue is still open" with North Korea on condition it abandons "military adventurism."South Korean President Lee Myung-bak held out the olive branch to the North in his annual new year's speech, saying he wanted the resumption of the long-stalled six-way talks over the communist nation's nuclear weapons.GALLERY: Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea after the shelling"It is imperative now more than ever for countries concerned to play a fair and responsible role," he said, referring to negotiations with North Korea that include China, the United States, Japan and Russia."I remind the North that the path toward peace is yet to be closed." However, "nuclear weapons and military adventurism must be discarded. The North must work toward peace and cooperation not only with rhetoric but also with deeds."But South Korea would respond to any threat against even "an inch of our territory."Lee also said he wanted North Korea show movement on to "drastically enhance economic cooperation" in partnership with other countries. "Taking it a step further, we need to make endeavors to engage our North Korean brethren in the long journey toward freedom and prosperity."Lee's speech, an apparent attempt to improve relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, comes after a rocky end to 2010 for the two countries that were created after the end in 1953 of a bloody three-year civil war that divided the Korean Peninsula.Military tensions rose dramatically last year, beginning in March with the sinking, allegedly by North Korea, of the South Korean patrol boat Cheonan and the loss of 46 sailors.An international investigating team said it found strong evidence that the 1,200-ton Cheonan split in half after being hit with a torpedo of North Korean manufacture. The team said the torpedo was likely fired by a small to mid-size submarine but North Korea denied it was involved.Relations dipped further Nov. 23 when North Korea unexpectedly shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong in the Yellow Sea and several miles from the North's mainland.The daylight attack, in which North Korea fired around 170 shells, damaged dozens of houses and several military buildings. It also killed two South Korean marines and two civilians and injured at least 20 people. South Korean forces returned fire but there were no known causalities.Lee said "the situation before and after the provocation against Yeonpyeong Island cannot be the same." Similar attacks will not be tolerated and "such provocations will be met with stern, strong responses."The shelling of Yeonpyeong Island also served as an opportunity for us to reflect on our security readiness and overhaul our defense posture. There cannot be any delay in establishing security measures," he said.Lee's speech comes after South Korea's Unification Ministry said last week that one of its policies for 2011 would be to lay out detailed preparations should unification of the two Koreas appear likely.Lee's speech also comes after editorials in the North Korean media that the two Koreas should improve relations but South Korea must stop its "reckless and wild behavior" toward the North."The danger of war should be removed and peace safeguarded in the Korean Peninsula," the state-run Korean Central News Agency said. KCNA quoted a North Korean editorial saying, "If a war breaks out on this land, it will bring nothing but a nuclear holocaust."For that reason, "confrontation between North and South should be defused as early as possible. Dialogue and cooperation should be promoted proactively."Lee's live address to the nation was made ahead of the arrival Tuesday in Seoul of Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. envoy responsible for policy toward North Korea, as part of his swing later through China and Japan. Bosworth will be accompanied by Sung Kim, the U.S. envoy for nuclear talks with North Korea.

TRIPOLI, Libya, March 19 (UPI) -- Libya can move toward recovery from civil war if its allies help it regain assets looted by the Gadhafi regime, Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble said.Noble met in Tripoli with Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan. Noble is helping Libya identify members of Moammar Gadhafi regime and collect stolen assets."As Libya continues to rebuild its infrastructure following the 2011 overthrowing of Gadhafi, Interpol member countries can help Libya track down not only fugitives, but the millions if not billions (of dollars) in assets stolen by Col. Gadhafi, his family and associates," Noble said.Gadhafi died in October 2011 after falling into rebel hands. NATO forces that year enforced a no-fly zone in order to prevent civilians from attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces.Zeidan said the government welcomed Interpol's creation of a joint task force that would work with Libyan teams to help repatriate assets looted during the country's civil war.Egyptian police announced Tuesday they coordinated with Interpol in the arrest of Gadhaf al-Dam, a confidant and cousin of Gadhafi, Egyptian news agency al-Ahram reports.He faces charges in Libya for crimes against humanity during Gadhafi's tenure. He defected at the beginning of the Libyan revolution.Egyptian authorities also handed former Libyan Ambassador to Egypt Ali Maria over to Interpol authorities to face crimes committed during the Gadhafi era.

| License Photo	BOSTON, Feb. 8 (UPI) -- Gov. Deval Patrick ordered drivers to stay off the roads Friday as Massachusetts braced for what was predicted to be a 100-year blizzard.Patrick declared a state of emergency, saying that would allow officials to "implement emergency measures to ensure the safety of our residents and take appropriate steps to mobilize state assets."Only a few flakes had fallen by mid-morning in Boston, The Boston Globe said. Patrick was anticipating a storm that could bring as much as 2 feet of snow, accompanied by winds as strong as 70 mph.The travel ban, unusual in a state used to winter storms, was to take effect at 4 p.m. EST. Forecasters said the storm would hit full force during what would normally be the evening rush hour.Gov. Lincoln Chafee declared a state of emergency in Rhode Island, the Providence Journal reported, and Gov. Dannel Malloy declared a state of emergency in Connecticut, The Hartford Courant said.AcccuWeather.com said the storm likely would cause coastal flooding and power outages as well as white-out conditions and massive drifts.Airlines suspended thousands of flights in and out of airports in New York and Boston, Amtrak announced it canceled service between the two cities, and schools either closed or dismissed early.Forecasters said the snow would be heavy and wet.The worst of the storm was expected to hit coastal areas of northern New England and southern Nova Scotia later Friday night into Saturday, AccuWeather.com said.On New York's Long Island -- which could receive more than 18 inches of snow -- the power company promised customers it was prepared, The New York Times reported. The utility was heavily criticized for its response to Hurricane Sandy last year.In Boston, where snow started to fall around 9:30 a.m., schools were closed and mass transit in the city was to be suspended starting at 3:30 p.m., officials said.Patrick told non-emergency Massachusetts government workers to stay home and urged private employers to issue similar stay-at-home orders.Snow fell early in New York and was expected to become rain before turning back to snow late Friday, forecasters said. Between 10 and 20 inches of snow were expected to fall by Saturday afternoon in the New York City region.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, criticized for the city's slow response to a 2010 snowstorm, tried to reassure residents that the city was prepared. He urged people to leave work early if possible, the Times said."Our biggest concern is making sure that people get home from their day and that they don't abandon their cars in the middle of the road," Bloomberg said. "But we don't think the snow is going to come down hard enough where that should be a problem."The storm -- which forecasters said could be the biggest blizzard some cities have seen in a century -- is the result of two weather systems colliding and producing one powerful force."The storm should reach its peak intensity early Saturday morning just east of Cape Cod," the National Weather Service said in a statement.Because of expected hurricane-force winds, NWS predicted "dangerous blizzard conditions" for many parts of Northeast.Winter weather and blizzard warnings were in effect from Pennsylvania through New Jersey and metropolitan New York all the way to Maine, the National Weather Service said.At the storm's height, snow could fall at 2 to 4 inches per hour and may be accompanied by thunder and lightning, AccuWeather.com said.The Weather Channel named Friday's storm Nemo, but the National Weather Service declined to give it a name."We never have, nor do we have any plans to consider naming winter storms," a weather service spokesman told the Times.

Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Senators who hammered Zero Dark Thirty over its portrayal of torture are now turning their sights on the CIA, openly wondering if the intelligence agency mislead the filmmakers on what actually happened in the lead up to the killing of Osama bin Laden.Sens. Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin, and John McCain released two letters sent to acting CIA Director Michael Morell asking tough questions about the agency's involvement with the filmmaking, seeking information on whether director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal could have been mislead by information provided by the CIA.The Senators, all members of the Intelligence Committee, are concerned that a scene showing an al-Qaeda operative getting waterboarded and then ultimately providing critical information, portrays torture as effective. They asked the CIA to release the exact documents provided to filmmakers that would have led to the allegedly fictional scene."Given the CIA's cooperation with the filmmakers and the narrative's consistency with past public misstatements by former senior CIA officials, filmmakers could have been mislead by information they were provided by the CIA," the letter reads.Those same senators previously wrote to Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton, claiming the film was "grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture resulted in information that led to the location of Osama bin Laden."Bigelow and Boal released a statement defending their portrayal of coercive measures in the film. "We depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding bin Laden;" they said. "The film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt, nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes."The filmmakers also went onto ABC's Nightline and claimed they never received any classified information from the intelligence community or the Obama administration.The two letters sent to CIA Director Morell are as follows:
December 19, 2012Mr. Michael Morell
Acting Director
Central Intelligence AgencyDear Acting Director Morell,We are writing to request information and documents related to the CIA’s cooperation with the makers of the film, Zero Dark Thirty. We are concerned by the film’s clear implication that information obtained during or after the use of the CIA’s coercive interrogation techniques played a critical role in locating Usama Bin Laden (UBL).As you know, the film depicts CIA officers repeatedly torturing detainees. The film then credits CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques as providing critical lead information on the courier that led to the UBL compound. While this information is incorrect, it is consistent with public statements made by former Director of the CIA Counterterrorism Center, Jose Rodriguez, and former CIA Director Michael Hayden.The CIA cannot be held accountable for how the Agency and its activities are portrayed in film, but we are nonetheless concerned, given the CIA’s cooperation with the filmmakers and the narrative’s consistency with past public misstatements by former senior CIA officials, that the filmmakers could have been misled by information they were provided by the CIA.In an unclassified letter you provided to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on May 31, 2012, you wrote that the CIA engaged with the filmmakers “to ensure an appropriate portrayal of the Agency’s mission as well as the dedication of the men and women of the CIA who played a key part in the success of that mission.” The film opens with the words “based on first-hand accounts of actual events,” and according to now publicly released CIA records, the filmmakers met extensively with CIA personnel. Specifically, one publicly released email notes that the filmmakers met with you for forty minutes, during which you provided “substance again.” Another publicly released CIA email states that “As a [sic] Agency, we’ve been pretty forward-leaning with [the filmmaker], and he’s agreed to share scripts and details about the movie with us so we’re absolutely comfortable with what he will be showing.”Pursuant to the Committee’s recently-adopted Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation program, Committee staff reviewed more than 6 million pages of CIA records. Based on that review, and with prior notification to the CIA, Chairman Dianne Feinstein and Senator Carl Levin released the following findings on April 30, 2012, regarding the UBL operation:- The CIA did not first learn about the existence of the UBL courier from CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques. Nor did the CIA discover the courier’s identity from CIA detainees subjected to coercive techniques. No CIA detainee reported on the courier’s full name or specific whereabouts, and no detainee identified the compound in which UBL was hidden. Instead, the CIA learned of the existence of the courier, his true name, and location through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program.- Information to support the UBL operation was obtained from a wide variety of intelligence sources and methods. CIA officers and their colleagues throughout the Intelligence Community sifted through massive amounts of information, identified possible leads, tracked them down, and made considered judgments based on all of the available intelligence.- The CIA detainee who provided the most accurate information about the courier provided the information prior to being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques.
In addition to the information above, former CIA Director Panetta wrote Senator McCain in May 2011, stating:“…no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier’s full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.”Given the discrepancy between the facts above and what is depicted in the film, previous misstatements by retired CIA officials, as well as what appears to be the CIA’s unprecedented cooperation with the filmmakers, we request that you provide the Committee with all information and documents provided to the filmmakers by CIA officials, former officials, or contractors, including talking points prepared for use in those meetings. Furthermore, we request copies of all relevant records discussing the cooperation between CIA officials, former officials, or contractors and the filmmakers, including records of the meetings that occurred, notes, internal emails, Sametime communications, and other documentation describing CIA interactions with the filmmakers.Thank you for your assistance on this matter.Sincerely,Dianne Feinstein

Acting Director
Central Intelligence AgencyDear Acting Director Morell:In your December 21, 2012, statement to CIA employees regarding the film, Zero Dark Thirty, you state that “the film creates the strong impression that enhanced interrogation techniques” were “the key to finding Bin Ladin” and that this impression “is false.” However, you went on to refer to multiple streams of intelligence that led CIA analysts to conclude that Bin Ladin was hiding in Abbottabad and stated that “Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques, but there were many other sources as well. And, importantly, whether enhanced interrogation techniques were the only timely and effective way to obtain information from those detainees, as the film suggests, is a matter of debate that cannot and never will be definitively resolved.”In our previous letter of December 18, 2012, we made several points based on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s Study of the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation program that are potentially inconsistent with your press release. Principal among those points was that “The CIA detainee who provided the most accurate information about the courier provided the information prior to being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques.”Accordingly, we would ask that you provide the following to the Committee:1. In regards to the Bin Laden operation, what information was acquired from CIA detainees subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques? When was this information provided: prior to, during, or after the detainee was subjected to the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques? If after, how long after? Please note whether such information corroborated information previously known to the CIA.2. Please provide specific examples of information that was obtained in a “timely and effective” way from CIA detainees subjected to the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques? When was this information provided: prior to, during, or after the detainee was subjected to the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques? If after, how long after? Please note whether such information corroborated information previously known to the CIA.Thank you for your assistance on this important matter.Sincerely,Dianne Feinstein
