WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Housing starts on private homes rose 3.6 percent from September to October, and 41.9 percent from October 2011, the U.S. Commerce Department said.Privately owned housing units authorized by building permits were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 866,000 -- 2.7 percent below the revised rate for September of 890,000 -- but 29.8 percent ahead of the October 2011 estimate of 667,000 -- the department said Tuesday in a release issued jointly with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The department revised its estimate of housing starts for September from 872,000 to 863,000. Starts in October came to 894,000 -- 41.9 percent above the 630,000 rate from October 2011.Single-family housing starts in October came in at an annual rate of 594,000 -- 0.2 percent below the revised figure for September, 595,000. Single-family housing completions in October were at an annual rate of 542,000 -- 3.4 percent higher than the revised rate for September, 524,000.The numbers reflect the findings in a separate index released Tuesday that said confidence among home builders had risen for the seventh consecutive month in November.The Commerce and HUD release said 772,000 privately owned housing construction projects were completed in October on a seasonally adjusted annual basis -- 14.5 percent more completions in the month than in September, where a revised estimate put completions at an annual rate of 674,000, and 33.6 percent above the October 2011 rate of 578,000.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 30 (UPI) -- LeAnn Rimes' publicist says the U.S. country music star has checked into an undisclosed rehabilitation facility to be treated for emotional problems."LeAnn has voluntarily entered a 30-day, in-patient treatment facility to cope with anxiety and stress," her representative Marcel Pariseau told People.com in an exclusive statement. "While there will be speculation regarding her treatment, she is simply there to learn and develop coping mechanisms. While privacy isn't expected, it's certainly appreciated."Rimes -- who checked in Wednesday, the day after her 30th birthday -- is not seeking treatment for an eating disorder or substance abuse, Pariseau said."This is just a time for me to emotionally check out for a second and take care of myself and come back in 30 days as the best 30-year-old woman I can be," Rimes said in a statement. "All the things in my life will be there when I get out, but you know what? I'm hoping they're not going to affect me as much. I'll have the tools to know how to deal with them."The singer has been granted permission to occasionally leave the facility to perform previously scheduled shows, People.com said.

| License Photo	LONDON, May 26 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama erred during a tour of London's Westminster Abbey when he signed a guest book with a date in 2008.Obama, who was touring the church Tuesday with first lady Michelle Obama, signed his name with the date "24 May 2008," instead of the current year, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday."It is a great privilege to commemorate our common heritage, and common sacrifice," the Obamas wrote in the guest book.A Westminster Abbey spokesman confirmed it was President Obama who signed the incorrect date.President Obama also placed a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior at the church, The Daily Telegraph reported. He was given a tour of Westminster Abbey from the Very Rev. Dr. John Hall."Westminster Abbey is known as the House of God and the House of Kings, where God is worshiped every day and where many great men and women are buried or memorialized," Hall told the Obamas."Here has taken place every coronation of kings and queens of England and of the United Kingdom since William I was crowned here on Christmas Day 1066."Hall noted thousands of international visitors "including very many from the United States are welcomed" every day.

PARIS, Nov. 8 (UPI) -- Invasive bee-killing Asian hornets have arrived in Paris and one man has died after being stung by the black and yellow striped insects, officials said.France has officially declared the pest, which is rapidly advancing to the north, a "harmful and invasive exotic species," Britain's The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday.The hornets, which experts said may have arrived in southwestern France in a consignment of Chinese pottery in late 2004, have no indigenous predators in France.Beekeepers in France said they are worried about their hives, as honeybees are the hornet's main source of food.The hornets, which hover over hives and attack bees in flight, can destroy a beehive in a matter of hours.A 54-year old man died Monday near the Loire wine-growing village of Saumur after disturbing a hornet nest while cutting his hedge.The hornets, in an ongoing move northward, could cross into Britain by 2014, Franck Muller of the Museum of National History in Paris said."We have modeled its potential spread by cross-checking data from France and Asia, and concluded it is capable of living anywhere in Europe and certainly in Britain," he said.

If nothing else, the weekend's major races showed the path to the Breeders' Cup Championships is going to be challenging.Case in point: Saturday's star-studded Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs went to Ron the Greek, who had been billed as a supporting actor.The $400,000, Grade I race promised to be a preview of the older horses pointing toward the Breeders' Cup Classic. But after some roughhousing early and again late, it was Ron the Greek who found room along the rail and got through to win by a head over Wise Dan. Nate's Mineshaft led much of the way and held on for third.The rest of the order of finish was replete with recognizable names: Rogue Romance, Alternation, Nehro, Mission Impazible and Fort Larned. Wise Dan came into the Stephen Foster riding a three-race winning streak; Alternation, a four-race win skein. Nate's Mineshaft had won five of his last six starts.Ron the Greek, who finished the 9 furlongs on a fast track in 1:50.51 with Jose Lezcano up, had finished second to Alternation in his last start, the Grade II Oaklawn Handicap. Prior to that, however, he won the Grade I Santa Anita Handicap. The 5-year-old son of Full Mandate now has seven wins from 19 lifetime starts."Everything went right for me tonight," Lezcano said. "The whole way I saw the hole on the rail and I thought I could get through. I asked him and he gave me a great run."Winning trainer Bill Mott said the win was magnified by the fact the Stephen Foster was a "Win and You're In" race for the Breeders' Cup Classic -- at Santa Anita, site of his previous biggest win."He seems like he's an improving horse and you'd have to say he's one of the top handicap horses in the country," Mott said. "It was a very good field tonight and I feel proud of our horse that he was able to beat such a good field."The Stephen Foster was not the only weekend action in the Classic division. Also:-- Neck 'n Neck stalked the pace in Saturday's $100,000, Matt Winn Stakes for 3-year-olds at Churchill Downs, easily assumed the lead and drew off to win by 7 1/4 lengths. Stealcase outlasted Macho Macho for second and Right to Vote and Master Rick completed the order of finish. Neck 'n Neck, a Flower Alley colt, ran the 1 1/16 miles on the main track in 1:43.72 under Leandro Goncalves. "Honestly, I expected him to run very well," winning trainer Ian Wilkes said. "But did I expect him to win that easily? No." He said he has not picked out a next race for Neck 'n Neck.-- Le Bernardin got a lead in the stretch run in Sunday's $100,000, Grade III Pegasus Stakes at Monmouth Park, then held off a determined bid by Easter Gift to win by a neck. The favorite, Good Morning Diva, finished third. Le Bernardin, a Bernardini colt, ran the 1 1/16 miles on a fast track in 1:44.51 with Mike Luzzi up. The Darley Stable homebred improved his lifetime mark to three wins from five starts. "The horse seemed to be lugging in for much of the race, but Mike did a great job," winning trainer Kiaran McLaughlin said. "I've never noticed that he's been a tough horse to ride in the past, but Mike knows him well and did a great job today. The Haskell is obviously a race we'll look at after we see how he comes out of this."We're under five months now to the Breeders' Cup World Championships at Santa Anita. Here's a look at weekend action in some of the other divisions:Ladies ClassicThose races in Dubai last March are starting to look like key races -- in reverse -- for the U.S. horses who fared so poorly in them. Last week it was Richard's Kid bouncing back to win in California. Saturday it was Royal Delta who kicked in the afterburners in the stretch run to win the $150,000 Grade II Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs by 8 lengths. In her last previous start, the 4-year-old Empire Maker filly finished ninth in the World Cup. Saturday it was no contest as jockey Mike Smith didn't need to provide any encouragement from mid-stretch on. Afleeting Lady led briefly and finished best of the rest, 4 1/2 lengths ahead of St. John's River. Royal Delta ran the 9 furlongs in 1:49.49 -- more than a full second faster than Ron the Greek ran the same distance in the next race. "Without a doubt, it was very good to see," said winning trainer Bill Mott. "She had a nice, smooth trip today and gave a good effort. She's a champion. She was a deserving champion last year and it looks like right now, from what we saw tonight, there are more good things to come." Royal Delta last year won the Ladies Classic and the Eclipse Award as top 3-year-old filly.Love Theway Youare ran by the odds-on favorite, Include Me Out, in the stretch run of Saturday's $250,000, Grade I Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park and went on to post the 18-1 upset win by 2 1/2 lengths. It was a long way back to Zafeen's Pearl in third. Rock and Glory pulled her way to the lead but stopped badly and was eased at the end. Love Theway Youare, a 4-year-old Arch filly, ran the 9 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:51.10 under Garrett Gomez. Love Theway Youare had been running in Grade I and Grade II races without a win. Her last victory was in an optional claimer 14 months ago and in her last race, the Marj Everett Memorial a month ago, she bobbled at the start and dropped her rider. Maria Ayala, assistant to winning trainer Myung Kwon Cho, said she told Gomez "to watch the replays of this horse before the race and he said, 'Okay, I've got it now.' She's been training really well." Joe Talamo, who rode Include Me Out, noted his filly tends to pull herself up when she strikes the lead. "In hindsight," he said, "I wish I would have waited a little longer."Love and Pride got to the front in Saturday's $150,000, Grade III Obeah Stakes at Delaware park and held off the odds-on favorite, Tiz Miz Sue for a 1 3/4-length victory. Check Point checked in third. Love and Pride, a 4-year-old A.P. Indy filly, ran the 9 furlongs on a fast track in 1:49.91. The Obeah Stakes is the prep for the $750,000 Grade II Delaware Handicap to be run on July 21. "She was awesome," winning rider Jeremy Rose said. "She has one heck of a cruising gear … . I am not sure who is coming for the Del 'Cap, but I think today she showed she is worthy of consideration." Tiz Miz Sue's trainer, Steve Hobby, said he is still looking at that race, too, dismissing Saturday's result as a "lone speed" outcome. "When you're alone on the lead, you're tough. Especially a good horse like that," Hobby said of Love and Pride.TurfTurbo Compressor led from start to finish in Saturday's $500,000 Colonial Turf Cup at Colonial Downs, holding off Air Support at the end by 1 1/2 lengths. Rahystrada finished third. Turbo Compressor, a 4-year-old Halo's Image ridgling, covered the 1 3/16 miles on firm turf in 1:55.15 with Joe Bravo riding. The race was run under the lights for the first time. Trainer Todd Pletcher put Turbo Compressor on the grass in a Gulfstream Park allowance race in March and he responded with a win. After finishing eighth in the Grade I Turf Classic at Churchill May 5th, he made it two of three on grass in Saturday's Turf Cup. "We knew if he got to the lead, we had a great chance to win the race," co-owner Nerina Morales said. "He loved the grass course but we were concerned about racing at night. We didn't know how dark it was going to be. But it turned out to be great. He's our baby."At Belmont Park, Summer Front was trapped on the rail in the stretch run of Saturday's $150,000, Grade III Hill Prince Stakes for 3-year-olds while Howe Great worked his way to the lead. But when jockey Ramon Dominguez got Summer Front out for room, he quickly downshifted, accelerated and made up the difference, winning by a half length. Film Shot was always close and finished third. Summer Front, a War Front colt, ran the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:33.74. Dominguez admitted he was "concerned about being on the inside. Unfortunately, I had no choice … . A move like that always takes a lot of horse out of you, and I was very impressed with him." Summer Front now has won all four of his career starts on the grass. He was second in the Grade III Lexington over the Keeneland all-weather surface and his only bad effort was on the Belmont main track in the Grade II Peter Pan, where he stumbled and finished eighth. "I've always liked my horse," winning trainer Christophe Clement said. "I messed up by running him in the Lexington and Peter Pan. But I had to try because he really trained well on dirt and it'd be a mistake not to try." He said he will look at the Grade II Virginia Derby at Colonial Downs on July 21.Filly & Mare TurfCentre Court hit the front entering the stretch in Saturday's $100,000 Regret Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Churchill Downs, bumped with Colonial Flag and then went on to win by a length over that rival. Treasured Up rallied from well back to finish third, a half length farther back. Centre Court, a Smart Strike filly, finished the 9 furlongs on firm turf in 1:48.25 with Javier Castellano in the irons. "We will probably go to the American Oaks, but there are a lot of options," winning trainer Rusty Arnold said. "There are some good races in New York and the Virginia Oaks also is a nice race. We'll see how she comes back from this one."A three-way battle to the wire capped Saturday's $100,000, Grade III Edward P. Evans All Along Stakes at Colonial Downs with Snow Top Mountain coming out a neck the best. Clair Skies Ahead was second, just a head better than Shimmering Moment. The favorite, La Pernelle, finished fifth. Snow Top Mountain, a 5-year-old Najran mare, got the 9 furlongs on firm turf in 1:49.48 with Paco Lopez aboard.Turf MileWednesday's $200,000 Oliver Stakes for 3-year-olds at 1 mile on the Indiana Downs turf drew a field of six horses whose last starts were at six different tracks -- from Belmont Park to Turf Paradise. Dale Romans invaded with the coupled entry of Silver Max and Cozzetti, which went off as the heavy odds-on favorite and ran 1-2. Silver Max led every step of the way and won by 6 3/4 lengths with his entrymate from well back to take second by a neck over Travel Advisory. Silver Max, a Badge of Silver colt, got home in 1:33.88 with Victor Lebron aboard. It was the fifth straight win for Silver Max since he ran fifth in the Grade III Holy Bull at Gulfstream Park way back in January. The streak also includes the Grade III Transylvania at Keeneland, the Grade II American Turf Stakes at Churchill Downs and the Arlington Classic.Action Andy went quickly to the lead in Saturday's $50,000 Da Hoss Stakes at Colonial Downs, turned back a bid by Sleepless Knight and went on to win by a half length over that rival. Followmyfootsteps followed in third. Action Andy, a 5-year-old Gators N Bears gelding, finished the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:36.01 with Horacio Karamanos up.Turf SprintBen's Cat bounced back from a couple subpar efforts to win Sunday's $150,000 Parx Dash at Parx Racing by 2 lengths over odds-on favorite Bridgetown. Perfect Officer finished third. Ben's Cat, a 6-year-old Parker's Storm Cat gelding, finished the 5 furlongs on firm turf in 54.96 with Julian Pimentel in the irons. Ben's Cat was a candidate for last year's Breeders' Cup but trainer King Leatherbury wasn't able to raise the money to get him nominated. JuvenileRay's Away dueled to the lead in Saturday's $200,000 (Canadian) Victoria Stakes at Woodbine, then opened up in the stretch to win by 2 1/2 lengths over Honorable Guest. Allaboutcaroline and Dan the Tin Man completed the order of finish. Ray's Away, a Kentucky-bred Limehouse colt out of the Capote mare Sorus, ran the 5 furlongs on the all-weather track in 58.28 seconds under Christopher Griffith.Amarish dueled his way to the lead in Saturday's $100,000 Willard L. Proctor Memorial at Hollywood Park, then drew off smartly to win by 4 1/2 lengths. Moreno's Mine finished second, a length ahead of Undrafted. Amarish, a Scat Daddy colt out of the Awesome Again mare Issues, ran the 5 1/2 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:04.55 with Edwin Maldonado up. "He's very competitive and good minded," winning trainer Jeff Bonde said. "He walks like a horse who has done it a hundred times. We'll have a team meeting to figure out what's next."First-time starter Anytime Magic stalked the pace in Saturday's $50,000 Lost in the Fog Stakes at Golden Gate Fields, then took over and won by 2 1/4 lengths over the favorite, Native Treasure. Saint Prado finished third. Anytime Magic, a Fusaichi Pegasus gelding out of the Cat Thief mare Sambuca Classica, ran the 5 furlongs on the all-weather track in 59.59 seconds with David Lopez up for trainer Robert Hess Sr.World Venturer circled around the leaders in Saturday's $100,000 TTA Sales Futurity for state-bred colts and geldings at Lone Star Park and cleared the field, winning by 2 1/4 lengths. Changing Karma finished second and Validated Blarney was third. World Venturer, a Wimbledon gelding, ran the 5 furlongs in 58.55 with Jamie Theriot aboard.Juvenile FilliesMiss Empire survived a bit of a rough start in Saturday's $100,000 Cinderella Stakes at Hollywood Park, sat off the early pace and then took complete charge in the lane, winning by 4 3/4 lengths over Awesome Annie. Tilde finished third and the favorite, Unusual Way, finished seventh. Miss Empire, an Empire Maker filly out of the Rajab mare Miss Excitement, ran the 5 1/2 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:05.00 with Kevin Krigger aboard.At Lone Star Park, Falling Star rallied three-wide to the lead turning for home in Saturday's $100,000 TTA Sales Futurity for Texas-bred 2-year-old fillies and controlled things the rest of the way, winning by 1 1/4 lengths. Pardonmecomingthru finished second, 2 lengths ahead of Miss Goodthing. Falling Star, a daughter of Too Much Bling, ran the 5 furlongs on a fast track in 58.31 seconds under Brian McNeil.K B's Princess chased the pace early in Saturday's $75,000 C.O. "Ken" Kendrick Memorial for New Mexico-bred fillies at SunRay Park, went to the lead when asked and won by 2 lengths over Lakehouse Fun. La Luz finished third. K B's Princess, making her first start, ran 4 1/2 furlongs on a fast track in 52.39 seconds with Alfredo Juarez Jr. riding.Elsewhere:FranceValyra rallied by the tiring leaders in the late going to upset Sunday's Group 1 Prix de Diane Longines, or French Oaks. With Johnny Murtagh up for trainer Jean-Claude Rouget, Valyra prevailed by 3/4 of a length over Beauty Parlor. Rjwa did her best running late to be up for third. Valyra, a daughter of Azamour, ran the 10 1/2 furlongs on good to soft going in 2:10.11. "When she got to the front she just pricked her ears a little. I think she's a filly on the improve and she could get even better," Murtagh said.Belmont ParkDealbata rated off the early speed in Saturday's $90,000 Monhegan Sky Stakes for fillies and mares, got through between horses and led a furlong out, then won by a length over late-running Bubbly Jane. Federation led briefly and held third. Dealbata, a 4-year-old, Irish-bred Dubawi filly, ran 1 1/16 miles on the firm inner turf course in 1:42.70 with Dominguez landing another one. It was the first U.S. start for the filly, who posted three wins and a second from five starts in France.Johannesburg Smile led from the early stages of Sunday's $90,000 Lemon Drop Kid Stakes, put some separation on the field in the lane and stayed well enough to win by a half length over Schoolyard Dreams. The favorite, Alma d'Oro, settled for third. Johannesburg Smile, a 5-year-old son of Johannesburg, ran the mile on a fast track in 1:35.48 with Cornelio Velasquez up.Hollywood ParkMaking her first start since last New Year's Eve, Turbulent Descent got to the lead late in the stretch run in Sunday's $70,000 Desert Stormer Handicap and edged clear to win by 1 1/4 lengths over Izzy Rules. Mildly Offensive finished third. Turbulent Descent, a 4-year-old Congrats filly, ran the 6 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:09.25 for jockey David Flores.

Nakano finished second and Leopard Rock rallied from last to finish third. Becausei'mworthit, a 4-year-old Indian Express filly, completed 5 furlongs on a fast main track in 58.52 seconds with Jose Lopez in the irons. The race was moved from the grass course.

"And that's what she did."Penn NationalLenape Rim put a head in front of Little Often Anni at the wire in Friday's $75,000 Lyphard Stakes for Pennsylvania-bred fillies and mares.

Lenape Rim, a 4-year-old Rimrod filly, finished the 1 1/16 miles on firm turf in 1:43.71 for jockey William Otero.Arlington ParkSaturday was Prairie State Festival day at the suburban Chicago oval with a half dozen races, each worth $125,000, carded for Illinois-registered steeds.In the White Oak Handicap for 3-year-olds and up, Capt.

Bullet Bob, a 6-year-old son of Mutakddim, finished the 6 furlongs on the all-weather surface in 1:10.66 with Tim Thornton riding. The odds-on favorite, River Bear, broke last and beat only one rival, putting paid to a three-race win streak. "I waited before I got into him and hoped nobody else was coming," Thornton said.Sandia Crest rallied outside Sweet Luca and was just up to win the Springfield Stakes for 3-year-olds by 1 1/4 lengths over that rival. Real Power also ran well late to take third. Sandia Crest, an Indy Snow gelding, ran the one-turn mile over the all-weather surface in 1:38.28 with James Graham riding. The win was his first since his maiden-breaker at Hawthorne four races back in early April. "At the half-mile pole, he started taking me," Graham said. "I let him take me as far as he wanted."Third Chance only needed one chance in the Isaac Murphy Handicap for fillies and mares. With Francisco Torres up, the 4-year-old Kafwain filly overhauled early leader Kip Berries on the turn and then drew off with a burst of speed, winning by 6 1/2 lengths. Algonquin Posse was up for second with Our Lady in Red finishing third. Third Chance ran the 6 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:10.92. She now has won her last six starts against state-bred rivals with two sixth-place finishes at Gulfstream Park sandwiched between. Third Chance is owned in part by local newscaster Ron Magers.La Tia, fresh off a 9-length maiden win over the same track at the same distance, proved too much to handle in the Purple Violet for 3-year-old fillies. With Constantino Roman in the irons, the City Place filly set a good clip and wasn't challenged, winning by 8 1/4 lengths. Dolly Peach was second and Wonder Country rallied along the rail to finish third. La Tia ran the mile on the all-weather track in 1:38.24. "I was pretty confident," winning trainer Brian Williamson said.Cumulonimble ran by pacesetting Katie the Lady in the stretch run of the Lincoln Heritage Handicap for fillies and mares and went on to win by 3 lengths. Katie the Lady and late-running Pathway dead-heated for second and third. Peyote Patty finished fourth. Cumulonimble, a 6-year-old Stormy Atlantic mare, got the 1 1/16 miles on firm turf in 1:42.66 with James Graham in the irons.Mr. Mischief got to the lead in the Black Tie Affair Handicap and never gave it up, winning off by 1 1/2 lengths.

Mr. Mischief, a 7-year-old Stormy Atlantic gelding, ran 9 furlongs on the firm Arlington turf in 1:42.82 for jockey E.T. Baird.

Strike Red finished third. Moment of Majesty, a 5-year-old Saint Liam mare, ran the 7 furlongs on firm turf in 1:20.57 with Gerry Olquin up.Pender Harbour stayed close to the pace in Sunday's $125,000 (Canadian) Steady Growth Stakes for Ontario-sired horses, then went by pacesetter Good Better Best to win by 2 lengths over that rival. Guipago finished third.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 27 (UPI) -- Israel is reported to have sent messages to the Turkish government in recent days saying it's interested in restoring "a more positive dynamic" in badly strained relations with its onetime strategic ally.Upcoming visits to the region by U.S. President Barack Obama and his new secretary of state, John Kerry, could have a lot to do with it.The Americans are keen for strategic reasons to have the two non-Arab military powers in the eastern Mediterranean back together to possibly restore a modicum of stability in a region that's swirling with conflict, sectarian hatreds and political turmoil.Obama is to visit Israel in March. Kerry is on his maiden trip as top U.S. diplomat and is to visit Ankara, where he's expected to raise the issue of Turkish-Israeli relations.There appears to be an effort by both sides to patch up a relationship, encouraged by the United States which viewed the Turkey-Israeli alliance as vitally important for regional stability.But Israel and Turkey are also being nudged toward reconciliation by the growing turmoil in the region, particularly Iran's confrontation with the United States and Israel, and the increasingly dangerous civil war in Syria.Israel and Muslim Turkey forged a discreet alliance that began in 1984 but became a full-blown strategic partnership in 1996.But the entente began to fray after Turkey's 2002 parliamentary elections when the Islamist Justice and Development Party gained power under Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The new prime minister was uncomfortable with the close links that Ankara had established with the Jewish state through Turkey's powerful military establishment, with U.S. blessings.Erdogan was impatient with Israel's foot-dragging in the peace process and the continued occupation of Palestinian land.The break came in May 2010 when a Turkish-organized flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid for the blockaded Gaza Strip was intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters of the Mediterranean. Naval commandos killed nine Turks aboard a Turkey ship, the Mavi Marmara.Israel refused Ankara's demands for a formal apology and compensation, claiming it acted in self-defense.Erdogan withdrew his ambassador, scrapped major military contracts worth billions of dollars to Israel's export-hungry defense industry, and halted all military training cooperation with Israel.The Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government has sent messages to Ankara over the last two weeks on the need to "get more positive vectors" in their relations.There were no other details, and given the popular animosities stoked up in both nations since 2010, there's not likely to be because Netanyahu, who's trying to stitch together a governing coalition as Israel's isolation grows, and Erdogan, with overwhelmingly pro-Palestinian electorate, must both tread carefully.Erdogan's been striving to restore Turkey as a paramount regional Muslim power and making up with Israel is unlikely to impress his neighbors.But wider strategic issues are at stake with the bloodbath in Syria threatening to engulf neighboring Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon amid Arab turmoil.Despite the vitriolic barbs Israel and Turkey have hurled at one another since 2010, there are senior officials on both sides who've been quietly seeking to end the rift.Israel's outgoing defense minister, Ehud Barak, the country's most decorated war hero, has consistently worked for a rapprochement, no doubt with substantial defense sales and access to important training programs in mind.On Feb. 17, the Turkish newspaper Today's Zaman, reported Israel, under U.S. pressure, had allowed the delivery of electronic warfare suites for two Turkish AWACs that had been blocked in 2010.Two days later, Turkey's Radikal newspaper reported secret talks under way to find an accommodation, with Israel prepared to issue an apology for the Mavi Marmara killings, possibly timed with Obama's visit.There have been other reports of secret talks in Geneva and Cairo."Turkish-Israeli reconciliation has, at least for a while, been an important item on the U.S. foreign policy agenda in the Middle East," observed Mideast analyst Ramzy Baroud."Neither Turkey and Israel, nor the U.S. and NATO are able to sustain the status quo -- the rift between Israel and Turkey -- for much longer."But returning to an old paradigm, where Turkey is no longer an advocate of Palestinian rights and champion of Arab and Muslim causes, could prove even more costly," Baroud noted.

Police used tear gas in a bid to disperse the crowd, The New York Times reported.Witnesses in Tunisia said a U.S.-run school was burned and looted, while in Sudan rage was directed at other missions as well.In Nigeria, about 2,000 people assembled outside a mosque in the city of Jos, CNN reported. Police fired warning shots in an effort to break up the crowd.There were many smaller demonstrations and riots, the BBC said. In London, about 200 people joined a non-violent protest outside the U.S. Embassy, while a crowd of about 1,000 burned U.S. President Barack Obama in effigy in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were on hand at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, Md., Friday as the bodies of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. diplomats killed Tuesday in Libya arrived in the United States.During a brief ceremony, Obama said Stevens was "everything America could want in an ambassador" and promised the sacrifice of the U.S. diplomats "will never be forgotten.""We will bring to justice those who took them from us," he said. "We will stand fast against the violence on our diplomatic missions."Most of all, even in our grief, we will be resolute," the president said. "Because we are Americans, we will hold our heads high."The United States of America will never retreat from the world."Clinton called on leaders in the Middle East to deal with violence in their countries, saying people in those nations "did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob.""We will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spine and face the future undaunted," she said.The violence began Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York and Washington. The protests were ostensibly sparked by a 14-minute trailer for "Innocence of Muslims" posted on YouTube depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a power- and sex-crazed bisexual pedophile.In Cairo, where more than 200 protesters have been injured since Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square as well as an area outside the U.S. Embassy in the city's Garden City area following midday prayers, Ahram Online reported."If you love the prophet, stay peaceful," Imam Mazhar Shaheen exhorted the crowd.However, Ahram Online said Salafist protesters, waving black flags, demanded action.What were described as "limited clashes" were reported outside the embassy grounds and the Semiramis InterContental Hotel.Egyptian soldiers began building a wall to protect the embassy.Late in the day, the Muslim Brotherhood organized a demonstration to show unity between Muslims and Christians, al-Masry al-Youm reported.In Libya, where Stevens and three other U.S. diplomats were killed Tuesday, the Shariah Supporters Battalion denied it was responsible for the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, The Tripoli Post reported.The Libyan government said Thursday it arrested four people in the consulate attack as Libyan and U.S. officials mounted a manhunt for others believed to have been involved.Shouts of "Death to America" and "We condemn the film" rang through Nangarhar province in Afghanistan Friday where demonstrators burned a U.S. flag.The protests spread to other countries' embassies, including the German and British embassies in Khartoum, Sudan, CNN reported. At the German Embassy, demonstrators replaced the German flag with an Islamist banner. Military sources told CNN late Friday a team of U.S. Marines was sent to Khartoum to protect U.S. posts there, with similar teams going to Libya and Yemen.Vice President Joe Biden called Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha Friday to express concern for the security of the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions in Khartoum, the White House said in a statement. Biden reminded Taha his government is responsible for protecting diplomats and diplomatic facilities and said the United States' top priority is the safety of its diplomatic presence abroad.The Times quoted German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle as saying part of the German Embassy in Khartoum had been "stormed" and "set aflame" but all personnel were safe.Security personnel were in place at U.S. diplomatic posts throughout the Middle East, an unidentified senior Obama administration official told CNN."We are in a full-court press at every single one of the posts in the Middle East and anywhere else there is any chance of demonstrations after Friday services to make sure nothing bad happens -- and to have the security in place in case bad things do happen," the official said Thursday.Yemeni security forces, backed by water cannons, blocked streets near the U.S. Embassy Friday as several dozen protesters gathered near the mission, carrying posters and shouting slogans. CNN reported witnesses said security forces opened fire on protesters but it wasn't clear what type of weapons were used. Two protesters died in demonstrations there Thursday. The Pentagon sent 50 marines to Sanaa to secure U.S. interests, the Times said.Iraqi protesters denounced the United States and Israel, and called for the expulsion of U.S. diplomats and an apology for the film."We want the U.S. government to prove that there is justice by stopping this movie and punishing the director and his staff," the Times quoted Sheik Ahmad al-A'ani as saying in Baghdad.PHOTOS: Anti-American attacks, protests in Middle EastElsewhere in Iraq, U.S. and Israeli flags were burned as some preachers expressed disbelief Stevens and the others had been killed in an attack and instead accused the United States of orchestrating the killings as a pretext for an attack, the Times said.In Gaza, demonstrators gathered outside Parliament where the crowd stomped on U.S. and Israeli flags, the Times said.Egyptian leaders have been working to repair diplomatic strains with the United States created by their initial response to Tuesday's assault on the U.S. Embassy, when they focused more on anti-American opinion than on condemning the violence, the Times said.During a phone call Wednesday, Obama warned Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi U.S.-Egyptian relations could be in danger if Cairo failed to protect U.S. diplomats and respond more firmly against the attacks.The Organization of Islamic Cooperation has condemned the violent acts on U.S. missions in Cairo and Benghazi, with its secretary-general saying such actions could not be condoned under any circumstances, Khaama Press reported.Speaking from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, OIC Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said the anti-Islam film was deplorable but reacting with violence cannot be accepted.Ihsanoglu called for restraint and urged law enforcement officials to do what was necessary to restore calm.

Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Video footage of 3-year-old John Boarman adamantly denying having eating sprinkles, even though his face is covered up in them, has gone viral ever since his mother, Erica, posted it on YouTube last Wednesday. In the beginning of the clip, Erica, asks John if he's had any snacks, a question that seems to appall the 3-year-old, as he fiercely denies having eating anything. What he doesn't realize is that his face, hands and chin are covered up in red sprinkles. The mom continues to confront him by showing him the half-empty sprinkle box which he again denies having opened. Erica then probes John by telling him that is not nice to "tell stories and lie," and eventually lets him know that his whole face is covered with sprinkles, but John stays firm in his position. "No, no I did not eat spinkles. I did not," he says before the clip ends.The concerned mother accompanied the video with a note on how she sat down with John after recording the clip to have a nice and long conversation about the truth."My 3 year old fibbing to my face, and it is surprisingly cute haha! After I filmed it we had a VERY long talk about the difference between telling the truth and not telling the truth. He has an amazing imagination and loves to tell us stories. I saw this as a sweet moment, something that every child goes through...where they try to push the boundaries to see how far they can go. And I thought I'd share it with my friends and family. And apparently, the world seems to enjoy it, too. We are currently working on the difference, and he is doing really well. :)," she wrote.

Wiki
Wallace Hume Carothers (April 27, 1896 – April 29, 1937) was an American chemist, inventor and the leader of organic chemistry at DuPont, credited with the invention of nylon.
Carothers was a group leader at the DuPont Experimental Station laboratory, near Wilmington, Delaware, where most polymer research was done. Carothers was an organic chemist who, in addition to first developing nylon, also helped lay the groundwork for Neoprene. After receiving his Ph.D., he taught at several universities before he was hired by DuPont to work on fundamental research.
He married the former Helen Sweetman on February 21, 1936. Carothers had been troubled by periods of mental depression since his youth. Despite his success with nylon, he felt that he had not accomplished much and had run out of ideas. His unhappiness was compounded by the death of his sister, Isobel, and on the evening of April 28, 1937 he checked into a Philadelphia hotel room and committed suicide by drinking a cocktail of lemon juice laced with potassium cyanide. His daughter, Jane, was born seven months later on November 27, 1937.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
