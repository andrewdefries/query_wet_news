BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 8 (UPI) -- Governments and regimes across the Middle East and North Africa, a major arms-buying region, are plagued by military corruption, including weapons deals with major powers, the global watchdog Transparency International says.That's hardly news. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other regional states have been implicated in scandals involving major Western defense companies such as Lockheed Martin of the United States or Britain's BAE Systems over the years.But the anti-graft watchdog noted in a report that two years after the pro-democracy revolutions of the so-called Arab Spring that toppled longtime dictatorships in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, the defense sectors in all 19 countries of the region remain riddled with corruption.Endemic across-the-board official graft was one of the key issues that triggered the uprisings that began in Tunisia in January 2011.Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Syria and Yemen are listed with "critical" levels of defense corruption in the report, released in Beirut this week. It took two years to compile. That means "there is hardly any accountability of defense and security establishments in all of these states," the report observed.The best-scoring countries were listed as Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.But the report concluded that the risk of military corruption in all 19 states, including Israel, is "high."The region, overwhelmingly made up of absolute monarchies or totalitarian republics, "has several key problems: excessive secrecy, lack of oversight and lack of citizen engagement," the report noted.With defense procurement usually in the hands of extended royal families or ruling clans, with no accountability or public scrutiny -- with the exception of Kuwait where a feisty Parliament with limited powers has blocked deals that enrich members of the ruling dynasty in recent years -- this makes for widespread graft in official circles."Networks based on close family and business ties as well as restrictions on public debate and civil society freedom were found in most countries assessed in the region," the report noted."Not one of the countries has a credible or safe 'whistle-blowing' system through which concerned officers and defense officials can report suspected corruption ... Yet the potential for changes exists."For instance, in Syria, gripped in a two-year-old civil war, TI reported that attempts to initiate debate on defense issues were crushed and those involved thrown into prison by the minority regime in Damascus that's battling for survival.Defense procurement was firmly in the hands of the Assad dynasty, which has ruled since 1970, and its associated clans in the minority Alawite sect. But even if the current president, Bashar Assad, is toppled, TI postulated that doesn't mean the defense sector corruption will automatically go away.The evidence so far, with four dictators brought down and Assad's demise widely predicted, indicates "that replacing authoritarian leaders with elected one sis not enough to eradicate corruption," said Mark Pyman, director of TI's defense and security program."Corruptive structures have been allowed to develop and mature within defense institutions and armed forces over 20 or 30 years and a regime change will not make them go away."Egypt's military establishment controls a large segment of the economy and run commercial enterprises that aren't subjected to public scrutiny, as is also the case in Algeria, Syria and Yemen.Incoming regimes seek to keep the generals on their side, if indeed the generals aren't directly involved in the regime change as has been the case in Yemen.Two years after Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, a former air force commander who gave the generals free rein in business, was toppled, "there are no signs that elected leaders are working to open defense institutions to public oversight," Pyman observed.In Israel, which boasts it's the only democracy in the Middle East, the military establishment wields immense political power and holds sway over the country's high-tech defense industry, the most advanced in the region.Over the years, many shady defense sales have been conducted by former military officers turned arms dealers accredited to the defense ministry. Few have been brought to book, largely because of their military connections.In March 2012, India, a major buyer of Israeli weapons systems, banned Israel Military Industries, a major arms manufacturer, from bidding on contracts because of alleged massive kickbacks in a 2009 bribery scandal.

EVANSTON, Ill., Dec. 18 (UPI) -- Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Ill., said about 50 rejected applicants were mistakenly sent an acceptance e-mail.Northwestern spokeswoman Megan Washburn said a "technological glitch" in Kellogg's system caused acceptance letters to be e-mailed to the rejected applicants, the Chicago Tribune reported Thursday."It was not human error," she said. "It has never happened before. Our systems have been in place for years. We have never experienced a problem."Washburn said Beth Flye, Kellogg's director of admissions and financial aid, began Tuesday to contact the rejected applicants who received the mistaken e-mails. She said the affected applicants will be reimbursed for their $235 application fee."Certainly we're very, very sorry," Washburn said. "It's an isolated incident and something we definitely have corrected and will work to ensure it never happens again."

NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- A leaked user's manual for Google upcoming Nexus 4 smartphone confirms the handset will feature wireless charging, U.S. tech watchers say.The leaked quick-start manual shows an induction coil at the back of the LG-built device, which would allow it to be charged by placing it on a charging mat rather than having to plug it in, CNET reported Monday.The manual mentions a "wireless charger" and informs Nexus 4 owners they must only "use an approved model."The manual was spotted after LG Australia released some product pages overnight, CNET said.The Nexus 4 is expected to include 2 gigabytes of RAM, 8 gigabytes of storage, a 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera and near-field communications for wireless payments.Google had intended to unveil the Nexus 4 at an event in New York Monday morning but postponed the event because of approaching Hurricane Sandy.Google did not announce a rescheduled date, saying it would do so in the near future.

YANGON, Myanmar, Oct. 26 (UPI) -- Buddhist monks in Myanmar have called for sympathizers of Rohingya people to be branded "national traitors," a report by a humanitarian group said.The call comes as tensions mount in Rakhine state, formerly called Arakan state, where violence between Buddhist ethnic Rakhinese and Muslim Rohingya has claimed several hundred lives since the summer.The BBC reported more than 1,000 homes have been burned since fighting broke out Sunday in Minbya and Mrauk U townships. The Myanmar government instituted a nighttime curfew in the towns in an attempt to quell the fighting.The Myanmar media website, operated out of Norway, Democratic Voice of Burma -- the former name for Myanmar -- said it has seen a document produced by the All-Arakanese Monks' Solidarity Conference.In it, monks call for the creation of security groups led by monks to enforce discipline throughout the state, and "to establish a magazine, covering all of Arakan state, to promote (Buddhist) religion."The monks also called for Rohingya to be expelled from Myanmar, the DVB report said.Expulsion would mean being sent to neighboring Bangladesh from where they are believed to have migrated over the past century into the Buddhist-majority Rakhine.The latest violence stems from the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman allegedly by three Muslims in the region in May. Buddhists responded with an attack that killed 10 Muslims and more violence and burning of homes resulted on both sides.In an attempt to calm the situation Myanmar President Thein Sein called for a state of emergency in several areas and said the confrontations have nothing to do with religious differences."The president has been very clear that the Arakan issue should not be seen as a religious one but if anyone is trying to establish it as a religious issue it's definitely the monks," said Chris Lewa, head of the monitoring group Arakan Project, based in Bangkok.Lewa, who recently returned from the Rakhine capital Sittwe, told DVB that ethnic Rakhines are afraid to be seen helping foreigners traveling in the area."The Rakhines are mostly afraid of their own community if they do anything that can be seen to be helping or supporting the Muslim community," said Lewa, whose Arakan Project is a member of the Asia-Pacific Refugee Rights Network.Thousand of Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh.Last week, Thein Sein suspended plans for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to open a humanitarian liaison office in Sittwe, supposedly after seeing monks across the country stage mass rallies against the OIC.Tensions in Rakhine state flared over the past 50 years, since the military takeover in 1962 and when the junta declared Rohingya non-citizens in the 1980s.Around 735,000 Rohingya live in northern Rakhine state, the Arakan Project estimates. They are related to the Chittagonian Bengali across the border but are distinct from the majority Buddhist population of Myanmar, who are of Southeast Asian origin.Rohingya who flee Myanmar aren't greeted with open arms in Bangladesh, where thousands languish in poorly maintained refugee camps, effectively making them stateless.

| License Photo	MCLEAN, Va., Sept. 21 (UPI) -- Republicans pounced on comments from U.S. Senate Democratic candidate Tim Kaine of Virginia, who said he'd consider a minimum income tax for all Americans.Kaine, a former governor of Virginia, made the comment Thursday during a debate with Republican George Allen, another former governor and Kaine's opponent in the senatorial race, The Washing Port reported. It was their first televised debate.After the debate, Allen said Kaine's record "is always one of looking to raise taxes. When he was governor, he tried to raise taxes on people earning as little as $17,000 a year. He wanted to raise taxes on buying used cars."Kaine said in the debate that he would be open to "some minimum tax level for everyone." He later qualified his statement, saying he didn't actually propose a minimum income tax, the Post said.He was responding to a question about the controversial comment Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made about "47 percent" of Americans not paying income taxes."I would be open to a proposal that has some minimum tax level for everyone but I do insist many of the 47 percent that Governor Romney was going after pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than he does," Kaine said during the debate.Kaine's discussions of his plan for fixing the country's fiscal problems during the debate didn't involve such a tax, the Post said.On Wednesday, a Washington Post poll indicated Kaine had an 8 percentage point lead over Allen in what is considered to be among the most competitive races in the country.Kaine and Allen are battling to succeed the retiring Sen. James Webb, a Democrat. Allen lost the seat to Webb six years ago.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 (UPI) -- President Obama Tuesday included two openly gay women to the U.S. delegations to the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.While the president made no mention of the sexual orientation of the delegation members, his decision to send retired tennis champion Billy Jean King and Olympic silver medalist hockey player Caitlin Cahow to the ceremonies appeared to be an oblique message to Russia, which has come under criticism by gay rights organizations for its anti-gay laws.The Russian Parliament recently passed a law banning what lawmakers called "propaganda" about "non-traditional sexual relations." However, President Vladimir has stated gay athletes and spectators will not face discrimination at the Sochi Games in February.International Olympic Committee officials have said a special protest zone will be set up during the games, Time magazine said.Obama will not attend the Games himself.Named to the Feb. 7 opening ceremony delegation along with King were: Janet Napolitano, Obama's former homeland security secretary who recently became president of the University of California; Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia; Robert Nabors, assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for policy; and Brian Boitano, Olympic figure skating gold medalist.Besides Cahow, the Feb. 23 closing ceremony delegation will include: McFaul; William Burns, deputy secretary of state; Bonnie Blair, multiple Olympic gold medalist speed skater; and Eric Heiden, also a multiple Olympic gold medalist speed skater.

| License Photo	TEHRAN, Sept. 6 (UPI) -- An intercepted order from Iran instructs militants in Iraq to hit the U.S. Embassy and other interests if a military strike on Syria occurs, U.S. officials said.Officials said the recently intercepted message was sent by Qasem Soleimani, head of Revolutionary Guards' Qods Force, to Iranian-supported Shiite militias in Iraq, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.In it, Soleimani said Shiite groups must be ready to respond with force should a U.S. airstrike on Syria occur.The Journal said Iranian officials didn't respond to its request for comment.Iraqi Shiites have shown favorability toward the Alawite-dominated government of Syria and oppose U.S. strikes against President Bashar Assad's regime.U.S. officials said the American Embassy in Baghdad was a likely target but didn't describe other potential targets in Iraq, the Journal said.Military officials have been trying to determine the range of possible responses from Syria, Iran and their allies if the United States launches a military strike in response to evidence that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against Syrians in August in an attack on Damascus suburbs.The State Department issued an alert Thursday warning U.S. citizens against non-essential travel to Iraq and citing terrorist activity "at levels unseen since 2008."In Tehran, Iran's new president says his country will send humanitarian aid to Syria if Washington attacks it, but didn't repeat an earlier hardliner vow to attack Israel.At the same time, Supreme Ruler of Iran Ali Khamenei said the United States would make a mistake in attacking Syria and would "definitely suffer" as a result."If something happens to the Syrian people, the Islamic Republic of Iran will do its religious and humanitarian duties to send them food and medicine," President Hassan Rouhani told Iran's Assembly of Experts, a deliberative body of Islamic theologians that elects and removes Iran's supreme leader and supervises his activities.Khamenei, as supreme ruler, is Iran's head of state and highest ranking political and religious authority.Rouhani, an Assembly of Experts member since 1999, described the situation in Syria as "dire" and condemned "military attacks on countries in this region, especially on Syria," but made no mention in his remarks of retaliation against Israel.The commander in chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps said last week an attack on Syria would lead to the "destruction of Israel."Khamenei said in remarks reported by state-run Press TV U.S. officials had no right to make "humanitarian claims [given] their track record" in Iraq, Afghanistan and at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Diplomats and analysts said they were not sure if Rouhani's moderate message represented a significant policy shift in Iran.Nader Karimi Joni, an independent analyst and chief editor of the Iranian sociopolitical magazine Gozaresh, told the Los Angeles Times he interpreted Rouhani's reserved offer as following through on campaign promises to give priority to Iranians' desire for improved living conditions and an end to international isolation.The Times said Rouhani appeared to be outmaneuvering hard-liners in curbing overblown vows to defend Syria from threatened U.S. airstrikes.Iran, along with Russia, remains Syria's most important ally, a source of material support and intelligence.Iran's state-run media increasingly broadcast programs reminding people Iranians suffered chemical weapons attacks during the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, The Washington Post reported.

Alexi Casilla Lora (born July 20, 1984 in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic) is a Major League Baseball second baseman and shortstop for the Minnesota Twins.
Casilla was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Angels in 2003. On December 9, 2005, the Angels traded Casilla to the Minnesota Twins for pitcher J.C. Romero. Casilla made his major league debut with the Twins in September of 2006, playing in 9 games.
In 2007, after a brief callup with the Twins, Casilla became the every-day second baseman after Luis Castillo was traded to the New York Mets. Casilla struggled, producing a .222 batting average with no home runs in 189 at-bats.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
