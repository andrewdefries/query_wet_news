WASHINGTON, June 28 (UPI) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Gov. Jeremy Stein said Friday the central bank will be cautious about unwinding its stimulus programs."If the [economic] news is bad, and it is confirmed by further bad news in October and November, this would suggest that the 7 percent unemployment goal is likely to be further away, and the remainder of the program would be extended accordingly," Stein said in prepared remarks for delivery at a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week the central bank could begin to slow down its $85 billion per month asset purchases this year and could possibly wind down the program completely in the middle of 2014.Three high ranking Fed officials sought to calm investors Thursday, saying the central bank was not rushing into any monetary policy changes if the economy was not strong enough to handle it.Stein seemed to sum up the Fed's week of clarifying the issue Friday."My only point is that consumers and businesses who look to asset prices for clues about the future stance of monetary policy should take care not to over-interpret these movements," he said."We have attempted in recent weeks to provide more clarity about the nature of our policy reaction function, but I view the fundamentals of our underlying policy stance as broadly unchanged," he said.

| License Photo	MADRID, March 14 (UPI) -- The European Aviation Safety Agency has certified that Airbus Military's new A400M airlifter meets full civil airworthiness standards.Airbus Military, which designed the aircraft to meet civilian and as well military standards, said the certification is "a critical step" toward delivery of the first A400M to the French air force."Certifying the A400M to civil as well as military standards has been a huge challenge for us, our suppliers and EASA itself," said Cedric Gautier, Airbus Military's head of A400M program. "But by providing a firm framework for certification from day one, to globally accepted standards, both we and the operators will see important benefits as the aircraft matures in service and new customers join the program."The EASA certification process involved the testing of the aircraft's handling in normal and failure conditions and more than 300 hours of function and reliability testing of its engines and systems.Military Initial Operating Clearance is ongoing, the company said, and tests have begun on military functions such as air-to-air refueling capabilities.

BURBANK, Calif., March 23 (UPI) -- Jay Leno has made more jabs at NBC after rumors mounted he will be replaced as "Tonight Show" host before his contract is up, The Hollywood Reporter said..The controversy was first ignited by jokes Leno made about NBC's February sweeps ratings, which caused NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt to take offense. Since the dust-up, rumors have been swirling that NBC has debated speeding up the timing of Leno's contract, which expires September 2014. Some top NBC executives would like Jimmy Fallon to take over as host of the "Tonight Show" in February 2014 to coincide with the airing of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, The Hollywood Reporter said.In reaction to the rumors, Leno has been making more jokes about the network during his opening monologues, the report said.On Friday he told the news report of Canadian doctors who removed a knife from the back of a man after it had been lodged there for three years."Imagine that. The guy had a knife in his back for three years. He must have worked at NBC too," Leno said.He continued by making a joke about a Carnival cruise that had recently gone awry."Have you heard about this alleged feud that I'm having with NBC? I think it's going to be OK," Leno said. "This is real. I had dinner last night with a bunch of executives. To make it up me, what they did, they are sending my wife and I on an all-expenses-paid Carnival cruise.""So it looks like it's going to be OK. Fantastic!" he added.

NAJAF, Iraq, April 14 (UPI) -- Gunmen assassinated a senior aide to Moqtada Sadr in Najaf, Iraq, following the cleric's secret return to Iraq under Iranian orders, a report says.Anonymous Iraqi sources for the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper said Iranian authorities ordered Sadr to leave his clerical studies in Qom because his presence "affect(ed) the course of relations between Tehran and Baghdad."The same sources said the aide to Sadr, Riyadh al-Nouri, was implicated in the assassination of prominent cleric Abdul-Majid al-Khoei, who was stabbed to death 24 hours after the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. Abdul-Majid is the son of Grand Ayatollah Abul-Qassim al-Khoei, who was once one of Saddam's most influential opponents.A statement on the Arabic language Web site Barutha news said Friday Jalal al-Dein al-Saghier, a key official in the Supreme Islamic Iraq Council, escaped an assassination attempt shortly before Nouri was gunned down. It was unclear if the two incidents were related.Media reports from Iraq said fighters loyal to Moqtada Sadr were engaged in tit-for-tat assassination attempts on members of the SIIC.

DETROIT, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Detroit Mayor David Bing said the repeal of Michigan's emergency management law threatens his city's efforts to get its fiscal house in order. In an interview with The Detroit News, Bing said Friday that unions representing municipal employees will be able to stall cuts in wages and benefits."Now that the law is not in effect anymore, all of the 25 initiatives that we had are probably up for a legal interpretation," Bing said. "It's a waste of money, it's a waste of time, and it's going to keep us from moving our agenda forward."The Detroit Police Officers Association sent a letter to the city Thursday, two days after the vote on the law, asking for restoration of cuts in salaries and benefits for police officers. The emergency management law allowed the governor to replace elected officials with appointed managers. Detroit bypassed having a manager by entering a consent agreement with the state.

GREENSBORO, N.C., Jan. 18 (UPI) -- North Carolina's law requiring doctors to show ultrasounds to women seeking abortions violates free speech rights, a federal judge ruled Friday. U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said the law compels doctors to deliver an anti-abortion message, the (Raleigh) News & Observer reported. She described the ultrasound requirement as a "one-size-fits-all provision."The Legislature passed the Women's Right to Know Act in 2011, overriding a veto by Bev Perdue, the Democrat who was then governor. Eagles ruled only on the ultrasound requirement, leaving other parts of the law standing, including a 24-hour waiting period and requirements that doctors must provide patients with information on the risks of abortion."This is a terrific victory for women in North Carolina," Paige Johnson of Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina said. "What was struck down was forcing a doctor to describe to a woman what she sees. I think anyone who hears that the government is encroaching on that level in a patient-doctor relationship is appalled."Paul Stam, a Republican and majority leader in the state House, said he hopes there will be an appeal.

TORONTO, Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Toronto's City Council voted Wednesday to ask crack-using Mayor Rob Ford to take a leave of absence and a poll indicated Torontonians widely agree. The City Council's vote on the motion, which came after Ford admitted having bought illegal drugs in the past two years after last week having said he had smoked crack cocaine, was 37-5, with Ford and his brother among those on the losing end, the National Post reported."I effed up," the embattled mayor said with a shrug of his shoulders just prior to the vote.The newspaper said council members later broke out laughing when Ford tried to introduce a motion calling for all them to undergo drug and alcohol testing. The Toronto Star reported a poll found 75 percent of city residents think Ford should resign or take a leave to seek treatment.At the heated meeting, Ford denied threatening Councilman Denzil Minnan-Wong, who sponsored the motion for a leave of absence. Minnan-Wong said Ford stood close to him in "a threatening way." Ford said he was just asking Minnan-Wong to sit down. "I did not threaten him in any shape or form," the mayor said. "He knows that. I asked him to take his seat. I have nothing to apologize for."Ford has been under fire since the Toronto Star reported he had been videotaped smoking crack. When Minnan-Wong asked him if he had bought illegal drugs in the past two years, Ford paused and responded "Yes, I have.""Our city's reputation has been damaged," Councilwoman Jaye Robinson said, reading the letter. "Together we stand to ask you to step aside and take a leave of absence. Let's get on with city business."Ford, who admitted publicly last week that he had smoked crack while in a "drunken stupor" has refused to step down and says he plans to run again when his current term ends in 18 months. He has predicted the election will be a "bloodbath."The Ipsos Reid poll was conducted from Friday to Tuesday on behalf of CTV News/CP24/CFRB Newstalk 1010 Radio. It surveyed 665 Toronto residents online. The margin of error is 4.3 percentage points.

Marin Čilić (Croatian pronunciation: , born 28 September 1988), is a Croatian professional tennis player. His career high ATP ranking is no. 9, achieved on February 22, 2010, following his best-ever performance at a Grand Slam, reaching the semi-finals in the 2010 Australian Open. Čilić developed his career at a tender age; his potential was realized by local hometown coaches who saw him play and encouraged his move to Zagreb for further training. He was soon befriended by his fellow countryman Goran Ivanišević who introduced him to current coach Bob Brett. He went on to turn professional in 2005.
Čilić was born and grew up in Međugorje, a town in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was raised Roman Catholic. His father Zdenko was determined that his sons - Marin and older brothers Vinko and Goran - would have the opportunities he lacked in playing sports. When the first tennis courts in the town were built in 1991, Marin and his friends were amongst the first to play on them. At the recommendation of Goran Ivanišević, Čilić moved in 2004 to San Remo, Italy at the age of 15 to work with Ivanišević's former coach Bob Brett.
Marin began playing on the junior ITF circuit in Spring 2004. At the start he played on clay courts, winning the La Vie Junior Cup Villach in singles and the Dutch Junior Open in doubles. He then qualified for the 2004 US Open, where he lost in the second round to Sam Querrey. In 2005, he won the French Open title in Boy's singles, beating Andy Murray in the semi-final and Antal van der Duim in the final. He finished 2005 ranked number two behind American Donald Young. While on the junior circuit, he won six tournaments in singles and four in doubles with his Canadian partner, Greg Kates.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
