| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 12 (UPI) -- ExxonMobil has been ordered to hand over a revised work plan for cleanup operations for the oil spill in the Yellowstone River in Montana, the EPA said.A leak was reported July 1 on the 12-inch Silvertip oil pipeline near Billings, Mont. Around 1,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Yellowstone River, ExxonMobil said. The company in its initial estimates reported oil spots as far away as 80 miles from the spill.Flooding along the Yellowstone River hampered preliminary response. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said as the flooding recedes, teams would be deployed for cleanup operations.The EPA said it received a draft plan from Exxon on the Yellowstone cleanup operation. The agency said Exxon's plans for oil recovery containment, source release area and remediation require further clarification."The EPA has instructed ExxonMobil to provide a revised plan within the week," the agency said in a statement.Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, in a letter to Exxon, requested three years of data, including viscosity, volatility and toxicity analysis, regarding the type of crude oil sent through Silvertip.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 (UPI) -- Chefs, nutritionists and food activists are asking U.S. restaurants to buy more products locally or collect for food banks for Food Day in October.Groups such as Chefs Collaborative, American Culinary Federation and the Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture are encouraging local restaurants to seek out partnerships with area hunger and sustainable-agriculture groups Oct. 24."Food Day is a great opportunity for restaurants to show their commitment to locally produced artisan foods, to showcase a variety of whole grains and to reach out to an audience hungry for more sustainable ways to consume that are more in keeping with the health of our bodies and our environment," Ellen and Todd Gray, owners of Equinox Restaurant, Watershed and Todd Gray's Muse at the Corcoran, all in Washington, said in a statement.Modeled on Earth Day, organizers hope Food Day will inspire Americans to hold thousands of events in schools, college campuses, houses of worship, restaurants, and even in private homes aimed at fixing America's diet and food system.For example:-- A chain of vegan restaurants, Native Foods, will organize cooking demonstrations and tastings in its seven locations in California.-- In Manhattan, the massive Italian market Eataly is handing out Food Day materials and bringing in 20 farmers to talk to customers.-- A New Haven, Conn., Real Food Restaurant Week will offer special meals featuring local produce and healthier options.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said 1,000 members of her staff are giving medical assistance to victims of Hurricane Sandy.Sebelius said as the National Guard continued going door-to-door to assist stranded residents in two of the hardest hit areas around New York City, and members of HHS medical teams are providing immediate, basic medical care for the residents. Nine Disaster Medical Assistance Teams from the National Disaster Medical System equipped with medical supplies and two teams of U.S. Public Health Service commissioned corps officers remain deployed in New York and New Jersey to provide care in medical shelters and to augment hospital staff at the states' and city's request, Sebelius said. The teams include behavioral health professionals from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps deployed to provide mental health support in shelters and first responders. Residents also can connect with local crisis counselors through the National Disaster Distress Helpline -- a toll-free, multilingual, crisis support service via telephone at 800-985-5990 and text 'TalkWithUs' to 66746 24 hours a day. In addition to requesting HHS medical team support, New York and New Jersey health departments have called on more than 615 medical volunteers available via two HHS sponsored programs: Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals and local Medical Reserve Corps to assist in shelters, emergency departments, special needs registries and call centers. At the request of the state of New Jersey, a Federal Medical Station is serving as a medical shelter at Middlesex Community College in Edison, and at the request of the state of New York, equipment from a Federal Medical Station is also in use in a New York City hospital. HHS activated the Emergency Prescription Assistance Program to assist people in the impacted areas without any form of health insurance coverage to replace certain prescription medications and limited durable medical equipment lost or damaged in the hurricane, Sebelius said.

WINDSOR, Ontario, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- Officials in an Ontario city said vandals were responsible for trimming a waterfront bush into a phallic shape.Cathy Masterson, Windsor's manager of cultural affairs, said the Canadian city was unaware of the 10-foot-tall penis-shaped bush until officials were contacted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and workers were dispatched to trim the plant into a "more traditional shrub shape," the CBC reported."Unfortunately, it appears that someone chose to come and vandalize some of the shrubs and turn them into new shapes," she said. "This would definitely have fallen outside of our mandate. It's always surprising when something that unusual happens."Mayor Eddie Francis told the CBC he was not amused by the prank.

PITTSBURGH, Dec. 23 (UPI) -- Evgeni Malkin had a hat trick Wednesday and both Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz had four points in Pittsburgh's 8-2 rout of Ottawa.Guerin had two power-play goals to go with two assists while putting nine shots on goal and Kunitz had a score and three assists. Pittsburgh produced seven consecutive goals -- five of them coming in the second period.The Penguins bounced back after being the victims of Martin Brodeur's NHL career record 104th shutout Monday. That loss to New Jersey snapped Pittsburgh's five-game winning streak.Malkin scored in each period. His goal in the second came with 1:33 left and gave the Penguins a 6-1 lead.Marc-Andre Fleury got the win with 45 saves. Pittsburgh moved into a tie with New Jersey atop the Atlantic Division with a league-high 53 points.After being out of action since Nov. 23 with a fractured cheekbone, Ottawa goaltender Pascal Leclaire returned Wednesday and gave up six goals on 24 shots through two periods. Brian Elliott, who started 15 of the last 16 games, made 10 saves in the third.

June 12 (UPI) -- Jose Martinez was shot and killed outside the restaurant he owned with his wife in New York City on November 22, 1986.The man who allegedly killed him, then 16-year-old Justo Santos, nearly got away with the crime: For 26 years, he evaded capture by fleeing the country. Thanks to the work of Martinez's daughter, Joselyn, an aspiring actress, Santos is once again behind bars.After the shooting, Santos escaped to the Dominican Republic. There, New York police learned, he was incarcerated for murder, but after just a year, he was released. Police closed the case in New York in 1988.But for Joselyn Martinez, that just wasn't good enough.Joselyn was just nine years old at the time her father was killed, but when she was old enough, she enrolled in law school. Upon learning no statute of limitations exists on homicides, she decided to look into the case herself.When officers at the NYPD 34th precinct told her the case was closed and the suspect out of reach, Joselyn Martinez turned to the Internet and social media to help her track Santos down.She saved information and pictures, even paid $300 to conduct online background checks.Then, after 10 years of searching on her own, she approached the police in January to present her case. With Joselyn Martinez's help, cold case officers were able to locate Santos in Miami, where he was arrested.Miami-Dade police said Santos confessed Thursday to killing Jose Martinez, and are working with New York to bring him back to face charges."She's the person most responsible for finding her father's killer," NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. "She did outstanding work."Although Joselyn Martinez credited the police with being responsive and helpful, her mother, Idalia, was less equivocal."I am thankful to God and to my daughter for never resting and didn't care for how many years," Idalia Martinez said. "She did a good job, my daughter."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- U.S. Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., announced Monday she is resigning to lead the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. "I am not leaving Congress because I have lost my heart for service -- to the contrary, I see a new way to serve," Emerson said in a statement. "I did not go seeking this opportunity, but I am excited about the new challenge it offers to find ways to promote strong rural policy."Emerson's resignation is effective in February. She will be president and chief executive officer of the association.The 8th Congressional District is a safe Republican district, Roll Call reported. State Republicans said the two main contenders are Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder and Lloyd Smith, executive director of the state GOP.Emerson was elected to Congress in a 1996 special election, succeeding her late husband, GOP Rep. Bill Emerson. After winning only 50 percent of the vote in her first general election, Emerson was returned to Congress by larger margins of the popular vote. Last month, she won with 72 percent.

| License Photo	BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 27 (UPI) -- Abdullah Abdullah, Palestine's ambassador to Lebanon, says Palestinians could more frequently march to Israel's borders to emphasize their right to return."This [march] is not a continuous battle [on the border] -- it is backed by peaceful popular resistance, which is taking place in the [occupied] Palestinian territories -- in rejection of Israeli occupation," Abdullah said in an interview with The Daily Star in Beirut Thursday. "These marches may take place more frequently," he said.Abdullah said the actions are intended to express the "Palestinian people's commitment to its internationally recognized rights of self determination, of returning to its homeland and of establishing its independent state."Israel shot and killed 11 Palestinians on May 15 on Lebanon's southern borders as thousands of unarmed marchers trekked to the frontier to mark 63 years of expulsion from their homeland.Similar recent protests in the Gaza Strip and Syria resulted in several other deaths. A march planned for June 5 will mark Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.Abdullah said organizers would take steps to protect protesters in the June action, although he did not say what they would be.He also said "popular committees" embracing all Palestinian groups would be formed in refugee camps in Lebanon in response to the announcement earlier this month in Cairo of an reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas."Every camp will have one popular committee, which embraces all Palestinian factions ... we want a united position on how Palestinian refugees should live in Lebanon ... we have turned the page of division forever," Abdullah said

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- Pakistani military said airstrikes in North Waziristan Thursday killed 15 militants as peace talks with the Taliban were halted over rising militant violence.Pakistani air force jets struck suspected militant hideouts in the tribal region, military officials told Geo News.CNN quoted the military as saying "foreign fighters" were among the 15 killed in the airstrikes.The Pakistani planes struck in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan as part of surgical strikes. Large quantities of arms and ammunition also were reportedly destroyed, Geo News reported.The airstrikes come after government negotiators, who have been holding peace talks with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan over the past two weeks, informed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that continuing the talks would be meaningless unless the banned militant group immediately stopped its violence.Sharif initiated the peace talks in the hope of ending the deadly terrorist violence of the past seven years. Recent violence includes the Feb. 13 blast in Karachi that killed 13 policemen, and the killing of 23 abducted paramilitary soldiers last Sunday, claimed by a faction of the Taliban in Mohmand tribal agency.Sharif had warned the executions of the 23 paramilitary soldiers could adversely impact the peace talks with the Taliban. The soldiers had been held by the Mohmand group after being abducted in 2010.Some Pakistani media reports have said the incident could be a setback for Sharif's government, which has said the peace talks are a last chance effort to end the militant violence.
