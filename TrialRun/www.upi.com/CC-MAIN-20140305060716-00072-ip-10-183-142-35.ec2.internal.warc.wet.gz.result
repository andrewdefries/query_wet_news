WASHINGTON, July 22 (UPI) -- The Swiss bank UBS said Monday it had struck a deal with U.S. authorities to settle charges that it misrepresented mortgage bonds issued in 2004 through 2007.UBS settled with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which has accused 18 big banks of overstating the value of bundled mortgage securities in advance of the 2008 financial meltdown that was largely caused by overwhelming numbers of defaulting home loans.Details of the agreement were not disclosed but The New York Times reported UBS said it was accepting a one-time, pretax charge of $919 million related to the settlement.The FHFA filed the lawsuit in 2011, seeking billions of dollars in compensation from the banks. FHFA losses involving UBS loans totaled $900 million, the Times said.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Author Brian Selznick says he doubted his 2007 children's novel "The Inventions of Hugo Cabret" could be adapted for the big screen until he heard Hollywood director Martin Scorsese wanted to do it.Best known for his gritty adult dramas "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull," "Mean Streets," "Goodfellas," "Gangs of New York" and "The Departed," Scorsese is equally renowned for his encyclopedic knowledge of cinema and advocacy for film preservation. This marks his first family movie."I made this book thinking it could not be filmed because the book, at the end of the story, the object of the book itself actually becomes part of the plot. And what happens when you turn the page because a big chunk of the narrative in my book is told with images like a movie. But even so, it's celebrating movies. It's really about what happens when you turn the page, and the power of the book itself," Selznick, who is distantly related to "Gone with the Wind" and "King Kong" producer David O. Selznick, told reporters in New York recently."I got the call that Scorsese wanted to make it," remembered the 45-year-old New Jersey native. "And I thought, 'Well, maybe this actually can be a movie.' And, I realized I never would have thought of him. Like, if someone had asked me, 'Who would you imagine directing this movie?' But, of course, the second we hear his name, we all realize there was no one else who could have made this movie." "Hugo," Scorsese's magical film based on Selznick's book, is up for a leading 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, going into Sunday's Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles.The movie is about Hugo, an orphan played by Asa Butterfield, who secretly lives in the walls of a train station in 1930s Paris and takes care of all its clocks. The boy, who has a gift for fixing broken machines, strikes up a friendship with the once-great but forgotten filmmaker Georges Melies, as well as his wife, Jeanne, and their goddaughter Isabelle, played by Ben Kingsley, Helen McCrory and Chloe Grace Moretz, respectively.Given his family connection to classic American cinema, Selznick said he grew up loving movies and excited by seeing his last name at the beginning and end of some of the best. The author went on to say he received "an amazing education" in early French film while researching his book. "It was really incredible and definitely was one of my favorite parts of making the book was discovering this entire part of cinema," he recalled. "So, when I got the call that Marty wanted to make this movie -- after the initial shock passed, which actually it still hasn't entirely passed. You know, knowing that he would then, of course, have gotten all of the references that are made in the book to these movies, and then be able to use these references for the film themselves, and bring God knows what else to it, the entire history of cinema to it, is amazing," Selznick said.Asked if he thinks it might be a tough sell to get children to sit through a film that is more than 2 1/2 hours, regardless of how good it is, Selznick countered: "The book I wrote is 530 pages, and a lot of people had this same comment about the book, 'Will kids be able to sit through the book?'"But I think that the story that Marty has captured on the screen is something that will carry kids through. Of course, there's going to be individual kids who are fidgety," he acknowledged. "There are going to be individual adults who were fidgety during 'Gone with the Wind' or anything. ... And I've talked to a lot of kids now who have seen the movie, as well. The ones I have talked to have been really, really thrilled and excited about what it is."The author admitted he took a bit of a gamble writing the book, given its length and subject matter."In real life, I was thinking I was writing something no one would read because it's a book about French silent movies for children, which isn't a guaranteed best seller," he said of the novel which eventually became a critical and commercial hit, as well as the winner of the literary world's prize, the Caldecott Medal. "It's as if I did all of that for Marty. ... I think this might be the first illustrated book that Marty has adapted. I don't think there are drawings in 'Age of Innocence.' I haven't read it."Selznick said with exception of Emily Mortimer's train-station flower girl, who was screenwriter John Logan's creation, he drew all the characters in his book."When I got the cast list, and I saw who was being cast, I was like: 'Oh, my God. They all look exactly like the people who I drew.' And the person I was most nervous about meeting was Asa as Hugo because Sir Ben is playing a real person. But I made him up and there he was, Asa." "Hugo" is due out on DVD and Blu-ray Tuesday.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, May 27 (UPI) -- A black bear didn't go over a river but went to the woods after scampering through residential and industrial areas of Anchorage, Alaska, police said.Police said residents spotted the small bear tooling around the area recently, then saw it scurry into the woods Saturday unharmed after officers tracked it for about 30 minutes following a report that a motorist tried to hit it, the Anchorage Daily News reported.A vehicle was stopped after someone reported a man was driving aggressively toward the bear, Trooper Bret Ledford said. He said the driver was being investigated for harassing wildlife and could be slapped with a misdemeanor citation."Witnesses said he chased after the bear. He said it was to take pictures," Ledford said. "He doesn't even have a camera in his car."Anchorage Police Sgt. Cameron Hokensen said the department's policy is to leave bears alone as long as they don't pose an immediate threat to humans. "It just seems like whenever it happens, everyone flocks to the area," Hokensen said. "He just wants to get out of here."Noting that summer was just under way, Ledford said, "We're going to see a lot more of this."

| License Photo	BEIJING, May 4 (UPI) -- China said Friday blind activist Chen Guangcheng could apply through "normal channels" to study abroad, and a U.S. university offered him a fellowship.The announcement from the Chinese government signaled a possible breakthrough in a dipolmatic entanglement involving the two countries."The Chinese government has indicated that it will accept Mr. Chen's applications for appropriate travel documents," U.S State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement."The United States government expects that the Chinese government will expeditiously process his applications for these documents and make accommodations for his current medical condition. The United States government would then give visa requests for him and his immediate family priority attention."A U.S. university offered a fellowship to Chen and his wife and children could travel with him, the State Department said.Liu Weimin, in a statement on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Web site, said Chen was receiving treatment in a Beijing hospital but could study abroad if he goes through "normal channels to take care of the relevant processes at the relevant departments in accordance with the law," The Wall Street Journal reported.PHOTOS: Chen Chuangcheng at U.S. Embassy in ChinaThe ministry's statement followed an intense round of negotiations between China and the United States that ended dramatically when Chen, who fled house arrest in late April, addressed a U.S. congressional panel via a cellphone held by an American Christian activist.Chen called Congress from his hospital room in Beijing and requested free passage to the United States."I want to come to the U.S. to rest. I have not had a rest in 10 years," Chen said. "I'm concerned most right now with the safety of my mother and brothers. I really want to know what's going on with them."He asked for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was in Beijing for economic talks. "I hope I can get more help from her," he said.But neither Clinton nor her Chinese counterparts mentioned Chen at the end of two-day talks on trade and security issues, saying instead that differences on human rights matters must not disrupt the broader relationship between the two powers.In a telephone interview with The Washington Post, Chen said he does not blame American officials for his predicament after he left the U.S. Embassy in Beijing under a U.S.-China deal. He accused Chinese officials of reneging on their promise to restore his freedom."It's not a one-time-only decision," Chen told the Post. "It doesn't mean I won't come back. As a free person, I believe I am endowed with the right to leave China when I want to and come back anytime I want."Liu said Chen could qualify for permission to study abroad despite his conviction in 2006 on destruction of property and obstructing traffic charges, which his supporters say were trumped up by local authorities. "According to Chinese law he's now a normal Chinese citizen, and through normal means he can apply through relevant procedures," Liu said.He said he didn't know whether Chen's family would be allowed to leave.U.S. lawyer Jerome Cohen, who advised Chen this week, told The New York Times the proposal could be a face-saving solution for China, defusing a situation that threatens relations between the two countries.Chen told the Journal Thursday his family was being mistreated after he escaped house arrest in Shandong province."While I was in the embassy, the situation back home was awful," he told the Journal."[Local authorities] were in my house, in my room. They wouldn't let my family close the door. I feel my family members aren't very safe in China." The Washington hearing was called by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, led by Republicans Frank Wolf of Virginia and Christopher Smith of New Jersey.Wolf said he would introduce a bill that would seek all State Department and White House communications concerning Chen's case. Republicans, including presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, demanded the White House work to ensure the safety of Chen and his family.

| License Photo	ATLANTA, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- A top Republican who promoted an Atlanta fundraiser for likely GOP presidential nominee John McCain stayed away from the event, The Wall Street Journal said.Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and a high-profile figure in a scandal involving disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, had e-mailed friends in recent weeks touting the Monday night McCain fundraiser. However, Reed was not at the event and McCain did not mention him during his remarks, the newspaper said.McCain, who participated in a congressional probe of the Abramoff scandal, had come in for criticism for his apparent association with Reed -- who was not charged with any wrongdoing but whose public image was damaged by details of his role in lobbying and fundraising operations conducted by Abramoff and others.Abramoff is serving a 6-year federal prison term for fraud, and has reportedly been cooperating with investigators looking into corruption involving public officials.A McCain campaign representative would not say whether the campaign asked Reed to stay away from the fundraiser.The campaign of likely Democratic president nominee Barack Obama issued a statement saying the McCain campaign "scrambled' to "scratch Ralph Reed from tonight's program.""The real question isn't why Reed isn't showing up, but why a so-called reformer would invite him at all," the statement said.

| License Photo	PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Among U.S. adults who make less than $24,000 a year in household income, 34 percent say they will vote for Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a survey indicates. An analysis of Gallup Daily tracking data for the three-week period from Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 showed income was correlated with voter support, but it is not a total determinant of vote choice.President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has a substantial voting edge over Romney among low-income Americans -- two-thirds of adults said they would vote for the president, but although Romney does better with those with incomes $180,000 or more, about 40 percent of U.S. adults who make $180,000 a year or more favor Obama. A newly released video clip of Romney at a fundraiser shows him saying Obama's base supporters -- "47 percent" of Americans -- are people who pay no income tax and depend on government services.Older Americans who have low incomes are those who have the highest chance of paying no income tax, but Gallup data for Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 showed among those voters age 65 and older who have $24,000 a year in income or less, Obama was favored by 49 percent and 43 percent supported Romney.Recent Gallup Daily tracking data showed Romney had significant support among those with the lowest incomes, the young, the old, and the older voters who have low incomes -- the groups most likely to pay no taxes. The Gallup Daily tracking survey conducted Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 of 9,839 registered voters has a margin of error of 1 percentage point.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina defended the Republican Party Sunday and said the variety of opinions will help the party grow. "The reason why the party continues to grow is because we like disparity, we like the diversity of ideas. And when we have that diversity of ideas, it helps us to build the best party for the future," Scott said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.Scott's comments were in response to a question about Republicans' criticism of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. "The fact of the matter is what you saw after the State of the Union is that there are many people in our party that are able to voice their concerns," he said. "So at the end of the day, what America needs is a party that is as diverse as the Republican Party. That is why the great opportunities for our future comes out of the GOP."Scott also brushed off criticism from William Barber, the head of the NAACP in North Carolina."A ventriloquist can always find a good dummy," Barber said. "The extreme right wing down here in South Carolina finds a black guy to be senator and claims he's the first black senator since Reconstruction. Then he goes to Washington, D.C., and articulates the agenda for the Tea Party." Scott said he doesn't understand Barber's comments and argued that he's focused on jobs, opportunity and education. "I'm not sure what part of that agenda he doesn't like," he said.

| License Photo	BEIJING, Nov. 13 (UPI) -- China's Communist Party Central Committee, led by a new leadership, acknowledged the market's "decisive role" in shaping the country's economic future.Ending its four-day plenary session, the central committee, under President Xi Jinping, said in a communique China will deepen its economic reform to ensure the market plays a "decisive" role in allocating resources.The meeting had been expected to focus on deeper economic reforms, political restructuring and opening up the country, which the reform-minded Xi has been stressing since taking over the reins of the country at the once-in-a-decade party congress last year to pick new leaders.The latest session, whose policies will guide the country in the next 10 years, was held at a time when China faces an economic slowdown after decades of explosive double-digit growth and new challenges ranging from growing public demand for greater say in matters that affect their lives to official corruption. Xi has said the nation's top priority remains development and improving people's livelihoods.The communique also called for enabling farmers to enjoy more property rights, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.The communique said economic reform is key, and the core solution is a proper relationship between government and market, leaving the market to play the decisive role in allocation of resources. It said the primary task is to build an open and unified market with orderly competition.The document, addressing China's growing urban-rural disputes over land requisition, said construction land in cities and the countryside will be pooled together in one market.Reforms also were called for in the transformation of government functions and building a modern fiscal system to support initiatives of both central and local governments. There should also be accelerated reforms in the social sector including education, employment, income distribution, social security and public health."The meeting is a new turning point of Chinese history," Chi Fulin, head of the China Institute for Reform and Development, told Xinhua. "It decisively impacts on the realization of a series of strategic targets, including the party's goal to develop China into a well-off society by 2020."The communique also said China will relax investment restrictions and accelerate construction of free trade zones. The new policies will apply both to domestic and international ventures.The New York Times said besides the market's "decisive role," the meeting also gave Xi a mandate to consolidate his decision-making authority by allowing him to establish a new national security committee and a leadership group to push through programs instead of relying on the party's cumbersome bureaucracies.Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang also want to change the economy's dependence on polluting industries and extravagant government spending."He's [Xi] demonstrating that he's really in charge," Christopher K. Johnson at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington told the Times in a telephone interview. "It's the clearest statement we've seen so far of his power inside the system."Xi, 60, is the son of a Communist revolutionary who served under Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping."The key point for me is that the market has a clearly defined role -- resource allocation -- where it is to be promoted, but the role of the party and government in managing everything else in society is primary," Arthur Kroeber, head of an economic research firm, told the Times. "It represents a pretty ambitious agenda, although of course the details won't come for a while.""Xi's main concern will be that there have been promises of major reform before, but promises without action," said Deng Yuwen, a Chinese current affairs commentator. "I think the communique makes clear that China will probably lean to liberalization and relaxation in the economy, but will remain quite conservative politically -- not unchanging, but conservative."The Wall Street Journal said the communique was vaguely worded in that it failed to offer specific plans for addressing more imminent challenges such as revamping or partially privatizing the cumbersome state-run enterprises and further liberalizing the country's currency and interest rate policies.The Financial Times said the meeting's statement, despite being bland, suggested Xi and Li are preparing to unleash unprecedented market forces within the world's second-largest economy.It quoted analysts as citing the creation of a leadership group to spearhead reforms."They are learning lessons from the past. If you don't have a small group pushing reforms forward, then you have too many interests holding them up," Shen Jianguang, an economist with Mizuho Securities, told the newspaper.
