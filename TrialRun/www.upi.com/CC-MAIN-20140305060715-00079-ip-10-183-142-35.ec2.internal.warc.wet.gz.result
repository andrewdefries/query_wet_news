PHOENIX, Oct. 12 (UPI) -- Researchers from Arizona State University have developed a software system that estimates greenhouse gas emissions in cities.The system, dubbed "Hestia" after the Greek goddess of the hearth and home, provides hourly, building-by-building and street-by-street dynamics of carbon dioxide emissions."With Hestia, we can provide cities with a complete, three-dimensional picture of where, when and how carbon dioxide emissions are occurring," said Hestia's lead scientist Kevin Gurney, an associate professor in ASU's School of Life Sciences and senior scientist with the Global Institute of Sustainability, in a news release."Cities have had little information with which to guide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions -- and you can't reduce what you can't measure."The researchers have already completed a map for Indianapolis, which they say was the first finely detailed account of an urban area's fossil fuel carbon emissions.While there have been other studies to measure emissions, the researchers say that those attempts have covered larger geographical areas or have taken a more general approach.To measure buildings, for example, the team accesses tax records for details such as square footage, the age of the building and what kind of fuel it uses for heating. Then the team runs individual building-energy models to estimate heat and air conditioning needs. The data are combined within a modeling system for quantifying CO2 emissions.The Hestia team is working on maps for Los Angeles and Phoenix. Eventually the study will cover hundreds of metropolitan areas.The Hestia model will help cities to determine precise locations of CO2 hotspots, such as energy-wasting factories or a neighborhood of older houses."This research, and its implications for global engagement regarding climate change, is an exciting step forward," said ASU President Michael M. Crow."Hestia gives us the next tool we need to help policymakers create effective greenhouse gas legislation."Scott Bernstein, who heads up the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a Chicago firm that promotes sustainable urban communities, says it's much easier to take steps to reduce CO2 emissions from city streets and buildings rather than to change the entire nation's network of power plants, coal mines and refineries.Previous tools to measure CO2 often weren't user-friendly."People look at these big giant spreadsheets in emissions accounting and their eyes glaze over badly, but if they can see a color-coded map, if they can see a flyover view, people get engaged," Bernstein told National Public Radio.Hestia is expected to complement NASA's planned December 2013 launch of the Orbital Carbon Observatory satellite, which will measure the concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, the university says.

| License Photo	The latest news on today's hottest celebrities ...JOHN TRAVOLTA: Actor John Travolta's publicist is denying sexual battery claims made by an unidentified male masseur in a $2 million lawsuit filed in California.People.com said the documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court allege the 58-year-old star of "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever" and "Pulp Fiction" exposed himself and groped the masseur against his will in Los Angeles in January 2011."This lawsuit is a complete fiction and fabrication," Travolta's representative told People.com Monday in a statement. "None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred. The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a baseless lie. It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn't been identified with a name even though it is required to do so. On the date when [the] plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in California and it can be proved that he was on the East Coast."The publicist said Travolta plans to sue the plaintiff and his lawyer for malicious prosecution.Travolta is married to actress Kelly Preston. They have two children.MATTHEW FOX: Former television star Matthew Fox has been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence in Oregon where he lives, TMZ reported Monday.The "Party of Five" and "Lost" actor was arrested at 3:23 a.m. PDT Friday on suspicion of DUI, and then taken into police custody and released later in the day.Law enforcement sources told TMZ Fox, 45, and an unidentified passenger were on their way to a fast-food restaurant when the actor was pulled over by police.No other details regarding the arrest were immediately available.Fox was accused last year of drunkenly assaulting the female driver of a charter bus who wouldn't let him on the vehicle. While no criminal charges were brought, a civil lawsuit against him is pending.STEPHEN COLLINS: U.S. actor Stephen Collins announced Monday he and his actress wife Faye Grant are divorcing after 27 years of marriage.The former "7th Heaven" star and Grant married in 1985 and have one daughter.Collins said in a statement issued to E! News he and his longtime spouse "are moving forward separately in our lives.""She has been my dearest friend and a loving mother," said Collins. "I know that we'll go through this process in a way that honors our family."Grant, who starred on "V" and "State of Grace," told E! News her husband's divorce filing is a "surprise.""I am devastated," she said. "I wish him the very best in whatever path he chooses to take."Twenty-seven years of marriage in Hollywood is the equivalent of 189 dog years. I was exhausted."PRINCE HARRY: Britain's Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy are considering a reconciliation, sources close to the on-again, off-again couple told UsMagazine.com Monday.The prince, 27, and Davy, 26, ended their stormy five-year romance in 2009; however, the young lawyer was friendly towards Harry when she attended the wedding of his brother to Kate Middleton last year."They're not dating again, but they are seeing each other," an insider told the celebrity news Web site about Harry and his former flame. "There's definitely a romantic connection still.They will never be 'just friends' -- both of them admit that's impossible."The source said the root of the tension between the two is Harry's service in the military, which frequently takes him away from home. He is a helicopter pilot in the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry Regiment."If Harry can stay in London for a while then he has a good chance of being back on with Chelsy, but she doesn't like it when he has to go away for months on end," the source told UsMagazine.com. "It's easier to be apart than together and pining for someone you can't see."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 19 (UPI) -- An analysis of the initial health plan filings in nine states finds premium rates appear to be falling below U.S. government estimates, analysts say. Caroline Pearson, vice president at Avalere Health, a Washington firm that delivers research, analysis, insight and strategy for leaders in healthcare business and policy, said information on the nine states was publicly available and represent a cross section of geography and state size, including two federally facilitated exchanges. The Avalere Health analysis found under the Affordable Care Act the second-lowest cost, or "Silver," premiums appear to be lower than the Congressional Budget Office estimated. Premiums for the second-lowest cost plans for a 40-year-old non-smoker range from a low of $205 in one region in Oregon to a high of $413 in another region in Vermont, the analysis said. The CBO previously projected nationwide the average monthly premium for the second-lowest cost Silver plan would be $433.Pearson said these Silver premiums for those buying an individual healthcare plan are to be used to set federal premium subsidies. If premiums are lower than projected by the CBO, federal costs for per-person subsidies may be lower than expected, thus saving the federal government money, Pearson said. "The initial data suggest that competition in exchanges is working to lower premiums, which will benefit non-subsidized enrollees and the federal government," Pearson said.

June 13 (UPI) -- Roger Brown of Brazil, Indiana, has been hospitalized in Indianapolis after his 6-month-old pit bull chewed his toes off while he slept.Brown, 46, awoke just before dawn Wednesday to a bloody left foot and two missing toes, and discovered his pit bull puppy had been gnawing at his foot.According to Brown, his dog Bo was able to chew off entirely his left small pinky toe, as well as the big toe on the same foot. The dog also managed to eat a sizable chunk of the man’s actual foot without waking him.Brown, who’s disabled and diabetic, admitted it was his own fault. He explained that he usually treats and tightly wraps open wounds and blisters on his feet, but failed in his regimen on this particular night.Brown said that Bo was likely enticed by the exposed wound that Brown said is a result of his diabetes.The pup was isolated after the incident by order of city police and was under observation for any sign of rabies.Brown also said that he's confident in his decision not to euthanize Bo, but to continue raising and caring for his pet.

NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 24 (UPI) -- Drew Brees hurled five touchdown passes and racked up 325 passing yards Sunday, leading the New Orleans Saints' 62-7 destruction of Indianapolis.Brees went 31-of-35 through the air with no interceptions. He hooked up on two scoring passes each to Marques Colston (seven catches, 98 yards) and Jimmy Graham as the Saints rolled up 557 yards of total offense.Mark Ingram gained 91 yards on 14 carries for New Orleans, which smashed the club's old record for most points in a game (51) and greatest margin of victory (42 points).The Saints' 55-point victory margin tied for the most in a game since the 1970 merger between the rival AFL and NFL.Curtis Painter completed 9-of-17 pass attempts for only 67 yards and an interception for the Colts (0-7), who are off to their worst start since 1997.

| License Photo	GENEVA, Switzerland, May 1 (UPI) -- Authorities in Bahrain should grant human rights activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja access to a lawyer of his choosing, a U.N. human rights official said.A court in Bahrain this week said the civilian courts would retry 21 activists, including Khawaja. Sentenced to life in prison for allegedly plotting against the government, Khawaja has been on a hunger strike since Feb. 8.PHOTOS: Bahraini anti-government protesters at Formula 1Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. rights commission, said Khawaja should be given more basic privileges."He should be given immediate access to his family, the Danish ambassador, a doctor and a lawyer of his own choosing," he was quoted by the BBC as saying.Khawaja holds Danish citizenship.The BBC was granted access to the rights activist for 5 minutes in his prison cell. He vowed to continue with his hunger strike, though he's getting nutritional supplements. His wife, Khadija al-Moussawi, claims he's being fed against his will.At least 50 people were killed during an uprising led predominately by Shiite minorities last year. The Sunni-led monarchy is said to be investigating recommendations outlined by an independent commission, though it's been criticized for its human rights record.

PORTLAND, Maine, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- The city clerk's office in Portland, Maine, opened Friday night to allow gay couples to marry as soon as the state's new same-sex marriage law took effect.Steven Bridges and Michael Snell, who have been together for nine years, tied the knot minutes after midnight Saturday in the Maine Room at City Hall, the Portland Press Herald reported. The two men, who said they had a commitment ceremony six years ago, were the first of about 15 couples in line for marriage licenses. Mayor Michael Brennan arrived at City Hall at about 10 p.m. When the building opened its doors, a local jazz group played "What a Difference a Day Makes."A crowd of about 300 people, including those waiting for marriage licenses, their guests and supporters, turned out. On the other side of City Hall Plaza two men protested the new law, adopted in a referendum in November. Snell's adult daughters, Carolyn and Katie, who live in Boston, attended his wedding. Same-sex marriages have been legal in Massachusetts since a 2004 court decision. "It's nice to see Maine catch up," Katie Snell said. Portland and Falmouth, a nearby town, opened clerk's offices for midnight weddings. A number of other municipalities, including Augusta, the state capital, Bangor and Brunswick, planned to have special Saturday hours for marriage licenses and weddings.

| License Photo	REYKJAVIK, Iceland, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Minke whale steaks and other whale meat will no longer be sold at Keflavik International Airport, the Icelandic government said Thursday.The announcement came hard on the heels of a warning from the British Foreign Office that anyone trying to bring whale meat into the country from Iceland would face confiscation, The Guardian reported. Penalties could include a fine of as much as 5,000 pounds (almost $8,000) and a jail term.A Visit Iceland spokeswoman said whale meat was being taken off the shelves at Keflavik by Wednesday night.Two anti-whaling groups said in October their investigators had purchased minke whale steaks at Keflavik. They said employees in the airport shop had falsely told them the meat could be legally brought into the United States.The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society released a statement Thursday urging tourists to abstain from whale while they are in Iceland.

Dec. 28 (UPI) -- This is what happens when your uncle-in-law is a billionaire. Kate Winslet married the creatively named Ned Rocknroll in a secret ceremony earlier this month. According to the Daily Telegraph, Rocknroll's uncle, Sir Richard Branson, has gifted the 37-year-old actress with a ticket aboard the Virgin Galactic shuttle, which plans to start flights next year.Though it might seem like a wedding gift, Branson's gift is a thank-you to Winslet for rescuing his mother, Eve, from a fire last year. Winslet won't be the only celebrity to experience weightlessness on the two-hour trip outside the Earth's atmosphere. Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie and Tom Hanks have all reportedly paid for tickets.

Wiki
Charles Wade Barkley (born February 20, 1963) is a former American professional basketball player. Nicknamed "Sir Charles" and "The Round Mound of Rebound", Barkley established himself as one of the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) most dominating power forwards. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team five times, the All-NBA Second Team five times, and once to the All-NBA Third Team. He earned eleven NBA All-Star Game appearances and was named the All-Star MVP in 1991. In 1993, he was voted the league's Most Valuable Player and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. He competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States' Dream Team. In 2006, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was frequently involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he mistakenly spat on a young girl, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness to become one of the NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.
Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a successful career as a color commentator on basketball. He works with Turner Network Television (TNT) as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games. In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, he announced that he would run for Governor of Alabama in 2014, but he changed his mind in 2010.

Wiki
Daniel Boyle (born July 12, 1976) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and an alternate captain of the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played for the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning, with whom he won a Stanley Cup in 2004.
Undrafted after four years with the Miami RedHawks of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), Boyle was signed as a free agent by the Florida Panthers on March 30, 1998. He played his first two seasons in the Panthers' farm system in the American Hockey League (AHL), earning All-Rookie Team honours in 1999, as well as Second Team All-Star honours in 1999 and 2000. Boyle earned a full-time roster spot with the Panthers in 2000–01, recording 4 goals and 22 points. The next season, his fourth in Florida, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (Martin Tůma) in 2003 on January 7, 2002. After completing the season with 20 points in 41 games after coming over from the Panthers, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Lightning on August 6, 2002.
He recorded 13 goals and 53 points in his first full season with the Lightning in 2002–03 before helping the team to the 2004 Stanley Cup championship. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Boyle went overseas to play for Djurgårdens IF of the Elitserien. As NHL play resumed the next season, Boyle continued to produce with a 15-goal, 53-point season in 2005–06. He recorded his first career NHL hat trick against the New York Rangers on December 23, 2006, adding an assist for a four-point game in a 4–3 win. The following season, Boyle elevated his game to career-high numbers of 20 goals, 43 assists and 63 points, good enough for Second Team All-Star honours.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
