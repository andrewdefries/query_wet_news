NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 14 (UPI) -- The sense of urgency among European finance leaders concerning the debt crisis looming over several countries appears to have eased, key leaders suggested."Fund managers are bringing their money back to Europe; that is good for the economy," said European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, The New York Times reported Friday.At a news conference in Nicosia, Cyprus, where finance leaders are gathering for a two-day meeting, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said "we'll have a lot of interesting discussions," which suggests a calm dialogue is expected while leaders discuss how best to proceed with bailouts for Greece and Spain, the newspaper said."Europe is stabilized ... equipped to deal with all phenomena that come along," said Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter.Discussions are expected to center on how to respond to Greece's request for more time to meet terms mandated by the so-called troika -- the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission -- in return for ongoing support.Although Spain has not formally requested help and is not expected to do so soon, the country's financial difficulties will be a key point of discussion, the Times reported.Three dramatic events have helped give the three-year crisis a rare moment of calm -- including the ECB decision to buy short term bonds of countries struggling to climb out of debt, a decision by a constitutional court in Germany to allow the country to contribute to the $646 billion European Stability Mechanism, and an election in the Netherlands this week that revealed stronger-than-expected pro-eurozone support.Voters in Germany and the Netherlands, among other countries, have expressed increased frustration with Greece's ongoing difficulties.The government in Athens is looking for an additional $15 billion in austerity budget cuts, while troika representatives are in the county working out recommendations that could grant or deny the next $323 billion in loans.Still, Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager, reasoned Friday that the international community might give Greece some time."If the deficit turns out to be somewhat worse than expected because of a temporary downturn in the economy, there could be some time but not money, not extra money," de Jager said.

CHELMSFORD, Mass., Sept. 5 (UPI) -- A product line of miniature IP cameras for discreet indoor and outdoor surveillance has been introduced by Axis Communications of Massachusetts.The cameras, which come in various sizes and forms, allow for mounted accessories and enclosures and are ideal "discreet surveillance applications in retail stores, banks and ATMs, hotel lobbies and building doorways," the company said.The AXIS P12 Series includes three models: the pinhole AXIS P1204 and AXIS P1214 and IP66-rated AXIS P1214-E model for indoor and outdoor applications.Each series consists of a small sensor unit -- including the camera head and progressive scan image sensor. The unit can be placed as much as 26 feet from a main unit that contains the camera electronics."The AXIS P12 Series will be especially attractive for customers looking for the flexibility to install a camera where there isn't much space or where they want a clean design – such as inside an ATM for that close-up face shot or a building entranceway for unobtrusive installation," said Fredrik Nilsson, general manager, Axis Communications, Inc. "HDTV video in a covert form factor is a powerful tool."AXIS P12 Series can be powered over Ethernet or via an optional external power supply. It provides as much as HDTV 720p video at full frame rate with multiple, individually configurable video streams in H.264 compression. Recordings can be saved to a microSD/microSDHC card or Network Attached Storage device.Axis said the cameras are expected to be available from October through its distribution network.

LONDON, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Tony Hall, chief executive of London's Royal Opera House and the BBC's former news director, has been named the British broadcaster's director general.He replaces George Entwistle, who resigned earlier this month after only 54 days in the position following the broadcast of an erroneous "Newsnight" report. Acting director general Tim Davie will continue until Hall assumes the post in March.BBC Trust Chairman Chris Patten said the BBC needs "to take a long, hard look at the way it operates and put in place the changes required to ensure it lives up to the standards that the public expects. "Tony Hall is the right person to lead this," he said."Tony Hall has been an insider and is currently an outsider. As an ex-BBC man he understands how the corporation's culture and behavior make it, at its best, the greatest broadcaster in the world. And from his vantage point outside the BBC, he understands the sometimes justified criticisms of the corporation -- that it can be inward-looking and on occasions too institutional. But perhaps most importantly, given where we now find ourselves, his background in news will prove invaluable as the BBC looks to rebuild both its reputation in this area and the trust of audiences."The shakeup at the BBC comes amid a scandal in which hundreds of women said former radio and TV personality Jimmy Savile, who died last year at age 84, sexually abused them when they were girls. Police and BBC investigations are currently under way.

Today is Thursday, Aug. 17, the 229th day of 2006 with 136 to follow.The moon is waning. The morning stars are Saturn, Mercury, Venus and Uranus. The evening stars are Neptune, Mars, Jupiter and Pluto.Those born on this date are under the sign of Leo. They include frontiersman Davy Crockett in 1786; movie producer Samuel Goldwyn in 1882; black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey in 1887; actors Monty Woolley in 1888 and Mae West in 1893; publisher/diplomat John Hay Whitney in 1904; actors Maureen O'Hara in 1920 (age 86) and Robert De Niro in 1943 (age 63); U.S. spy plane aviator Francis Gary Powers in 1929; British poet laureate Ted Hughes in 1930; pop singer Belinda Carlisle in 1958 (age 48); and actor Sean Penn in 1960 (age 46).On this date in history:In 1807, Robert Fulton began the first American steamboat trip between Albany, N.Y., and New York City.In 1915, a hurricane struck Galveston, Texas, killing 275 people.In 1961, the East German government began building the Berlin Wall.In 1978, three Americans completed the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by balloon, landing their helium-filled Double Eagle II near Paris.In 1987, kidnapped U.S. journalist Charles Glass escaped and was rescued after being held hostage for 62 days in Lebanon.Also in 1987, Rudolf Hess, Hitler's former deputy, was found strangled in Berlin's Spandau Prison. He was 93.In 1991, the Lebanese government granted amnesty to former Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and allowed him to leave the French Embassy.In 1992, filmmaker Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, split up after 12 years together. Allen said he was in love with the actress' adult daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.In 1996, the Reform Party nominated Texas businessman Ross Perot for president.In 1998, addressing the American people, U.S. President Bill Clinton admitted he had a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky that was "not appropriate."In 1999, at least 16,000 people were killed and 20,000 more injured when a strong earthquake rocked Turkey.In 2001, Ford Motor Co. announced it would dismiss up to 5,000 of its salaried employees, or 10 percent of its managers and engineers.In 2003, a U.S. soldier killed a Reuters photographer at a prison near Baghdad after mistaking his camera for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.Also in 2003, loss of revenue from a fire-damaged Iraqi oil pipeline was estimated at $7 million a day with repairs expected to take a month.In 2004, eight British men arrested with reconnaissance plans for the New York Stock Exchange and other targets have been charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to use radioactive material, toxic gas, chemicals or explosives.n 2005, reports say three suicide car bombings in the center of Baghdad killed at least 43 people and injured 80 others. Meanwhile, a series of bombs exploded simultaneously across Bangladesh killing at least 115 people.Also in 2005, Israeli soldiers and police began moving Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip.A thought for the day: it was Alexander Woollcott who said, "All the things I really like to do are either immoral, illegal or fattening."

LONDON, June 26 (UPI) -- No. 2-ranked Victoria Azarenka withdrew before her second-round match and third-seeded Maria Sharapova was beaten at Wimbledon Wednesday.Azarenka left the tournament Wednesday due to a knee injury and a series of upsets have further opened the lower half of the draw. Sharapova lost to world No. 131 Michelle Larcher de Brito 6-3, 6-4 and Petra Cetkovska ousted ninth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-2.Azarenka, Sharapova and Wozniacki join No. 5-seeded Sara Errani, who was eliminated in the first round Monday, on the sidelines -- leaving eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova, who won at Wimbledon in 2011, as the highest seeded player left in that half of the draw.Kvitova moved into the third round when Yaroslava Shvedova withdrew prior to the match.Azarenka defeated Maria Joao Koehler 6-1, 6-2 in the first round Monday but took a fall that left her writhing in pain. She met with a trainer after the fall early in the second set and had the injured right knee wrapped before finishing the win.Her camp reported Tuesday there was no structural damage to the knee but minutes before Azarenka was to play Flavia Pennetta in the second round Wednesday, the Belarusian star withdrew.Larcher de Brito had never before beaten a Top 10 player but dropped serve just once in taking out Sharapova. Sharapova had a pair of break chances in the final game but Larcher de Brito was able to advance on her fifth match point try.In other upsets, local favorite Eugenie Bouchard delighted the British crowd with a 6-3, 6-3 win over 12th-seeded Ana Ivanovic; Vesna Dolonc took out 16th-seeded Jelena Jankovic 7-5, 6-2; Camila Giorgi held on for a 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (8-6) win over 22nd-seeded Sorana Cirstea; and Karin Knapp rallied for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 decision over No. 27-seeded Lucie Safarova.Marion Bartoli, the No. 15 seed, took a tight 7-5, 6-4 match over Christina McHale. Other seeded winners Wednesday included No. 17 Sloane Stephens, 19th-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro, 20th-seeded Kirsten Flipkens, No. 25 Ekaterina Makarova and No. 29 Alize Cornet.Unseeded players going into the third round included Eva Birnerova and Monica Puig, who had handed Errani her first-round upset.

ATLANTA, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- Georgia's Zoo Atlanta has announced the death of a pregnant 26-year-old African elephant.The zoo said the elephant, Dottie, died Monday during the third trimester of her first pregnancy, WSB-TV in Atlanta reported Tuesday.Zoo officials said veterinarians first noticed irregularities with the protein levels in the elephant's blood Oct. 10 and she then lost nearly 800 pounds in only 11 days. The officials said zookeepers tried to treat the unknown infection with antibiotics but Dottie died five days after starting her treatment.The official cause of death will be determined via necropsy performed by the zoo's veterinary team along with the Department of Pathology in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia."We are saddened by the sudden loss of Dottie. I know our veterinary and animal management team worked diligently to ensure she received the best care and treatment possible. This is especially sad for us because Dottie was pregnant with her first calf," said Dennis Kelly, president and chief executive of the zoo. "We will miss her here at Zoo Atlanta."

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- An old reel-to-reel tape found in an attic contains a previously unknown interview with civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a Tennessee man said.Stephon Tull told CNN he discovered the tape marked "Dr. King interview, Dec. 21, 1960, while rummaging through boxes in his father's attic.Tull said he borrowed an old tape player so he could listen to his father interviewing King."I could not believe what I was hearing," said Tull, whose father had grown up in Tennessee during the years of racial tension and segregation laws."He planned on writing a book on how bad things were back in that era," Tull said, but never finished it.In the interview, King discusses his definition of non-violence and its importance in the civil rights movement.In another part, the civil rights leader talks about a recent trip to Africa.Historian Clayborne Carson, founding director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, said he and his colleagues are most interested in what King says about Africa on the tape.

PINE BLUFF, Ark., Sept. 8 (UPI) -- Arkansas police said a 107-year-old man fired several shots at officers Saturday before he was killed in an exchange of gunfire with a SWAT team.Monroe Isadore was killed at a home in Pine Bluff when SWAT officers forced their way into the bedroom where he had been holed up with a handgun, police said.The Pine Bluff Police Department said in a written statement given to KTHV-TV, Little Rock, Ark., Isadore had fired at the SWAT team as they entered, and had earlier fired at officers through the window and door.Officers were sent to the address Saturday afternoon to investigate a disturbance.Two people in the home, whose names were not reported, told police Isadore had pointed a gun at them and was inside a bedroom, the statement said."When officers announced themselves, Isadore shot through the door at them," the statement said. "No officer was hit or injured by the gunfire. The officers retreated to a safer area and supervisors and additional help were called."After negotiators were unable to convince Isadore to give up, tear gas was dropped into the room through a window.The suspect allegedly responded by firing at the window."Shortly afterwards, a SWAT entry team, inside the residence, breached the door to the bedroom and threw a distraction device into the bedroom," the statement said. "Isadore then began to fire on the entry team and the entry team engaged Isadore, killing him."

| License Photo	Jan. 10 (UPI) -- The first drawbridge to ever be built in Chile has become an international joke after the grand opening of the $30 million project had to be pushed back due to at least one of the bridge’s traffic decks being installed incorrectly.The bridge was built over the Cau Cau River to connect Valdivia with Teja Island. The mix-up has made the bridge a laughingstock on social media.¿El jefe de obra del puente Cau Cau en Valdivia podrá resolver este desafío? pic.twitter.com/GyM4NYdA0a— Edu^2 (@AlephEdu) January 6, 2014
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera doesn’t find it so funny. "It can be fixed, and it will be fixed by the company that made the mistake," Pinera said."The only responsible party is the builder. We are going to make them answer for this," said Public Works Minister Loreto Silva.Spanish construction company Azvi was alerted to the error. The auto platforms were reportedly installed upside down, though they were possibly backwards.Azvi released a statement saying the bridge would be fixed "without major work.""The controversy about the bridge being built upside down is meaningless, as both sides are symmetrical," the company stated. Azvi added that the bridge is "currently running" and "has no structural problems."Infografía en EM graficó error al armar puente en Valdivia.
