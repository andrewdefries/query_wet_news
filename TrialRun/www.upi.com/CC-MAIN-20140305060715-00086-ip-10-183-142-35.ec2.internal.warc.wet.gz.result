Turn!" and "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" died Monday, his grandson said.He was 94.Seeger, who lived in the Hudson Valley city of Beacon, N.Y., died of natural causes at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Monday, Kitama Cahill Jackson told the New York Times.Seeger became a fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s and had a string of hit records in the early 1950s as a member of the Weavers folk music quartet.The group's most famous recording was of Lead Belly's "Goodnight, Irene," which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950.Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era.In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights and environmental causes.He was one of the folksingers who popularized the spiritual "We Shall Overcome" during the 1960s U.S. civil rights movement.Seeger's "Turn! Turn! Turn!" -- a folk rock setting of a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes -- became a No. 1 hit for the Los Angeles rock band the Byrds in 1965.During his long career, Seeger sang at labor rallies, headlined folk music festivals and performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at a concert for President Barack Obama's first inauguration.He told United Press International in 1985 he saw his career as a link to a long history of songs written and sung by working people."My job is to pass on the songs and music I've learned," he said. "I'm a link to a long line of people like Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly. They taught songs to me and I've taught them to others."At a Madison Square Garden concert celebrating Seeger's 90th birthday, Bruce Springsteen introduced him as "a living archive of America's music and conscience, a testament of the power of song and culture to nudge history along."Seeger's wife, Toshi, died last year, days before the couple's 70th anniversary.He is survived by a son, Daniel; daughters, Mika and Tinya; a half-sister, Peggy; and six grandchildren, including musician Tao Rodriguez-Seeger, who performed with him at Obama's inauguration.The president issued a statement Tuesday, celebrating Seeger's life and work."Once called 'America's tuning fork,' Pete Seeger believed deeply in the power of song," Obama said in the statement. "But more importantly, he believed in the power of community -- to stand up for what's right, speak out against what's wrong, and move this country closer to the America he knew we could be. Over the years, Pete used his voice -- and his hammer -- to strike blows for worker's rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation. And he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Pete's family and all those who loved him."

TORONTO, Sept. 9 (UPI) -- Getting into character for his latest screen endeavor of a married, closeted homosexual in the 1950s in "Far From Heaven" wasn't difficult says actor Dennis Quaid, not even the kiss scene with his on screen lover."It's all love," shrugs the boyishly charming Quaid in Toronto to promote the North American premiere of "Far From Heaven" at the Toronto International Film Festival.Besides, he knows what it's like to have troubles and feel you're not being true to yourself even if he can't identify with the homosexual aspect of the character."We all have our secrets and feel we're not living an authentic life from time to time and, although the character is gay, I can relate to what he's going through," says a tired but relaxed Quaid in between pulls on his cigarette during an interview.At 48-years-old, the former husband of actor Meg Ryan still exudes a mix of rough around the edges, innocence, and devilish charm."I have a few friends who've been in the same situation, got married, had kids and came to grips with their sexuality," says Quaid.It was these friends Quaid used as a resource when preparing for his role as Frank Whitaker, head of the local branch of the Magnatech TV sales company, opposite actor Julianne Moore, in this latest Todd Haynes' directed film.Moore plays Cathy Whitaker, the perfect housewife who develops a relationship with her black gardener Raymond (Dennis Haysbert) to the horror of the town's gossipmongers, while her husband Frank is grappling with his homosexuality.Mimicking the 1950s style of domestic melodramatic movie making particularly that of director Douglas Sirk ("All that Heaven Allows"), "Far From Heaven" not only explores the theme of homosexuality, but that of racial prejudice within a well-to-do suburban home during the post-World War II era."I think by setting it in the '50s, made it more relevant to today," says Quaid. "If it was done in a '90s way I don't think the film would have had as much impact as it does." He believes this role deviates from the characters he usually plays - the all American guy -- as this time it's an all American guy with a twist, a dark secret."It's a very interesting story," says Quaid.It was the director that drew Quaid to the film. After seeing Haynes' previous film "Goldmine," Quaid knew he wanted to work with him."I pretty much said yes before I read the script," he says. "I knew it was going to be something special. I thought the part was something completely different. I'm glad he offered me the part."A seasoned actor with over 25 films to his credit, including "The Rookie," "Traffic," "Frequency," and "Any Given Sunday," Quaid has accomplished his goal of being a working actor having grown up watching stars like Marlon Brando, James Dean and Alec Guinness.He feels lucky even if being a celebrity was tough to handle at first."It was confusing to me and I felt why are these people so interested in me. I've grown used to it and I've accepted what I do as a public thing," he says. "For me it was all about acting, not fame or even money. I just wanted to be a working actor."Acting runs in the family. His father was a frustrated actor and his grandfather was a Vaudeville actor and of course then there's his big brother, Randy Quaid."I still have my original love for acting," says Quaid. "That's why I feel so lucky. I think that's what sustains me in the sort of leaner times."Quaid is already working on his next film, "Cold Creek Manor" with director Mike Figgis. Quaid is visibly tired, but he's not complaining, the endless interviews are just part of his job and the cigarettes and Cokes are a help in the hot room as his handlers shuffle him to another interview."Far From Heaven" is due for release on Nov. 8.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- An outbreak of norovirus among patients and staffs at two hospitals in British Columbia has led to closures of some treatment units, medical authorities said.Two Vancouver-area hospitals -- Royal Columbian Hospital and Vancouver General Hospital -- closed some units after identifying norovirus infections, CBC News reported Thursday.An entire floor of the Royal Columbian facility was closed down after 12 patients and six staff members came down with the virus Wednesday, authorities said.Symptoms of norovirus infections include a sudden onset of diarrhea and nausea, and the symptoms usually last an average of 24 hours."There is a new strain emerging this season and so we're seeing lots of norovirus in the community," said Elizabeth Brodkin, medical director of infection control for the publicly funded Fraser Health region.One of two units closed by norovirus at Royal Columbian Hospital were expected to reopen Friday, but another ward at Vancouver General Hospital remains under containment, authorities said.

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 12 (UPI) -- A North Carolina unit of NASCAR that produces videos for the motorsports giant announced it will lay off about 15 percent of its workforce.NASCAR Productions will eliminate 32 of 180 jobs, although some people will remain until the last of the Sprint Cup races are run in the fall, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer reported.Steve Herbst, the head of the unit, said Tuesday executives decided to end production work on videos for outside accounts such as music videos and Notre Dame hockey not related to motorsports.The unit occupies four floors of the 20-story NASCAR Plaza building. It built a studio in 2009 with $40 million worth of digital technology. At its peak, the unit was producing 100 hours of video a week.While it produces "Inside NASCAR" for Showtime, its biggest client has been Fox Sports' Speed channel, which reaches 81 million U.S. households. Speed has cut back on some NASCAR programming to run other shows.Herbst said the organization is considering the creation of a NASCAR cable channel similar to that of the NFL Channel.Despite the job cuts, he said NASCAR's digital unit, NASCAR.com, was expected to add about 60 positions by the end of the year.

BANGKOK, Feb. 24 (UPI) -- Anti-government protesters in Thailand are demanding greater protection after gunmen opened fire on a rally, killing a 5-year-old girl and wounding 30 people.Men in two pickup trucks fired weapons and lobbed grenades Saturday into a noodle shop and then the People's Democratic Reform Committee rally in Trat, about 180 miles east of Bangkok, the Bangkok Post reported.A PDRC spokesman said about 2,000 protesters were listening to speakers on a stage in a large market next to the shop at 9:30 p.m. when the trucks drove by.One truck attacked the noodle shop where PDRC security guards were sitting and the other truck turned its weapons on the outdoor rally, the Post reported.The girl reportedly was standing next to a food stall when she was shot."This attack was carried out by people who disagree with the PDRC in what was clearly a well-organized strike using M16s and grenades," PDRC spokesman Akanat Promphan said."The reason for the continued attacks on our rally sites is because the government is doing nothing to prevent them and has failed to find anyone culpable for past violence," he said. Promphan said the attacks strengthen the anti-government movement and other protesters will join as a result.The Nation newspaper reported Trat Gov. Benjawan Anplueng Sunday declared the Khao Saming market area a "disaster zone affected by terrorism."The provincial government will speed up compensation payments to the injured people and the family of the slain child, she said.Injured victims will receive about $76 in compensation and dead girl's family will get about $770.The Trat attack is the latest violence against the PDRC's anti-government protest rallies, mostly in Bangkok.At least four people, including policeman, were killed and dozens injured last week when Thai police tried to clear a large protest site in the capital occupied since the autumn, the BBC reported.Violence escalated during the operation and police alleged they were targeted by snipers. Several police officers were seriously injured by a grenade reportedly thrown by protesters.Police fired live rounds during the operation and arrested 200 protesters, the BBC reported.The PDRC, led by Suthep Thuagsuban, a former opposition Democrat Party member, boycotted Feb. 2 national elections, which were won by the incumbent Yingluck Shinawatra and her Pheu Thai party.But Shinawatra leads a caretaker government until April 20 and 27 when polling in parts of Bangkok and in nine provinces in the southern region can take place.Some polling stations were unable to open and voters were unable to cast their ballots in early February because of alleged intimidation.Yingluck unseated the Democrat Party in elections in 2011, but her administration has been crippled by accusations of corruption.Her critics also allege she is a surrogate leader for her disgraced brother Thaksin. He was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006 that left the country divided.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 19 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Tuesday called for giving illegal immigrants visas that would allow them to remain in the United States. Paul addressed immigration in a speech to a U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce breakfast, The Washington Post reported. He said giving legal status to immigrants who have been in the United States for a year or two would turn them into taxpayers. "If you wish to live and work in the United States, then we will find a place for you," he said. Advance reports on Paul's speech said he would call for a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Bu he told the Post he deliberately avoided the phrase because everyone "closes their ears" when they hear "path to citizenship" and "amnesty."Instead, he suggested those who enter the United States illegally should get the same chance at citizenship as others without having to leave the country to seek legal status. "Basically what I want to do is to expand the worker visa program, have border security and then as far as how people become citizens, there already is a process for how people become citizens," he told the Post. "The main difference is I wouldn't have people be forced to go home. You'd just get in line. But you get in the same line everyone is in."

TOKYO, Dec. 25 (UPI) -- A slowing economy hobbled by deflation poses the biggest challenge to Shinzo Abe as he prepared Wednesday to become Japan's next prime minister.Abe is returning to the same post he had held previously after his Liberal Democratic Party won a landslide victory this month in parliamentary elections, which ended the three-year regime of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's Democratic Party of Japan.Abe becomes Japan's seventh prime minister in six years, an indication of the country's current unstable political scene.Japanese economy is the world's third largest after that of the United States and China, but it, like its competitors, has been hit by the global crisis and falling exports on which it is heavily dependent. The catastrophic March 2011 earthquake and tsunami has only made the situation worse. The country could be pushed into another recession if the economy in latest quarter ending in December also shows a shrinkage as did the previous one.Abe's plan to tackle the economy under his "Abenomics" ranges from unlimited monetary easing, big spending on public works and steps to fight deflation to curb the yen's rise, which make Japanese exports more expensive.Kyodo News reported Abe wants the Bank of Japan to set an inflation target of 2 percent and take drastic monetary easing steps.Abe's program will be handled by former Prime Minister Taro Aso, expected to become both the new finance minister and deputy prime minister in his Cabinet. Kyodo said Aso took the same bold fiscal steps during the 2008-2009 global financial debacle.Kyodo said many other positions will also be filled with former Cabinet members who held portfolios before the DPJ's rise to power in 2009. Among them will be former Trade and Industry Minister Akira Amari, expected to take over as minister of economic revitalization, a new post to be created by Abe.Toshimitsu Motegi, former financial services minister, will become minister of economy, trade and industry, and will handle Japan's future energy policy following the earthquake disaster that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.Abe's another immediate challenge will be to guide his party for a strong win also in the elections to the Upper House to be held this summer, so he can pursue his policies without much opposition.One such policy will be revising Japan's pacifist constitution. The LDP's election manifesto had called for changing the Constitution to recast Japan's Self-Defense Forces as a "national defense military." Under the current pacifist Article 9 of Japan's post-war Constitution, the country renounced war as a means of settling international disputes. It also prohibits Japan from maintaining a military.Abe is returning to power at time when Japan is involved in a territorial dispute with China over the resource-rich Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which is worsening by the day and threatens the security in the region.Abe also must deal with the growing belligerence of North Korea, whose latest provocation included the Dec. 12 firing of a long-range rocket which was widely condemned by the United Nations and much of the free world.Kyodo said Abe has promised to strengthen Japan-U.S. ties and to exercise Japan's right to collective self-defense with Washington, which has been banned under the government's interpretation of the Constitution. In this connection, Abe has decided to appoint Fumio Kishida as foreign minister, Kyodo said.Kyodo, quoting sources, reported Abe has decided to appoint LDP lower house member Itsunori Onodera as defense minister. The 52-year-old Onodera had previously served as parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs and as senior vice foreign minister.

| License Photo	April 19 (UPI) -- The father of the two young brothers at the center of the Boston bombing investigation mourned his dead older son, calling Tamerlan Tsarnaev "a true angel."Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother Dzhokhar, 19, were identified by the FBI as suspects in Monday's deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon. A series of events early Friday morning lead to a massive manhunt and shootout in Watertown that left Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead.His father, who still lives in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan, described his son as a gifted student who dreamed of becoming a professional boxer.The Tsarnaev brothers attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin school and Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent three semesters at Bunker Hill Community College between 2006 and 2008. The brothers moved from Chechnya sometime after 2001. Both were legal permanent residents, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reportedly became an United States citizen last year.

Wiki
Wilhelm Carl Grimm (also Karl; 24 February 1786 – 16 December 1859) was a German author, the younger of the Brothers Grimm.
He was born in Hanau, Hesse-Kassel and in 1803 he started studying law at the University of Marburg, one year after his brother Jacob started there. The whole of the lives of the two brothers were passed together. In their school days, they had one bed and one table in common. As students, they had two beds and two tables in the same room. They always lived under one roof, and had their books and property in common.
In 1825 Wilhelm married a pharmacist's daughter; Henriette Dorothea Wild, also known as Dortchen, at age 39. Wilhelm's marriage in no way disturbed the harmony of the brothers. As Richard Cleasby said, “they both live in the same house, and in such harmony and community that one might almost imagine the children were common property.” Together, Wilhelm and Henriette had four children: Jacob Grimm (3 April 1826–15 December 1826), Herman Friedrich Grimm (6 January 1828–16 June 1901), Rudolf Georg Grimm (31 March 1830–13 November 1889), and Auguste Luise Pauline Marie (21 August 1832–9 February 1919).
