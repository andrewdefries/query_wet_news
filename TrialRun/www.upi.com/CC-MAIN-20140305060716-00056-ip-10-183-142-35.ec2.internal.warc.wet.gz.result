MOSCOW, Feb. 21 (UPI) -- India wants its joint venture BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles installed on Russian warships.Indian Defense Minister A. K. Antony bluntly delivered that message Tuesday when Russian Defense Minister Dmitry Rogozin visited India.Antony said in New Delhi that the Russia should induct the BrahMos missile into its fleet so the success of the joint venture will be fully appreciated.Antony delivered his assessment while addressing "Partnership Day," which marked the 15th anniversary of signing of an agreement between India and Russia for the formation of BrahMos joint venture.He said Indian air force will shortly be able to mount BrahMos missiles on both land and air platforms, making it a genuine force multiplier for all the wings of the Indian armed forces, Zhurnal BSR website reported Wednesday.Antony's observations updated those that he made nearly seven months ago, also during meetings in New Delhi with Rogozin. At the time Rogozin said, "BrahMos is not only a successful joint venture but also a model for cooperation which has immense political value for our two countries."BrahMos cruise missiles are being fitted for deployment on 40 Indian air force Russian-supplied Sukhoi-30MKI combat aircraft, as the land- and ship-launched BrahMos variants have completed testing.The aerial version of the BrahMos missile was recently displayed at the recent Aero India show at Bangalore, where a model of the hypersonic BrahMos 2 variant under development was also shown.The Russian Federation and India have already agreed to broaden cooperation on developing the next generation air-launched hypersonic BrahMos 2 missile, capable of speeds of 3,800-5,300 mph.Indian analysts have developed four possible reasons for Russian reluctance to deploy BrahMos:First, it parallels missile systems already deployed.Secondly, unlike India, the Russian navy isn't currently commissioning new warships until the new Gorshkov class frigates go online.Thirdly, many Russian experts view BrahMos as a downgraded Yakhont supersonic cruise missile already deployed with the Russian armed forces, so why should the Russian military choose to deploy it?Finally, the Russian cannot incorporate JV lessons from the BrahMos because everything for the missile is out-sourced from Russia. The missile's target acquisition software, guidance, navigation and fire control systems are all Indian contributions to the JV, along with the firing mechanisms.Despite the disagreements, a smaller model of the BrahMos cruise missile is being developed for arming the Indian air force's fighters, to accommodate the air force's front-line aircraft, including the Russian-built Sukhoi-30MKI, the French-built Mirage 2000 and future fighter purchases.Indian air force Air Chief Marshal N. A. K. Browne said, "Dr. A.S. Pillai (of the joint Russian-Indian BrahMos joint venture) has assured us that BrahMos will be developing a miniaturized version of the missile for our other aircraft and future inductions."

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Bill Beckwith, the carpenter who became a host of the TV show "Curb Appeal," was killed in San Francisco when a car hit his motorcycle, police said Tuesday. Beckwith died at San Francisco General Hospital shortly after the crash Monday night, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Police said the driver of the car remained at the scene and has been cooperating in the investigation.After studying modern dance and English at the University of Montana, Beckwith, 38, founded BB Design Build in San Francisco in 2001. He became a co-host of "Curb Appeal," an HGTV show that provides makeovers for homes the owners hope to sell. Victoria Canty, a friend, described Beckwith on a Facebook tribute page as "like a superhuman." She said he had broad interests -- which included kickboxing and yoga .Canty said Beckwith loved practical jokes and she hoped when she first heard of his death that the report was another one. She described him as "up there smiling and laughing, knowing that the joke's on us." His girlfriend, Yulia Korneeva, described him as "bright, adventurous and strong."

The evening stars are Neptune, Mercury, Jupiter and Uranus.Those born on this date are under the sign of Virgo. They include U.S. Army bacteriologist Walter Reed in 1851; Gen. John "Black Jack" Pershing, hero of World War I, in 1860; author Sherwood Anderson in 1876; English author J.B. Priestly in 1894; actress Claudette Colbert in 1903; Bill Monroe, the "father of bluegrass" music, in 1911; author Roald Dahl in 1916; singer Mel Torme in 1925; TV producer Fred Silverman in 1937 (age 70); "Miss Manners" Judith Martin in 1938 (age 69); actor Richard Kiel in 1939 (age 68); singer/songwriter Peter Cetera in 1944 (age 63); actress Jacqueline Bisset in 1944 (age 63); singer/actress Nell Carter in 1948; and actors Jean Smart in 1951 (age 56) and Ben Savage in 1980 (age 27), and Olympic track gold medalist Michael Johnson in 1967 (40).On this date in history:In 1759, in the French and Indian War, the British defeated the French near the city of Quebec.In 1788, Congress authorized the first U.S. national election, to be conducted "the first Wednesday in January next (1789)."In 1814, during the British attack on Fort McHenry, Md., Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics of "The Star-Spangled Banner."In 1922, the temperature at El Azizia, Libya, reached 136 degrees F., generally accepted as the world's highest recorded atmospheric temperature.In 1971, New York state forces stormed and regained control of Attica state prison in a riot that killed 42 people.In 1991, the United States and Soviet Union declared they would cease arms sales to Afghanistan.In 1993, in a dramatic ceremony at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed a declaration of principles for Palestinian self-rule.In 1996, the Dow closed at more than 5,838, a record high.In 1998, George Wallace, former Alabama governor, presidential candidate and one of the most controversial politicians in U.S. history, died in Montgomery, Ala., at the age of 79.In 1999, at least 118 people were killed in the bombing of a Moscow apartment building.

Officials said the residents apparently had been left to fend for themselves against the rising waters.Also in 2005, U.S. President George Bush said he took responsibility for "serious problems" in the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina. He said he wanted to look forward to recovery and do assessments later.In 2006, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said there can never be full and absolute security for potential terror targets in the United States.A thought for the day: Washington Irving said, "There is a certain relief in change, even though it be from bad to worse; as I have found in traveling in a stagecoach, that it is often a comfort to shift one's position and be bruised in a new place."

| License Photo	Sept. 25 (UPI) -- Long before Twitter, Jesus Christ was the original tweeter, according to Vatican cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, because his statements were "brief and full of meaning."At a conference Wednesday, Ravasi said Christ "used tweets before everyone else, with elementary phrases made up of fewer than 45 characters like 'Love one another’."“A bit like in television today, he delivered a message through a story or a symbol,” Ravasi said.As the Vatican continues to grow its Internet presence -- Pope Francis has more than three million followers on just his English-language Twitter -- Ravasi says the clergy must embrace modern digital tools.“If a cleric, a pastor is not interested in communication, they are defying their duty,” Ravasi said.

WORCESTER, Mass., Oct. 16 (UPI) -- Longtime Holy Cross women's basketball coach Bill Gibbons has been accused of abusive behavior toward players in a lawsuit filed in New York.In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Ashley Cooper, 20, who spent two seasons as a scholarship player for the Crusaders before transferring to New York University, charged in her lawsuit that Gibbons struck and berated team members repeatedly and sometimes "in front of hundreds of witnesses" during games, ABC News reported.In court papers filed in Manhattan, Cooper said the college in Worcester, Mass., ignored the abuse and accused the school's athletic director of negligence for refusing to take any action. Cooper said the abuse she suffered forced her to transfer out of Holy Cross after two years, leaving her unable to play at the collegiate level. "I don't want this to happen to anyone else ever again," Cooper told ABC News in an exclusive interview. "I want to stop it. I'm doing this for other people. I'm taking a stand for others, for every freshman that walks through the door." Cooper, a standout from Colts Neck, N.J., said in her lawsuit the coach's "actions constitute the worst type of bullying because not only is defendant Gibbons her coach and supervisor, but also he is someone she is supposed to respect."Cooper alleged Gibbons "struck another female player on the back" during a March 2013 Patriot League Tournament game. After that incident, the player's father "verbally complained" to the athletic director, but no action was taken, Cooper alleged.Gibbons, who acted in an "outrageous manner in his yelling, ranting, screaming and hysterics," once struck Cooper so hard his hand print didn't immediately fade, the lawsuit said.ABC News said Gibbons hung up when contacted for comment. Gibbons has been head coach of the Holy Cross women's basketball team for nearly 30 years and is the winningest coach in the program's history. After the lawsuit was filed, Holy Cross officials said outside attorneys were being brought in to review the allegations. In a statement to ABC News, the college said, "The physical, mental and emotional well-being of our students is our highest priority at Holy Cross. We just received the lawsuit and are in the process of reviewing it. Ms. Cooper had brought her concern to the college and we investigated at that time. The lawsuit we received today includes a series of new allegations and we will now bring in outside counsel to review them." Richard Regan, the Holy Cross athletic director for 15 years until retiring earlier this year, did not responded to ABC News' requests for comment.

Mike Huckabee has the highest favorable rating among possible Republican 2012 presidential candidates, Gallup reported.While Huckabee has the highest favorable score, Americans said former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was the most recognized, results released Monday indicated.GALLERY: 2012 Republican presidential possibilitiesFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are also widely recognized by Republicans and have favorability numbers similar to Palin's, the poll said.Overall, Huckabee's favorable score was the highest of the 13 potential candidates included in the survey, the Princeton, N.J., polling agency said. Palin, Gingrich and Romney have similar net favorable scores. Five of the potential candidates are relatively well known among Republicans nationwide, with Palin leading the candidates with 95 percent recognition. Huckabee, Gingrich, and Romney are recognized by between 84 percent and 87 percent of Republicans, while Rep. Ron Paul of Texas is recognized by 73 percent. Other Republican politicians tested in the poll were Govs. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Mitch Daniels of Indiana; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; former Govs. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, John Huntsman of Utah and Gary Johnson of New Mexico; Indiana Rep. Mike Pence; and South Dakota Sen. John Thune.Texas Gov. Rick Perry, not included in the Gallup survey, indicated he isn't interested in running for president in 2012, and that's fine by a majority of Texans, a poll conducted for the state's major newspapers indicated. Results indicated nearly two-thirds of Texas voters oppose a Perry bid for the White House. No indication of when the poll was conducted, its survey sample or margin of error was given in two Texas newspapers. Results for the Gallup poll were based on nationwide telephone interviews conducted with 923 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents Tuesday and Wednesday. The margin of error is 4 percentage points.

DECATUR, Texas, March 22 (UPI) -- A suspect in a shootout with police in Texas has died and police in Denver say he was the man sought in the slaying of Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements.Clements, 58, director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, was killed late Tuesday when he opened the front door at his home in Monument, Colo.The suspect in Texas, whose name hasn't been officially released, led police on a chase Thursday before his vehicle was involved in a collision with a tractor-trailer, Wise County (Texas) Sheriff David Walker said Thursday. The suspect was shot during an exchange of gunfire in Decatur, Texas, after the crash.Citing federal and state law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, The Denver Post reported Friday the suspect was Evan Ebel, 28, a member of a white supremacist prison gang.He had been on life support at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, and was considered brain dead after the shootout in Decatur. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office said Ebel was removed from life support and has died, the Post reported.Colorado law enforcement officials are looking into whether Ebel may have killed 27-year-old pizza delivery driver Nathan Collin Leon in Denver Sunday, the newspaper said.The Denver Police Department posted a message on its Twitter feed Friday saying investigators "are confident the Texas suspect is also suspect in the Denver/Golden case."Ebel was driving a black, four-door Cadillac with Colorado license plates. Colorado police had said Wednesday they were looking for a Cadillac or Lincoln in the shooting death of Clements.

SEOUL, Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Pressure is mounting on North Korea to abandon its publicly stated plan to perform a third nuclear test detonation, diplomats said.This comes as state-controlled media in North Korea said leader Kim Jong Un has made an "important" decision regarding the nation's nuclear policy following a meeting with a large group of military leaders. The North said Jan. 24 it would detonate a third weapon in an underground test facility in response to a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning its Dec. 12 long-range rocket test.China, North Korea's closest ally in the region, is said to be working behind the scenes to get North Korea to scrap the planned nuclear test, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said Sunday. Though China has yet to acknowledge it publicly, a high-level envoy may travel to Pyongyang to urge Kim not to set off the bomb. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak urged military and civilian leaders to be vigilant against aggression from the North and made an unscheduled visit to his security headquarters to examine the nation's ongoing efforts to monitor its reclusive neighbor.

| License Photo	May 27 (UPI) -- Adrian Peterson told Bruce Murray and Amani Toomer on Sirius/XM NFL Radio Thursday that he has relatives who are gay but doesn't support gay marriage, NESN reported Monday. When asked about speculation that the Minnesota Vikings had released punter Chris Kluwe for being too open about his pro-gay marriage stance, the 28-year-old running back admitted he's against it. To each his own. I’m not with it. But I have relatives that are gay. I’m not biased towards them. I still treat them the same. I love ‘em. But again, I’m not with that. That’s not something I believe in. But to each his own.The Vikings released Kluwe in favor of fifth-round draft pick Jeff Locke earlier this month. "He was a good friend of mine and a really cool guy," Peterson said of Kluwe, now a punter with the Oakland Raiders. "[He's] probably one of the smartest guys I've ever been around. [He's] different" Peterson said he didn't think his team had made their decision based on Kluwe's political views. "They know Kluwe. They've been knowing him for a long time. They know he's outspoken," he said.

Wiki
Joseph Charles John "Joe" Piscopo (pronounced PIS-ka-po) (born June 17, 1951) is an American comedian and actor best known for his work on Saturday Night Live.
Born in Passaic, New Jersey, Piscopo attended West Essex High School and was a member of the drama club "the Masquers". He developed a reputation for never playing a part the way it was written. When he was not clowning around he could usually be found lifting weights with his cousins Paul LaMagna and Bill Dolphin (Scarecrow). Although his mother wanted him to follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer, Joe ultimately went into stand-up comedy in the late 1970s, becoming a cast member of the short-lived sketch-comedy series Madhouse Brigade in 1978.
In the summer of 1980, he was hired as a contract player for Saturday Night Live. The show had gone through major upheaval when all the writers, major producers, and cast members had left that spring. The all-new cast bombed with critics and fans with the exception of Piscopo and Eddie Murphy; they were also the only two cast members to be kept when Dick Ebersol took over the show the following spring.
