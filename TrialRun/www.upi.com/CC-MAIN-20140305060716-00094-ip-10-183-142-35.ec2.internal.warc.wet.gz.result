CHICAGO, Dec. 12 (UPI) -- Grain futures closed mostly lower Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve tweaked its monetary policy positions.On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn was off 2 to off 3 1/4, soybeans were off 5 1/4 to up 1 1/2, wheat was off 9 1/4 to off 11 and oats were off 2 1/4 to off 3 1/2.Corn closed slightly lower with demand described as sluggish.

Stocks on Wall Street were little changed after the announcement.The prices:Corn: Dec 7.21 off 3 1/4, Mar 7.25 1/2 off 2 1/2, May 7.28 1/2 off 2, Jly 7.24 off 2 1/4.Soybeans: Jan 14.73 1/2 up 1 1/2, Mar 14.70 1/2 off 3/4, May 14.55 off 4, Jly 14.40 3/4 off 5 1/4.Wheat: Dec 7.94 3/4 off 11, Mar 8.12 off 9 1/2, May 8.24 1/2 off 9 1/4, 8.32 3/4 off 9 1/2.Oats: Dec. 3.69 1/4 off 3 1/2, Mar 3.85 1/4 off 2 3/4, May 3.90 off 2 1/4, Jly 3.89 off 2 3/4.

CANBERRA, Australia, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The Australian government will build a land-based test site near Adelaide to ensure working order of submarine subsystems units before installation in new vessels.Subsystems include propulsion, energy plant and integration technology, a statement from the Australian Department of Defense said.The decision was based on a study started in November for the Future Submarine Program by the contractor Babcock and with input from the government's Defense Science and Technology Organization.Australia's submarines are built in Adelaide, South Australia, and details of the new test facility are being considered."Elements of the facility will be located also in Western Australia where the navy will have easy access for training purposes, and in Victoria where DSTO maritime specialists are based," the statement said.The Future Submarine project -- with vessels yet to be designed -- will be the largest and most complex defense project undertaken by Australia.The test site will be integral to the project because it should reduce the risk of delay, cost overruns, poor availability and increased operating and sustainment costs.The facility will also help with maintenance of the Collins class fleet, which suffered problems earlier in its procurement process and up to now.The announcement of the test site comes at the same time as publication of a major report on sustainment contracts for the six Collins Class vessels, the Coles Review, led by John Coles, an independent expert from BMT Defense Services in the United Kingdom.Since the first of the vessels was delivered around 15 years ago the fleet has suffered maintenance issues and systems failures that have meant only one sub has been operational.Two submarines -- the HMAS Sheean and HMAS Rankin -- are in "deep maintenance" and completely unavailable, the Defense Industry Daily news website reported last month.The HMAS Farncomb is in port facing indeterminate maintenance. The original HMAS Collins submarine, commissioned in 1996, is on "limited availability" -- considered fit only for training.The HMAS Waller was in port for major battery repairs as recently as May 2009, the Defense Industry Daily report said.The Coles Review has been endorsed by the navy, the government's Defense Materiel Organization, Department of Finance and Deregulation and shipbuilder contractor ASC.The report made 25 recommendations to restore the Collins class fleet to an international benchmark by 2016.One recommendation recently was signed, a five-year performance-based In Service Support Contract to ensure work being undertaken on the Collins submarines is to required quality and delivered on time.Under the contract, which started July 1, the DMO has options to be exercised subject to satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, May 7 (UPI) -- Sundance Channel says it has ordered a 10-episode second season of the Georgia-set drama "Rectify," its first wholly owned original scripted series.Season 1 is to wrap May 20. Its second season is to begin airing in 2014.Aden Young stars in the show, which Sundance describes as "a haunting story of a man released from prison after spending nearly two decades on death row." The cast also includes Abigail Spencer, Luke Kirby and J. Smith Cameron."The response to 'Rectify' has been incredible," Sarah Barnett, Sundance Channel's president and general manager, said in a statement."We feel as though this story has tapped into something truly unique, with both critics and audiences using their platforms to share such strong, personal reactions to this very distinctive TV series. There's so much drama and character that's been set up in the first season, it will be electrifying to see where 'Rectify' goes in Season 2."

| License Photo	Aug. 20 (UPI) -- The world's largest retailer was out of business for about half an hour Monday afternoon, when Amazon.com's website and mobile apps went out of commission.Amazon's outage, which lasted from approximately 2:45 p.m. to 3:35 p.m. ET, was the third crash of a major online site in a week: the New York Times experienced more than an hour of downtime last Wednesday, and Google, along with Gmail and YouTube, were dark for about five minutes Friday.While Amazon has not offered any explanation for the downtime, its Amazon Web Services dashboard and compute cloud listed error messages."We are currently experiencing elevated error rates for the AWS Management Console," Amazon said, and with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon said it was "investigating increased API error rates and latencies for tagging related API calls in the US-EAST-1 region" in Northern Virginia.Amazon rakes in more than $100,000 per minute, according to 2012 estimates, meaning the brief outage may have cost the company some $5 million in revenue.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Damascus, the world's oldest continually inhabited city, is now a key battleground in Syria's civil war, which enters its third year in March.Rebel forces are intensifying their assault on the ancient capital, where the beleaguered minority regime of President Bashar Assad has concentrated its elite and most loyal troops.The other flash point is in the north around Aleppo, another ancient city that used to be Syria's commercial heart, with rebel forces steadily making gains in heavy fighting.But the war, which the United Nations estimates has killed 70,000 people since the uprising against Assad began March 15, 2011, is likely to be won or lost in Damascus. And there's probably hard fighting still ahead.Government forces hold the center of Damascus and a ring of strong points that have blocked major rebel efforts to break into the inner city where the regime's military and intelligence power centers are located.Fighting has raged for months and the rebels, mainly the ferocious jihadist groups and the secular Free Syria Army, are able to sometimes penetrate this ring of steel and concrete with devastating effect.On Feb. 21, a huge car bomb exploded outside the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, a prominent symbol of the regime on Thawra Street in the downtown district of Maazra.The state news agency reported 53 people killed and more than 200 wounded. The United Kingdom's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group, put the death toll at 61.Including other bombings in the city that day, the Observatory said the fatality toll was 85.One of the wounded was Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a longtime Syrian puppet and a relic of the Palestinian wars of the 1970s and '80s.The Russian Embassy was damaged in the Thawra Street blast, which occurred as rebel forces made a determined effort to push into the city center.These forces, largely from Syria's Sunni majority, have been held by regime's superior firepower and control of the air.The army's elite units are manned by minority Alawites, an obscure offshoot of Shiite Islam which dominates the regime.As pillars of thick black smoke billowed over the city, army headquarters came under mortar fire. Other mortar rounds exploded near Assad's presidential palace.Some parts of the old city have been badly hit by the destructive chaos. World heritage sites, including the fabled Umayyad Mosque, built after the Arab conquest of the city in A.D. 634, have been damaged, just as much of the historic vaulted souk, or market, in Aleppo were burned down.Damascus has seen it all before over the millennia -- and survived.Carbon dating indicates it has probably been inhabited since 6300 B.C.It's always been fought over. In 1260 B.C, it became a battlefield between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, who emerged victorious. By the eighth century B.C. Damascus was the cultural and economic center of the Near East, and remained so for more than 1,000 years.It's been conquered many times, by Alexander the Great in 323 B.C., finally by Australian cavalry, as well as Britain's legendary Col. T.E. Lawrence on Oct. 1, 1918, when the Ottoman Empire finally crumbled.The current conflict seems to have "evolved into a war of attrition," says Middle East analyst Victor Kotsev."Despite significant rebel advances in the last few weeks and months -- including the capture of a major air force base in Aleppo and the largest dam in the country -- the conflict has stalemated and right now it looks as if President Assad may be able to cling to power for longer than most Western officials and media outlets acknowledge."Still, in the end, he's likely doomed, but not so much because he stands to collapse rapidly in the manner in which Moammar Gadhafi did in 2011."Instead, as experts note, regime troops can't easily be replaced, as compared to rebels, who are drawing on a larger pool of willing fighters, from Syria and abroad," Kotsev noted.So things may be getting pretty bad for Assad. The regime was recently reported to have been forced to recruit women to fill the ranks of the beleaguered army.

WASHINGTON, April 27 (UPI) -- More than 68,000 guns seized by Mexican authorities from 2007 to 2011 have been traced to the United States, U.S. officials said.The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a news release the guns had been manufactured in the United States or legally imported into the United States by a federal firearms licensee.All the guns were suspected of being used in crimes in Mexico.The guns were among more than 99,000 the Mexican government submitted to ATF for tracking, the release said.During the five-year span, ATF said the proportion of pistols had declined from 44.9 percent of seizures in 2007 to 38 percent in 2011 while the proportion of rifles seized climbed from 28.2 percent to 43.3 percent.The Christian Science Monitor has reported at least 50,000 people are estimated to have died in organized crime-related killings since 2006 in Mexico, which has been beset by drug cartel violence.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Washington Post has joined the list of targets attacked by Chinese hackers that includes The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the Times reported.The Times reported Wednesday its computer systems had been compromised by cyberattacks from China, with The Wall Street Journal saying Thursday it had experienced similar attacks.The Times Friday reported The Washington Post also was attacked in 2012, when newsroom computers were found to be in communication with servers in China.Washington Post Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Lee said the company "did not have anything to share at this time."China has denied the hacking allegations."All such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results," a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.

Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Interest in Mars exploration was revived when NASA successfully landed the Curiosity Rover in the Gale crater last year, with millions of people watching the "seven minutes of terror" descent of the rover to the surface. But Curiosity does not roam the Red Planet entirely alone: the chatty robotic lab joined Spirit and Opportunity, twin rovers who this week celebrate their 9th anniversary exploring the Martian landscape.Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004, were initially slated for a 90-sol (90 Mars days) mission but ended up lasting more than 20 times that--about six years--until it got stuck in soft soil and became unrecoverable. Opportunity continues to move and gather data.The two rovers were instrumental in confirming the past presence of water on a planet that is now too cold and dry to sustain life.

The Sun's magnetic field and releases of plasma directly affect Earth and the rest of the solar system. Solar wind shapes the Earth's magnetosphere and magnetic storms are illustrated here as approaching Earth. These storms, which occur frequently, can disrupt communications and navigational equipment, damage satellites, and even cause blackouts. The white lines represent the solar wind; the purple line is the bow shock line; and the blue lines surrounding the Earth represent its protective magnetosphere. The magnetic cloud of plasma can extend to 30 million miles wide by the time it reaches earth. UPI/SOHO/ESA/NASA | License Photo
