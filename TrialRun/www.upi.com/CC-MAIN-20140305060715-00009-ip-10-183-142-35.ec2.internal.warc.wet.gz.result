FRANKFURT, Germany, Feb. 6 (UPI) -- The European Central Bank left its key monetary policies in place Thursday pointing to a "moderate recovery" that was proceeding as the bank expected."We decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment," said ECB President Mario Draghi at a news conference.In spite of that, Draghi said the eurozone was "now experiencing a prolonged period of low inflation," indicating the point that low inflation had grown as a concern."Underlying price pressures in the euro area remain weak and monetary and credit dynamics are subdued," he said.Economists fear that when prices trend lower in a period of so-called deflation, that economy stalls because purchases are put off on the expectation that prices will continue to drop.The ECB lowered its key lending rates in November 2013, dropping its main bank-to-bank rate from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent. It also lowered its marginal lending rate facility, generally used for emergency loans, 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.At the time, Draghi said the increased liquidity was required for the 18-member currency region, "given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1 percent."The bank has a target inflation rate of 2 percent.But Draghi said policy makers are banking on a slow recovery. "Our previous assessment of economic growth has been confirmed," he said, predicting output in the eurozone to grow "at a slow pace." "In particular, some improvement in domestic demand should materialize, supported by the [accommodating] monetary policy stance, improving financial conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms," he said.

BAAR, Switzerland, Sept. 5 (UPI) -- The Greek government expressed interest in the implementation of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline for Europe, the project company announced.Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos said the government was committed to TAP as part of the Southern Corridor of transit systems planned for Europe.TAP Managing Director Kjetil Tungland said the sentiment is a testament to the enduring partnerships with European and Greek parties."This is just a further step in the good and productive relationship TAP has had with the Greek government and the country's authorities throughout the project's development," he said in a statement.The BP-led consortium controlling operations at Shah Deniz has said the pipeline is one possible transit option for European consumers. TAP could move as much as 353 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year to the region through Greece, Albania and Italy.By next year, the BP-led group should decide between Nabucco West, a scaled-down version of the larger $10 billion project, and TAP as the conduit for Azeri natural gas.

LONDON, April 16 (UPI) -- David Tennant, the star of British period drama "Casanova," has been named the new Doctor Who. Tennant, who will become the 10th Time Lord of the British TV series "Doctor Who," is taking over from Christopher Eccleston, who quit after performing for one season, the BBC reported Saturday. "I grew up loving 'Doctor Who' and it has been a lifelong dream to get my very own Tardis," said Tennant. "Taking over from Chris is a daunting prospect -- he has done a fantastic job of reinventing the doctor for a new generation and is a very tough act to follow." Tennant has also starred in BBC shows "Blackpool" and "He Knew He Was Right," and the movie "Bright Young Things."A new 13-part "Dr. Who" adventure and Christmas special will begin filming later in 2005.

LONDON, Sept. 23 (UPI) -- The recession threatens to derail reforms in long-term care leaving the elderly facing mounting medical bills, an economic adviser to the U.K. government says.Government ministers are debating proposals that would mean no one would pay more than a maximum of $54,000 for their long-term care, with any costs above that covered by the state, The Daily Telegraph said.However, the economist who drew up the proposals said he worries the economic crisis will make Prime Minister David Cameron reluctant to commit to the extra $2.6 billion a year the plan would cost.Andrew Dilnot, appointed last year by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, said he did not think his reforms were "dead" but urged health advocates to hold Cameron's "feet to the fire" to ensure the government acts.In July, Dilnot proposed a "social insurance" system, potentially funded through higher taxes, to ensure the elderly no longer face "catastrophic" bills for long-term care.He acknowledged politicians were reluctant to commit more public money in a troubled economy."There is a problem," he said. "There is inertia because the public finances are not in a good way. If we had got this out 10 years ago, there would not be a discussion about public funding. We have got a much steeper hill to climb."

| License Photo	OSLO, Norway, March 15 (UPI) -- A Norwegian family said they visited their cabin after leaving it alone all winter and discovered a meteorite had crashed through the roof.Rune Thomassen said he and his family went to the cabin Sunday in Oslo's Rodel kka district and immediately saw a hole in the roof, Norway News.com reported Thursday.The family went inside and discovered the culprit was a meteorite that had crashed through the roof at some point during the winter.GALLERY: 2012: The year in spaceKnut Jorgen Roed Odegaard, an astrophysicist at the University of Oslo, said only 14 meteorites have been found in Norway since 1848. He said the object that hit the cabin likely fell sometime around March 1, when several meteor sightings were reported."We took in hundreds of tips and have been searching for bits of meteorites," Odegaard said. "And then we find this right here in Oslo!"Hans Amundsen, a member of NASA's astrobiological institute, said the meteorite was "very rare" because "you can see in its cross-section that it contains bits of many different particles that are compressed together."

TEL AVIV, Israel, June 16 (UPI) -- Israel's natural gas bonanza in the eastern Mediterranean just keep getting bigger, with reserves currently pegged at around 25 trillion cubic feet.That's enough to guarantee the Jewish state, dependent on imported energy since it was founded in 1948, energy security for at least two decades.The strikes at three fields, dubbed Tamar, Dalit and Leviathan, could even turn Israel into a gas exporter and transform its economy. There are indications that there's oil down there as well.But the offshore finds may become a casus belli as Lebanon, Israel's northern neighbor and longtime battleground, lays claim to the gas fields as well.Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper reported June 8 that the biggest field found off Israel, Leviathan, extends north into Lebanese waters and could well aggravate tensions between the countries.Under the headline "Israel prepares to steal gas fields in Lebanon's waters," the leftist daily said if Israel tried to siphon gas from Lebanese territory, Beirut would be forced to defend its resources.One of Hezbollah's top leaders, Hashem Safieddine, head of the Iranian-backed movement's executive council, has declared it won't allow Israel to "loot" Lebanese gas resources.Israel's military chiefs say Hezbollah currently possesses around 45,000 missiles and rockets, which could be fired at Israel's emerging energy infrastructure centered on the port of Haifa.The city was repeatedly hit by Hezbollah rockets during the 34-day war with Israel in July and August 2006.These days, Hezbollah purportedly has long-range weapons that have greater accuracy and carry more destructive warheads than those used in 2006. These are capable of hitting just about anywhere in Israel.In the event of renewed hostilities, and both sides are talking tough again, Israel's energy installations would be prime targets.Lebanon's parliament speaker, Hezbollah ally Nabih Berri, has urged the Beirut government to move swiftly to start its own offshore exploration or risk Israel claiming whatever resources there are."Israel is racing to make the case a fait accompli and was quick to present itself as an oil emirate, ignoring the fact that, according to the maps, the deposits extend into Lebanese waters," said Berri.The speaker, who has submitted a parliamentary bill to launch exploration of Lebanon's potential offshore reserves, declared: "Lebanon must take immediate action to defend its financial, political, economic and sovereign rights."Israeli officials insist that the gas fields lie within Israeli territorial waters.However, the liberal Haaretz daily noted Tuesday, "Israel has yet to declare its exclusive economic zone, though this usually applies to what in the sea, such as fish, and not what lies under the continental shelf."It quoted Professor Moshe Hirsch of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, an expert in international law, as saying that problem could arise when the continental shelf is shared by more than one country.But he maintained the gas lies squarely in Israel's sector of the continental shelf and so there was no need top declare an exclusive economic zone.Strikes were made early this year at the Dalit field off Hadera, south of Haifa by a consortium headed by Noble Energy, a U.S. company with headquarters in Houston, which is working with three Israeli firms.Tamar, 50 miles east of Haifa, was found in 2009. Last week Nobel raised its original estimate of the field's size by 33 percent to 8.4 trillion cubic feet of gas.But then came the discovery of Leviathan, double the size of Tamar at an estimated 16 trillion cubic feet of gas, further off the coast.Nobel said that total offshore reserves could top 30 trillion cubic feet, double Britain's giant gas fields in the North Sea, with a conservative value of some $300 billion. Nobel is moving a drilling platform from the Gulf of Mexico to step up exploration.Gas production is to begin in 2012. Israel is planning to build a liquefied natural gas plant near Haifa but it probably won't go online until 2015.The gas finds, particularly Leviathan, which may turn out to be even bigger, are "nothing short of a geopolitical gamechanger," Gal Luft, executive director of the U.S.-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, wrote in Haaretz Sunday."Altogether the basin the eastern Mediterranean … could contain an amount of gas equivalent to one-fifth of U.S. natural gas reserves."

NEW YORK, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- Some 1,800 New York University students have been notified by the New York City school that their Social Security numbers were posted on the Internet. "We regret the concern that this may cause our students and former students who were on the list, and we apologize to them," John Beckman, an NYU spokesman, told the New York Times.University officials said the information -- names, Social Security numbers and in some cases telephone numbers -- were published on NYU's Web site on a list of students interested in intramural sports, the Times reported Saturday. Brian Ristuccia, a computer technician in Massachusetts, said he notified the university of the snafu in December anonymously because "it is very common for an organization faced with a security problem to blame the person that discovers the problem."Ristuccia added he copied the information "so that it would be difficult for NYU to claim that the information never existed." The university denied being notified and questioned why Ristuccia posted the information on his Web site, the Times said. Beckman said the university was considering using a different student identification system than Social Security numbers.

Gov. Brian Schatz, Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle and Adm. Robert Willard, KITV, Honolulu, reported.The president's trip was delayed nearly a week because of extended congressional discussion on the payroll tax cut.

Obama signed it 5 minutes later and headed to Hawaii for his vacation.Dozens of people came out to watch the presidential motorcade head to the Obama vacation home on Kailua Beach, KHON-TV, Honolulu, reported."It's exciting. It's a lot more than I expected," said Kim Houston, a visitor from Alaska."Every year we try to be out here and wave him in and say 'aloha,'" said Kailua resident Peter Quigley.The Obama family is spending their Christmas in a five-bedroom house on Kailua Beach, CNN reported. The first family has vacationed on Kailua Beach for the past three years.The house boasts a larger swimming pool and more security than houses the Obama family rented in years past, said local real estate agent David Dunham.After the Obamas return to Washington, Dunham plans to sell the house with an asking price of $7.9 million.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, May 2 (UPI) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan apparently fled to Los Angeles International Airport Thursday instead of checking into a court-mandated rehab center, a prosecutor said."I hear she's on her way to LAX and getting on a flight back to New York," Santa Monica Chief Deputy City Attorney Terry White told the New York Post hours after Lohan's attorney assured a California Superior Court judge Lohan was already "ensconced in the bosom" of the Morningside Recovery drug rehab center in Newport Beach, Calif., south of Los Angeles."She's there. In fact, she is going to be meeting later today with a psychiatrist, and her therapy and treatment is undergoing immediate commencement," Lohan attorney Mark Heller told Judge James Dabney.White said if it's true Lohan has fled, he would ask Dabney to issue a warrant for Lohan's immediate arrest.The Post said that could happen as early as Friday.The troubled actress, who made her motion picture debut in Disney's remake of "The Parent Trap," was under court order to begin 90 days of rehabilitation to settle charges she lied to police after crashing into a truck on California's Pacific Coast Highway last summer.Minutes after Heller told Dabney Lohan had checked in, celebrity news website TMZ published photos of Lohan shopping at Fry's Electronics, a big-box consumer electronics store, in Fountain Valley, 8 miles south of Newport Beach."Lindsay Lohan's lawyer lied in court when he said his client was already ensconced in a rehab facility," the website said. "She was actually roaming the aisles of an electronics store."About 2 hours later, Lohan is reported to have pulled up to Morningside in a sport utility vehicle but drove away without the actress getting out.Morningside is unlicensed, California Department of Alcohol and Drug Program Deputy Director Millicent Tidwell told the Post.It's illegal in California to offer residential drug and alcohol treatment without a license.It wasn't immediately clear if Lohan or her team knew Morningside was unlicensed.The "Mean Girls" actress earlier agreed to check in Thursday to the Seafield Center alcohol and drug rehab center in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., on Long Island.But at the last second, she went against the prosecution's recommendation and said she would check in to Morningside, Heller said.

NAYPYITAW, Myanmar, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Journalists in Myanmar said they received warning notifications from Google that their email accounts may have been hacked by "state-sponsored attackers."The journalists are employees of Eleven Media, one of the country's leading news organizations, and Bertil Lintner, an expert on Myanmar's ethnic groups, The New York Times reported.Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman in Tokyo said he could not provide specific information about the warnings or where the attacks came from."I can certainly confirm that we send these types of notices to accounts that we suspect are the targets of state-sponsored attacks," he said.Meadows could not say how Google identifies a "state-sponsored" attack and could provide no other details "without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors."Myanmar news publications have been highly censored during five decades of military rule, but those restrictions have been lifted since President Thein Sein came to power nearly two years ago, the Times reported.

Wiki
Harry Mason Reid (born December 2, 1939) is the senior United States Senator from Nevada, serving since 1987. A member of the Democratic Party, he has been the Senate Majority Leader since January 2007, having previously served as Minority Leader and Minority and Majority Whip.
Previously, Reid was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Nevada's 1st congressional district, and served in Nevada local and state government as city attorney of Henderson, a state legislator, Lieutenant Governor, and chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission.
Reid was born in Searchlight, Nevada, the third of the four sons of Inez Orena Jaynes, a laundress, and Harry Vincent Reid, a miner. His paternal grandmother was an English immigrant from Darlston, Staffordshire. Reid's boyhood home had no indoor toilet, hot water or telephone. Searchlight had no high school, so Reid boarded with relatives 40 miles away in Henderson, Nevada to attend Basic High School where he played football, and was an amateur boxer. While at Basic High he met future Nevada governor Mike O'Callaghan, who was a teacher there. Reid attended Southern Utah University and graduated from Utah State University. He then went to George Washington University Law School earning a J.D. while working for the United States Capitol Police.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
