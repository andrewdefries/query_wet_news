CHICAGO, April 25 (UPI) -- The balance of genders among top professions leans heavily toward men but women are making strides forward, U.S. employment firm CareerBuilder said."While employers have made strides in equalizing compensation for both genders, historical gaps are still present in some organizations today," Rosemary Haefner, vice president of Human Resources at CareerBuilder said in a statement."Also contributing to the disparity in income levels is a higher representation of men working in more lucrative occupations. Fortunately, we're starting to see that balance out as women account for a larger percentage of the overall workforce and pursue employment in high-paying areas," she said.A CareerBuilder survey indicated that four of 15 top-paying jobs are dominated by women. Among oral and maxillofacial surgeons and among orthodontists, 57 percent are women. Among prosthodontists, 62 percent are women. And 66 percent of pharmacists are women, the survey indicated.Among physicians and surgeons the gender disparity is modest with 45 percent women and 55 percent men. Among dentists, it is close with 49 percent women.But in most top-tier jobs, men have most of the positions. Among chief executive officers, 83 percent are men, for example.Men also comprise 97 percent of engineering managers, 77 percent of computer and information systems managers, 72 percent of natural science managers and 90 percent of air traffic controllers.Men dominate the fields of petroleum engineers, marketing managers, airline pilots, lawyers and general managers' positions.Women dominate in the fields of registered nurse -- 96 percent women -- and psychiatry, 62 percent of psychiatrists are women.The survey indicated women make up 57 percent of anesthesiologists, 58 percent of pediatricians, 66 percent of probation officers and 70 percent of translators and interpreters.Claims adjusters, industrial-organizational psychologists, public relations specialist, curators, graphic designers, editors and mathematical technicians are all mostly women, as are bartenders, 59 percent of whom are women, the survey said.Where is there balance? There is an even split among political scientists, advertising and promotions managers and school bus drivers.There is only a small gender gap among arbitrators, mediators and conciliators, sociologists, computer operators, bakers, medical scientists, accountant and auditors, statisticians, retail sales persons, optometrists, art directors, post secondary teachers, and training and development managers, CareerBuilder said.The survey, conducted in March by Harris Interactive, included interviews with 1,746 men and 1,475 women, CareerBuilder said.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UPI) -- U.S. motor group AAA reports that retail gasoline prices are 7 cents higher than one month ago, with the East Coast and Midwest seeing the highest prices.AAA reports that U.S. commuters Tuesday could expect to pay, on average, $3.36 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline. That's 7 cents higher than the national average one month ago but 6 cents lower than the same time last year.Drivers in New York City paid $3.83 for a gallon of regular unleaded Tuesday. Gasoline prices for the East Coast spiked after superstorm Sandy hit the region in late 2012.For Chicago, commuters Tuesday paid around $3.60 for a gallon of regular unleaded, the motor group reports.AAA Nebraska spokeswoman Rose White said the gasoline price increase in the Midwest was in part because of higher demand for crude oil from Canada, the Lincoln (Neb.) Journal Star reports.Pipeline companies in the United States and Canada have moved to either reverse existing pipeline networks, like the Seaway pipeline, or build new ones, like Keystone XL, to ease the bottleneck at a storage hub in Cushing, Okla. The Nebraska report said that move leaves the Midwest without its normal refinery supplies, which it said may explain gasoline price spikes in the region.Nebraskans paid about $3.34 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline Tuesday, up 14 cents compared to last month.

Today is Thursday, Sept. 8, the 251st day of 2005 with 114 to follow.The moon is waxing. The morning stars are Mercury, Mars and Saturn. The evening stars are Neptune, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus and Pluto.Those born on this date are under the sign of Virgo. They include England's King Richard I, "Richard the Lion Hearted," in 1157; composer Antonin Dvorak in 1841; stage and film director Max Reinhardt in 1873; country music pioneer Jimmie Rodgers, "The Singing Brakeman," in 1897; Florida Sen. Claude Pepper in 1900; comedian Sid Caesar and political activist Lyndon Larouche Jr., both in 1922 (age 83); actor Peter Sellers in 1925; country music singer Patsy Cline in 1932; former Sen. Sam Nunn in 1938 (age 67); and actors Henry Thomas ("E.T. -- The Extra-Terrestrial") in 1971 (age 34) and Jonathan Taylor Thomas ("Home Improvement") in 1981 (age 24).On this date in history:In 1522, Spanish navigator Juan de Elcano returned to Spain, completing the first circumnavigation of the globe with an expedition that began under Ferdinand Magellan.In 1565, the first permanent European settlement in what is now the continental United States was founded on the site of the present St. Augustine, Fla.In 1900, more than 6,000 people were killed when a hurricane and tidal wave struck Galveston, Texas.In 1935, an assassin shot autocratic Louisiana Sen. Huey P. Long at the Capitol building in Baton Rouge, La. Long died two days later.Also in 1935, 19-year-old Frank Sinatra launched his singing career when he appeared with a group called The Hoboken Four on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour radio talent show.In 1966, "Star Trek" premiered on NBC-TV.In 1974, President Ford granted former President Nixon full pardon for any and all offenses he may have committed during his years in office.In 1993, the Senate approved President Clinton's national-service bill, which would give participants grants for taking part in community service work.In 1994, a U.S. Airways jetliner crashed near Pittsburgh, killing 132 people. The accident became the subject of the longest aircraft investigation in the history of the National Transportation Safety Board.In 1998, the Justice Department opened a preliminary inquiry into President Clinton's participation in Democratic fundraising for the 1996 re-election campaign.In 1999, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley returned to his hometown of Crystal City, Mo., to announce he was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.In 2002 sports, Pete Sampras won his fifth men's U.S. Open tennis championship with a four-set victory over Andre Agassi. Sampras retired the following year as the 2003 Open was about to begin.In 2003, New York police beefed up subway security because of renewed fears about a possible gas or chemical assault.Also in 2003, the U.S. music industry filed lawsuits against 261 people, accusing them of violating copyright laws by swapping online music files.In 2004, CBS reported that newly discovered documents bolstered claims that President Bush failed to meet his responsibilities while a member of the Texas National Guard in the 1970s. But, serious doubts soon arose as to validity of the documents.A thought for the day: in "Middlemarch," English novelist Mary Anne Evans (George Eliot) wrote, "... men know best about everything, except what women know better."

DARTMOOR, England, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Archaeologists in Britain say a hoard of treasures unearthed in a 4,000-year-old tomb on Dartmoor is the most significant ancient find made to date on the moor.An intact burial of cremated remains was found in the tomb chamber, known as a cist, wrapped in an animal pelt containing a delicate bracelet studded with tin beads, a textile fragment with detailed leather fringing and a unique coiled bag, they said."Visibly it's not as impressive as Stonehenge, but archaeologically it's just as important," Dartmoor National Park chief archaeologist Jane Marchland told the BBC.Just eight beads have been found on Dartmoor in the last 100 years, she said."It was incredibly exciting to lift the lid and a bead fell out."In a conservation lab researchers have been studying the pelt and its contents."The level of preservation we have got is amazing," conservator Helen Williams said. "We're awaiting DNA results on the pelt so we can identify what animal it might have come from.""Amazing doesn't really do them justice. It's the most extraordinary assortment of finds with tin beads and wooden ear studs."The beads are the earliest evidence of tin found in the country's southwest, archaeologists said.

ACAPULCO, Mexico, Feb. 28 (UPI) -- Top-seeded Roberta Vinci advanced and No. 2 seed Flavia Pennetta also scored a victory Tuesday in first-round action at the Mexican Open. The two Italians each moved on with straight-set wins over Spanish opponents on the red clay at the Fairmont Acapulco Princess.Vinci defeated Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), while Pennetta -- who won the Mexican Open in 2005 and 2008 and was runner-up four other times -- had little trouble in her 6-4, 6-2 triumph over Arantxa Parra Santonja.Third-seeded Sara Errani of Italy also breezed into the second round with a 6-1, 6-1 rout of American Irina Falconi.But the news wasn't as good for another seeded player as No. 5 Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania was upset by Slovakian Magdalena Rybarikova, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).Sixth seed Johanna Larsson of Sweden got by Bulgarian qualifier Sesil Karatantcheva 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, while defending Acapulco champion Gisela Dulko pulled out due to illness.

| License Photo	DENVER, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was released on bail Thursday after appearing in court on assault and kidnapping charges.Varlamov, 25, was arrested after a complaint, apparently filed by his girlfriend, alleged that on Monday he kicked the woman, knocked her down and dragged her by the hair, Denver police said.Varlamov surrendered to authorities about 6 p.m. Wednesday.He was taken before a judge Thursday where bail was set at $5,000 and Varlamov was given permission to travel. The judge also issued a restraining order, The Denver Post said.The Post quoted the alleged victim's attorney as saying the woman had been beaten several times. The alleged victim's name was redacted from official court documents released to the public.The Colorado Avalanche issued a statement about the arrest, saying only that the team was aware of the incident and wouldn't comment. The NHL put out a similar statement.Varlamov is in his sixth season in the NHL. He played for the Washington Capitals prior to joining the Avalanche before the 2011-12 season. He's played in eight of Colorado's 11 games this season, winning seven and allowing 14 goals.The Avalanche have 20 points this season, second-most in the NHL. Colorado next plays Friday at Dallas. It was unclear whether Varlamov would make the trip.

June 18 (UPI) -- A team of Australian researchers have uncovered a 1,200-year-old city buried beneath the jungles of Cambodia thanks to new technology that allowed them to create a detailed archeological survey.The city, which predates the famous Angkor Wat by several centuries, indicates the previously known temple complex was a part of a much larger, sprawling city rather than a walled-in city.A study led by the Archaeology and Development Foundations Phnom Kulen program and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences relied on LiDAR -- light detection and ranging -- airborne laser scanning to across a swath of about 140 square miles in northwestern Cambodia.The images revealed, "with exceptional clarity," "a vast, low-density urban periphery stretching far beyond the major Angkorian temples."Most of these structures were only revealed thanks to LiDar's "unparalleled ability to penetrate dense vegetation cover and map archeological remains on the floor," the researchers said. In video footage of the team trooping through the jungle, only a few stones are visible, as much of the archaeology is encased in the ground.

| License Photo	NEWTOWN, Conn., March 28 (UPI) -- It took Adam Lanza less than 5 minutes to fire 155 bullets at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the lead prosecutor in the massacre said Thursday.State's Prosecutor Stephen Sedensky said 154 rounds were fired from a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle and one bullet was fired from a Glock handgun Lanza used to kill himself Dec. 14, NBC News reported.Some of the information from warrants and an accounting of what police recovered in Lanza's home and vehicle were released Thursday, a week before state lawmakers were to take up bipartisan reforms to Connecticut's gun laws, as well as and mental health and school safety reform.Authorities said three samurai swords were recovered at the home that Lanza shared with his mother, Nancy Lanza, whom he killed before heading to the elementary school, where he killed 20 children and six adults before shooting himself.Also recovered were a National Rifle Association certificate and boxes of Lanza's papers and writings, authorities said.Police also recovered nine 30-round magazines, three of which were full, for the Bushmaster Lanza took to Sandy Hook, NBC News said.Besides the Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle with a 30-round magazine and the Glock 10mm handgun, authorities said they found a Sig-Sauer 9mm semiautomatic pistol in the school.Police found a shotgun in the car Lanza drove to the school.All of the weapons were legally owned by his mother, authorities have said.Reports indicated Lanza was obsessed with mass killings, including the 2011 massacre in Oslo, Norway, in which 77 people died in a shooting and bomb attack.A law enforcement official told NBC News in February Lanza collected material on mass shootings, although the official said there was no indication whether the material had a role in the school massacre.State Senate Majority Leader Martin Looney, D-New Haven, has said next Wednesday is the date planned for a vote on a bipartisan package of gun reforms and mental health and school security legislation in the works for weeks since the Dec. 14 tragedy, the New Haven Register reported Thursday.The bipartisan legislation is expected to include a ban on future sales of magazines with greater than 10 rounds; universal background checks stronger penalties for gun violations and new registration rules, the Register said.

SEOUL, Feb. 22 (UPI) -- South Korea on Friday slammed an event promoting Japan's claim to the Dokdo islands, with officials terming its arguments "unjustifiable and meaningless."Tension over the contested islets was heightened when the Tokyo central government sent a senior Cabinet official to the annual "Dokdo Day" event, the Yonhap News Agency reported.Japan's Shimane prefecture, which claims administrative control over the islands, has held the event every Feb. 22 since 2006 to emphasize its claims, but this was the first year a member of the central government attended.In protest, South Korea "urged Japan to abolish ordinances about the designation of the Dokdo day and to immediately stop unjustifiable territorial claims to Dokdo," South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young said in a statement.The government vowed it would make "strong responses" to any provocative action by Japan.The decision to send Aiko Shimajiri, a parliamentary secretary with the Cabinet Office, to the event was criticized as a "grave criminal act" by Kim Kwan-yong, governor of North Gyeongsang province, which administers the islands for South Korea. They are called the Takeshima islands in Japan.A group of about 100 people demonstrated in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul and delivered a letter to the embassy asking Japan to be "a true neighbor instead of seeking an aggressive attitude."
