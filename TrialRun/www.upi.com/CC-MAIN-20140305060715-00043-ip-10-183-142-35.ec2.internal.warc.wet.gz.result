WASHINGTON, April 6 (UPI) -- The activist who tried to picket the all-male Augusta National Golf Club during last year's Masters tournament to protest the club's exclusion of women is now targeting companies whose executives belong to the club, and how the women who work for those companies are treated.As the legendary Masters Golf Tournament begins this week at Augusta, Martha Burk and the organization she chairs, the National Council of Women's Organizations, are using the event as a springboard for a corporate campaign examining alleged sex discrimination against women who work in the financial sector."Women in the financial sector paint a very different picture than that we see in the slick annual reports and 'diversity' audits," Burk said.Initially, the "Women on Wall Street" investigation will look at financial firms whose chief executives are members of Augusta, including Kenneth Chenault, chairman and chief executive of American Express; CEO Kenneth Lewis and James Hance, Jr., vice chairman and CFO of Bank of America; Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway; Sanford Weill, chairman of CitiGroup; Charles Johnson, CEO of Franklin Templeton; William Harrison, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase; Phillip Purcel III, chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley; and Arthur Ryan, chairman and CEO of Prudential. Other firms whose executives belong to the club, as well as firms whose executives belong to other exclusionary clubs, will be next in line, Burk told reporters.American Express, Smith Barney (part of CitiGroup), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Prudential, as well as Goldman Sachs, have all been named in sex discrimination lawsuits, NCWO said in a release Tuesday.The campaign "was never about golf," said Jane Smith, chief executive officer of Business and Professional Women/USA and the BPW Foundation, at a press conference launching the initiative. "It has always been about power and keeping women out of the halls of power and business," she said.At the press conference, staff handed out golf balls on which was printed: "Do you need two of these to play on Wall Street?""Everyone knows that high-level business is done in many places away from the office ... when corporate leaders are willing to publicly participate in activities that keep women out, it makes a very public statement about the value of women workers," Smith said.The organization also announced Tuesday that it had enlisted the help of law firm Mehri & Skalet, PLLC. Founding partner Cyrus Mehri won two of the largest race discrimination class action suits in history, one against Texaco in 1997 for $176 million and one against Coca-Cola in 2001 for $192.5 million. He also created a report on the treatment of black coaches in the NFL that scandalized the organization into creating a workplace diversity program."[CEO] Charles B. Johnson's membership at Augusta is a personal one, not a company membership, and has nothing to do with our corporate policies, and Franklin Templeton is absolutely an equal opportunity employer," said Lisa Gallegos, spokesperson for Franklin Templeton.Bank of America did not return calls. Spokespersons for American Express and Augusta National Golf Club declined to comment for this article.Augusta has lost between $7 million and $12 million in Masters Tournament sponsorships for the second year in a row since the members' roster was made public, Burk said at the press conference."Complaints have come disproportionately from women in the financial sector, not incidentally a sector that is heavily represented at Augusta National," Burk said in a letter accompanying "equal opportunity" surveys sent out to the eight financial companies.The equality surveys ask for a gender breakdown of the top 150 employees, stock options distribution, promotion opportunities, pay and policy data and other information to show that women are treated equally at the firms. The questionnaires also ask companies to indicate whether they had reimbursed or deducted expenses from male-only clubs, on the basis that "if your company and its executives treat expenses deriving from participation in male-only clubs such as Augusta National as a business expense, then your position that female executives have the full panoply of opportunities as their male counterparts has no credibility," she wrote. Results will be tallied into a "Diversity Report Card.""Companies with nothing to hide should welcome the opportunity," Burk said at the press conference.The initiative also established a Web site, www.augustadiscriminates.org, to collect information about potential sex discrimination from women at financial firms.Several reports of discriminatory treatment, deemed "Hootieisms" after Augusta Club President Hootie Johnson, were detailed in a letter from Mehri to Burk released Tuesday. One woman from Merrill Lynch reported receiving items including a sex toy and obscene poem from a male broker in her office; the broker, she said, was not disciplined and in fact was later promoted. Another employee said the company steered the best accounts, as well as leads and referrals, away from women at the firm. At CitiGroup, a branch manager reportedly said women made better sales assistants because they were "lapdogs." A female employee at Morgan Stanley said she had dinner with her clients and some male colleagues, and was then sent home in a cab, while her colleagues took her clients to a strip club. And the company allegedly excluded women from networking opportunities including events and trips."If you are a member of this exclusionary, plainly sexist organization, what kind of message are you sending the female customer base and the presumably-majority female employee base? Are we not good enough to associate with you?" one female customer and employee wrote in a letter to Bank of America's chairman.Smith suggested that companies are taking the buying power of women for granted. Women, Smith indicated, make up 48 percent of investors and purchase 83 percent of all products and services. "How can we really take these corporate leaders seriously ... they want our dollars but they don't want us in our private business circles," she said.

BAGHDAD, Jan. 5 (UPI) -- As the "coalition of the willing" slips into history and morphs into U.S. Forces-Iraq, the military prepares for the final phase of the massive logistical operation to withdraw U.S. forces and their war machine, even the scrap, from Iraq.All combat forces are scheduled to be out of Iraq by August, leaving only a residual contingent of 50,000 instructors to train Iraqi forces, advisers and other non-combat personnel on a string of bases.The delay in parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for January but now put back to March because of intense political feuding, introduced some uncertainty concerning the withdrawal schedule.U.S. commanders say the military is flexible and could start the final phase of the troop pullout as late as May if necessary. But the logistics can't wait and so on Dec. 14, top-echelon logistics officers of the U.S. military gathered in Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, Iraq's southern neighbor, to map out their plans in a "rehearsal of concept" drill for moving everything from tanks to telephones out of Iraq by the August deadline.Gen. Ray Odierno, the U.S. commander in Iraq, explained that this operation involves more than just putting troops on transport planes and flying them out."We have six years' worth of stuff that we've gathered here as the U.S. military," he says.Since May more than 76,000 items of equipment and 10,000 vehicles have been shipped out, some of it to other units in the Central Command zone of operations around the Middle East and Afghanistan. Most units are exceeding their objectives of moving out 300,000 containers a month, according to senior officers.By the end of the withdrawal, military logistics teams will have moved an estimated 1.5 million pieces of equipment from some 300 bases around Iraq.As the drawdown continues, logistics experts say the trick is to anticipate what those units still in place will require, such as food and fuel, and for how long. There are still some 100,000 troops in Iraq.Among the accumulated machinery that has to be shipped out, there are some awkward items like the D-9 Caterpillar bulldozer, 48 tons of armor and engine. They have to be carried out on transporters to Kuwait for shipping.The D-9 "will take out anything in its way," said Lt. Douglas Pelletier of the 87th Engineer Support Company. That includes road surfaces.Then there's the mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, a bulging, heavily armored truck designed to protect infantrymen from roadside bombs, one of the main causes of casualties throughout the war that began in March 2003."This thing weighs 58,500 pounds," says Spec. Ronnie Williams, who drives an MRAP. Thousands of these ungainly vehicles will have to be hauled out on trailers called heavy-equipment transports over the desert border to Kuwait, from where they will be loaded onto ships for return to U.S. bases or on to reinforce U.S. forces in Afghanistan where a military surge is under way against the Taliban. At the Camp Arifjan confab, the process was closely examined by the Third Army and 1st Theater Sustainment Command and a host of other concerned service and agency personnel, from the newly constituted U.S. Force-Iraq, Central Command, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Army Materiel Command, Defense Logistics Agency, the Joint Contracting Command for Iraq/Afghanistan and many others. Even the State Department had people there.They held briefings and discussions on how this massive operation can be synchronized between dozens of units and locations. They also examined issues such as weather predictions, threat trends, customs operations, shutting down service stores and withdrawal timetables. "The whole (drawdown effort) is staggering," said Col. Steven Elkins, the rehearsal of concept coordinator and 1st TSC support operations officer. "We have a lot of capability because we've been doing this for a number of years now. But it's like reversing a faucet."

COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- A new sea snake species has been identified -- not in ocean waters but in a formalin-filled jar in a Copenhagen, Denmark, museum, researchers say.Researchers from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts examined formalin-filled jars of snakes and found two sea snakes with the same name on the label, which had been there since being collected in the 1800s."But they looked different and didn't seem to belong to the same group of snakes," researcher John Elmberg from Kristianstad University in Sweden said. "That was where the detective work began. After comparing the sea snakes with other similar species in other museums in Europe it was even more obvious that we had found a new distinct sea snake."The newly discovered mosaic sea snake, named after its unusually patterned skin, lives in one of the world's most endangered environments -- the tropical coral reefs around Northern Australia and Southern New Guinea.The snake never goes ashore and now that it has been identified it is apparent it is relatively common in the seas of the region, a Kristianstad release said."Museums are probably full of undiscovered species, and are an invaluable archive worthy of protection, just like the jungle itself," Elmberg said.

FUKUOKA, Japan, March 5 (UPI) -- Ray Chang singled in two runs in a five-run eighth inning Tuesday that gave China a 5-2 win over Brazil in the World Baseball Classic.Chang's single came after Weigiang Meng opened the eighth with a single and Brazilian pitchers walked three consecutive batters. The third walk forced in a run just before Chang singled to left for a 3-2 Chinese lead.A hit batter and two more run-scoring walks completed the rally.The Pool A win guaranteed China (1-2) a spot in the 2017 WBC while Brazil (0-3) will have to qualify for the next tournament.Earlier round-robin results allowed Cuba and Japan, both 2-0 in Pool A, to advance to this year's WBC second round. China and Japan play Wednesday for the group title.Jiangang Lu (1-0) pitched the final 2 2/3 innings for China in picking up the win while Brazil's Murilo Gouvea, who allowed one hit, walked three and struck out three in 3 1/3 innings, took the loss.Brazil's Daniel Matsumoto, who had been hit by a pitch, scored the game's first run on a J.C. Muniz single in the second inning. Three consecutive singles loaded the bases for Brazil in the seventh before Tiago Magalhaes scored on a fielders' choice, putting Brazil ahead 2-0.

STAMFORD, Conn., March 25 (UPI) -- As Charla Nash, the Stamford, Conn., woman who was brutally attacked by a chimpanzee in 2009 contends with the state, she says she's lucky to be alive.Nash has a $50 million lawsuit pending against the estate of her deceased friend Sandra Herold, the owner of the 14-year-old chimp, Travis. Herold passed away in May 2010 while Nash was still recovering."I wish I could have talked to her, but I needed to get healthier and stronger, and then she had passed away," Nash told The Hartford Courant.Nash's lawyers have also filed a request to pursue a $150 million lawsuit against the state on the grounds that authorities failed to protect the public from a dangerous animal. If the state denies the request, it has "sovereign immunity" against lawsuits.Nash's lawyers point to state laws prohibiting the ownership of pets of Travis' size, saying state officials had received a number of complaints about the chimp. A state official even called Travis "an accident waiting to happen." The chimp had gotten loose and roamed the city in 2003.The attack, which took place in Herold's home Feb. 16, 2009, blinded Nash. The 200-pound primate tore off her hands and face and left her within inches of her life. She received a face transplant from an anonymous donor and is scheduled for a second attempt at a hand transplant. "I'm very happy that I'm here. I find it remarkable and absolutely amazing that I could be sitting here talking to people," Nash said. "I thank God that I've had the opportunity."Robbed of her vision, Nash has been fitted with glass eyes. She is still undergoing rigorous rehabilitation and appears gaunt.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (UPI) -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif., said Sunday she thought China would've used the opportunity to arrest ex-CIA employee Edward Snowden to improve U.S. relations.Snowden, who leaked details of sophisticated NSA electronic monitoring programs, left Hong Kong Sunday and traveled to Moscow before paperwork required to have him detained was completed. U.S. officials said Sunday Hong Kong could have taken the whistle-blower into custody because the hold-up on paperwork was based on minor issues.Feinstein, in an appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation," said she thought it was a "very big surprise" that China didn't arrest Snowden when it had the chance."I had actually thought that China would see this as an opportunity to improve relations, and extradite him to the United States," she said. "China clearly had a role in this, in my view. I don't think this was just Hong Kong without Chinese acquiescence."Feinstein, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the committee is more concerned about enabling "people to see the process that's followed" in surveillance."I think from the point of view of our committee, something that concerns me more is that we get an understanding in this nation that what this is all about is the nation's security," she said.

KATHMANDU, Tibet, March 10 (UPI) -- Police in Nepal said they filled the streets of Katmandu Sunday to prevent violence and self-immolations protesting Chinese rule in neighboring Tibet.The demonstration in Katmandu was one of several that took place around Asia this weekend to call for China's departure from the mountain state and to mark "Uprising Day," the 54th anniversary of the failed 1959 revolt against the Beijing government.Security in the capital was tight, Nepalnews.com said. Roads were closed around Chinese government missions and at least a dozen Tibetan activists were briefly detained for questioning.Voice of America said police in Dharmsala, India, stepped in to stop a man from setting himself on fire in front of hundreds of Tibetans. Dharmsala is the base of the Tibetan government-in-exile.Self-immolation is not an uncommon gesture in the long-running friction between Tibetans and China. More than 100 Tibetans have set themselves alight since 2009, Voice of America said.
