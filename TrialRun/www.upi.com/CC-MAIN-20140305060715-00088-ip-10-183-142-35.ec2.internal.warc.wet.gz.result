OSHKOSH, Wis., Jan. 29 (UPI) -- Prototype aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles have been delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps for testing by Oshkosh Defense, the company said Thursday.The vehicles are its P-19R on-road/off-road trucks, which were chosen by the Marines last year to replace Oshkosh firefighting vehicles currently in use."We delivered three P-19R prototypes in December and will support them as they undergo rigorous government testing through this summer," said John Bryant, senior vice president of defense programs for Oshkosh Defense."The Oshkosh P-19R will replace the fleet of Oshkosh P-19A ARFF vehicles, which were first fielded with the Marine Corps in 1984 and are reaching the end of their service lives. With this vehicle, we've rolled into one platform our decades of experience producing military and ARFF vehicles to give Marines more advanced firefighting capabilities."The new P-19R aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicle features independent suspension for off-road use and advanced Stryker firefighting systems. Oshkosh gave no details as to the length of the testing program.

LONDON, July 5 (UPI) -- Frequently consuming foods containing soy may contribute to memory loss, British experts say.Experts at England's Loughborough and Oxford Universities researched the impact of soy consumption in 719 senior citizens on the Indonesian island of Java, the Daily Mail reported Saturday.Researchers determined people who ate soy at least twice a day had 20 percent less memory function that those who ate it significantly less."Soy consumption is on the increase in the West and is often promoted as a 'superfood.' Soy products are rich in micronutrients called phytoestrogens, but it is not entirely clear what their effect on the aging brain is," said Professor Eef Hogervorst of Loughborough University.Hogervorst said vegetarians and elderly women seemed to be highly susceptible to potential memory loss from soy consumption.

EPPING, N.H., Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Officials in a New Hampshire town said a meeting of selectmen was interrupted for about two minutes by a bat.The Epping selectmen said the bat showed up about 46 minutes into the town hall meeting and remained in the room for about two minutes until it was successfully chased from the building, WMUR-TV, Manchester, reported Thursday."There was a bit of a frenzy. I called for a recess, but they chose to keep filming, and the bat was chased out the door, eventually," Board Chairman Karen Falcone said.Officials said the bat interrupted a discussion about placing a no-right-turn sign on Depot Road.

PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 23 (UPI) -- More than three-quarters of U.S. residents identify themselves as Christians, a Gallup poll released Friday said. More than half of those surveyed, 52.5 percent, said they are Protestants, 23.6 percent Catholic and 1.9 percent Mormon. The 78 percent who describe themselves as Christians has dropped only slightly since 1951, when 82 percent told Gallup they were Christian.Fifteen percent say they are atheist, agnostic or do not identify with one religious faith, a group that has increased from near zero in 1951. But 92 percent said in a separate survey that they believe in God.Only 1.6 percent said they are Jewish, 0.5 percent Muslim and 2.4 percent members of another non-Christian religion.More than 80 percent said religion is an important part of their lives.The data come from the Gallup Daily tracking survey Jan. 2-Nov. 30, which had a sample of 327,244 adults. The margin of error is 1 percentage point.

ISTANBUL, Turkey, April 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Embassy in Ankara was targeted to be bombed by an alleged Turkish al-Qaida cell whose members were trained in Afghanistan, Turkish police said.Police seized nearly 50 pounds of plastic explosives with detonation systems attached, along with 10 rifles and guns, six laptop computers and other evidence, police said.Twelve people -- two Chechens, two Azerbaijanis and eight Turks -- were arrested in two raids, police said.The raids -- which occurred in February but were only now reported -- occurred in the northwestern city of Tekirdag and Istanbul, police said.All 12 people were believed to be members of al-Qaida terrorist cells, the Dogan News Agency said.The U.S. Embassy issued a travel warning at the time but said police had provided no specific threat information about the targets.It had no immediate comment Friday.The U.S. Embassy was the target of a suicide bomb attack in February that killed a Turkish security guard and severely injured a local resident. But that attack was attributed to an extreme left-wing organization, not Islamic militants.The arrested alleged attackers also planned to bomb an Istanbul synagogue and the private Rahmi M. Koc Museum, police said. They additionally intended to attack Turkish TV personality-actor Acun Ilicali and author Adnan Oktar, also known as Harun Yahya, an Islamic creationist who speaks against evolution, the news agency said.

July 12 (UPI) -- Investigators on the scene of a partially-collapsed building in New York's Chinatown found a slew of safety violations that may have contributed to the explosion that damaged the structure and injured 13 people Thursday.City Department of Buildings officials inspected the structure after firefighters battled an hour to put out the blaze sparked by the noontime explosion, and issued a full-vacate order based on their findings.DOB investigators said they found 16 instances of illegally converted apartments, gas pipes and gates on apartments. Some of the secondary exits from the second to fifth floors were blocked, and the building lacked proper smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Officials also found exposed electrical wiring and paint violations in their inspection.Building owner Mary Shiu was issued two Environmental Control Board summonses for violations found Thursday.Shiu was also cited four years ago for two violations and issued a full-vacate order for failure to maintain the property.Inspectors in 2009 found a separation between the floor and the wall on the ground level of the building that "posed a danger of collapse," DOB records show. Shiu was also cited for a lack of fire-stopping material.The vacate order rescinded in March 2009 after Shiu paid a $2,000 fee and both violations were resolved. There were no other open violations at the time of the explosion.Eight civilians and five firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and burns Thursday, and two were in serious condition at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.Officials had not officially determined the cause of the explosion or collapse, but said the building was structurally sound. Initial theories suggested improperly used "bug bombs" may have exploded and blown out a wall, but authorities were not ruling out a gas leak.
