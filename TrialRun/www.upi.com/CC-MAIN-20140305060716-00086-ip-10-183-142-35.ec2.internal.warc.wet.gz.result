WASHINGTON, July 8 (UPI) -- U.S. rail deliveries of petroleum and petroleum products increased by more than 20 percent during the last week in June, the Association of American Railroads said.The AAR said total U.S. weekly rail traffic for major commodity groups was up 1 percent to 281,367 carloads for the last full week of June year-on-year. For the first 26 weeks of 2013, however, the rail deliveries were down 1.5 percent compared to the same time last year.Half of the commodity groups monitored by AAR reported increased rail traffic for the last week in June when compared to the same time last year. Petroleum and petroleum products led the way with a 26.6 percent increase year-on-year, the trade group reported last week.Rail deliveries of crude oil in the United States are increasing because production gains are straining existing pipeline capacity. A U.S. State Department review of the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada said rail must be considered against the pipeline when weighing its national interest.AAR said Canadian rail traffic had decreased for June. The Canadian National Railway Co. said Wednesday it would start servicing oil production in Alberta with a new terminal starting in November.At least five people died when oil freight carried by Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway exploded Saturday in Quebec.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- The Weinstein Co. says it has canceled its Los Angeles premiere of Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked period picture "Django Unchained." The studio said the decision was made out of respect for the victims of last Friday's school shooting in Newtown, Conn., which left 20 children, six adults and the shooter dead."Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event," a spokesperson for The Weinstein Co. told USA Today Monday. "However, we will be holding a private screening for the cast and crew and their friends and families."Set in the American South in the 19th century, the film stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Don Johnson, Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio. The Los Angeles premiere was to take place Tuesday.It is to open in theaters nationwide Dec. 25.Tarantino's other movies include "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction," "Kill Bill" and "Inglourious Basterds."

| License Photo	July 9 (UPI) -- Some may consider the British royal family a relic of the past, but at least one member of the Windsor clan has joined the 21st century.Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, joined Twitter Monday, becoming the first member of the royal family to get on the social network.By the end of the day Tuesday, less than 36 hours from the birth of the account, Prince Charles's younger brother had almost 24,000 followers."Welcome to my Twitter account -AY" he wrote, from the handle @TheDukeOfYork.Welcome to my Twitter account - AY— The Duke of York (@TheDukeOfYork) July 8, 2013
So far, the inaugural tweet is the only one the prince has sent: The next 10 tweets appeared to be composed by staff, as they were without the -AY signature indicating Prince Andrew himself had written them.

ARCADIA, Calif., Nov. 2 (UPI) -- New Year's Day found running room on the rail in deep stretch, shot through and won Saturday's $2 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile.The favorite, previously undefeated Havana, had a clear lead at the top of the lane and held on for second, 1 1/4 lengths behind the winner. Strong Mandate finished third, another 3/4 of a length in arrears.New Year's Day, trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Martin Garcia, got the 1 1/16 miles on the fast Santa Anita main track in 1:43.52. It was his second win, following a maiden victory at Del Mar in August. The Street Cry colt, owned by Gary and Mary West, went to the post at 10-1 odds.Havana was favored after winning at first asking at Saratoga, then taking the Grade I Champagne at Belmont Park last month. Havana, a gray son of Dunkirk, is owned by the principals of the Irish-based Coolmore."This is pretty special," Gary West said. "Now I've got something to look forward to in the 3-year-old races" next year.

| License Photo	TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- Amid continuing concern that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is inclined to order military action against Iran's nuclear program, a key Defense Ministry chief says, "Iran is our central threat."The comments by Amos Gilad, director of policy and political-security affairs at the ministry, followed a report by the Hebrew-language newspaper Yediot Ahoronot that Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak were pushing for pre-emptive strikes against Iran.The report by veteran commentator Nahum Barnea underlined a critical rift within the defense establishment and the top political echelon over how to counter what many, Netanyahu in particular, see as an existential threat to the Jewish state.But many in the defense establishment oppose any overt military action against Iran because they accept that it could unleash a regional war on an unprecedented scale using weapons that have never before been used in Middle Eastern combat.Saudi Arabia and the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf would be endangered and Iran would threaten much of the world's oil supplies. The United States also opposes a unilateral Israeli campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities, fearing it could get dragged into a conflict not of its choosing, and has repeatedly told the Israelis so. That was a message forcefully reiterated by U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta when he visited Israel in early October and held talks with Barak.Gilad, who has great influence within the Israeli military establishment, stressed that countering the Iranian threat must be Israel's top defense priority.Netanyahu, he said, "was the first who heard of Iran's forecasted move on the nuclear missile path and he sees it as a massive threat. The defense minister understands the depth of the threat as well."The debate within the upper echelons of government over the Iranian threat was largely behind closed doors until earlier this year when the outgoing head of the Mossad intelligence service, former general Meir Dagan, went public by denouncing Netanyahu and Barak.He was backed by other senior defense and security officials, many of whom had apparently been squeezed out of command positions over the last 18 months by Netanyahu and Barak.According to Barnea, the current chief of the general staff, Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz, Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, Military Intelligence director Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi and General Security Service head Yoram Cohen all oppose action against Iran at this time.Gilad maintained that less than a decade ago Iran did not possess missiles capable of reaching Israel; now it has hundreds of ballistic missiles with the range to hit the Jewish state with 10 minutes of launch."At the moment, there is no immediate nuclear threat, but there is definitely a great deal of motivation and determination for it," he said."Today, the status is that they're at the starting point -- they have (enriched) uranium, the knowledge is there."He declared that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "says that Israel has no place. Iran believes that it needs to be an empire equal in strength to the United States."That's the motivation driving the development of Iran's missile capabilities." The Israelis believe the Iranians seek to stockpile sufficient quantities of weapons-grade enriched uranium to make several warheads quickly in a "breakout" operation with which to attack the Jewish state before anyone's aware of what they're doing.Commentators in Yediot Ahronot, the liberal Haaretz and other dailies have in recent days openly speculated that the hawkish Netanyahu, having won nationwide acclaim for securing the Oct. 18 release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas since July 2006, now felt he had the country behind in taking on Iran.Netanyahu, said Jerusalem Post military writer Yaacov Katz, feels that "Israel can now move forward to deal with some of the other strategic problems it faces in the region, such as Iran's nuclear program."But the problem, many military strategists say, is that Israel doesn't have sufficient military force to deliver a knockout blow against Iran on its own.Brig. Gen. Relik Shafir, who took part in the Israeli air strike that destroyed Iraq's Tammuz nuclear reactor June 7, 1981, is one: "The Israeli air force doesn't have the real strategic capability to bomb distant targets for a prolonged period of time with the required intensity and firepower."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis is leaving the Obama administration, the White House said Wednesday.In a letter she sent to department employees, Solis said she decided to resign and "begin a new future" after mulling it over during the holidays and discussing it with family and friends. The 55-year-old former California congresswoman said she decided to "return to the people and places I love and that have inspired and shaped my life.""This afternoon, I submitted my resignation to President Obama," she said. "Growing up in a large Mexican-American family in La Puente, Calif., I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to serve in a president's Cabinet, let alone in the service of such an incredible leader. "Because President Obama took very bold action, millions of Americans are back to work. There is still much to do, but we are well on the road to recovery, and middle class Americans know the president is on their side," she said."Leaving the department is one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made, because I have taken our mission to heart," she said. "As the daughter of parents who worked in factories, paid their union dues and achieved their goal of a middle class life, and as the first Latina to head a major federal agency, it has been an incredible honor to serve."In a statement released by his press secretary's office, President Obama called Solis "a tireless champion for working families.""Over the last four years, Secretary Solis has been a critical member of my economic team as we have worked to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and strengthen the economy for the middle class," Obama said. "Her efforts have helped train workers for the jobs of the future, protect workers' health and safety and put millions of Americans back to work."I am grateful to Secretary Solis for her steadfast commitment and service not only to the administration, but on behalf of the American people. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors."Neither she nor the president made mention of what Solis' future plans may include.She is one of several high-level officials, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, leaving the administration as Obama begins his second term.In her lengthy letter, Solis outlined the "extraordinary things" the department achieved under her direction and said she is "humbled by the commitment of every single employee of this department -- from the folks here in Washington to those who directly touch communities out in the field.""We have much to be proud of," she said.

VATICAN CITY, March 7 (UPI) -- Hackers attacked the Web site for the Catholic Church Wednesday, Vatican officials said.The official Web site of the Holy See was not operational Wednesday afternoon and a spokesman confirmed it had been hacked, CNN reported.Anonymous, a loose confederation of computer hackers, claimed responsibility."Anonymous has now decided to lay siege to your site in response to the doctrines, liturgies and the precepts, absurd and anachronistic, that your organization, (which) is for profit, propagates and spreads worldwide," CNN said a statement in Italian on the blog "ufficiale di Anonymous Italia" read."This is NOT intended to attack the Christian religion or against the faithful around the world, but to the corrupt Roman Apostolic Church and all its emanations," the statement said.Hackers also took down the home page of Panda Security's Web site, the Spanish-based software security company said.Eweek.com said the Panda Security attack appears to be in retaliation for the arrests of several alleged members of the hacker group LulzSec.The company's Web site was taken down Wednesday but Panda Security, in a post on its Facebook page, said the attack did not breach the company's internal network "and neither source code, update servers nor customer data was accessed."The company said the only information accessed was related to marketing campaigns and some obsolete credentials."We continue investigating the cause of the intrusion and will provide more details as soon as they become available. Meanwhile we assure all our customers and partners that none of their information has been compromised and that our products and services continue functioning as normal."Eweek.com said Anonymous apparently used the site as an opportunity to take aim at Hector Xavier Monsegur, alleged leader of the LulzSec group, whose cooperation with authorities helped lead to Tuesday's arrests of five computer hackers in the United States, Scotland, England and Ireland for computer hacking and other crimes.Monsegur had used the online name "Sabu" in his work with LulzSec."Yeah yeah, we know, Sabu snitched on us," a message on the hacked PandaLabs page allegedly said. "As usually happens, FBI menaced him to take his sons away. We understand, but we were your family, too."The hackers also promised to continue their activities and challenged the FBI and other authorities to try to find them."To FBI and others ... come at us bros we are waiting for you," the message read, eweek.com said.The five hackers charged Tuesday identified themselves as aligned with the group Anonymous or offshoot groups including LulzSec, the Justice Department said.Monsegur was secretly arrested last year and pleaded guilty on Aug. 15, 2011, in federal court to computer-hacking conspiracies and other crimes, prosecutors said.Prosecutors allege Monsegur and other members of Anonymous are responsible for a number of cyberattacks between December 2010 and June 2011, including denial-of-service attacks against the Web sites of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, as retaliation for the refusal of these companies to process donations to WikiLeaks, as well as hacks or denial-of-service attacks on foreign government computer systems.

| License Photo	Jan. 9 (UPI) -- Rumors have resurfaced that Apple is working on a cheaper iPhone, and the time may be ripe for the normally premium-only tech company to take the discount device plunge.According to sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is moving forward with the development of a less expensive version of the iPhone that would launch later in 2013 in emerging markets such as China.The downmarket device would have a similar design as its higher-priced cousin, but instead of an aluminum body, the phone casing would be made of a cheaper polycarbonate plastic. The internal hardware, including the graphics chip and processor, could be made from either new parts originally designed for older models, or recycled parts from older iPhones.Of course, the rumors are just that--the Cupertino-based company refused to comment on the possibility of a cheaper device, and similar rumors have happened before many times. In fall of 2011, tech watchers were disappointed when an expected a low-price version of the iPhone 4, built in Brazil and aimed at China and similar markets, failed to materialize.Apple has historically refused to downgrade the quality of its products in favor of lower prices. In 2008, Steve Jobs famously wrote off whole swaths of potential customers as out of reach for his company."What we want to do is deliver an increasing level of value to these customers, but there are some customers which we choose not to serve," Jobs said. "We don't know how to make a $500 computer that's not a piece of junk; our DNA will not let us do that. We've seen great success by focusing on certain segments of the market and not trying to be everything to everybody, and you can expect us to stick with that winning strategy."But the iPad Mini may be an indication that CEO Tim Cook's philosophy may be more pragmatic than his visionary-to-a-fault predecessor, especially as demand for lower-priced older iPhone models remains extremely high.

Wiki
Reba Nell McEntire (born March 28, 1955) is an American country music artist and actress. She began her career in the music industry singing with her siblings on local radio shows and at rodeos. As a solo act, she was invited to perform at a rodeo in Oklahoma City, which caught the attention of country artist Red Steagall. He brought her to Nashville, Tennessee, where she eventually signed a contract with Mercury Records in 1975. She released her first solo album in 1977 and released five additional studio albums under the label until 1983.
Signing with MCA Nashville Records, McEntire took creative control over her second MCA album, My Kind of Country (1984), which had a more traditional country sound and produced two number one singles: "How Blue" and "Somebody Should Leave". The album brought her breakthrough success, bringing her a series of successful albums and number one singles in the 1980s and 1990s. McEntire has since released 26 studio albums, acquired 35 #1 singles, and 28 albums have been certified Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America.
In the early 1990s, McEntire branched into film starting with 1990's Tremors. She has since starred in the Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun and starred in her television sitcom, Reba (2001–2007) for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series–Musical or Comedy. She has sometimes been referred to as "The Queen of Country", having sold 41 million records in the United States and more than 56 million worldwide. In the United States, she ranks as both the seventh best-selling female artist in all genres and the seventh best-selling country artist, and the second best-selling female country artist of all time, behind Shania Twain.
