PARIS, Oct. 8 (UPI) -- French energy company Total announced Monday start-up at the Atlas natural gas condensate field in the Norwegian waters of the North Sea.Exploratory drilling in the field was completed in 2010. The French energy company said it expected to produce, on average, 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent and 2,500 barrels of condensates per day starting next year."The fast track development was completed within budget and schedule and will have a very quick return," Patrice de Vivies, senior vice president for exploration and development, said in a statement. "It is a good example of Total's expertise in maximizing value of mature assets by combining exploration and development forces."Norway in September said it received applications from 47 companies for a bidding round for reserves on its continental shelf. That followed July labor strikes that cut into the production potential in the country. The International Energy Agency said July oil production from Norway was as its lowest level since 1991 because of strikes.Norway is the largest oil producer in Europe and the second-largest exporter of natural gas after Russia. Total said Norway was the largest contributor to its equity production last year with 287,000 boe per day.

June 25 (UPI) -- A new study on the underdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in minority children shows that between Kindergarten and eighth grade, black and Hispanic children are half as likely as their white peers to be diagnosed with ADHD.Among those diagnosed with ADHD, children who are ethnic or racial minorities are less likely to use prescription medication for the disorder, even when researchers account for factors including health insurance coverage, socio-economic status and academic achievement."There's no reason to think that minority children are less likely to have ADHD than white children, so these are worrisome findings that suggest a systemic problem," said Paul Morgan, lead author of the study published in the journal Pediatrics.Using the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Morgan and colleagues analyzed data collected by the federal government on 17,100 children in the Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999, based on parent reports.By the spring of middle school, about 7 percent of white children had received an ADHD diagnosis, while 4.4 percent of Hispanic children, 3 percent of black children, and 3.5 percent of children of other minority groups were diagnosed.Compared with whites, the odds of an ADHD diagnosis was 69 percent lower for black children, 50 percent lower for Hispanic children and 46 percent lower for children of other minorities.Among children diagnosed, children of all racial and ethnic minorities were less likely to be prescribed medications including Vyvanse, Ritalin and Concerta compared with white children. Prescription medication was used 47 percent less by Hispanic children, 65 percent less by black children and 51 percent less by children of other minorities.Despite noted skepticism among some minority communities about ADHD diagnosis and their beliefs about its treatment, the authors say the lack of treatment is due to underdiagnosis in the first place."Other research has already identified a range of different effective treatments for ADHD, including medication, behavioral therapy, specialized educational programming and parent training," says Morgan, an associate professor of education at Penn State University. "These findings suggest that children who are racial and ethnic minorities are not accessing those treatments because they are comparatively underdiagnosed."ADHD is the most common mental health condition among kids and teens, and despite their findings, the authors note that further study is needed to determine overdiagnosis among other groups -- possibly boys.Boys in this study were twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD -- regardless of race or ethnicity. Boys who engaged in fighting, bullying and similar problem behaviors had increased odds of diagnosis.

EDINBURGH, Scotland, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- The Scottish government has been spending more each year on potted plants and cut flowers, an opposition party complained Thursday. The Scottish Liberal Democrats said the total bill has been 130,000 pounds ($214,000) for the past three years. But the annual figure has been rising to 56,378 pounds ($92,700) in the past fiscal year. Alison McInness, the Liberal Democrat business manager, said the government spent a hefty 26,000 pounds ($43,000) in three years just in flowers and plants for ministers' offices. "At a time when people still have to tighten their purse-strings, many will be surprised that the Scottish Government is spending this kind of money cultivating plants when it would be better spent cultivating jobs and growth," she said."Scottish ministers should prune this growing spend."The governing Scottish National Party said a new contract for government facilities has increased the cost of plants across the board. A spokesman also fired a couple of volleys at the Liberal Democrats. "Perhaps the Liberal Democrats should be more concerned with the fact they support an unelected House of Lords mired in an expenses scandal," he said, referring to the debate about replacing the British upper house with an elected body. "Of course, with independence we will save the taxpayer around 50 million pounds ($82 million) a year on the current costs of running Westminster."

TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 21 (UPI) -- Tampa Bay wide receiver Sammie Stroughter was placed on injured reserve because of a foot injury, the Buccaneers said Friday.Stroughter had one reception for 14 yards and returned three punts in Tampa Bay's first two games this season.In 33 games over his four-year NFL career, Stroughter has 60 catches for 639 yards and one touchdown. He's averaged 8.4 yards over 16 punt returns and 27.7 yards on 34 kickoff returns.Friday's roster move marked the third time Stroughter will miss playing time due to a foot injury. He missed the last three games of his rookie season in 2009 and appeared in just six games last year because of foot problems.Tampa Bay signed wide receiver Chris Owusu, who had been on the practice squad of the San Diego Chargers. An undrafted rookie, Owusu had been among the final cuts made by the San Francisco 49ers this season.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Feb. 20 (UPI) -- Matt Kenseth and Denny Hamlin each claimed a Budweiser Duel victory Thursday at Daytona International Speedway, earning top positions for the Daytona 500.In Budweiser Duel I, Kenseth edged out Kevin Harvick by 0.022 seconds with Kasey Kahne just 0.063 seconds behind in a photo finish.Kenseth, who won the Duel and the Daytona 500 in 2012, led 31 of 60 laps. Harvick had the lead on the last turn on the final lap, but Kenseth overtook him down the stretch. Harvick garnered fifth position in Sunday's Daytona 500.Kahne will start in the seventh spot.Marcos Ambrose claimed fourth place, followed by Dale Earnhardt Jr.In the night's second race, Hamlin took the win after a wild last-lap crash, in which Clint Bowyer rolled over David Ragan's car and did a mid-air flip before landing upright.The crash began when Jimmie Johnson ran out of gas down the stretch and slammed into the wall after being was bumped from behind by Jamie McMurray. Johnson collided with McMurray again before his No. 48 car caught fire on the infield grass.There were no injuries in the mishap.Martin Truex Jr., who had already secured the second starting spot for the Daytona 500 in last week's time trials, was also involved. As a result, he will start the race in the back of the field, while Kenseth and Hamlin will move up to the second and third starting positions.

UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (UPI) -- There's a "fresh chance" to resolve underlying issues behind a cycle of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a U.N. envoy said.Former Irish President Mary Robinson, acting as a U.N. envoy for the Great Lakes region in Africa, told the U.N. Security Council there was a chance for renewed opportunity in DRC."There is a fresh chance to do more than just attend to the consequences of conflict," she said. "There is a chance to resolve its underlying causes and to stop it for good."A framework adopted by African leaders and the international community is meant to find regional solutions to DRC challenges. Robinson said she welcomed regional commitments to resume stalled negotiations between DRC authorities and rebel forces from the March 23 Movement. M23 rebels seized control over parts of DRC last year.The Security Council in March authorized a special brigade within the peacekeeping mission in DRC that's authorized to carry out operations against militant groups that threaten national security. Robinson said most people in the country supported though brigade, though some rights groups said they were concerned it would add to the crisis.An 88-page report published Tuesday by Save the Children said that DRC war and poverty meant the country was the most difficult place for a mother to raise a child.

LIMA, Oct. 6 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Afghan President Hamid Karzai should thank allied forces "for the sacrifices" they make instead of criticizing them.Panetta's comments Friday came after Karzai said the United States is not doing enough to fight terror in neighboring Pakistan, CNN reported.Karzai accused the United States and NATO Thursday of attacking insurgents in Afghanistan instead of targeting their supporters Pakistan."The U.S. and NATO should go to the places where the roots of terrorism exist. They are saying one thing but acting contrary to that," Karzai said at a news conference in Kabul.Tensions between the United States and Afghanistan have escalated in recent months due to a series of fatal attacks on U.S. troops by their Afghan counterparts, as well as the accidental killing of civilians."Look, we have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan's sovereignty," Panetta told reporters shortly after landing in Lima, Peru, Friday for a meeting with Latin American defense officials."Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy, and I think it would be helpful if the president, every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticizing them," Panetta said.

| License Photo	Feb. 19 (UPI) -- NASA lost communication with the International Space Station on Tuesday morning and has established only sporadic connections since, according to NASA spokesman Josh Byerly.At approximately 9:45 a.m. EST, flight controllers in Houston were updating the software onboard the International Space Station's flight computers when one of the station's data relay systems malfunctioned. The station then lost regular communication with the ground.The primary computer that controls critical station functions defaulted to a backup computer, but was not allowing the station to communicate with NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. Mission Control Houston was able to communicate with the crew as the space station flew over Russian ground stations before 11:00 a.m. EST, and instructed the crew to connect a backup computer to begin restoring communications. Expedition 34 Commander Kevin Ford reported that the station's status was fine and that the crew was doing well.The #ISS is currently experiencing a comm loss with the ground. Crew and station are fine. More details at nasa.gov/mission_pages/…— NASA Astronauts (@NASA_Astronauts) February 19, 2013
