ZURICH, Switzerland, March 4 (UPI) -- Swiss voters overwhelmingly imposed one of the world's most severe checks on executive pay, with jail terms for board members who violate the new rules.Some 68 percent of voters backed the plan, one of the highest approval rates ever for a popular referendum in Switzerland, the government said Monday.The plan, fiercely opposed by the country's business community, gives shareholders of companies listed on Switzerland's two stock exchanges a binding say on the overall pay packages for executives and directors.The 24-item Minder Initiative -- named for the independent Swiss member of Parliament behind the measure but dubbed the "rip-off" and "fat cat" initiative by the country's media -- also makes pension funds owning shares of companies obligated to vote on compensation packages and bars companies from giving bonuses to executives joining or leaving a business, or to executives when their company is taken over.Violations could result in fines equal to up to six years of salary and a prison sentence of up to three years."I am very proud of the Swiss people who have sent a very strong signal to the establishment," Thomas Minder, who is also an entrepreneur, told Radio Television Suisse.He called on lawmakers to swiftly enact the law.Proponents said the plan could go into effect next year, but opponents said parliamentary procedures and legal issues could delay its implementation until 2015 or even later, The Wall Street Journal reported.The Swiss government and the parliamentary upper house, the Council of States, joined business lobbies in opposing the initiative, warning it could spark a big-business exodus.Minder rejected this, telling Swiss daily Le Temps the level of alarm over executive pay and bonuses in other countries meant his initiative could become Switzerland's "best export product."Switzerland has a direct democracy, also known as pure democracy, which lets people vote on policy initiatives directly. In a representative democracy such as in the United States, people generally vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives.The U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has given shareholders a non-binding say-on-pay vote since in 2011.Non-binding shareholder votes on executive pay also have been introduced in other European countries, in part as a response to Occupy Wall Street and other movements that have attacked the corporate excesses and abuses that fueled the world financial crisis, The New York Times said.The European Parliament Thursday agreed to limit bonuses of bankers to equal their regular salaries without shareholder approval and to twice their salaries with shareholder approval.The EU move helped persuade Swiss voters to support the referendum, Minder Initiative Secretary Claudio Kuster told the Journal.

SAN RAMON, Calif., Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Signing agreements for work in deep-water areas off Morocco gives Chevron the opportunity to expand into frontier basins, a company chairman said.Chevron Corp., which has headquarters in California, said its Moroccan subsidiary signed agreements with the government there for work in three offshore areas."We look forward to participating in exploration activities in Morocco, which provides Chevron an opportunity to advance our growth strategy in frontier basins," Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in a statement.Morocco has seen growing interest from international oil and natural gas companies. U.S. company Plains Exploration and Production, Gulfsands Petroleum, based in London, and Turkish company Genel Energy have all made similar moves on the emerging Moroccan market.The CIA World Factbook estimates that, as of January 2012, Morocco had proven oil reserves of around 680,000 barrels, 99th in the world. Natural gas estimates from 2012 were at 49 billion cubic feet, 98th in the world.

CALGARY, Alberta, July 17 (UPI) -- Canadian oil company Suncor Energy said its operations returned to full production, less than a month after Alberta flooding forced a precautionary shutdown.Suncor said oil production in Canada was reduced by 3 million barrels because of setbacks resulting from a 100-year flood in Alberta.Provincial authorities declared a state of emergency in June because of heavy flooding. Suncor was forced to close part of its regional pipeline system because of a release from an associated pipeline operated by Enbridge in northeast Alberta.Enbridge said heavy flooding may have disrupted parts of a regional pipeline system, resulting in a small oil spill. "Suncor Energy reports it has returned to full production at its oil sands operations," the company said in a statement Wednesday. "Since the restart of the Enbridge regional oil sands pipeline system earlier this month, Suncor has been ramping up its oil sands production as pipeline and storage capacity would allow."Pipeline operations were closed June 24. The energy company said its oil production for the year should be within the expected range despite the shutdown.

"I'm going to be a really good patient, and I'm going to do everything that I need to do. I've booked my surgery. ... I'm good. I'm ready to deal with it, and I'm going to be fine. I feel really, really strong. Doctors say this is a 'good' kind of cancer to have. ...

LARAMIE, Wyo., June 13 (UPI) -- A planet could be tucked away in a gap in the disk surrounding a star 176 light-years from Earth, a University of Wyoming professor said.While the origin of the gap is unclear, Hannah Jang-Condell, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy, said the research team's calculations indicate "that the gap may be harboring a planet of six-to-28 times the mass of the Earth," the university said in a release."That's a small planet," Jang-Condell said. It's not a 'gas giant.'"Jang-Condell is a co-author of the paper, "The 0.5-2.22um Scattered Light Spectrum of the Disk Around TW Hydrae: Detection of a Partially Filled Disk Gap at 80 AU," published in The Astrophysical Journal.Because the possible planet is approximately 7.5 billion miles from the TW Hydrae star and its heat source, she said, the mass probably has a temperature similar to Neptune's -- about minus 360 degrees Fahrenheit.The disk lacks large dust grains in its outer regions, said John Debes, an astronomer from the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the study."Typically, you need pebbles before you can form a planet," Debes said. "So, if there is a planet there and there is not even millimeter-sized dust ... farther out, the observation is inconsistent with traditional planet formation models."An alternative planet-formation theory suggests a portion of the disk becomes unstable and collapses, causing a planet to form in just a few thousand years, he said."If we can actually confirm that there's a planet there, we can connect its characteristics to measurements of the gap properties," Debes says. "That might add to planet formation theories as to how you can actually form a planet very far out."

House Republicans have tried to repeal the law previously, but those efforts died in the Democrat-led Senate, Politico reported Thursday.Soon after the Supreme Court announced its decision last week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said a repeal vote would be the week of July 9.

| License Photo	ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 27 (UPI) -- George Zimmerman will ask the state of Florida to cover his legal costs to win an acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, his lawyer said.Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he would soon prepare a motion asking Circuit Judge Debra S. Nelson to authorize payments for the $200,000 to $300,000 it cost to defend Zimmerman, the Orlando Sentinel reported.State law requires Florida to pay Zimmerman's legal bills because he was acquitted of second-degree homicide charges by a six-member Seminole County jury in July.The money will come from the state agency that pays the non-lawyer legal expenses of indigent defendants.O'Mara said he is in the process of adding up the numbers but estimated the request would total $200,000 to $300,000.Martin, an unarmed black high school student, was shot to death in Sanford, Fla. Feb. 26, 2012. Moments before the shooting, neighborhood watch volunteer Zimmerman had called police describing the teen as suspicious.

MANILA, March 2 (UPI) -- Philippines President Benigno Aquino called on a group of Muslim militants to surrender after taking over a remote Malaysian village by force.The takeover is tied to a centuries-old conflict with Muslims loyal to a sultan once powerful in the southern Philippines and parts of Malaysia. CNN said 12 of the militants were killed along with two Malaysian police officers in a gun fight Friday.The New York Times said the militants arrived on the island of Borneo Feb. 12 to re-establish long dormant claims to ownership of the area and resisted several peaceful pleas to relinquish power prior to Friday's gunfight."Because of the path you have taken, what we have been trying to avoid has come to pass," Aquino said. "If you have grievances, the path you chose was wrong. The just and, indeed, the only correct thing for you to do is to surrender."

Wiki
Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910), better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American author and humorist. He is most noted for his novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), the latter often called "the Great American Novel."
Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later provide the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. He apprenticed with a printer. He also worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to his older brother Orion's newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, before heading west to join Orion. He was a failure at gold mining, so he next turned to journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, which became very popular and brought nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had found his calling.
He achieved great success as a writer and public speaker. His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
