BAGHDAD, Feb. 16 (UPI) -- Iraq aims to have another round of oil and gas licensing auctions during the fourth quarter of 2011, an Iraqi oil official said from Baghdad.Iraq has had three rounds of oil and gas auctions since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. It emerged from the last round in December 2009 with the confidence to say the country would one day rival Saudi Arabia in terms of oil production.Increasing production at some of the fields, however, could mean overcoming some major technological hurdles in the war-torn country. Energy officials said oil production could reach 8 million barrels per day by 2018 if all goes as planned.Energy officials in Baghdad said the central government has started procedures necessary to hold another round of oil and gas licensing auctions at the end of 2011, The Wall Street Journal reports.Oil majors working in the county, like British energy company BP, Italy's Eni and Exxon Mobil, have contributed to a measured rise in production in the country already.

WASHINGTON, June 28 (UPI) -- A group of U.S. environmental activist groups called on the federal government to conduct another review of the planned Keystone XL oil pipeline.Pipeline opponent Bold Nebraska joined the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, tar sands opponent Oil Change International and others in demanding the U.S. State Department conduct another environmental review.The State Department in early 2013 published its draft environmental assessment of the pipeline proposed to deliver 830,000 barrels of tar sands oil from Canada to southern U.S. refineries. Opponents of Keystone XL are concerned about the high-level of emissions associated with tar sands production and the perceived likelihood of pipeline corrosion. A study published this week by the U.S. National Research Council dispelled concerns about the corrosive nature of tar sands. The advocacy groups petitioning the State Department said Thursday they want to see more details on climate impacts associated with tar sands production. Their 48-page letter to the State Department points to a series of reports critical of tar sands, including an April report from the Environmental Protection Agency saying carbon emissions were downplayed in the original report from this year.The State Department's initial review said climate concerns associated with tar sands would be present with or without the pipeline. President Obama said he would weigh the project against its environmental footprint.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- California, a symbol of scientific excellence, is failing to invest enough time, money and training to teach science, teachers and administrators say.A survey conducted by the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning at the University of California, Berkeley, found only 10 percent of elementary students regularly receive hands-on science lessons, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Just one-third of elementary teachers said they felt prepared to teach science, and educators in the state's Silicon Valley say some students are coming to high schools never having conducted a single science experiment in elementary or middle school.The lack of science education is reflected in test scores.In tests by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, California students ranked at the bottom level along with Arizona, Mississippi and Hawaii.Students well-trained in science, technology, engineering and math -- the disciplines known as STEM -- are critical to the state's economic prosperity, Tom Torlakson, California's superintendent of public instruction, said.Fifteen of every 20 new jobs in the state require such skills, he said."There is a sense of alarm, particularly in the business community, over our low achievement scores in math and science," said Christopher Roe, head of the STEM network. "For a state that depends on science and technology as we do with Silicon Valley and Hollywood, we can't afford to be on the bottom. We have a history in years past as a leader, and we have to get there again."

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- A judge Tuesday threw out a marital agreement Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt contended gave him sole ownership of the baseball club.Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon ruled the 2004 marital property agreement was insufficient to back Frank McCourt's claim his wife Jamie wasn't entitled to an ownership stake in the Dodgers as part of their divorce, the Los Angeles Times reported.Gordon made the ruling more than two months after an 11-day trial during which Jamie McCourt argued she didn't know that by signing the agreement she'd be surrendering her rights to the team."The court finds that the marital property agreement is not a valid and enforceable agreement," Gordon wrote.The ruling leaves the Dodgers' ownership picture murky. Frank McCourt's lawyers said Tuesday they would try a different legal strategy to establish his sole ownership.But David Boies, an attorney for Jamie McCourt, told the Times the ruling should spur her husband to "sell the Dodgers, either to her or to somebody else" in order to provide her with a settlement worth half of their marital estate.

MOSCOW, Feb. 17 (UPI) -- Russia's top military commander says a U.S. proposal to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe remains a threat to arms control discussions.Gen. Nikolai Makarov, chief of Russia's General Staff, said the two countries were on the verge of completing a new nuclear arms reduction treaty, however plans to establish anti-missile equipment in Bulgaria and Romania threatened to derail the process."Recent events in Eastern Europe have to some extent affected the negotiations," Makarov told reporters in Moscow Tuesday. "But this will be reflected in the new treaty."The RIA Novosti news agency said Wednesday that the Kremlin was seeking clarification from Washington about a statement from Bulgaria's prime minister last week that talks were under way to base a missile shield in Bulgaria and Romania.The United States had canceled previous plans for such a deployment in Poland and the Czech Republic amid adamant opposition from Russia. Moscow views missile defense weaponry as a threat to its own nuclear deterrence capabilities.

BUFFALO GROVE, Ill., Jan. 27 (UPI) -- A suburban Chicago girl and her outspoken atheist father said they'd appeal an injunction's removal that returned a moment of silence to state public schools."I'm definitely dissatisfied with the injunction being removed," Dawn Sherman, 17, told the Chicago Tribune. "The whole purpose of the injunction was to not implement the moment of silence until we had ascertained the constitutionality. This issue has not been settled."The Buffalo Grove (Ill.) High School senior and her father, WJJG-AM, Chicago, talk show host Rob Sherman, said they would either appeal to a higher court, ask the state Legislature to make the moment of silence voluntary or ask school boards across the state to move the timing of the moment so it is not always at the beginning of the day, the Tribune said.U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman lifted his 2-year-old injunction after the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals determined last week the Illinois Silent Reflection and Student Prayer Act requiring the moment of silence in all Illinois public schools was not unconstitutional because the law did not specify the silent time must be used for prayer.The law lets students reflect on the day's activities rather than pray if that is their choice.The appeals court added the moment had a practical purpose in calming students at the start of classes.Gettleman ruled Jan. 21, 2009, the law does indeed cross the line separating church and state."The statute is a subtle effort to force students at impressionable ages to contemplate religion," Gettleman said in his ruling.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UPI) -- Hollywood's lobbying group is asking the Obama administration for permission to use drones for aerial shots, a document indicates..The Motion Picture Association of America released their lobbying disclosure document this week, The Hill reported.In the letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, representatives from the MPAA asked them to allow filmmakers to put cameras on unmanned aircraft in U.S. airspace. MPAA spokesman Howard Gantman said putting a camera on a drone would be safer, cheaper and more useful than using a helicopter or crane.The Hill said the FAA is drafting rules that would allow private groups to apply to fly drones and may start issuing private drone licenses by 2015. Police departments are also eyeing the technology.The FAA estimates 30,000 private and government drones could by in operation by the end of the decade.

| License Photo	MADRID, April 17 (UPI) -- Leaders of a left wing political party in Spain are calling for a referendum on whether the country should abolish the monarchy and return to being a republic.The minority United Left party said one reason for the move is the poor example the king has been setting during a time of economic hardship, The Telegraph of Britain reported.Increased calls for King Juan Carlos, 74, to abdicate follow an elephant hunting trip to Botswana where he injured his hip in a fall.Tomas Gomez, leader of the Madrid branch of the opposition socialist party, said the king must choose between service and "an abdication that would allow him to enjoy a different kind of life."The socialist party said it will present a list of questions to Parliament calling for details of the financing of the Botswana trip to be made public.So far the royal household has declined to give details on the trip except to say that it was a "private matter."

| License Photo	Jan. 8 (UPI) -- Posters on the internet board 4chan aren't exactly known for being the arbiters of taste, but the latest viral prank to come from the community may have hit a new low.After photos surfaced of Justin Bieber apparently smoking pot, members of 4chan launched a campaign #CutforBieber, encouraging fans to harm themselves in an attempt to get the pop singer to dump his weed habit."Lets start a cut yourself for bieber campaign," an anonymous user wrote on 4chan's controversial /b/ board (link NSFW). "Tweet a bunch of pics of people cutting themselves and claim we did it because bieber was smoking weed. See if we can get some little girls to cut themselves."(Slate takes a good look at what exactly about that /b/ board is so enthralling.)When someone was able to trace the trend back to 4chan, the original post was deleted. "OP DELETE THIS THREAD, WE HAVE BEEN SPOTTED," someone responded, but the original post has was captured in a screenshot.The campaign got enough attention, although much of it negative, to get #cutforBieber into the trending topics on Twitter in the U.S. #cutforbieber? Cutting is NOT something to joke about. There are people who are actually suffering from self-harm, this is so disrespectful.— Official CANCER(@OfficialCANCER) January 7, 2013
#selfharm is no joke. All children have the right to a safe and protective environment. #cutforbieber— UNICEF (@UNICEF) January 8, 2013
This is probably the most naive immature thing I have ever witnessed. Don't #cutforbieber. Cutting is a serious issue not a gimmick.— marissa jean(@Marissa_Jean) January 8, 2013
Some people actually suffer from self-harm and it's SO freakin disrespectful to #cutforbieber.— Venus Angelic (@VenusAngelic) January 8, 2013
Some people had a little more fun with the trend, posting images of themselves cutting paper, their nails, and of course, weed.i cut for @justinbieber #cutforbieber twitter.com/gemmadeighan/s…— ♡GEM♡ (@gemmadeighan) January 8, 2013
#cutforbieber we got you Justin @justinbieber twitter.com/shelbeysparrow…— Shelbey Sparrow (@shelbeysparrow) January 8, 2013
I #cutforbieber too okay? #Believe twitter.com/thejianhaotan/…— Jaime Tan JianHao (@thejianhaotan) January 8, 2013
So far, Bieber has ignored the whole thing.A similar prank by another anonymous Internet poster started a #baldforBieber frenzy, attempting to convince Bieber's fans the star had been diagnosed with cancer and that they should shave their heads in solidarity.
