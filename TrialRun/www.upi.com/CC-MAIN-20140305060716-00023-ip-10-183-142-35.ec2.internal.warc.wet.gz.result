| License Photo	NEW YORK, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- Amanda Bynes has agreed to see a counselor twice a week for the next six months as part of a deal to settle her New York bong-tossing case, officials said."I understand that after a period of six months has expired, if I have complied with the conditions set forth below the charges will be dismissed," the New York Daily News quoted the actress as stating in an affidavit signed Dec. 19 and presented in court by her lawyer Friday."This is an important step in her rehabilitation," Bynes lawyer Gerald Shargel told the newspaper. "I am optimistic about her future and pleased with the result."Bynes, 27, was charged last year with marijuana possession, evidence tampering and reckless endangerment after police said she threw a foot-long, glass bong out of the window of her Manhattan apartment.Bynes has been living with her parents in California after months of inpatient treatment for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.The actress was arrested multiple times since April 2012 and has been accused of driving while intoxicated, hit-and-run and driving with a suspended license, in addition to the alleged bong-tossing offenses.Bynes is the former star of the TV sketch comedy series, "The Amanda Show." Her film credits include "What a Girl Wants," "She's the Man" and "Hairspray."

HERSHEY, Pa., July 15 (UPI) -- A Dave Matthews fan said she will never forget the Pennsylvania concert that started with her giving the stranded musician a lift.Emily Kraus said she and her boyfriend were running late for the Saturday concert in Hershey when they spotted a man who strongly resembled Dave Matthews at the side of the road with a flat bike tire, CNN reported Monday.The couple pulled over and discovered the stranded man was indeed Matthews, who had gone out for a pre-show bike ride without his cellphone.Kraus said she had a bike rack on her car, so Matthews joined them on the ride to the stadium. She said they talked about his tour and his daughter's summer camp."We didn't know how to make conversation with him," Kraus said.The couple's kindness resulted in Matthews inviting them for dinner, bringing them backstage and upgrading their tickets to front row seats."My cheeks still hurt from smiling, giggling and laughing all night long ... this will always be remembered," Kraus said.Matthews thanked Kraus during his set at Hersheypark Stadium."I did not have a cell phone on the bicycle... And then a nice lady named Emily rode up in a red car with a bicycle rack on it and gave me a ride on to the gig," he said.

BENTLEY, Australia, June 14 (UPI) -- Ancient armored fish had a complex muscle arrangement, including abdominal muscles, a paleontologist at Australia's Curtin University said.The researchers said the discovery found in preserved tissue on Australian placoderm fossils offers an insight into the early evolution of all vertebrates, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Friday. "Nothing like this has ever been found in the world," said the study's lead author Associate Professor Kate Trinajstic, a palaeontologist with Curtin University in Bentley. "We've actually found the muscles and we've found them in such quantity and preservation that for the first time we can actually map all of the muscles on a fish."Placoderms, the earliest-known jawed vertebrates, swam Devonian seas 70 million years.Researchers had assumed these fish had primitive structures such as sharks, but the discovery of the tissue on the fossils "tells us that primitive doesn't mean simple," Trinajstic said."These fish had a unique and complex musculature which is unknown in modern fishes," Trinajstic told ABC. "Along with having a complex muscle system, they also have a differentiated vertebra column, that's quite an advanced feature."Another difference? The presence of abdominal muscles."Sharks and bony fish have quite simple muscles and they don't have the abdominal muscles, but this really ancient fish has abs," Trinajstic said.She said researchers used the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility to scan the fossils, ABC said.Trinajstic said decomposition or decay was prevented because of rapid burial once the fish died.

| License Photo	DETROIT, Oct. 18 (UPI) -- Jhonny Peralta led a home run barrage Thursday that pushed Detroit into the World Series with an 8-1 win and an ALCS sweep of the New York Yankees.The Tigers completed a dominating four games, during which they outscored the Yankees 19-6 and held New York to a .156 team batting average, its lowest ever in a playoff series.Detroit will have the next five days off before opening a bid for its first World Series title in 28 years against either St. Louis or San Francisco.The fourth and final game of the league championship series symbolized the ease with which Detroit rolled over the Yankees. The Tigers outhit New York 16-2, both of the Yankees' hits coming off starter Max Scherzer during his 5 2/3 innings of work.Scherzer struck out 10 in recording his first playoff victory this season and the second of his career.Three relievers combined to throw 3 1/3 hitless innings with Phil Coke working the last two frames.The Yankees suffered their fourth sweep in a best-of-seven playoff series. The other three occasions took place in the World Series -- against Cincinnati in 1976, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1963 and the New York Giants in 1922.New York superstar Alex Rodriguez, benched for a portion of the playoffs due to a severe batting slump, was not in the starting lineup but came on to get two at-bats as a designated hitter. He did not have a hit in either trip to the plate and finished the series with a batting average of .125.Detroit pounded out 11 hits against New York starter CC Sabathia, including a first-inning single by Delmon Young that put the Tigers in front for good.Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run homer in the fourth and Peralta added a two-run shot later in the inning that gave Detroit a 6-0 lead. Austin Jackson contributed a solo shot in the seventh and Peralta finished the scoring with a solo blast in the eighth.New York's only run came on Nick Swisher's RBI double in the sixth, the inning in which the Yankees produced their only two hits.The four-game sweep was the first in the ALCS since Detroit pulled off the feat six years ago against Oakland before losing to St. Louis in the World Series.Detroit's last World Series triumph came over the San Diego Padres in 1984. Their previous championship came over St. Louis in 1968, the year before Major League Baseball expanded its playoffs from two to four teams.With Detroit Manager Jim Leyland now able to set his starting rotation for the World Series, he is likely to send Justin Verlander to the mound for Game 1. Verlander has won all three of his starts during this year's playoffs with an 0.74 earned run average over 24 1/3 innings.

ISTANBUL {WOMENSENEWS}--A government proposal to lengthen the duration of paid maternity leave from four months to six months is generating apprehension rather than applause from women in Turkey."It is a positive development in principle, but may become an obstacle for women to return to work," Gulden Turktan, the Istanbul-based president of the Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey (KAGIDER), told Women's eNews.Women already start facing barriers in working life once they get pregnant, added Nur Ger, the founder and CEO of the Istanbul-based SUTEKS Textiles and the chair of the Turkish Industry and Business Association's gender equality working group."There is a tendency among employers to avoid hiring pregnant women since they will need to take their [maternity] leave soon," she said.The maternity leave discussion currently underway in the Turkish cabinet comes amid increasing pressure on Turkish women to have more children. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been calling since 2008 for women to have "at least three" children to revitalize the country's slowing population growth.Read more at Women's eNewsTurkey's fertility rate dropped to 2.02 in 2011, just below the replacement level of 2.1. Meanwhile, the median age of the country's population inched above 30 last year for the first time.This year, Erdogan has upped the ante, saying in January that "we need four to five [children per family] to carry the country forward," assigning four government ministers to work on population policy and floating proposals for family-expanding incentives, such as free fertility treatments for low-income couples.A Larger GoalAs with his outrage last year about abortions and Caesarean sections, which he characterized as "secret plots" to hinder the country's growth, Erdogan has framed his push for a bigger, younger population as part of a larger goal: To make Turkey one of the world's top 10 economies by 2023, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. (It currently ranks 17th.)That goal, though, would be better served by increasing women's participation in the paid work force, KAGIDER's Turktan told Women's eNews."It is very basic arithmetic: If you leave half of the resources untapped, your growth potential remains limited," she said. "Currently, the female employment rate is 26 percent, [meaning that] of around 26 million women of working age, only 6.9 million are employed. This is a huge wasted potential."Though the number of working women is slowly growing, Ger noted that the government's aim for 2023 is only to have 35 percent female participation in the work force. "When compared to the current status, this does not seem like a very challenging target," she said.The quality of the country's labor force is as important as its quantity, added economist Gokce Uysal, the vice director of the Bahcesehir University Center for Economic and Social Research."Monetary incentives to increase fertility rates work predominantly on the poorer segments of the population, who may not have the means to invest properly in the 'human capital' of their children," Uysal told Women's eNews.She is calling for comprehensive education reform. The average person in Turkey gets just 6.5 years of schooling, and only half as many women as men attain a secondary or higher level of education, according to the United Nations Development Programme.Child Care Subsidy PushThe lack of subsidized child care is another major barrier to Turkish women's full participation in the work force."If the prime minister wants each Turkish family to have at least three children, then the government must create a sustainable, state-funded child care system. Otherwise this will not work," Turktan said. "A working mother with three children can only be a reality with child-care help."A monthly child-care subsidy to working women would "pay back twice as much," according to research conducted by KAGIDER and PricewaterhouseCoopers, in increased employment and the expansion and formalization of Turkey's child-care sector, she said.Under a current law that is also up for amendment, companies are responsible for providing child care if they employ more than 150 women."This acts as a disincentive for firms as it increases the relative cost of female workers," Uysal said. "Maternity leave has a similar effect. We should have paternity leave for fathers as well, which should not be transferable."Shared parental leave is becoming increasingly common in Europe, where Sweden and Germany both mandate that at least two months of their generous paid leave be taken by fathers. Workers' unions and women's organizations in Turkey – including the women's branch of Erdogan's own ruling political party – have lobbied for similar measures since at least 2009, but without success.Adopting a system of parental leave rather than maternity leave would "work toward equalizing the costs of female and male workers. Moreover, it would help tilt the household division of labor away from a traditional gender-based one," Uysal told Women's eNews.Women in Turkey spend four more hours per day than men engaged in household and caregiving activities, compared to a difference of just over an hour in the Nordic countries, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Better Life Index."A traditional gender-based division of labor at home is one of the strongest barriers against female labor force participation," Uysal said. "We need to acknowledge this and start fighting it."Read more at Women's eNews

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- The White House has not decided how to respond to passage of marijuana legalization measures in Colorado and Washington, administration sources said.The U.S. Department of Justice has maintained that federal law trumps state law but no formal decision has been made yet on whether the feds will step in to block the new laws, The Washington Post reported Saturday."I really don't know what we're going to do," a high-ranking law enforcement official told the Post.The Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration have been engaged in a concerted effort to drive medical marijuana dispensaries out of business in California. However, the Post said the administration declined to take a pre-emptive stand on legalization measures that appeared on the ballots in Washington, Colorado and Oregon.On administration official told the Post they suspected the White House held off because the administration did not want to antagonize voters before Tuesday's election, particularly in Colorado."It was a battleground state," the official said.

| License Photo	JERUSALEM, March 21 (UPI) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin visited the Western Wall during her two-day visit to Jerusalem that includes dinner with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.Shortly after her airplane landed in Tel Aviv Sunday, Palin, accompanied by husband Todd, visited the Western Wall and adjacent tunnels, The Washington Post reported. Excavations of the tunnels have provoked Palestinian protests because of their nearness to the Temple Mount, location of the Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest shrines. GALLERY: 2012 Republican presidential possibilitiesOn Monday, Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate now employed by Fox News, was scheduled to tour the Christian Quarter of the Old City before her dinner with Netanyahu."I'm thankful to be able to travel to Israel on my way back to the U.S.," Palin said on her Web site as she traveled from India to Israel. "As the world confronts sweeping changes and new realities, I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the key issues facing his country, our ally Israel." Deputy Knesset speaker Danny Danon, who accompanied Palin on her visit to the Wall, said she was "very connected and touched to be at the Wall."Western Wall Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz said Palin prayed near the Holy of Holies and left a note with a personal prayer. CBS reported Palin wore a Star of David to show her solidarity with Israel."She said that she absolutely supports Israel and that America is the biggest friend that Israel has," Rabinowitz said.Netanyahu has met with several other possible U.S. presidential contenders in recent months.

MALAKAL, South Sudan, Jan. 20 (UPI) -- The strategic South Sudan town of Malakal has been seized from rebel control after a week of street fighting, the South Sudan army said Monday.The recapture of Malakal comes two days after the government retook the key city of Bor, capital of Jonglei state.Thousands were killed and a half million civilians became refugees in six weeks of fighting between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and rebels loyal to former Deputy President Riek Machar, the Middle East News Agency reported Monday.The United Nations said atrocities, including war crimes, have been committed on both sides, and Sunday reported soldiers attempted to forcefully enter a refugee camp sheltering thousands of civilians. U.N. human rights envoy Ivan Simonovic detailed reports of mass killings, sexual violence and widespread destruction in South Sudan's oil-rich Jonglei stateRebels attacked Malakal last week. The city has changed hands three times in the conflict and has been badly damaged, the news agency said.South Sudan erupted Dec. 15 in what Kiir claimed was a coup attempt by Machar, who was dismissed by Kiir in July. The fighting has spiraled into ethnic killings between the Dinka people, loyal to Kiir, and the Nuer, loyal to Machar.

Wiki
Anton Alekseyevich Volchenkov (Russian: Антон Алексеевич Волченков; born February 25, 1982), also known as the "A-train" and the "Russian Bear", is a Russian ice hockey defenceman who currently plays for the Ottawa Senators in the National Hockey League.
He was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in the 1st round as the 21st overall selection in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. In 2002, he came back to North America and played the entire season with Ottawa. He is known for his fearless attitude towards other players and the puck, and is generally considered to be amongst the toughest players in the league. In his early days playing in Europe, he played goaltender; however, his coach instructed him to play defence, which may help explain why he led the NHL in blocked shots in 2006–07 by a large margin. He is consistently amongst the top shot blockers and hitters.
Since his first stint in Ottawa, he has become a regular in the Senators' starting line-up. As a "stay-at-home" defenceman, he is known primarily for his blocked shots and massive hits. He also played in the 2006 Olympic Games for the Russian national ice hockey team and is now considered to be among Ottawa's top two defenders, along with Chris Phillips.
