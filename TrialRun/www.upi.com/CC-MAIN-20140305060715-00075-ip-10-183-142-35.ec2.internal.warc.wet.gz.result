BEIJING, March 8 (UPI) -- China's February exports, spurred by demands from the United States and other markets, rose 21.8 percent annually to $139.37 billion, a government agency said.In a further demonstration of China's strong recovery in its foreign trade, the General Administration of Customs said Friday imports fell 15.2 percent year-on-year to $124.12 billion, yielding a monthly trade surplus of $15.25 billion.In February of last year, China had a trade deficit of $31.98 billion.The agency said, however, the numbers would be different when making allowance for seasonally-adjusted factors such as four fewer working days in February due to the Spring Festival.Economist Wang Jun at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges said the better-than-expected exports were due to the steady recovery of the Chinese, United States and emerging economies, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Wang said the lower imports were due to a stronger U.S. dollar and falling prices for commodity goods as well as importers building inventories prior to the holidays.In the first two months of this year, trade with the European Union, China's largest trade partner, rose 3 percent while trade with the United States, its second-largest trade partner, increased 14.8 percent.Trade with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 22 percent but trade with Japan was down 8.2 percent, the report said.Analysts said the sharp jump in the February trade surplus may renew pressure on China to let its yuan appreciate more because a cheaper yuan gives the country an unfair trade advantage.Chen Hufei, a researcher with the Bank of Communications, told Xinhua imports would grow as China's economic recovery continues in coming months.China's economy grew 7.8 percent in 2012. It was higher than the government's target of 7.5 percent, but lower than the 9.3 percent in 2011.For this year, the government has again set a growth target of 7.5 percent. It also plans to grow its total foreign trade volume by around 8 percent in 2013.

SUNNYVALE, Calif., June 21 (UPI) -- Canada has communicated with the U.S. Air Force's Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite, becoming the first international partner in the system to do so.The AEHF system provides greatly enhanced protected communications capabilities for strategic command and tactical warfighters. A single AEHF satellite provides greater total capacity than the entire legacy five-satellite Milstar constellation now in use.Lockheed Martin, which produced the satellite, is on contract for six satellites and the mission control segment.The U.S. Air Force has been allowing select groups to use AEHF for testing as it fields the system."AEHF's protected communication capabilities are operational and have wide appeal," said Mark Calassa, vice president of Protected Communications at Lockheed Martin. "This event was an integrated effort that spanned countries, armed services and product lines. It shows our employees are delivering a complex system that works well, enhances capability and improves allied missions."Lockheed said a U.S.-Canada team, using a variant of the SMART-T terminal from a location near Ottawa, Canada, exchanged data with the U.S. Air Force's 4th Space Operations Squadron in Colorado. Later Canadian forces, with U.S. support, tested multiple Navy Multi-Band IP variant terminals to exchange data over AEHF networks.The Netherlands and Britain, who are also partners in the AEHF project, will conduct their first terminal connections in the months ahead.

PROVIDENCE, R.I., Aug. 3 (UPI) -- A pair of legal medical marijuana growers in Rhode Island said they are moving their plants after being victimized by thieves 17 times in the past five years.George DesRoches Jr. and Domenic Parillo said they have been maintaining a marijuana growing operation at a Providence apartment for five years, but they have decided to move their plants to a secret location after being repeatedly targeted by thieves, the Providence Journal reported Friday.DesRoches said a group of four men with two handguns who threatened him, his girlfriend and two friends in March was the last straw.The men said the marijuana has already been moved and they are working on transporting the rest of their belongings.

ANN ARBOR, Mich., May 7 (UPI) -- Humans may have played a part in the disappearance of mastodons after the last ice age by hunting and killing the most dominant males, a U.S. researcher says.Killing the biggest males for food would have left younger males engaged in pitched battles to replace them, violent affairs that could have affected the normally stable animal societies, University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher said.He cites as evidence puncture wounds from tusks and smashed bones found in fossils of female mastodons.Similar affects can be observed in modern elephant populations when poachers kill the large male bulls that keep younger males in line.Humans may have had the same effect on mastodons, Fisher said."Humans were the main driver of extinction, but when you look deeper into the complexity of that something very interesting starts to appear," he told The Daily Telegraph."The social structures of these animals were severely degraded as a result of the loss of mature males and in my view forms part of the extinction process," he said.He emphasized the analogy with modern elephants.The normal structure of elephant society is one where the old bulls keep the younger males in check," he said. "When the big bulls are pulled out of the picture, all hell breaks loose."

Trestman, 57, spent 17 years as an offensive coordinator and position coach, working to mold quarterbacks with the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, the Detroit Lions, the Arizona Cardinals and the Oakland Raiders."The skill set that Marc has, being an offensive mind, and then his great relationships that he's had with quarterbacks historically in the NFL and the work he's done with them makes him a good fit for the job," Alouettes general manager Jim Popp said.The Bears interviewed at least 13 candidates for the position, including Colts offensive coordinator Bruce Arians and Seahawks offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell, the Chicago Tribune reported.General Manager Phil Emery's final decision reportedly came down to between Trestman and Arians.

LONDON, March 9 (UPI) -- Brazilian and British leaders talked trade in meetings that were overshadowed by lingering concerns about last year's killing of a Brazilian man in London. In his first trip to Britain, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed during talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair the need to hammer out a comprehensive global trade agreement, the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday. Lula said that without a deal developing nations like Brazil would suffer from inequalities in global trade regulations that favor the world's wealthiest nations. The center-left Brazilian president has made promoting fair global trade a priority during his three years in office.The Brazilian president also reiterated his concern about the death of a Brazilian man last year in London and said he would visit with his family during his three-day visit. Last July British authorities mistakenly shot and killed Jean Charles de Menezes in a London metro station thinking he was a possible terror suspect following the train and bus bombings that killed nearly three dozen people.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- Los Angeles officials took a key step Tuesday toward issuing a photo ID card for undocumented immigrants that could also be used as an ATM card.A City Council committee voted unanimously to recommend the full council approve a request to solicit bids from vendors, to implement a photo ID program that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has said would serve as an official identification for many of the 4.3 million immigrants living in LA, regardless of their immigration status.San Francisco, Oakland and a few other California cities already offer similar ID cards.Councilman Ed Reyes said issuing such cards would allow immigrants to open bank accounts and gain access to municipal services, the Los Angeles Times reported."This card allows people who have been living in the shadows to be out in the light of day," he said, while noting he anticipates there will be opposition to the so-called City Services Card because of the controversial nature of immigration.Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told the newspaper issuing the cards would make it "easier for people who have violated federal immigration laws to live in the city."Supporters of the cards say its ATM aspect, by making it easier for immigrants to open bank accounts, would alleviate the need to carry cash and make them less-tempting targets for muggers, and would make immigrants less reluctant to report criminal activity to the police.

Sept. 27 (UPI) -- When researching images for a cover story tracing Romney's Mormon roots, Time magazine found a photo of a young Mitt Romney in 1968, sprawled out on a French beach next to a declaration of love for his then-girlfriend Ann.Time's deputy photo editor, Paul Moakley, gives us the backstory:On a recent cover shoot I asked Romney about the image and found out that around 1968, while serving as a Mormon missionary in France, a young Mitt made several photographs with the help of his LDS friends. He described how the photo was taken, explaining that it was playfully staged for his high school girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, Ann Davies. Romney revealed that the photo is actually one of a series made during his time abroad.Eager to get away from his stiff millionaire reputation, Romney has been playing up love for his wife at campaign events. In one campaign-made video, "The Love Story Continues" Ann describes their origins as a young couple in Utah, separated by Mitt's commitments to his Mormon mission in France. Though it's a cute photo, we couldn't possibly expect the Internet to resist the potential for meme excellence. Hypervocal kicked it off with a nod to a classic one-liner from "Anchorman." Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski tweeted out his own (dare we say, harsh?) version of the photo to his followers: Hmm. buzzfeed.com/johngara/send-… twitter.com/BuzzFeedAndrew…— Andrew Kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) September 27, 2012
If you're interested in creating your own "sand-written" Romney message, Buzzfeed makes it easy with a handy DIY meme-maker. Here are a few of their reader contributions:
