LONDON, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- British Energy Minister Ed Miliband welcomed top officials from Norwegian energy giant StatoilHydro to discuss gas and wind technology in the region.Helge Lund, the chief executive at StatoilHydro, met with Miliband in London to discuss issues pertaining to its business in Britain, the company said in a release.Miliband welcomed the friendly relationship his country had with Norway and StatoilHydro, expressing his interest in the Sheringham Shoal wind farm in particular. Lund, for his part, emphasized the role his company played in the region."We are exporting large gas volumes to the United Kingdom, and we have important projects here both within upstream oil and gas and offshore wind," he said.StatoilHydro said construction for the Sheringham Shoal offshore wind farm would begin in 2010. The farm consists of 88 wind turbines that will supply energy to roughly 220,000 homes.Meanwhile, the company is in the process of evaluations of the Mariner and Bressay heavy oil fields.To accommodate its growing activities in the United Kingdom, StatoilHydro announced it moved into new offices near Paddington Square."The opening of the new, larger office in London demonstrates our commitment to long-term business in the United Kingdom," said Lund.

ATKINSON, N.H., March 15 (UPI) -- Former Boston lead singer Brad Delp's death at his Atkinson, N.H., home was the result of suicide, Delp's family and police said.Atkinson police said the first officer at the scene found that the rock star left notes for his family and for emergency workers, said WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H."We found a note on the door in the garage, which led into the house and we found another note on his bedroom door, 'caution carbon monoxide,' and then there was a little statement on there. We went looking for him," said police Lt. William Baldwin.Police found Delp's body last Friday in a bathroom where two charcoal grills were smoldering in the tub. They were called to the scene by Delp's girlfriend.In a statement Wednesday, Delp's family said he was a person who "gave all he had to give" to people around him."He gave as long as he could, as best he could, and he was very tired," the statement said. "We take comfort in knowing that he is now, at last, at peace."Delp was with Boston in the 1970s, singing two of the band's biggest hits, "More than a Feeling" and "Long Time."

ATLANTA, March 15 (UPI) -- Physicians who practice healthy habits personally are more likely than other doctors to recommend lifestyle modification to patients, U.S. researchers suggest.Lead author Dr. Olivia Y. Hung, of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues Nora L. Keenan and Dr. Jing Fang, surveyed 1,000 U.S. physicians about their lifestyles and whether they recommended national guideline lifestyle modifications to patients with high blood pressure.The healthy lifestyle included eating healthy, limiting sodium, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol consumption and becoming more physically active.The survey of doctors indicated:-- 4 percent smoked at least once a week.-- Almost 39 percent ate the recommended five or more cups of fruits and vegetables a week.-- About 27 percent exercised five or more days a week.-- About 66 percent made all five lifestyle recommendations to patients.In addition, the study found doctors who exercised at least once a week or didn't smoke were about twice as likely to recommend the five interventions.The findings were presented at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention/Nutrition, Physical Activity and Metabolism scientific sessions in San Diego.

EAST LANSING, Mich., Aug. 5 (UPI) -- Parents get physical with their misbehaving children in public more than they do in laboratory experiments or acknowledge in surveys, U.S. researchers say. Kathy Stansbury, a psychologist at Michigan State University, and colleagues found 23 percent of the youngsters received some type of "negative touch" when they failed to comply with a parental request in public places such as restaurants and parks. Negative touch included arm pulling, pinching, slapping and spanking, Stansbury said. "I was very surprised to see what many people consider a socially undesirable behavior done by nearly a quarter of the caregivers," Stansbury said in a statement. "I have also seen hundreds of kids and their parents in a lab setting and never once witnessed any of this behavior."University student researchers anonymously observed 106 discipline interactions between a parent and child ages 3-5 in public places such as outdoor playgrounds or family restaurant and recorded the results. Male caregivers touched the children in more during discipline settings than female caregivers, but the majority of the time it was in a positive manner. Positive touch included hugging, tickling and patting, Stansbury said. The study, published in the journal Behavior and Social Issues, also found positive touch caused the children to comply more often, more quickly and with less fussing than negative touch, or physical punishment. Stansbury said when negative touch was used, even when children complied, they often pouted or sulked afterward. "If your child is upset and not minding you and you want to discipline them, I would use a positive, gentle touch," Stansbury said. "Our data found that negative touch didn't work."

FORKS TOWNSHIP, Pa., Sept. 6 (UPI) -- A Pennsylvania man who homeschools his children said he paid his $7,143 school tax in $1 bills to protest funding public education.Rob Fernandes videotaped himself delivering the 7,143 $1 bills, along with 54 cents change, to the Forks Township municipal building and explaining his reasoning to tax collector Anne Bennett-Morse, Philly.com reported Friday."I'm not doing this to make anybody's life more difficult," Fernandes can be seen telling Bennett-Morse in the video.Fernandes said he sees the money taken for school taxes as "stolen.""We homeschool our kids, so we don't even use the public school system, yet I'm being forced to pay all this money into a public school system that I don't use, don't want, don't need. And I don't think that's really either fair, just or even ethical," he said."It would be the equivalent if McDonald's were to force vegetarians to pay for their cheeseburgers," he said."I'm a big proponent of education," he said, adding that "education can be provided more efficiently in a free market."

Rachel Alexandra's hard-won victory in Saturday's $750,000 Woodward Stakes was so impressive and historic, her owner and trainer already are laying claim to Horse of the Year honors.Based solely on the Woodward, it's hard to argue. The last time a 3-year-old filly beat older males in a Grade I race on the main track in New York was in 1887. No filly had ever won the Woodward.Jockey Calvin Borel, who took off the Kentucky Derby winner to stick with Rachel Alexandra, sent her right to the lead in the Woodward and was pushed right along by Da' Tara through an opening quarter in 22.85 seconds -- sprinter time. She shook off the early speed on the turn but then had to cope with the closers and was all out to score her ninth straight win by a head over Macho Again. Bullsbay was another 1 1/2 lengths back in third.Despite the relatively desperate margin, Borel said Rachel Alexandra "would never let him go by her. Every time he went up to her, she would dig in again. She is such a tremendous filly. He ran up to her three times, and she kept giving me a little bit more.""I thought she truly showed she was a champion today," said Steve Asmussen, who trains Rachel Alexandra for Jess Jackson's Stonestreet Stable and Harold McCormick. "I can't say enough about the race she put in today under the circumstances." The Kentucky-bred Medaglia d'Oro filly now has won the Kentucky Oaks, the Preakness Stakes, the Mother Goose, the Haskell and the Woodward, seemingly leaving nothing to prove. The only potential issue is that owner Jess Jackson will not send her to Santa Anita for the Breeders' Cup, eschewing California's artificial surfaces.And that brings us to Zenyatta, the 5-year-old, still-undefeated runner-up for last year's Horse of the Year title, who could try for another victory in the Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic in November or could take on the males in the $5 million Classic.It takes some pretty far-fetched "what if" scenarios to see Rachel Alexandra not being Horse of the Year. But … what if Zenyatta wins a prep race convincingly, then runs in the Classic and beats an even tougher field of males than Rachel Alexandra met Saturday?The issue still could be settled -- for sure -- on the track.That option is the Oct. 3 Beldame at Belmont Park. Should both the superstars run there, the pot would be upped to $1 million. Zenyatta's owner and trainer haven't ruled it out. And, if they come east, it would be tough for Jackson to duck them."A lot gets said about the other mare and what's next. But I think we ought to focus on exactly what happened today," Asmussen said after the Woodward. About a race against Zenyatta, Jackson said, "I can't predict. It depends on both horses coming out and what both camps would be willing to do. I've indicated Rachel's had a full race year already. It might be that they get together, but I can't predict that. It takes two to (tango), but it better be a good venue or neither one will come."Other races with implications for the Classic:-- Monday's $1 million Pennsylvania Derby at Philadelphia Park may have turned up another potential star -- the Phipps Stable homebred Gone Astray. After being beaten in a minor stakes last month at Saratoga, trainer Shug McGaughey decided the Travers was too deep for the Dixie Union colt and instead targeted the rich but less contentious Philly event. Gone Astray responded, moving quickly to the front around the turn and easily loping off to win by 9 1/4 lengths. Join in the Dance was best of the rest, 2 lengths ahead of California shipper Kelly Leak. The favorite, Duke of Mischief, had a brutal trip and finished fourth. Gone Astray, under Eddie Castro, ran the 1 1/8 miles on a fast track in 1:48.27. McGaughey said the colt had been "training well at Saratoga. But this came as a surprise, as easy as he won today. I guess I'm going to have to take a look and see what I've got before deciding where he'll run next."-- Richard's Kid, at odds of 25-1, swept around the leaders turning for home in Sunday's $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar and went on to post a stunning upset. Einstein got the lead at the top of the lane and finished second by a neck with the favorite, Rail Trip, third. Colonel John was fifth. Richard's Kid, a 4-year-old, Maryland-bred Lemon Drop Kid colt, ran the 1 1/4 miles on the all-weather track in 2:02.39, winning for the sixth time in 19 starts. Earlier this year, he was seventh in the Eddie Read Handicap and second to Unusual Suspect in the Cougar II Handicap. Winning jockey Mike Smith said trainer Bob Baffert told him Richard's Kid "was doing good. He said he wants to drop back and make that run. After that, he said, 'Then I want you to give me one of those Hall of Fame rides.'" Garrett Gomez, who rode Colonel John said his mount and Rail Trip were saving ground when, "all of a sudden, the leaders backed right up into us and we had nowhere to go … Racing luck."-- At Arlington Park, Gran Estreno returned to his home court for Saturday's $200,000, Grade III Washington Park Handicap after winning the Claiming Crown Emerald on the Canterbury Park turf last time out. The result was the same as the 6-year-old Argentine-bred steed led all the way through slow fractions and got home first, 1/2 length ahead of Dubious Miss. Wicked Style finished third. Gran Estreno, under E.T. Baird, finished the 1 3/16 miles on the all-weather track in 2:00.61. He also earned a guaranteed spot in the Breeders' Cup Classic but would have to be supplemented to that race.In other holiday weekend racing that might impact the $25.5 million Breeders' Cup Championships Nov. 6-7 at Santa Anita:$2 million Ladies ClassicThird Dawn came four-wide into the stretch in Sunday's $100,000 Torrey Pines Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Del Mar and swept by the leaders, then drew off to win by 2 1/4 lengths. Music Magic finished second and Jehan was third. Third Dawn, a Kentucky-bred Sky Mesa filly, ran the 1 mile on the all-weather track in 1:37.6 under Joel Rosario. "I'll give her a little time now and bring her back for the 4-year-old filly series at Santa Anita," said winning trainer John Sadler. $2 million Sentient Jet Sprint-- Pyro showed little through the early furlongs of Saturday's $300,000 Forego Stakes at Saratoga. But when jockey John Velazquez kicked him into gear, the 4-year-old Pulpit colt quickly moved up, came out for room and finally split horses in the final sixteenth to win by 1/2 length. The favorite, Kodiak Kowboy, also ran well late to take second and Ready's Echo came from last to be third. Pyro got the 7 furlongs on a fast track in 1:21.48. Pyro went to Godolphin Racing after finishing sixth in last year's Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile and was idle until July 29, when he finished second in a Saratoga overnight stakes to Gold Trippi, who ran ninth Saturday. Rick Mettee, assistant to winning trainer Saeed bin Suroor, credited Velazquez. "Johnny gave him a perfect trip. To beat a horse like Kodiak Kowboy, you've got to pull a perfect trip. I could tell he had horse left at the quarter pole. But he pulled a really good trip, which isn't easy to do in a big field like this," Mettee said.-- Zensational picked up his fourth consecutive win with an anthoritative score in Sunday's $300,000 Pat O'Brien Stakes at Del Mar. Backing up his earlier victory in last month's Bing Crosby Stakes, the 3-year-old Unbridled's Song ridgling shot out to an easy lead and loped home 2 1/4 lengths ahead of Noble Court. Nikki'sgoldensteed finished third. Zensational, under Victor Espinoza, ran the 7 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:22.31. "He's fast," Espinoza said. "He's really fast. I've ridden some very good, very fast horses. But I've never ridden one like him." Added trainer Bob Baffert: "It's nerve-wracking to have a horse this good. He's an incredible animal -- so fast. You have to be careful with him. If you move on him, he takes off." Baffert said Zensational will train up to the Breeders' Cup.$1 million Sentient Jet Filly & Mare Sprint-- Carlsbad dueled for the lead in Friday's $200,000 Rancho Bernardo Handicap through quick early fractions, got the advantage and drew off to win by 4 lengths. Lady Lumberjack rallied to take second with Golden Doc A third. Carlsbad, an Arizona-bred daughter of Rocky Bar, won for the seventh time in nine starts and earned a spot in the Filly & Mare Sprint. However, she is not nominated and would have to be supplemented.-- Tribal Belle went quickly to the lead in Saturday's $150,000 (Canadian) Seaway Stakes at Woodbine, opened up a clear lead and survived at the end by a neck over Simply Splendid. Exotic Bloom ranged up from the back of the pack to snatch third. Tribal Belle, a British Columbia-bred daughter of Tribunal, ran the 7 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:22.44 under James McAleney.$3 million Emirates Airline Turf-- No Inflation seized the lead in Saturday's $200,000 Kent Breeders' Cup for 3-year-olds at Delaware Park and turned back all challenges, drawing off at the end to win by 6 1/4 lengths. Out At Night finished second and Dr Large was third. Colonel Rutledge was fourth and the odds-on favorite, Laureate Conductor, completed the order of finish. No Inflation, a Florida-bred Repriced gelding, ran the "about" 1 1/8 miles on firm turf in 1:48.29 with Rosemary Homeister Jr. up for trainer Tom Proctor, picking up his first added-money win. No Inflation had, however, finished second in the American Derby at Arlington and third in the Jefferson Cup earlier this year. Homeister said she "was told to just let him break and wherever he is comfortable, just leave him there. And when he broke, he broke sharp and he put himself on the lead and he felt very comfortable in that spot … When I got to the middle of the last turn and asked him, he was just in cruise control."-- Rendezvous had been knocking on the door all through the meet but finally got the big prize in Sunday's $300,000 Del Mar Derby, catching Battle of Hastings in the shadow of the wire to win by a nose. Acclamation finished third. Rendezvous, a Kentucky-bred Victory Gallop colt, finished the 1 1/8 miles on firm turf in 1:46.88 under Joel Rosario. He had been third in the Oceanside Stakes on Opening Day, then second in the La Jolla Handicap. "Joel was in a zone today," said winning trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, "so I just told him to ride his race and he surely did." He said Rendezvous will be pointed toward the Oak Tree Derby and maybe the Hollywood Derby.-- Free Fighter engaged odds-on favorite Brass Hat in a long stretch battle in Monday's $125,000 Stars and Stripes Handicap at Arlington Park, coming out on top by 1/2 length. Caberneigh was well back in third. Free Fighter, a 4-year-old Illinois-bred Out of Place gelding, finished the 1 1/2 miles on firm turf in 2:28.31. James Graham had the ride for trainer Chris Block. It was Free Fighter's sixth win in 16 starts but first stakes victory. "By the turn Brass Hat had come to me and we started picking it up together. He held on real well to win it."-- Al Khali settled behind horses for the first half of Sunday's $100,000 Saranac Stakes for 3-year-olds at Saratoga, moved up on the turn and into the stretch and drew clear to win by 1 1/4 lengths over El Crespo. Armstrong Mill finished third. Al Khali, a Kentucky-bred Medaglia d'Oro ridgling, ran the 1 3/16 miles on firm turf in 1:53. Kent Desormeaux had the mount for trainer Bill Mott.$2 million Emirates Airline Filly & Mare Turf-- Hot Cha Cha rallied around rivals in the turn in Monday's $200,000 Pucker Up Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Arlington Park and waltzed home first, 1 1/4 lengths to the good of the favorite. Romacaca. Single Solution was third, rallying from last of 12. Hot Cha Cha, a Kentucky-bred daughter of Cactus Ridge, ran the 9 furlongs on firm turf in 1:47.67 with James Graham in the irons.-- Mushka sat comfortably in second place behind a runaway speedball in Monday's $100,000 Glens Falls Handicap at Saratoga, then slowly reeled in the leader, went by and won off by 1 1/4 lengths. Lemonette also ran well late to finish second and Queen of Hearts finished third. Mushka, a 4-year-old, Kentucky-bred Empire Maker filly, finished the 1 3/8 miles on the firm inner turf in 2:13.5. Kent Desormeaux rode for trainer Bill Mott. -- Tizfiz rallied from a pace-stalking position to win Monday's $150,000 Edward J. Debartolo Sr. Memorial Handicap at Remington Park by 2 lengths over Get Rich Quick. Heza Wild Guy finished third. Tizfiz, a 5-year-old, Kentucky-bred Tiznow mare, got the 9 furlongs on firm turf in 1:48.03 with Luis Quinonez up.$2 million TVG Turf Mile-- Get Serious dueled for the early lead in Sunday's $175,000 Red Bank Stakes at Monmouth Park, got clear in the stretch, lost a shoe and then was fully extended to win by a neck over the onrushing Pleasant Strike. Steve's Double finished third. Get Serious, a 5-year-old, New York-bred City Zip gelding, ran the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:33.01 under Pablo Fragoso. "I can't say enough about this horse," said winning trainer John Forbes. "To run as good as he did and part of it missing a shoe is just tremendous." He said the next race will be either at Belmont or in the Oct. 3 Cliff Hanger at the Meadowlands, with an eye on the Breeders' Cup.-- Public Speaker rallied along the rail to go to the lead in Monday's $100,000 Sea O'Erin Handicap and edged clear to win by 1 length. Exchanging Kisses set the early fractions and held second. Demarcation was third and the favorite, Tizdejavu, faded to finish seventh. Public Speaker, a 4-year-old, Kentucky-bred Distorted Humor colt, ran the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:35.04. Junior Alvarado rode for trainer Dale Bennett. -- Guipago settled well back in the field in Sunday's $125,000 (Canadian) Vice Regent Stakes for 3-year-olds at Woodbine, rallied between horses to gain the lead in the stretch and got home first, 1/2 length better than Paso Doble. Mr. Foricos Two U finished third as the favorite. Guipago, an Ontario-bred colt by My Way Only, ran the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:34.33 with Tyler Pizarro up.$1 million Turf Sprint-- Chamberlain Bridge had to come six-wide around the turn in Monday's $250,000 Turf Monster Handicap at Philadelphia Park. But once pointed to the wire, the 5-year-old War Chant gelding was all business, closing stoutly under John Velazquez to win by 1 1/2 lengths. Little Nick took the place by a nose over Mr. Nightlinger. Chamberlain Bridge ran the 5 furlongs on firm turf in 57.14 seconds. Chamberlain Bridge, trained by Brett Calhoun, now has four stakes wins this year.-- Big Push made all the pace in Sunday's $60,000 Gilded Time Stakes for 3-year-olds at Monmouth Park and survived a late bid by Ju Jitsu Jax to win by a neck. The odds-on favorite, Affirmatif, was another 1 3/4 lengths back in third. Big Push, a Florida-bred Black Mambo colt, ran the "about" 5 1/2 furlongs in 1:01.3 with Elvis Trujillo aboard for trainer Steve Klesaris.$1 million Dirt Mile-- Star Nicholas dropped back to last in a field of five in Saturday's $85,000 Windy Sands Handicap at Del Mar, then rallied between horses in the stretch to win by a neck as only about a length covered the field at the finish. Monzante was second, a neck in front of Tamborim. Star Nicholas, a 6-year-old, California-bred Poteen gelding, ran the 1 mile on the all-weather track in 1:37.53 with Michael Baze up for trainer Peter Eurton.-- Grazen got the lead between horses in the stretch run of Saturday's $100,000 El Cajon Stakes for 3-year-olds at Del Mar and gritted out a 3/4-length victory. Chocolate Candy rallied to just miss and Fu Peg He Rat was well back in third. Grazen, a California-bred Benchmark colt, ran the 1 mile on the all-weather track in 1:36.49 with Garrett Gomez up for trainer Mike Mitchell.-- Going Ballistic circled the field, rallied from last of seven and won Monday's $150,000 Governor's Cup Stakes at Remington Park by 1 1/4 lengths. Jonesboro was second as the odds-on favorite and Alcomo finished third. Going Ballistic, a 5-year-old, Florida-bred horse by Lite the Fuse, ran 1 1/16 miles on a fast track in 1:43.8 under Luis Quinonez. Donnie Von Hemel trains.$2 million Grey Goose Juvenile-- Dublin stumbled at the start of Monday's $300,000 Three Chimneys Hopeful at Saratoga, slowly made up ground, got to the lead at midstretch and shook loose, winning by 2 lengths over Aspire. Aikenite was third. Dublin, a Kentucky-bred Afleet Alex colt, ran the 7 furlongs on a fast track in 1:23.52. Jamie Theriot was up for trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who was winning his fifth Hopeful. The others came with Deposit Ticket, Salt Lake, Hennessey and Yonaguska. "This was my No. 1 pick in the sales," Lukas said. "I still haven't lost my eye in that." He said he would like to stretch out Dublin around two turns in his next start but would consider the Grade 1, $400,000 Champagne, a one-turn mile Oct. 10 at Belmont Park.-- Western Smoke insisted on going to the lead in Saturday's $150,000 Sapling Stakes at Monmouth Park and, when jockey Elvis Trujillo let him have his way, the Kentucky-bred Smoke Glacken colt opened a big lead and coasted home first, 1 3/4 length ahead of Not Macho Any More. El Rocco was third. Western Smoke ran the 6 furlongs on a fast track in 1:09.56, gaining his fourth win in six starts. Three of the four victories have come in stakes. "We really didn't break too well," Trujillo said. "He kind of stumbled a bit. But he picked himself up quickly and wanted to go to the front. I tried to rate him a little, but I didn't want to fight him. After that, I decided to just let him run."-- Dixie Band picked up his third win without a defeat in capturing Saturday's $150,000 Arlington-Washington Futurity at Arlington Park. After a pace-stalking trip, Dixie Band was hooked in the stretch by longshot U Appeal to Me but managed to draw off in deep stretch and won by 1 3/4 lengths. Piscitelli was third. Dixie Band, a Kentucky-bred Dixie Union colt, ran the 1 mile on the all-weather track in 1:39.45 for jockey David Flores.-- Gleam of Hope got through along the rail entering the stretch in Monday's $200,000 Budweiser Select Cradle Stakes at River Downs and drove home 2 1/4 lengths in front of Guys Reward. Harrods Creek finished third and the favorite, Strike the Tiger, faded in the lane to get home seventh. Gleam of Hope, a Kentucky-bred City Zip colt, covered 1 1/16 miles on a good main track in 1:46.8 for jockey Corey Lanerie.-- Fastin Bear stalked the pace, then drew off rather easily in Monday's $125,000 Simcoe Stakes for Ontario-breds at Woodbine, winning by 5 1/4 lengths over Mobthewarrior. The favorite, Doctor Jack, settled for third. Fastin Bear, a Forest Camp colt, ran the 7 furlongs in 1:23.84. He now is 1-for-3 and picked up his first stakes win.-- Ibboyee surged to the lead at midstretch in Monday's $150,000 Aspirant Stakes for New York-breds at Finger Lakes and got loose to win by 6 1/4 lengths over Dahlgren. Ibboyee, a Medallist colt trained by Todd Pletcher and ridden by Cornelio Velasquez, ran the 6 furlongs on a fast track in 1:11.18.$2 million Grey Goose Juvenile Fillies-- Mi Sueno came around the leaders at the top of the stretch in Saturday's $300,000 Darley Debutante Stakes at Del Mar and, under some urging from jockey Michael Baze, was up to win by 1 length over Blind Luck. La Nez finished third. Mi Sueno, a Kentucky-bred Pulpit filly, ran the 7 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:23.78. Baze said when Blind Luck "got in front of her at the eighth pole -- a head or a neck -- she just rebroke and went after her. I knew I was a winner then. When she puts in her run, she's plenty good. And distance will be no problem for her. The farther the better." Winning trainer Eric Guillot said Mi Sueno "will relax even more when she starts running two turns. She has matured a lot as time has gone on. We'll be aiming for the Breeders' Cup."-- Hot Dixie Chick ran off with Sunday's $300,000 Spinaway Stakes at Saratoga, stalking the pace before taking command in the stretch to win by 1 3/4 lengths. Beautician was second and Bickersons was third after showing the way. Hot Dixie Chick, trained by Steve Asmussen and ridden by Robby Albarado, got the 7 furlongs on a fast track in 1:22.28. She also won the Schuylerville to get the Spa season rolling. The victories would make Hot Dixie Chick a favorite for the Breeders' Cup -- if she gets there. Asmussen, who says he won't take Rachel Alexandra to the California artificial surfaces, didn't sound enthusiastic about that option for her younger stablemate. "I don't know if we look past this at all," the trainer said. "It's a Grade 1, the Spinaway."-- She Be Wild drew off smartly in the stretch run to take Saturday's $150,000 Arlington-Washington Lassie at Arlington Park by 5 3/4 lengths over Tiz Miz Sue. Screen Legend finished third. She Be Wild, a Kentucky-bred Offlee Wild filly, ran 1 mile on the all-weather track in 1:38.67. Now 3-for-3, she won her career debut in a $40,000 claimer, then came back to capture the Top Flight Stakes at Arlington last month. Trainer Wayne Catalano said she started her career for a tag because, "Once in a while you have to take shots and do things. The opportunity came and we needed to get a race into her."-- Truth and Justice got the lead in Saturday's $100,000 Sorority Stakes at Monmouth Park, set a very brisk pace and then wasn't challenged, winning off by 3 1/2 lengths. Fuzzy Britches ran evenly to finish second and the favorite, Kinsey, finished third. Truth and Justice, a Kentucky-bred Yes It's True filly, ran the 6 furlongs in 1:09.99 under Joe Bravo. "I was a little worried and surprised when I saw the fractions, said winning trainer Kelly Breen. "She was going so easily up front it was hard to believe that she was going so fast."-- All About Anna drew clear in the stretch in Saturday's $100,000 Coca-Cola Bassinet Stakes at River Downs in Ohio and won by 6 lengths over Letter of the Law. Jody Slew finished third. All About Anna, a Kentucky-bred Maria's Mon filly, ran the 6 furlongs in 1:12.4 with Corey Lanerie up for trainer Eddie Kenneally.-- Sound of Thunder, making her career debut, rallied from last of 13 to win Monday's $125,000 (Canadian) Muskoka Stakes for Ontario-bred fillies at Woodbine. Amazon Belle, the favorite, was just a neck back in third and a nose in front of Tee Game. Sound of Thunder, by Stephen Got Even, ran 7 furlongs in 1:25.02. "I didn't put her in expecting to win, but I thought she would run well," said winning trainer Mark Casse.-- Franny Freud, the odds-on favorite, pressed the pace in Monday's $150,000 Lady Finger Stakes for New York-breds at Finger Lakes, then easily drew off, winning by 3 1/2 lengths over Hook Me Up. Fanny Freud, a daughter of Freud, got the 6 furlongs in 1:11.84 on a fast track.In other weekend racing:Ellis ParkGodolphin Gray led from the early stride to win Monday's $50,000 Cliff Guilliams Memorial Handicap by 1 length over Matty's Trail.

| License Photo	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., July 29 (UPI) -- Elina Svitolina jumps 32 spots in the world rankings, which were updated Monday, after collecting her first WTA title.Svitolina defeated Shahar Peer in straight sets Sunday in the final of the Baku Cup. It was her first appearance in a title match and came after she'd advanced to the semifinals the previous week.The 8-1 record over the last two tournaments boosts Svitolina from 83rd to No. 49 in the rankings. The bulk of that change -- she was 71st a week ago -- came in the wake of the Baku Cup win.Dominika Cibulkova collected her third WTA championship Sunday with a win at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, Calif., beating No. 4-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska in the final. It was Cibulkova's first championship since she won at Carlsbad, Calif., a year ago. That tournament is this week and Cibulkova is again in the field. She improved her ranking to 21st with the Stanford title.There are three Top 10 players challenging for Cibulkova's title at the Southern California Open. No. 3-ranked Victoria is seeded No. 1 and Radwanska and seventh-ranked Petra Kvitova are also in the field. Ninth-ranked Angelique Kerber leads the draw for the Citi Open in Washington.The WTA Top 10 with player's name, home country and rankings points:1. Serena Williams, United States, 11,7052. Maria Sharapova, Russia, 9,0103. Victoria Azarenka, Belarus, 8,8254. Agnieszka Radwanska, Poland, 6,1655. Li Na, China, 5,5556. Sara Errani, Italy, 5,1007. Petra Kvitova, Czech Republic, 4,4358.

| License Photo	COLLEGE PARK, Md., Oct. 23 (UPI) -- The global economy is teetering on collapse and the U.S. presidential election may well decide whether another Great Depression is avoided.For nearly two decades, China and the United States have been locked into a dangerous growth paradigm. Beijing undervalues the yuan to boost export, limit imports and accommodate migration from farms to cities.With dollars earned from trade surpluses, Beijing subsidizes imports of key raw materials like oil and credit to state-owned enterprises and provincial governments to accelerate industrialization and infrastructure investments. And Beijing buys U.S. private sector bonds and Treasury securities.The annual U.S. trade deficit with China is about $345 billion -- and that represents a huge drain on demand for U.S. goods and services and the principal reason the American economy is growing slowly.Until 2008, Americans avoided recession by consuming more than they produced -- homeowners borrowed ever large amounts to finance a spending binge. Led by China, foreign investors provided the funds by buying U.S. securities and Wall Street banks recycled this money by underwriting "creative mortgage products."When the Ponzi scheme collapsed, Washington bailed out the banks and the Obama administration engineered a weak recovery by running up federal spending and deficits.In China, the largest beneficiaries of modernization have been the families of communist party officials and U.S. multinationals -- such as Caterpillar and General Motors -- which have located operations in the Middle Kingdom.The iron alliance of conservative interests within the Communist Party and politically influential U.S. multinationals precludes radical changes in Beijing's growth strategy or pressure from the Obama administration to instigate needed changes in Chinese policies.Meanwhile, Wall Street financiers block genuine bank reforms that would free up lending to U.S. small businesses and continue to pay themselves ever larger bonuses.Europe suffers from similar dysfunctions.For many years, the euro has been undervalued for Germany and other northern states, making their exports artificially cheap, and overvalued for Spain, Italy and Greece, making their economies uncompetitive. The latter piled up trade deficits, financed by the Spaniards borrowing against their homes and the Italian and Greek governments borrowing from German and other northern-European banks.Now, the austerity imposed by Germany on southern Europe only throws their economies into deeper recession and does little to affect the structural changes needed -- for the southern economies to recover they must export more to the north, and Germany, Holland and the others must accept trade deficits to facilitate this. Such solutions are never discussed at meetings among European leaders to resolve the debt crisis.The U.S. and global economies are growing at less than 2 percent in 2012 and the same is expected in 2013 -- too little to both accommodate productivity advances and avoid new unemployment.The sales of U.S. blue chips -- the Standard and Poor's companies that make up 80 percent of U.S. publicly traded companies -- are declining for the first time since the recession ended and layoffs are likely at these companies next year if the pace of demand doesn't pick up.Only currency adjustments between the United States and China and replacing Dodd-Frank with genuine bank reforms can avoid another U.S. recession -- one that throws the already weak global economy into the great abyss.Four years with President Barack Obama speaks loudly that he doesn't have the stomach to effect changes with China or on Wall Street. At least Republican candidate Mitt Romney promises to tackle the China problem and new Wall Street reforms.The choice is between the failed and the untried.Americans shouldn't double down on the unsuccessful policies but rather bet on Mr. Romney.--(Peter Morici is an economist and professor at the Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, and widely published columnist.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (UPI) -- Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, N.J., Monday, pushing a massive storm surge and leaving millions of people without power along the East Coast.Sandy was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone shortly after landfall but was still kicking up strong winds blamed for a partial crane toppling near Carnegie Hall in New York, while driving rain and pounding surf inundated near-vacant cities in the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm made landfall at about 6 p.m., CBS-TV, Philadelphia, reported.The National Hurricane Center in Miami warned Sandy is "expected to bring life-threatening storm surge and coastal hurricane winds plus heavy Appalachian snows," with one official calling it the "worst-case scenario."Two U.S. deaths were attributed to Sandy, a man killed when a tree hit his home in New York City's Queens borough, and a person killed in a storm-caused car crash in Maryland, Fox News reported.The facade of a building in New York's Chelsea neighborhood collapsed, sending debris raining onto 8th Avenue.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a 10 p.m. news conference to urge residents not to call 911 unless it is truly a "life-threatening emergency." He said 911 was receiving 10,000 calls every 30 minutes, roughly 10 times the normal rate. He also admonished drivers to stay off the roads, saying stuck vehicles are complicating things for emergency responders."We need to keep the roads clear," Bloomberg said. "Do not drive."The mayor said he expects the storm surge to recede by midnight but said "the time to leave has passed," adding, "Do not go outside, it is very dangerous. ... You have to stay wherever you are."Bloomberg said backup power New York University's hospital had stopped working and the city was working to help move people out. He also noted a "large number of fires" have been caused by downed wires and electrical problems.A 63-mile stretch of New Jersey's Garden State Parkway was closed because of flooding.With massive power outages throughout the region, travel plans were on hold, schools were canceled and government offices were shuttered. The storm is expected to affect as many as 60 million people.Sandy still had maximum hurricane-force winds of 75 mph, moving northwest at 18 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 p.m. EDT advisory. The storm was centered 10 miles southwest of Philadelphia.Floodwaters forced the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to close New York's LaGuardia Airport, NY1 News reported. Power was out in parts of Lower Manhattan, where the water level at Battery Park reached a record 11.25 feet. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told MSNBC Sandy was to blame for at least one fatality in Montgomery County in which a car hydroplaned and crashed. He also said Maryland would add an additional day of early voting Friday.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said some people had decided to stay in Atlantic City despite his urging them to evacuate, and he laid the responsibility on Mayor Lorenzo Langford, WPIV-TV, Philadelphia, reported."So for those of you who are on the barrier islands who decided it was a better idea to wait this out than to evacuate and for those elected officials who decided to ignore my admonition, this is now your responsibility," Christie said.He said no further evacuation efforts would be undertaken because of the danger. Rescue operations, he said, "are putting first responders in significant, significant danger and it's not fair to their families to be putting them in danger because you decided to be hardheaded."Forecasters said Sandy, already responsible for at least 67 deaths in the Caribbean, was likely to collide with a cold front, spawning a superstorm capable of generating flash floods, snowstorms and massive power outages.President Obama said he spoke with governors of a number of states in Hurricane Sandy's wide, wide path along the eastern seaboard from North Carolina to the New England states. Even Florida was affected Monday by dangerous surf generated by Sandy."They have issues emergency declarations. Those have been turned around quickly here in the White House," Obama said. "We have prepositioned assets so that FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] personnel are working closely with state and local governments. We're making sure that food and water and emergency generation is available for those communities that are going to be hardest hit."In New York, authorities said they're concerned that the partial collapse of a crane could plunge onto the street, WABC-TV, New York, said.Sandy forced construction work to be suspended, so it was unclear whether anyone was at the job site at one what WABC said is one of the tallest towers in Manhattan.Meanwhile, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that New York City schools would be closed Tuesday. Classes were canceled in several cities for about 2 million students.The New York Stock Exchange posted on its website it would be closed for a second straight day Tuesday. "In consultation with other exchanges and market participants, NYSE ... will close its markets in coordination with all U.S. equities, bonds, options and derivatives markets on Tuesday," the statement said. "We intend to re-open our U.S. markets on Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2012, conditions permitting."The Office of Personnel Management said on its website that federal offices in Washington would be closed to the public for a second day Tuesday.WABC said the Brooklyn Battery and Holland tunnels were closed, and that speeds were reduced on the George Washington Bridge and three Staten Island crossings.Amtrak said its Northeast Corridor services were canceled through Tuesday because of Sandy. Airports reported thousands of flights had been canceled.Obama said his team knows "this is going to be a slow-moving process through a wide swath of the country, and millions of people are going to be affected.""So the most important message that I have for the public right now is, please listen to what your state and local officials are saying. When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate," Obama said. "Do not delay, don't pause, don't question the instructions that are being given because this is a serious storm and it could potentially have fatal consequence[s] if people haven't acted quickly.""But keep in mind that for folks who are not following instructions, if you are not evacuating when you've been asked to evacuate, you're putting first responders at danger," Obama said, a sentiment echoed by FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate.Fugate said one of his key concerns was "people who didn't evacuate" but later needed to be rescued, putting responders "in harm's way."Obama said he wasn't worried about Sandy's impact on the election."I'm worried about the impact on families, and I'm worried about the impact on our first responders. I'm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation," he said. "The election will take care of itself next week."Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said Sandy would be a "long-duration" event."Time has run out, or is running out, for preparations," Knabb said.Hurricane-force and tropical storm-force gusts could last in some areas "into Tuesday night or Wednesday morning." Forecasters also warned winds would be much higher at the upper floors of high-rise buildings than at ground level.Rainfall in some areas could be "measured in feet," not inches, Knabb said, while 2-3 feet of snow could fall in the mountainous regions of West Virginia.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on his website said he and his wife were keeping those in Sandy's path in their prayers."I hope that if you can, you'll reach out to your neighbors who may need help getting ready for the storm -- especially your elderly neighbors," he said in the post. "And if you can give of your resources or time, please consider supporting your local Red Cross organization."Off the coast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., the U.S. Coast Guard reported rescuing 14 of 16 people from the replica tall ship HMS Bounty, which was built for the 1962 movie "Mutiny on the Bounty" and also used in "Pirates of the Caribbean," who were in life rafts. CNN later reported one of the two missing people had been recovered, but was characterized as unresponsive and the 16th person was still missing. The Coast Guard said in a release the 16 Bounty crew members had abandoned ship after it lost power 90 miles from Cape Hatteras and began taking on water. It originally reported 17 people were on board the vessel, which sank.Weather advisories were posted along the Eastern Seaboard and inland into West Virginia, western Virginia, Kentucky and western Maryland.Rain and tropical storm-force winds were reported in Atlantic City, where casinos were closed Sunday after Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency.By 7:30 a.m., streets near the new Revel casino resort were flooded with more than a foot of water, witnesses told The (Newark) Star-Ledger.On its forecast track, the center of Sandy was expected to make landfall along or just south of the southern New Jersey coast Monday evening or night. Hurricane-force winds extended outward from center as far as 175 miles while tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 485 miles."It could be bad," Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior told CNN, "or it could be devastation."Storm-surge and high tide could raise water levels anywhere from 1-to-11 feet above normal along the East Coast to the Canadian border. The United Nations canceled all meetings at its New York headquarters. Broadway shows were canceled, as were performances at New York's Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera.Early voting was canceled in several states. Virginia's governor said Sunday his state would take measures to ensure residents could vote, despite potential hurdles created by the storm.A UPI-CVoter poll indicated 1 percent of the 1,585 adults polled last week before the threat of Sandy became imminent said natural disasters were the top issue facing the country, compared with 5 percent who cited healthcare and 3 percent who named the war on terror. Pollsters said the issue was expected to grow in importance in advance of the Nov. 6 balloting since Sandy is on track to devastate several swing states.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13 (UPI) -- A house fire of undetermined origin Monday left a father and two children dead and a mother clinging to life in Los Angeles, officials said.The incident was reported at 4:37 a.m., Los Angeles Fire Capt. Jaime Moore said. The mother, a son and daughter, were found huddled together in one room in the "metal-clad, barn-like home," while the father was found in a nearby hallway. None of the four had a pulse when firefighters arrived and all had suffered smoke inhalation. The father had been burned, as well, Moore said.Firefighters resuscitated the mother but she remained in critical condition, the Los Angeles Times reported.Fire investigators remained on the scene, attempting to determine how the blaze began. Officials said there were no smoke alarms inside and it appeared the family did not have an escape plan.The victims' names and ages were not reported.

| License Photo	CAIRO, Sept. 5 (UPI) -- A bomb thrown at the convoy of Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim injured at least eight people Thursday, officials in Cairo said.Ibrahim was not hurt in what Egyptian state television described as an assassination attempt, Ahram Online reported.At least eight people, including six security officers and a child, were injured in the attack, the Egypt Ambulance Authority said.Ibrahim said four vehicles among his convoy sustained damaged, as well as a number of civilian-owned vehicles. The explosion also damaged several businesses.The blast occurred near Ibrahim's residence in Cairo's Nasr City district, a stronghold for supporters of Egypt's ousted President Mohamed Morsi.In his first television interview since he was installed as Egypt's interim president, Adly Mansour dismissed claims that Morsi's ouster would lead to a return of the regime of Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled before Morsi, Ahram Online reported Wednesday."No force can turn back the clock, neither to the former regime or the one before it," Morsi said in an interview Tuesday on state television. "What happened after 25 January [2011] was an attempt at creating a clone of the former regime but with a religious tone."Mansour rejected concerns that a police state was being re-established after security forces violently dispersed two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo in mid-August. Hundreds of people died and numerous arrests were made among Muslim Brotherhood leaders and members. Morsi, ousted in early July, is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood."I know the police faced a lot of criticism in dispersing the [pro-Morsi] sit-ins, which were not peaceful, but they tried to pursue all peaceful stages [to clear the camps] and there was no response," Mansour said.Mansour said the resignation of former Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei in protest over the issue caught him by surprise.Mansour also said in the interview that foreign investment in Egypt has fallen to $2 billion after having reached $13 billion in 2007, Ahram Online reported."The cabinet's priorities are to commit to the transitional road map, to restore security and to improve the economic situation," he said.
