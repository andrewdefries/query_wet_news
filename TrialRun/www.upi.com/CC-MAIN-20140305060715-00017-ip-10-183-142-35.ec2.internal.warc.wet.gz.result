MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 14 (UPI) -- Best Buy says it will give founder Richard Schulze additional time to prepare his bid to buy the struggling U.S. electronics retailer.Best Buy's board of directors, which in August gave Schulze a Dec. 16 deadline to come up with a fully financed deal, said Friday it has agreed to extend the deadline to Feb. 28."Both parties believe that allowing Mr. Schulze to bring his offer after the holiday season and fiscal year end is in the best interests of shareholders and provides Mr. Schulze and his potential partners with an opportunity to include the company's full year results as part of their due diligence review.," Best Buy said in a statement.The board will have 30 days to review any offer made by Schulze.Shares of Best Buy, which rallied Thursday ahead of reports of an imminent bid, tumbled 15 percent Friday morning after the announcement was made. Analysts are now wondering if Schulze is having problems finding private equity partners to support a bid, CNN Money said.

SUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 7 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin has completed thermal vacuum testing of the U.S. Navy's first Mobile User Objective System satellite.A next-generation narrowband tactical satellite communications system, MUOS will provide significantly improved and assured communications for mobile warfighters. It will augment and ultimately replace the current UHF system and provide 10 times more communications capability, including simultaneous voice, video and data.In tests in Lockheed Martin's Dual Entry Large Thermal Altitude chamber, the MUOS spacecraft was stressed in a vacuum environment at extreme hot and cold temperatures it will experience throughout its design life.The milestone was the culmination of an extensive test program that proves the spacecraft's overall design, quality of workmanship and survivability during launch and on-orbit operation environments, the company said.Lockheed said thermal vacuum testing of the first MUOS satellite was completed later than planned as the team worked to validate the performance of the state-of-the-art spacecraft."The team worked extremely hard to complete this important test phase in a disciplined and timely fashion to support our customer's launch needs," said Mark Pasquale, Lockheed Martin vice president and MUOS program manager."The test confirms the spacecraft's ability to provide critical on-the-move communications for our deployed forces in remote and rugged locations and represents a pivotal moment toward achieving mission success on this program."The first MUOS satellite, along with the associated ground system, is on track to launch early next year.

GENEVA, Switzerland, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- U.N. special envoy to human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana said he's visiting the country to assess the grievances of ethnic minority groups.Quintana is scheduled to arrive Friday for six-day tour of Myanmar. He plans to visit Rakhine and Kachin states, two regions gripped by ethnic conflict."In Rakhine state, I hope to be able to assess what steps the government has taken to improve the human rights situation there," he said in a statement Tuesday. In Kachin, he said "important progress" has been made on ending hostilities, but he wanted to look at "how the underlying grievances of Myanmar's different ethnic groups will be listened to and addressed when the post-ceasefire talks start."Myanmar received international praise when it ended decades of military rule with general elections in 2010. The country's human rights record and lingering conflicts with various armed groups, however, has overshadowed some of its political reforms.Quintana said he'd issue a report on his findings to the U.N. Human Rights Council in March.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- House Speaker John Boehner said President Barack Obama lacks "courage" for warning about $85 billion in U.S. spending cuts but offering no viable alternative."Having first proposed and demanded the sequester, it would make sense that the president lead the effort to replace it," the Ohio Republican said in an op-ed piece published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal."Unfortunately, he has put forth no detailed plan that can pass Congress, and the Senate -- controlled by his Democratic allies -- hasn't even voted on a solution, let alone passed one," Boehner's piece said."By contrast, House Republicans have twice passed plans to replace the sequester with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect national security," Boehner wrote.The sequester is the Washington term for federal domestic and military spending cuts set to be automatically triggered in nine days and run through September unless Congress intervenes.The cuts -- established as part of the 2011 deal to raise the federal debt limit -- represent a small slice of the government's annual $3.5 trillion budget and big-ticket programs such as Social Security and Medicare benefits are exempt from them.The Daily Beast website reported Wednesday Boehner's office called on Republicans in July 2011 to agree to the sequester "to guarantee that Congress" take action on debt-reduction. The cuts were initially seen as so draconian Congress would enact a more targeted deficit-reduction deal to make comparable savings but no such deal has been reached.Congress is on a winter recess and is to return next week, just days before the March 1 deadline -- which already was moved once, at the start of the year, to give Republicans and Democrats additional time to negotiate.U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., told a town hall meeting Tuesday he is concerned that House Republicans have been "caving too much" and that "once the sequester takes effect, people are going to be screaming for a deal, and that deal ultimately is going to be what the president wants -- to raise taxes.""And if there's enough pressure, (Boehner) will bring it to the floor and 200 Democrats and 30 or 40 Republicans will vote for it," Bridenstine told constituents in Bixby, Okla. "And once again you have the speaker caucusing with the Democrats.""Republicans' willingness to do what is necessary to save [safety-net and retirement-security] programs is well-known," Boehner said in his piece. "But after four years, we haven't seen the same type of courage from the president."Boehner's criticism came after Obama -- who has proposed a deficit-reduction strategy that includes curbs on tax breaks for upper-income people -- warned military readiness and vital domestic services would be hurt "if Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take place.""These cuts are not smart, they are not fair, they will hurt our economy, they will add hundreds of thousands of Americans to the unemployment rolls. This is not an abstraction -- people will lose their jobs," Obama said at the White House with uniformed firefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians who could lose their jobs if the cuts go into effect.Administration officials have said if the cuts go through, many federal employees would likely be furloughed one day a week, which could affect certain federal operations including meat inspection and law enforcement.Some Republican lawmakers have proposed alternative savings that would spare military cuts but not domestic."The ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations, so the burden is all on first responders or seniors or middle-class families," Obama said, adding those proposals would "slash Medicare and investments that create good middle-class jobs.""And so far at least, what [Republicans have] expressed is a preference where they'd rather have these cuts go into effect than close a single tax loophole for the wealthiest Americans -- not one," Obama said.The dueling remarks came after Alan Simpson, a former GOP senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Bill Clinton, proposed a plan that would reduce the deficit $2.4 trillion through spending cuts and a tax-system overhaul. The amount is $900 billion more than the $1.5 trillion White House officials have said is their goal.Simpson and Bowles were co-chairmen of a White House bipartisan deficit-reduction panel created in February 2010 to find ways to reduce the mounting federal debt. The panel's package of tax and spending changes fell three votes short of the required 14-vote support from its 18 members that would have sent the proposal to Congress for a vote.House GOP leaders haven't yet detailed the size of the deficit-reduction package they will propose. They have said it would balance the budget within 10 years, which The Wall Street Journal said would put it in the $4 trillion range.Republicans have said it wouldn't include any tax increases.Obama administration officials say any deficit-reduction package must include new tax revenue as well as spending cuts.

LONDON, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- Net migration to Britain in the year that ended in March was down about 25 percent from the previous year, the government reported Thursday.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said the coalition government's policies aimed at reducing immigration are working, the Financial Times reported. Those include a crackdown on dubious student visas, a cap on visas for skilled workers and limits on allowing family members to enter Britain. "This shows we are bringing immigration back under control," Harper said. "Our tough policies are taking effect and this marks a significant step towards bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this parliament."The Office of National Statistics said the number of people entering the country on student visas dropped 8 percent, while the number of British residents moving out of the country with job offers elsewhere was up 5 percent. Overall, net migration was 183,000, down from 242,000.Edward Acton, vice chairman of the University of East Anglia, told the Financial Times he fears the country is losing legitimate foreign students."Ministers dancing on the green at reductions in legitimate student arrivals is in direct contradiction to the assurance the government gave Parliament a fortnight ago that it welcomes all genuine students," he said.

| License Photo	April 2 (UPI) -- In a statement on his Senate website Tuesday, Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk announced his support for gay marriage."When I climbed the Capitol steps in January, I promised myself that I would return to the Senate with an open mind and greater respect for others," Kirk wrote."Same-sex couples should have the right to civil marriage. Our time on this Earth is limited, I know that better than most. Life comes down to who you love and who loves you back -- government has no place in the middle."Kirk joins Rob Portman, R-Ohio, as the second Republican to back same-sex marriage.

Wiki
Dolly Rebecca Parton (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter, author, multi-instrumentalist, actress and philanthropist, best-known for her work in country music.
In the four-and-a-half decades since her national-chart début, she remains one of the most-successful female artists in the history of the country genre which garnered her the title of 'The Queen of Country Music', with twenty-five number-one singles, and a record forty-one top-10 country albums. She has the distinction of having performed on a top-five country hit in each of the last five decades and is tied with Reba McEntire as the only country artists with No. 1 singles in four consecutive decades.
She is known for her distinctive soprano, sometimes bawdy humor, flamboyant dress sense and voluptuous figure.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
