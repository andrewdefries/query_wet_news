WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UPI) -- Sales of existing U.S. homes slipped off of a nearly four-year peak in September, dropping 1.9 percent, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.Home sales declined from 5.39 million per year in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million in September, the trade group said.The figure on existing home sales for August was revised lower from 5.48 million.Sales for the month are also 10.7 percent higher than September 2012 when the annual rate stood at 4.78 million.NAR also said the median price of a home in September rose 11.7 percent from the same month in 2012, marking the 10th consecutive month of increases of 10 percent or more. The trade group said tight inventory of available homes is putting pressure on prices, which threatens the housing market recovery."Affordability has fallen to a five-year low as home price increases easily outpaced income growth," said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun."Expected rising mortgage interest rates will further lower affordability in upcoming months. Next month we may see some delays associated with the government shutdown," Yun said in a statement.The trade group said there were 2.21 million existing homes on the market at the end of September, which represents a 5-month supply at the current sales pace, a figure that is up from the 4.9-month supply in August, NAR said.Unsold inventory is 1.8 percent higher than September 2012.

TORONTO, May 22 (UPI) -- Weak head and neck control at 6 months of age may be a sign of autism spectrum disorder and developmental delays, U.S. researchers say.Study author Dr. Rebecca Landa of the Kennedy Krieger Institute and colleagues concluded a simple "pull-to-sit" task could be added to existing developmental screenings at pediatric well visits to improve early detection of developmental delays.Landa and her team examined 40 infants, ages 5.6 months to 10 months, considered to be at high genetic risk because a sibling had autism. Infants were scored on whether their head maintained alignment with the spine, or was in front of the spine, during the task. Lack of this head control indicated head lag.One group of 20 infants were tested at 6, 14 and 24 months. Ninety percent of infants diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder exhibited head lag as infants; 54 percent who met criteria for social/communication delay exhibited head lag as infants and 35 percent of children not meeting the criteria for social or communication delay or autism spectrum disorder exhibited head lag at 6 months.In the second group of 20 infants, researchers examined 6-month-olds at a single point in time for the presence of head lag. The study found 75 percent of high-risk infants exhibited head lag, compared to 33 percent of low-risk infants.Landa presented the International Meeting for Autism Research in Toronto.

| License Photo	CHICAGO, April 10 (UPI) -- An online exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of Chicago's O'Hare airport features a 2006 video of a pilot reporting a UFO encounter.The O'Hare@50 exhibit, created by Northwestern University's Transportation Library to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the airport's dedication by President John F. Kennedy, includes the so-called "UFO video" among other documents, facts and other materials related to the airport.The 2006 video involves a pilot flying at 38,000 feet having a conversation with the control tower. The pilot reports seeing an object at his "10 o'clock" that rapidly changes colors before vanishing. The air controller reports seeing nothing unusual.Roberto Sarmiento, head of the Transportation Library and curator of the online exhibit, said the site also pays tribute to Ralph Burke, who wrote the original 1948 master plan for O'Hare."Burke deserves much of the credit for forging an innovative plan that, eventually and for the most part, became a reality," Sarmiento said.The exhibit can be viewed at library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/evanston-campus/transportation-library/collection/ohare50."It's a mix of interesting and eclectic material that may better acquaint transportation enthusiasts and the general public with the history and lore of one of the world's most well-known airports," Sarmiento said.

| License Photo	CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 30 (UPI) -- Golfer Vijay Singh won't be suspended for using deer antler spray, PGA Tour Commission Tim Finchem announced Tuesday.Singh admitted in a January Sports Illustrated article he had used the spray -- which contains small amounts of IGF-1, a growth factor banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency -- but contended he didn't know the product contained any banned substances.The tour warned players about deer antler spray in August 2011.Finchem said Singh had been sanctioned for making the admission, and Singh kept playing while he appealed.The WADA issued a statement Tuesday indicating the use of deer antler spray is not considered prohibited, because the amount of growth hormone contained in it is too small to trigger a positive test.Thus, Finchem said, Singh would not face suspension from the PGA and Champions tours."Mr. Singh should have contacted the PGA Tour Anti-Doping Program Administrator or other resources readily available to players," Finchem said, "in order to verify that the product Mr. Singh was about to utilize did not contain any prohibited substances, especially in light of the warning issued in August 2011 in relation to deer antler spray."

TORONTO, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- Canada's Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. has acknowledged a forensic audit that suggests $198 million winnings were obtained fraudulently by insiders.At a Toronto news conference, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Chief Executive Officer Kelly McDougald said the corporation's previous estimate of $106 million in fraudulent winnings was increased after an audit by Deloitte and Touche.The most recent audit expanded the investigation into retailers to include their families and staff, the Toronto Star reported.In the past two years, OLG has instituted anti-fraud measures such as requiring ticket holders to sign tickets before having them electronically scanned, along with self-scan terminals at retail locations. However, the Deloitte and Touche audit found scams involving retailers using "atypical behaviors" involving instant win scratch tickets and lying to customers about winning free tickets on regular lottery plays, the report said."Today marks the next phase in the transformation of OLG's lottery operations," McDougald told reporters.She said the corporation's database of transactions containing some 200 billion pieces of data had been turned over to the Ontario Provincial Police, who said they would assign 14 officers to investigate suspicious winnings.

NASHVILLE, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- A Tennessee Republican lawmaker gearing up for a congressional campaign proposed making women get an ultrasound and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion.State Sen. Jim Tracy proposed legislation that would force a woman to get a "transabdominal ultrasound" -- in which a technician rubs a device over the abdomen to produce an image and heartbeat sounds from a fetus -- before getting an abortion.Under the proposed law, if a woman refused to look at the image the technician would be required to describe any limbs or other physical features visible on the monitor. Critics point out a transabdominal ultrasound often fails to generate more than a blurry image during the first trimester, making the measure little more than a hurdle to getting an abortion."This is the kind of issue you have when you have non-medical professionals trying to legislate on a medical issue," said Jeff Teague, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee.The (Nashville) Tennessean said Tuesday Tracy has announced plans to run a primary campaign against U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, an anti-abortion Republican who won a second term in Congress in 2012 despite revelations he urged his former wife to have two abortions.Any measure passed by the Legislature would almost certainly face a court challenge, the newspaper said.The Tennessee Constitution has a specific right to privacy clause that has made legal roadblocks to women's right to an abortion difficult to enact in the past, the report said.

TOKYO, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- A Tokyo court is blocking publication of a book that gives details of terrorism investigations.The provisional injunction against publisher Dai-San Shokan was issued Monday, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported. The book reveals personal details -- including names, photos and family data -- about people under investigation that are believed to have been leaked online from the Metropolitan Police Department. The book also has personal information about police investigators and informants. The book, "Leaked Police Terrorism Info: All Data," was released last week and has been sold in Tokyo bookstores.Dai-San Shokan boss Akira Kitagawa said, "I'll consider what we should do from now on." A lawyer for the petitioners read their statement: "Freedom of expression should not be exercised unconditionally nor in an irresponsible manner. Isn't freedom without responsibility a kind of violence?"It is rare for Japanese courts to ban books since the constitution guarantees freedom of speech.

June 9 (UPI) -- A man who fled murder charges in 1979 was arrested Friday at Chicago's O'Hare Airport and held without bail after spending 34 years on the run.Ata Yousef El Ammouri, 65, owned a convenience store on Chicago's south side neighborhood of Woodlawn when he was arrested and charged with the murder of Joe Harris, 31, on July 22, 1979.El Ammouri allegedly shot Harris after Harris stole a can of beer from the store, a release from the Cook County Sheriff's Office said. He posted $100,000 bail and was named a fugitive after he failed to appear in court in November 1979.Authorities caught up with El Ammouri at O'Hare when he flew in from Jordan, where he had been living, to attend a graduation.Cook County officials said the investigation involved collaboration from a number of state and law enforcement agencies, including the Department of State Diplomatic Security Service.

Wiki
Ronald Ernest "Ron" Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American medical doctor, author, Republican U.S. Congressman of the House of Representatives and candidate for the 2012 Republican Party presidential nomination. Paul is currently the U.S. Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas, which comprises the area south and southwest of the Greater Houston region, including Galveston. Paul serves on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Economic Committee, and the House Committee on Financial Services, and is Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology, where he has been an outspoken critic of current American foreign and monetary policy.
A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul is a graduate of Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree. Paul served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force from 1963 until 1968, during the Vietnam War. He worked as an obstetrician and gynecologist during the 1960s and 1970s, delivering more than 4,000 babies, before entering politics during 1976.
Paul is the initiator of the advocacy group Campaign for Liberty and his ideas have been expressed in numerous published articles and books, including Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom (2011), End The Fed (2009), The Revolution: A Manifesto (2008), Pillars of Prosperity (2008), A Foreign Policy of Freedom: Peace, Commerce, and Honest Friendship (2007), and The Case for Gold (1982). According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress since 1937. His son Rand Paul was elected to the United States Senate for Kentucky in 2010, making the elder Paul the first Representative in history to serve concurrently with a child of his in the Senate.
