NEW YORK, March 27 (UPI) -- Bariatric surgery dramatically outperforms standard medical treatment of severe type 2 diabetes, U.S and Italian researchers found. The study published in the online edition of the New England Journal Medicine found most bariatric surgery patients were able to discontinue all diabetes medications and maintain disease remission during the two-year study period. None of those randomly assigned to receive standard medical treatment for diabetes was able to stop medication. "Although bariatric surgery was initially conceived as a treatment for weight loss, it is now clear that surgery is an excellent approach for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disease," senior author Dr. Francesco Rubino, director of the Metabolic and Diabetes Surgery Center at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell and associate professor of surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College, said in a statement.Rubino and colleagues at the Catholic University/Policlinico Gemelli in Rome evaluated remission of diabetes in 60 severely obese patients ages 30 to 60 with advanced diabetes and a body mass index greater than 35. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: one group underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a second group had bilopancreatic diversion and the third group received conventional individualized medication and rigorously monitored dietary and lifestyle modification."These findings confirm that the effects of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes may be attributed to the mechanisms of surgery rather than the consequences of weight loss," Mingrone said in a statement. "Studying the actual mechanisms by which surgery improves diabetes may help understand the disease better."

DES MOINES, Iowa, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Bacon beckoned at the 2013 Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines, Iowa, that saw lots of homemade costumes along with a glut of bacon treats.Customized attire and costumes at the Saturday homage to bacon included a couple from Davenport, wearing "50 Shades of Bacon" shirts -- a take on the popular novel "50 Shades of Grey" -- complete with a pig posing provocatively and a couple from Montezuma dressed as Vikings."Vikings and bacon," Roy Hill told the Des Moines Register. "Come on."The lucky 8,000 who snagged passes to the bacon extravaganza at the Iowa State Fairgrounds waited about 15 minutes before they could enter the festival, the Register said.World Wrestling Entertainment star Hacksaw Jim Duggan, known for carrying a two-by-four into the ring, carried a large slab of prop bacon as he roamed around the auditorium Saturday, the Register said."You know what I've been telling everybody, yesterday I had bacon and eggs for breakfast, I had a BLT for lunch, I had bacon bits on my salad for dinner, so I've been training for the Bacon Festival," he said.

| License Photo	INDIANAPOLIS, May 4 (UPI) -- A Facebook page urging Indianapolis 500 officials to keep Donald Trump out of the pace car during the historic race has picked up 7,500 fans.Michael Wallack, an Indianapolis lawyer, said he created the "dump Trump" page April 8 expecting to attract little notice, the Indianapolis Star reported. The release of President Obama's birth certificate and other recent events have brought thousands of people to the page. Trump has also come under fire for suggesting Obama was an indifferent student who only got into Harvard Law School because of his race. "Driving the pace car should not be used as a sound board for some terrible businessman to spew his political aspirations, especially with this being the 100th anniversary," said Chris Hughes, an Indianapolis racing fan.The Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced Trump would be the pace car driver on April 5, at a time when his presidential aspirations were a bit more muted. Spokesman Doug Boles said the organization has heard from Trump fans as well as Trump detractors.

| License Photo	July 1 (UPI) -- Wikileaks founder Julian Assange eviscerated the handling of Edward Snowden and the leak of NSA secrets by the U.S. and the State Department.Assange also said the secrets would out, no matter the pressure put on Snowden."There is not stopping the publishing process at this stage," said Assange. "Great care has been taken to make sure that Mr. Snowden can’t be pressured by any state to stop the publication process." "I mean, the United States, by canceling his passport, has left him for the moment marooned in Russia," he said. "Is that really a great outcome by the State Department? Is that really what it wanted to do?”Assange criticized what he characterized as an overreaction to Snowden."I think that every citizen has the right to their citizenship,” he said. “To take someone’s principal component of citizenship, their passport, away from them is a disgrace.""Mr. Snowden has not been convicted of anything," he said. "There are no international warrants out for his arrest. To take a passport from a young man in a difficult situation like that is a disgrace.”Snowden is believed to still be in the "transit area" of the Moscow airport while his fate is negotiated -- or not -- by world leaders.Assange remains at the Ecuadoran embassy in London.Watch the full interview:Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 16 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama's wealth reaches upward of $3.8 million and possibly much higher, financial disclosure reports issued by the White House Monday show.The forms, which only provide wide ranges for each category, show most of his assets are tied up in treasury notes and bills -- $1 million to $5 million each, with another $1 million to $5 million in book royalties. Obama and his wife, Michelle, also have at least hundreds of thousands of dollars more tucked away in retirement funds and education funds for their two daughters. At the lower level, Obama probably is worth $3.8 million and at the upper end would have as much as $16.8 million, the reports indicate.Vice President Joe Biden is not a millionaire, his reports indicate.The reports are required to be made public under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 (UPI) -- The percentage of school-age children living in poverty grew between 2007 and 2011 in one quarter of U.S. counties, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. While 832 counties had a statistically significant increase in the school-age poverty rate, 10 counties saw the rate drop significantly, statisticians said. The bureau released its Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, which are among the factors used to determine federal aid to local schools. The estimates combine information from the bureau's American Community Survey, the 2000 and 2010 censuses, federal income tax filings and applications for federal nutrition assistance. The bureau said there was a significant increase in poverty among children aged 5 to 17 in 26 percent of the counties. The bureau compared 2011 with 2007, the last year before the recession began. A total of 83 counties had increases in school-age poverty between 2010 and 2011, while 23 had declines.

SENDAI, Japan, March 14 (UPI) -- A U.S. aircraft carrier group has moved farther offshore from Japan after radioactivity was found on helicopter crews, the 7th Fleet said Monday.Stars and Stripes reported the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group moved its ships and aircraft away from the Fukushima nuclear plant, where the Japanese are struggling to avert a meltdown after Friday's mammoth earthquake and tsunami.Low levels of contamination were found in the air and on the crews of three helicopters returning from relief work near Sendai.The 17 crew members were easily cleaned by washing, and the move is only temporary, the Navy said. It said their exposure was less than a month's worth of background radiation.The Reagan strike group was heading to South Korea for joint military exercises when it was diverted to Japan. It arrived Sunday to support disaster aid in devastated Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. "They received very, very low levels of contamination," Cmdr. Jeff A. Davis told The Washington Post by telephone. "It certainly is not cause for alarm. It is something we have to watch very carefully and make sure we are able to monitor, and to mitigate against this environmental hazard." The aircraft carrier and other U.S. warships in the region will not be in the path of wind-carried radiation, the Post said.Word of the contamination experienced by U.S. personnel came as Japan braced for possible nuclear disaster Monday as officials desperately worked to prevent multiple reactor meltdowns after the earthquake and tsunami.The disaster left more than 3,500 people confirmed dead, thousands more unaccounted for, more than 300,000 homeless, and millions without water, power, heat or transportation. The country's prime minister called the calamity the country's worst crisis since World War II.Explosions have occurred at two of six boiling-water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the 11,000-person town of Okuma in Fukushima prefecture's Futaba district, with the second explosion occurring Monday.The latest explosion did not appear to have harmed the reactor, but at least six people were injured in the blast, Japanese officials said. Workers flooded the two stricken reactors with seawater and then released steam, officials said, to avoid a full nuclear meltdown.

Wiki
Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was a British film director and producer. He pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres. After a successful career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and early talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood. In 1956 he became an American citizen, while remaining a British subject.
Over a career spanning more than half a century, Hitchcock fashioned for himself a distinctive and recognisable directorial style. He pioneered the use of a camera made to move in a way that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism. He framed shots to maximise anxiety, fear, or empathy, and used innovative film editing. His stories frequently feature fugitives on the run from the law alongside "icy blonde" female characters. Many of Hitchcock's films have twist endings and thrilling plots featuring depictions of violence, murder, and crime, although many of the mysteries function as decoys or "MacGuffins" meant only to serve thematic elements in the film and the extremely complex psychological examinations of the characters. Hitchcock's films also borrow many themes from psychoanalysis and feature strong sexual undertones. Through his cameo appearances in his own films, interviews, film trailers, and the television program Alfred Hitchcock Presents, he became a cultural icon.
Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph, which said: "Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else." The magazine MovieMaker has described him as the most influential filmmaker of all-time, and he is widely regarded as one of cinema's most significant artists.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
