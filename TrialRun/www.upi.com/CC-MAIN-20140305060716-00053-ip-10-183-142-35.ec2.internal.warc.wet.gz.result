WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (UPI) -- While the deforestation of tropical rainforests is seen as a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of cool-weather rainforests tends to be overlooked when addressing climate change, a panel of scientists said.These "forgotten" rainforests store more carbon per acre than tropical rainforests, the scientists said in Washington Wednesday while introducing "Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World: Ecology and Conservation," a book to be released next month.Temperate and boreal rainforests are found in 10 regions of the world, including the coastal rainforests that stretch from the California Redwoods to British Columbia and Alaska, to the lesser-known rainforests in South Africa, Japan, Europe and the Russian Far East.In the United States, the Top 10 national forests with the highest carbon storage are in western Oregon, Washington and Alaska. These rainforests store nearly 9.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents or roughly twice the amount of the nation's emissions from burning fossil fuels annually, the book says."The redwoods and our coastal rainforests are incredibly good at storing carbon for long periods," said forest ecologist Dominick DellaSala, editor and principal writer of the book, the Mail Tribune newspaper in Medford, Ore., reports."They are a big sponge for carbon. In fact, the redwoods and coastal forests up into Alaska have to be the best carbon storage on the planet, along with the Australian rainforest."But DellaSala said that less than 14 percent of the nation's forests are protected from logging and other resource development threats."As the United States engages in international efforts to prevent deforestation in developing countries, the Obama administration should protect carbon-rich older forests here at home from logging," said DellaSala in a news release."The United States should lead by example and we should expect at least as much of ourselves as a nation that we ask of others, especially those with fewer resources to address deforestation."The nation's temperate rainforests account for just a fraction of their once historic size: between 15-20 percent of old-growth rainforests remain in the Pacific Northwest and less than 4 percent of the region's coastal redwoods are still standing."The great temperate rainforests of many other countries are long gone," said Paul Alaback, professor emeritus of Forest Ecology at the University of Montana and one of the book's co-authors. "The U.S. has some of the most significant remaining temperate rainforests on federal lands in the world and has the responsibility to move swiftly to protect them."

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Sony BMG has been hit by lawsuits in California and Texas over its copy-protected CDs that install computer files without the owners' knowledge.Monday's court actions were just the latest headache for Sony, which last week recalled all of its CDs containing the hidden XCP software because the program was exploited to place a virus on some computers.The suit filed by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott was the state's first under its Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act of 2005, The Hollywood Reporter said."Consumers who purchased a Sony CD thought they were buying music. Instead, they received spyware that can damage a computer, subject it to viruses and expose the consumer to possible identity crime," Abbott said.The consumer activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation and two national class-action law firms filed a similar suit in Los Angeles, The Reporter said.The suit accuses Sony of creating "serious security, privacy and consumer protection problems" by placing the "flawed and overreaching computer program in over 20 million music CDs."

WALTON, Ga., Aug. 27 (UPI) -- A Georgia county celebrated the 116th birthday of the world's oldest living person -- the eighth person to reach the age -- by dedicating a bridge to the woman.Besse Cooper, who turned 116 Sunday, was honored at a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday for a new bridge on New Hope Church Road in Walton County when officials dedicated the bridge to her, the Walton (Ga.) Tribune reported Monday."The older she has gotten the more wittier she has gotten," said Cooper's son, Sidney, in relaying a message from his mother for the ceremony."I'm glad I gave them a reason to name it," he quoted Besse Cooper as saying.Cooper, who was born in Tennessee on Aug. 26, 1896, is only the eighth person confirmed to have reached the age of 116.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- The Department of Energy would receive $28.4 billion under the proposed FY 2011 U.S. budget to support innovation and maintain national security.The budget request included $36 billion in new loan authority to expand support for Energy Department loan guarantees for nuclear power facilities and $500 million to support $3 billion to $5 billion in loan guarantees for innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.The department's budget would provide $144 million for research, development and demonstration activities to modernize the nation's power grid, including smart-grid technologies that would spur creation of a smarter, more efficient, secure and reliable electric system.The Energy Department budget request also includes $2.4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, $545 million for advanced coal climate change technologies and $5.1 billion for basic energy sciences to discover novel ways to produce, store and use energy.The budget plan would phase-out funding for "inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change."

| License Photo	ESTORIL, Portugal, May 3 (UPI) -- Defending champion Juan Martin del Potro lost just one game Thursday in posting a second-round win at the Estoril Open tennis tournament in Portugal.Del Potro had a bye as the event's No. 1 seed and so Thursday marked his first appearance. It was relatively short as he dispatched Rui Machado 6-1, 6-0 in 62 minutes.He finished off 5-of-6 break-point chances and won 72 percent of the points on serve and 70 percent overall for the match.Del Potro next faces seventh-seeded Albert Montanes in the quarterfinals. Montanes shook off a challenge from Bobby Reynolds for a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win Thursday. There were only four breaks in 29 games, but three were by Montanes.The other quarterfinal set Thursday has fourth-seeded Albert Ramos playing wild-card entrant and local favorite Joao Sousa. Ramos beat Bjorn Phau 7-5, 6-0, losing only 13 points in the second set. Sousa advanced when fifth-seeded Denis Istomin retired after Sousa was up 3-6, 6-3, 4-2.The other quarterfinals, determined Wednesday, have second-seeded Richard Gasquet playing Daniel Munoz-de la Nava and third-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka going against No. 6-seeded Robin Haase.

WASHINGTON, July 18 (UPI) -- The U.S. government said it welcomes Iraq's efforts to find a political solution to ongoing conflict but is concerned by the overall level of violence.U.S. combat forces left Iraq in December 2011 under the terms of a bilateral strategic forces agreement. Since their departure, violence in Iraq has reached a point not seen since the country teetered on the brink of civil war in 2007.U.N. special envoy to Iraq Martin Kobler told the Security Council this week "fear, frustration [and] helplessness" were the overriding sentiments expressed by those Iraqis who grew up under the shadow of war.Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said the government was "deeply concerned" by the rise of violence in Iraq and its potential consequences for civil war in neighboring Syria.Al-Qaida elements from Iraq are fighting alongside anti-government forces in the Syrian war. Harf said Wednesday there was an overwhelming sentiment from Iraqi leaders of the need to find political solutions to internal crises.Kobler said he welcomed efforts by Iraqi political leaders to sit down at the negotiating table to resolve their differences. Some of the violence is Iraq is pitted along sectarian lines."We are encouraged that many political and religious leaders have taken a strong stance against this violence, and that we have continued to explore ways to address these ongoing security issues going forward," Harf said during a press conference.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UPI) -- House Speaker John Boehner said President Barack Obama lacks "courage" for warning about $85 billion in U.S. spending cuts but offering no viable alternative."Having first proposed and demanded the sequester, it would make sense that the president lead the effort to replace it," the Ohio Republican said in an op-ed piece published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal."Unfortunately, he has put forth no detailed plan that can pass Congress, and the Senate -- controlled by his Democratic allies -- hasn't even voted on a solution, let alone passed one," Boehner's piece said."By contrast, House Republicans have twice passed plans to replace the sequester with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect national security," Boehner wrote.The sequester is the Washington term for federal domestic and military spending cuts set to be automatically triggered in nine days and run through September unless Congress intervenes.The cuts -- established as part of the 2011 deal to raise the federal debt limit -- represent a small slice of the government's annual $3.5 trillion budget and big-ticket programs such as Social Security and Medicare benefits are exempt from them.The Daily Beast website reported Wednesday Boehner's office called on Republicans in July 2011 to agree to the sequester "to guarantee that Congress" take action on debt-reduction. The cuts were initially seen as so draconian Congress would enact a more targeted deficit-reduction deal to make comparable savings but no such deal has been reached.Congress is on a winter recess and is to return next week, just days before the March 1 deadline -- which already was moved once, at the start of the year, to give Republicans and Democrats additional time to negotiate.U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., told a town hall meeting Tuesday he is concerned that House Republicans have been "caving too much" and that "once the sequester takes effect, people are going to be screaming for a deal, and that deal ultimately is going to be what the president wants -- to raise taxes.""And if there's enough pressure, (Boehner) will bring it to the floor and 200 Democrats and 30 or 40 Republicans will vote for it," Bridenstine told constituents in Bixby, Okla. "And once again you have the speaker caucusing with the Democrats.""Republicans' willingness to do what is necessary to save [safety-net and retirement-security] programs is well-known," Boehner said in his piece. "But after four years, we haven't seen the same type of courage from the president."Boehner's criticism came after Obama -- who has proposed a deficit-reduction strategy that includes curbs on tax breaks for upper-income people -- warned military readiness and vital domestic services would be hurt "if Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take place.""These cuts are not smart, they are not fair, they will hurt our economy, they will add hundreds of thousands of Americans to the unemployment rolls. This is not an abstraction -- people will lose their jobs," Obama said at the White House with uniformed firefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians who could lose their jobs if the cuts go into effect.Administration officials have said if the cuts go through, many federal employees would likely be furloughed one day a week, which could affect certain federal operations including meat inspection and law enforcement.Some Republican lawmakers have proposed alternative savings that would spare military cuts but not domestic."The ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations, so the burden is all on first responders or seniors or middle-class families," Obama said, adding those proposals would "slash Medicare and investments that create good middle-class jobs.""And so far at least, what [Republicans have] expressed is a preference where they'd rather have these cuts go into effect than close a single tax loophole for the wealthiest Americans -- not one," Obama said.The dueling remarks came after Alan Simpson, a former GOP senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Bill Clinton, proposed a plan that would reduce the deficit $2.4 trillion through spending cuts and a tax-system overhaul. The amount is $900 billion more than the $1.5 trillion White House officials have said is their goal.Simpson and Bowles were co-chairmen of a White House bipartisan deficit-reduction panel created in February 2010 to find ways to reduce the mounting federal debt. The panel's package of tax and spending changes fell three votes short of the required 14-vote support from its 18 members that would have sent the proposal to Congress for a vote.House GOP leaders haven't yet detailed the size of the deficit-reduction package they will propose. They have said it would balance the budget within 10 years, which The Wall Street Journal said would put it in the $4 trillion range.Republicans have said it wouldn't include any tax increases.Obama administration officials say any deficit-reduction package must include new tax revenue as well as spending cuts.

MADRID, April 23 (UPI) -- A proposed change in Spanish law could make human chains, blocking streets or hindering public services during protests illegal, officials say.Under the proposed legislation, group leaders could face criminal trials if members of their demonstration cause disruption, Think Spain reported Monday.Demonstrating via the Internet, preventing police from doing their job, vandalism and protesting without proper permitting would violate the reform, proposed by Minister for Public Safety Ignacio Ulloa.Organizations would be held liable for members' actions, unless a group holding a demonstration is a public body or union, in which case liability falls on the person as an individual.Groups across Spain have spoken out against the proposed reform, calling it an attempt at censorship and an attack on their freedom of speech.

Brandon Yip was drafted by the Avalanche in the 8th round, 239th overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He played amateur junior hockey with the Coquitlam Express of the BCHL before enrolling to play collegiate hockey with Boston University of the Hockey East. In his freshman year in 2005–06, Brandon scored an impressive 31 points in 39 games and was named Hockey East rookie of the year. In his Junior year with the Terriers in 2007–08, Yip season was partly affected through an indefinite suspension for breaking team rules before returning to finish with 23 points in 37 games. After winning the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship with the Terriers in his senior year in 2008–09, Yip graduated from BU with high honors with a B.S. in Criminal Justice.
On July 22, 2009, Yip signed a one-year entry level contract with the Avalanche. Prior to his first pro season in 2009–10, Yip suffered a broken hand in a pre-season game that sidelined him for the first two months of the year. Returning to health Yip made his professional debut with the Avalanche's American Hockey League affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters, for six games before being recalled by Colorado on December 19, 2009, to make his NHL debut in a 5-2 home win against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Yip scored his first goal three days later against Jonas Hiller of the Anaheim Ducks.
