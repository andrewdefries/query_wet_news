HOUSTON, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Policies to combat climate change -- "well-intentioned but ultimately flawed or confusing" -- could hurt oil recovery, the head of Saudi Aramco said.Abdallah Jumah said Tuesday at an international energy conference oil and gas will be needed to meet rising demand for energy around the world. "If ... conventional and non-conventional oil resources fall victim to well-intentioned but ultimately flawed or confusing energy policies, then the necessary investment of time, toil and treasure may not materialize, and a significant proportion of these precious resources might not be recovered," Jumah, president and chief executive officer of Aramco, said at the CERA weeklong energy confab. Jumah said that in a bid to tackle the perception of peak oil, both conventional oil as well non-conventional resources such as tar sands must be considered. He placed the world's in-place endowment of conventional oil and non-conventional fuels at between 13 trillion and 16 trillion barrels.

HOLLYWOOD, May 17 (UPI) -- The U.S. sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond" will return next fall for its ninth and final season, Zap2it.com reported Monday.Although CBS won't reveal its full fall schedule until Wednesday, the network ended months of speculation when it announced Sunday the Emmy-winning comedy will be back for a single, 16-episode season."Our decision had nothing to do with money," said Phil Rosenthal, the show's creator and executive producer. "Emotionally, we never want the show to end, but everything must. We look forward to these remaining episodes as a few encores, and a few more meals with our staff."Both Rosenthal and the show's star, Ray Romano, have said the decision was based largely on meetings with writers to see if they still had stories to tell."The decision about coming back was always about maintaining the quality, and not feeling like we've overstayed our welcome," said Romano, who is also an executive producer of the show. "I look forward to being a hapless, sexless husband once again in year nine."

SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 12 (UPI) -- One-in-5 U.S. adults say they are burdened by medical debt and half of them are unable to pay the debt at all, federal health officials said.Lead author Robin Cohen of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics said health insurance -- public or private -- frequently determines whether families can pay for their medical expenses.In the first six months of 2011, one-third of people were in a family experiencing financial burden of medical care. One-in-5 were in a family having problems paying medical bills, 25 percent were in a family paying medical bills over time and 10 percent were in a family that had medical bills they were unable to pay at all, the report said."When 1-in-5 Americans were in medical debt it's clear that we're not doing enough to make health insurance affordable. Soon, federal law will require every American to have insurance, but nothing controls what health insurers can charge," Carmen Balber of the Consumer Watchdog Campaign in California said in a statement. "States need the power to say no to excessive health insurance premium hikes."A ballot initiative sponsored by CWC for the November ballot in California would require insurance companies to justify rate increases, under penalty of perjury, before higher rates can take effect. Regulators would have the power to reject or modify unreasonable premium rates, and limit the amount of wasteful overhead, profit and executive compensation that insurance companies may pass on to consumers, Cohen said.

CONVERSE, Texas, Jan. 15 (UPI) -- A pair of armed robbers in Texas who received just 68 cents from their three victims were sentenced to lengthy stays in prison.State District Judge Raymond Angelini sentenced Ryan Huerta, 19, to 18 years in prison last week and Arnulfo Hernandez was sentenced to 20 years in prison Monday for their string of three incidents in Converse, the San Antonio Express-News reported Tuesday.Hernandez had originally obtained a plea agreement calling for a maximum eight-year sentence, but the agreement was voided when he failed to show up for sentencing in September. He told the court he skipped the appearance because he was trying to support his pregnant girlfriend.Police said the men were armed with a .22-caliber rifle when they robbed a Converse Walmart employee of his pocket change in January 2011 and attempted to rob a woman nearby, firing a round into her windshield before she drove off. The third victim was able to disarm Huerta and the teens fled, but returned after circling the block and rammed the man's car.Police said the shot fired into the woman's car did not penetrate the windshield."But for the grace of God and the small caliber of the weapon, we could have something else entirely," prosecutor Daryl Harris said.

BATON ROUGE, La., Feb. 24 (UPI) -- Republicans are ready to work with President Barack Obama but warned they would remain true to their core tenets, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Tuesday.Delivering the GOP response to Obama's speech before a joint session of Congress, Jindal called the recently signed, $787 billion economic stimulus package "irresponsible" and contended it is "no way to strengthen our economy, create jobs, or build a prosperous future for our children."Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want the economy to recover and the nation to prosper, Jindal said."So where we agree, Republicans must be the president's strongest partners," he said. "And where we disagree, Republicans have a responsibility to be candid and offer better ideas for a path forward."Jindal, speaking from the governor's mansion in Baton Rouge, said Republicans appreciate Obama's message of hope, but "sometimes it seems like we look for hope in different places.""Democratic leaders in Washington, they place their hope in the federal government," Jindal said. "We place our hope in you, the American people."Ultimately, it is an "honest and fundamental" disagreement about government's role, Jindal said."We oppose the national Democratic view that says the way to strengthen our country is to increase dependence on government," he said. "We believe the way to strengthen our country is to restrain spending in Washington, to empower individuals and small businesses to grow our economy and create jobs."Jindal, 37, is considered a rising star of the Republican Party. Previously this week, he gained attention for rejecting millions of dollars in unemployment assistance allocated to his state in the stimulus plan.

HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y., Feb. 23 (UPI) -- Investigators on Long Island, N.Y., blamed a faulty heating system flue for a deadly carbon monoxide leak at a shopping mall restaurant, city officials said.Steven Nelson, 55, the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station died Saturday night after falling unconscious in the basement of the restaurant, which was filled with customers and staff at the time.A.J. Carter, a spokesman for the town of Huntington, said Sunday the fire marshal determined the cause of the leak was a faulty flue, the New York Daily News reported."The issue was in the basement, where the manager ... was overcome," Carter said.Citing a co-worker it did not identify, the newspaper said Nelson was felled when he went to the basement to investigate the odor of gas.The report said Legal Sea Foods assistant manager Megan Smith, who survived, was overcome by gas when she went looking for Nelson, a father of two."She (Smith) went downstairs to inspect and disappeared," the co-worker said. "That's when we knew something was wrong. People kept disappearing down there."Suffolk County police Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick said Sunday the carbon monoxide appeared to have been confined to the basement."It does not appear to have made it in the area of the restaurant where the customers were," he said.Another 28 people were taken to hospitals for treatment of the effects of the invisible but deadly gas.Fitzpatrick said no customers were harmed. The victims were all restaurant employees or emergency personnel who had rushed to the scene.Nevertheless, Legal Sea Foods and two other restaurants were quickly evacuated after Nelson collapsed."They told us to leave because of a gas leak," Cheesecake Factory patron Kathy Sella told WNBC-TV, New York. "I didn't want to blow up or anything like that. We were at the bar having a glass of wine and then, one of the waitresses, she said you have to leave."A summons has been issued requiring the restaurant to repair faulty equipment before it can reopen.

CAIRO, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- A lawyer for a former top Egyptian security official argued in court Sunday his client is innocent of murdering pro-democracy protesters.Gameel Saeed, a lawyer representing Ahmed Ramzy, former commander of the Central Security Forces, said because officers were exonerated of murder in Sayeda Zeinab Square, his client must also be innocent, al-Masry al-Youm reported. Ramzy is accused of "participation with others in the killing of protesters in several locations," including the square, the prosecutor's petition said.Additionally, Saeed said, police officers gave testimony under pressure from interrogators.The trial, which includes defendants former President Hosni Mubarak, former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly and five former security officials in addition to Ramzy, was adjourned to Monday. During the Sunday session, Nasser al-Asqalani, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, demanded an update on Mubarak's reportedly deteriorating health -- the deposed leader is in custody at the International Medical Center in Cairo. Asqalani said Mubarak should be transferred to Tora prison with other former regime leaders.

| License Photo	April 30 (UPI) -- Television personality Kristin Cavallari told Coco Eco Magazine she's been putting her acting career on hold to be with her fiance, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler.“I’ve passed on a couple of things that would have kept me here in L.A. because my fiancé Jay has to be in Chicago, so if I was here, we would never see each other,” Cavallari says in Coco Eco magazine’s April/May issue. “The sacrifices we make for love…”Cavallari, who has a shoe line with Chinese Laundry and recently launched her very own jewelry line, spoke about the importance of finding a balance between work and her personal life. She maintained that her designing career is perfect for this because it allows her to do what she loves while remaining close to her husband.“It’s easy to get wrapped up in your career and have that be your only focus, and I want my marriage to work and last -- and family comes first,” she says. “The design work is great because I can do most of it from Chicago and I have so much fun with it. I love it and it all works out.”The 26-year-old is set to marry Cutler this summer. The couple welcomed their first child Camden Jack Cutler, on August 8, 2012.
