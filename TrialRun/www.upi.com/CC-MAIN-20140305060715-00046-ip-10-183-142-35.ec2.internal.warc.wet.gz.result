NEW YORK, June 17 (UPI) -- Manufacturing activity rose modestly in New York in June, despite declines in most categories, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday.The general business index rebounded from a decline in May that followed three months of improvements, the Fed said.In June, the general business index for the Fed's New York District rose 9 points to 7.8.In an unusual twist, the general business index rose with 29 percent of respondents indicating conditions had gotten better in the past month and 22 percent indicating it had gotten worse."Nevertheless, most other indicators in the survey fell," the Fed said.The new-orders index gave up six points to reach minus 6.7, while the shipments index lost 12 points to minus 11.8.The unfilled orders index gave up eight points to minus 14.5.In addition, the Fed said, "labor market conditions worsened." The index measuring the number of employees slipped to zero, while the index measuring number of hours worked gave up 10 points to minus 11.3.Also retreating in June was the business outlook for six months down the road, "suggesting that optimism about future conditions was weakening further."

SANAA, Yemen, Dec. 8 (UPI) -- Bell Helicopter has won a $27 million contract to supply Yemen with a comprehensive mission package to support military requirements, a company statement said.The deal was announced as U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates kicked off a tour of the region to discuss growing international concern over Iran's nuclear program.The Bell Helicopter deal includes commercially designated Huey II aircraft, pilot and maintenance training, spares, special tooling and dedicated service representatives."This contract award is the result of a true team effort," said John L. Garrison, Bell Helicopter president and chief executive officer. "We are delighted to partner with AMCOM, DCAA and DCMA to provide the Yemen government with aircraft and support that not only adds value to their mission, but are expected to be delivered ahead of schedule," he said in a company statement.The aircraft are to be delivered in January and are expected to be operational within a year. A spares package has also been included in the $27 million deal."Built on the foundation of proven reliability, the Huey II delivers increased mission capabilities and the performance enhancements needed to ensure the success of the Yemen government's mission requirements," said Larry Roberts, senior vice president commercial business.The tender was launched in January and Bell says all four aircraft are complete.Bell Helicopter is a subsidiary of Textron Inc. and is an industry-leading producer of commercial and military, manned and unmanned vertical lift aircraft and the pioneer of the revolutionary tilt rotor aircraft."Based on the proven Bell UH-1H helicopter, the Huey II configuration adds a more powerful engine, new dynamic components and tailboom, a new navigation and communication suite, and complete rewiring to an existing hull; significantly increasing in hover performance and gross weight, while lowering direct operating costs," the company said of its winning helicopter.Under the deal, at least 12 Yemeni pilots and 32 maintenance technicians will be trained by Bell Helicopter experts.While in Oman, Gates discussed Iran's disputed nuclear program with Sultan Qaboos bin Said as well as the growing threat in Oman's neighbor, Yemen.The visit comes amid the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic memos on the WikiLeaks Web site. Documents released include cables that depicting Arab leaders deeply threatened by Iran's nuclear ambitions and urging Washington to take military action. Since the link, U.S. officials have been trying to allay concerns by allies and partners unnerved by the leaked files, which included embarrassing revelations and harsh assessments of an array of leaders.

EMERYVILLE, Calif., Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Digital animation studio Pixar says it's named its main building after the late Steve Jobs, who was instrumental in keeping the firm alive in its early years.The Apple founder was a big investor in the animated movie studio, laying out $10 million to purchase Pixar from Lucasfilm in 1986.Pixar was sold 20 years later to Disney for $7.4 billion.The building at the Emeryville, Calif., headquarters of Pixar has been officially named "The Steve Jobs Building."It's appropriate, The Pixar Times blog said, because Jobs helped design it, suggesting it be centered around a large atrium so employees would be constantly running into each other, which would spark creativity.Jobs put millions of his own money into Pixar years before it was profitable, until its first feature film, "Toy Story" in 1995, made it a hugely successful studio.

| License Photo	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Nov. 7 (UPI) -- A professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey said he is offering a class aimed at examining the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen from a theological perspective.Azzan Yadin-Israel, an associate professor of Jewish studies and classics, said he will teach a Byrne Seminar -- a one-credit course offering an introduction to research in classes of up to 20 students -- that seeks to examine the religious references and Bible stories found in Springsteen's music, Rutgers Today reported Thursday."The seminar includes lyrics of songs from 'Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey,' Springsteen's first album, all the way through 'Wrecking Ball,' so this is clearly a broad phenomenon," Yadin-Israel said. "In some songs, Springsteen engages biblical motifs explicitly, as the titles indicate. For example, 'Adam Raised a Cain,' 'Jesus was an Only Son,' 'In the Belly of the Whale.' But concepts with biblical resonance appear throughout his works, and it's just a matter of taking the theological overtones seriously."The Byrne Seminars offer a relatively relaxed classroom setting, so there's no expectation that anyone will become a Springsteen scholar. I do hope the students gain an appreciation for a particular way of thinking about texts, an attentive engagement of an author's work, and an understanding of the broader contexts -- political, literary, theological, etc.-- that inform a work," he said.

HAWTHORNE, Calif., March 5 (UPI) -- The reasons why a technical glitch delayed a SpaceX capsule's docking with the International Space Station may remain secret because of U.S. laws, experts say.When SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif., launched a Dragon capsule March 1 to carry supplies to the station, its thrusters developed problems that ground engineers had to overcome, delaying the capsule's docking with the ISS by one day.SpaceX said it would investigate the malfunction, but it will be restricted in what it can publicly reveal by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that list commercial capsules like Dragon as munitions, NewScientist.com reported Tuesday.The U.S. regulations put in place in 1999 are intended to keep technology that could be used in advanced ballistic weapons out of the hands of countries such as China, Iran and North Korea."SpaceX will know what went wrong, regardless of ITAR," SpaceX spokeswoman Christina Ra said. "ITAR regulates what we can share." Commercial space-industry firms, led by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation in Washington, are campaigning to have ITAR relaxed."Certainly NASA will find out what happened with SpaceX," Alex Saltman, CSF executive director, said. "And I think there's value to the community in learning about what happened so that people can avoid similar problems in the future.""Being able to share best practices is important in any industry, and you don't want to put any undue restrictions on that capability."

| License Photo	There is actually so much that a player does during a practice round that a complete description could make for a very good book. Whereas every player has his own routine for practice rounds, there are a few things that all players are looking to achieve.Get to Know the CourseIn his interview yesterday, Tiger Woods said that "the most important thing about these next two days is just getting to know this new course for us."Simply put, the end goal of practice rounds is to get to know the course. But what exactly does that mean? "Getting to know the course" is somewhat of a vague concept. In an ideal world, there would be enough practice rounds to reach the point where one feels like he has played there his whole life, almost like it being his home course. Obviously a player can't play that many practice rounds for every tournament. This is why players try to absorb as much information about the course as possible during practice rounds. While playing a practice round, players keep their eyes and ears open to the course like antennas, trying absorb as much information as possible. Players actually gather information on the grounds from their feet as they walk the course. Playing proper practice rounds can be demanding. This is why they will often play only nine holes in one day. Yesterday, for example, several of the American players played only about 8-10 holes. You will also notice that they will almost never play for score. Playing for score takes an entirely different mindset. One might say that the antennas are closed to reception, except for information that might influence the shot that is to be played in the moment. This can change, however, on courses that are regular tour stops. Once a player has been to the same course for a few years in a row, the practice rounds change slightly in nature. Some players are known to even play for a little cash during practice rounds. I remember Lanny Wadkins saying that he has an un-cashed check from Ben Hogan from a practice round that they played together. Not to break Lanny's heart, but during practice rounds, Hogan was known to play his approach shots to parts of the greens where he knew the hole was going to be placed during the tournament. Meaning that he played away from the flag during practice rounds. In essence, your best chance of beating Hogan was to play him in a practice round.Medinah is not a regular tour stop and even when a player thinks he knows the course, things can change. Woods, who has won two PGAs at Medinah, spoke to this dynamic."I've been here two PGAs and it's a different golf course again. I'm going to need to do my homework so that whoever I go out with that I will be ready and able to contribute and understand this golf course and how to play it," Woods said. Get to Know DistancesOne of the main focuses during a practice round is to get to know distances to the course's various obstacles -- water hazards, trees, bunkers. One of the things that I noticed yesterday was that, with the exception of hole 15, Medinah's water hazards are all frontal -- in front of the green in the axis of play. For a tour player, these hazards virtually never come into play. However, they will influence shot selection and strategy for the approach shots into those greens. Nowadays on tour, each player is given a very sophisticated yardage book that has distances to and from nearly every spot imaginable. Yet nothing can be left to chance in a game where one shot could mean the differences between winning or losing the golden Ryder Cup. This yardage book becomes a veritable notebook for tour players. Players will write down dominant wind direction for each hole in case the wind swirls on different parts of the course because of trees. For example, at Medinah, three of the par-threes play across a major water hazard -- those tend to be pretty windy.Because the tee boxes and the greens on these holes are sheltered by tall trees, players might not feel the wind and the flag might not be moving much. The player who "hasn't done his homework" as Tiger says, might make a crucial error when the pressure is on. Identify Major Shot PatternsThe other thing that I noticed on the course was that there are a lot of dog-legs out there. As we all know, dog-legs offer an interesting challenge. If you are a slicer, you already know the challenge you are faced when you come to a hole that turns to the left. Believe it or not, tour players are in the same boat. In fact, it is often said that even a play like Lee Trevino never won at Augusta because most of the holes turned to the left and he preferred playing a fade. In the case of Lee at Augusta, there is surely more to it, but there is much truth in that statement. For a tour professional, the decision is to try to cut the corner (Bubba Watson style), bend it around the corner (Phil Mickelson style) or play to a certain distance in the dogleg that allows for a good angle on the next shot (Zach Johnson style). With seven holes bending to the left and three turning to the right, strategy off the tee this week is going to be very important. Not only will each player have to decide how to play each hole in preparation for his singles match, the captains are going to have to keep in mind each players' shot tendencies when doing the pairings for the doubles matches. Get Confident on the GreensIn his interview yesterday, he made a comment that is often said about the modern tour: "ultimately if you look at any golf tournament, whoever makes the most putts usually wins." Whereas I don't think that this is always the case, especially not in the big events, there is no question that one of the main focuses for the players during a practice round is the greens. Very often in golf, for amateurs and pros alike, one's success on the greens comes down to feeling comfortable about the greens. Phil made a comment during the FedEx that even though he has a practice green with the same grass as did the course, he still wasn't comfortable with the greens. During a practice round, players spend a lot of time on the greens. They hit putts from all directions to make sure that they know the breaks on the greens. They try to get a feel for how fast the ball is rolling. They look for tricky spots on the greens where holes may be placed. As I was walking the course late in the afternoon, a couple of American team players were back out on the 13th green. There is one spot on the back left of that green where there is a little ridge from the front of the green to the back of the green. Once the ball gets over that ridge, it then goes back downhill and to the left. Hopefully, it's the American's dedication to doing their homework that will help bring the Cup back to the States.----Stephen Moskal is currently the Director of Instruction for Golf Swing Exchange, an innovative on-line coaching platform whose goal is to revolutionize the ability for people to learn golf.

VATICAN CITY, March 6 (UPI) -- The Roman Catholic Church needs global standards for disciplining bishops, Cardinal Sean O'Malley said in an interview in Rome. O'Malley, who is in the city for the conclave that will select the next pope, told The Boston Globe on Tuesday that will be a task for the man chosen to succeed Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. He cited the U.S. church, which adopted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual abuse some years ago, but where there is no uniform policy for dealing with bishops who failed to move against abusive priests. "Right now, it's not terribly clear, but it's something the next pope will have to deal with," he said.O'Malley was named archbishop of Boston by Pope John Paul II in 2003 and cardinal by Benedict in 2006. His predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, resigned amidst allegations he was involved in covering up sexual abuse by priests in the Boston archdiocese. The next pope must also "relate well to the global church," O'Malley said. While the church is growing fast in South America and Africa, its leadership continues to be dominated by Europeans.

Aug. 16 (UPI) -- Florida health officials have issued an official warning to swimmers as 12-year-old boy fights for his life against a brain-eating bug.The Florida Department of Health warned people against warm, shallow waters after Zachary Reyna contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, caused by the rare single-celled parasite Naegleria fowleri, while playing in a ditch by his house in LaBelle on August 3. Zachary's mother took him to the hospital after he slept all day the next day, unusual behavior for an active 12-year-old boy. Surgeons operated on his brain and diagnosed him with PAM, which destroys brain tissue and is nearly always fatal.But there's hope for Zac, and for 12-year-old Arkansas girl Kali Harding, who contracted the parasite a few weeks ago but has responded positively to an experimental anti-amoeba drug.The Centers for Disease Control released some of the same anti-amoeba drug used to treat Kali to Zac's doctors.Through 2012, there were 128 known cases of Naegleria fowleri-caused infections, and just two survivors. The infection typically presents within seven days and kills within 12, so Kali and Zac and their families are optimistic about doubling the survival rate."We continue to be amazed by Kali's progress," her family said in a statement Thursday. "Today she's able to sit up on her own, write some words on a white board and stand with assistance for very brief stretches. She's even able to throw and catch a ball with her therapists. We are grateful for the continued prayers from Kali's supporters, which no doubt drive her recovery."Kali's doctors treated her with Impavido, and reduced her body temperature to 93 degrees, the same technique used to protect the brain from injuries that cause swelling. Several weeks after she was infected, doctors reported no presence of the amoeba in her spinal fluid.The CDC recommends avoiding swimming in shallow, warm water, wear a nose clip, and avoid stirring up sediment while wading in shallow water.

Wiki
David Lee Roth (often referred to as "Diamond Dave") (born October 10, 1955, Bloomington, Indiana) is an American rock vocalist, songwriter, actor, author, and former radio personality, best known as the original lead singer of Van Halen. In addition to his work with Van Halen, Roth is a successful solo artist, having released several platinum and gold solo albums. Roth rejoined Van Halen in 2007 for a North American tour that became the highest grossing tour in the band's history.
David Lee Roth is the son of the late Nathan Roth, an ophthalmologist, and Sibyl Roth, and the brother of Allison and Lisa Roth. Roth's paternal and maternal grandparents migrated to Indiana from Russia. One of his grandmothers was from Azores, Portugal. Roth's uncle, Manny Roth, is an influential New York City nightclub owner and entertainment entrepreneur. Manny Roth built and owned the famous New York establishment Cafe Wha? in the early 1960s, when the likes of Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix were working there. Seven-year-old David Lee got his first taste of, and desire for, show business from the inside by hanging out at Cafe Wha?.
Roth moved to Pasadena, California in his teens after living in Swampscott, Massachusetts and Bloomington, Indiana.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
