NEW YORK, May 13 (UPI) -- The editor in chief at Bloomberg News said company reporters had tracked Wall Street personnel through terminal use since the early days of the company.Bloomberg News is, in a manner of speaking, an afterthought developed to help the company sell subscriptions to data terminals, which make up 85 percent of the firm's revenue, The New York Times reported Monday.When the news division began in the 1990s, reporters frequently accompanied sales personnel on their rounds, the Times said. With the two divisions that closely linked, "Some reporters have used the so-called terminal to obtain, as The Washington Post reported, 'mundane' facts such as logon information," editor in chief Matthew Winkler said in an editorial that appeared online late Sunday."The recent complaints relate to practices that are almost as old as Bloomberg News," Winkler said about the news gathering practice that has made headlines for what is considered a breach of client privacy.Winkler, who is the author of "The Bloomberg Way: A Guide for Reporters and Editors," a handbook on reporting ethics, apologized for the practice, which he called "inexcusable."Former employees of the company, the Times reported, have said reporters were trained on how to use the terminals to look for subscriber data.The practice came to the surface recently after Goldman Sachs complained that a reporter, inquiring about the status of one of the bank's executives, said that the executive had not logged on to his Bloomberg terminal recently.A similar incident occurred at JPMorgan Chase last year, the Times said.Bloomberg has gone into damage control. Winkler apologized for the practice that involves a company with 2,400 reporters on its staff. Bloomberg L.P. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Doctoroff last week called the practice a "mistake" and said it would not happen again.Doctoroff also said the reporters could only access limited information through the subscriber data. They could not, for example, learn about market activity. They could, however, look through chats between Bloomberg clients and terminal sales personnel.There are 315,000 terminal subscriptions, which provided Bloomberg with the bulk of its $7.9 billion in revenue in 2012, the Times said.

VICTORIA, British Columbia, June 21 (UPI) -- ExxonMobil is seeking permission to export 30 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually from British Columbia in what is considered the biggest export scheme ever proposed for Canada's West Coast.The company is looking into potential construction sites for a proposed LNG plant in the Kitimat and Prince Rupert areas that would process the equivalent of almost a third of Canada's current daily production, the Financial Post reported.In its export application with Canada's National Energy Board Wednesday, Exxon said the project at first would produce 10 million to 15 million tons of LNG a year, beginning from 2021 to 2023. Gas would be drawn from fields owned by Exxon and its Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd.British energy company BG Group also this week filed an application with the NEB, to export as much as 21.6 million tons of LNG per year from a proposed terminal on Ridley Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.The two proposals come amid a worldwide LNG boom in which the International Energy Agency says global trade in the liquid fuel is expected to increase 31 percent by 2018 from 2012, as new supplies come online.B.C. Premier Christy Clark welcomed the news of the two LNG export applications."Once again we see companies wanting to take advantage of B.C.'s LNG potential and this move today highlights industry's continued interest in its potential," Clark said Thursday in a statement."These applications, if approved by the National Energy Board, show that we are on the verge of new economic opportunities with LNG," said Rich Coleman, Minister of Natural Gas Development. The NEB has issued export licenses to three similar Western Canadian LNG projects: LNG Canada (Shell and co-venture partners); Kitimat LNG (Chevron Corp. and Apache) and the Douglas Channel Energy partnership.But none of those projects have reached final investment decisions to begin construction, The Wall Street Journal reported.Brian Youngberg, an analyst who follows Exxon at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis, said it was not likely all the projects would be built."Right now it's a race to get buyer agreements and permits. With some of the others probably a bit further along in the process, Exxon is playing catch-up here," Youngberg was quoted as saying by the Vancouver Sun.Exxon's application did not disclose the cost for the project. "We're a fair ways away from an investment decision," Imperial Oil representative Pius Rolheiser was quoted as saying by the Vancouver Sun. "We'll make that decision after we get government regulatory approvals and determine contracts and relationships with customers and suppliers and a variety of other factors."

NEW DELHI, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- India's Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. is building 42 more Russian Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft for the Indian military.The deal between HAL, the Ministry of Defense and Russia's Rosoboronexport was signed just ahead of a visit to India by Russian President Vladimir Putin."HAL's total responsibility for this supersonic multirole aircraft has now gone up to 222," said HAL Chairman R. K. Tyagi. "This will further boost our confidence and operations as we have already delivered 119 Su-30 aircraft to the air force."We will continue to contribute to the country's defense preparedness."The twin-seat Su-30 MKI has a maximum speed of 1,320 miles per hour at altitude (839 mph near ground level) and a service ceiling of more than 58,000 feet. It is a variant of the Sukhoi Su-30 and was specifically developed for India.HAL said 157 Indian vendors are involved in providing 13,350 components of the aircraft and that HAL divisions produce another 19,450 components for the plane."The Su-30 MKI project provides solid platform to indigenous manufacturing and technical competence creating hundreds of direct and indirect jobs," the company said. "HAL's hand-holding with private entrepreneurs has also ensured creation of strong infrastructure and quality avionics products."

| License Photo	Aug. 12 (UPI) -- Sick and tired of being ignored all the time, one middle child from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has started the International Middle Child Union to raise awareness of the little-known holiday that comes around every August 12."Our whole lives, middle children crave attention, but we're always ignored, so it's typical that someone would give us a holiday just so they could ignore it," said middle child and former advertising executive Bruce Hopman.Middle Child's Day is a real holiday, though most don't know it. "You can barely find it, let alone the origins of it," Hopman said.The founder and sole member of the IMCU wants middle children everywhere to use the hashtag #midkidstrike on their social media accounts on Middle Child's Day.Hopman says while they're at it they should change their Facebook profile pictures for the day to show famous middle children like Lady Edith from "Downton Abbey," Bill Gates, Madonna or Malcolm from "Malcolm in the Middle.""You know, like they do for other really important causes, like Supreme Court rulings," he said.The comical IMCU bears the slogan "We are SO screwed!," and Hopman, 56, has gathered a small following of middle children who appreciate his efforts.Author of the as yet unpublished "Smack Dab: A Middle Child's Story," Hopman also runs a Smack Dab blog, where he has several humorous greeting cards for the middle child you almost forgot on Middle Child's Day.One features a child in a cape and aviator glasses with a shirt that reads, "Please notice me!" The e-card reads "Sorry we can't be with you on Middle Child's Day. We're having dinner with your brother and sister."Hopman wasn't able to avoid his passing on his own plight, however. The father of three says he is keenly aware of the needs of his middle child, who is also his only daughter.He also tweets @MidKidMusings where he has more than 4,500 followers. Fellow middle children appreciate his work building self-esteem among the oft-ignored group. "If we don't pick ourselves up," Hopman said, "who will?"

RIVERSIDE, Calif., April 8 (UPI) -- Mike Soubirous, a Riverside, Calif., council candidate, has posted comments on the municipal Facebook page and says the city cannot remove his opinions.Soubirous, running for the Ward 3 Council seat in a June election, created a campaign Facebook page and used it to post comments and invitations for readers to click "like" on other posts on the city's Facebook page, The (Riverside) Press-Enterprise reported Monday.Although he was advised by City Clerk Colleen Nicol his posts would be removed because state law forbids use of public resources for campaign activity, Soubirous said to him "social media is for promoting not only your business ... [but] your political status. To me [the city's page] was open and fair game because it's there.""The city doesn't support individual candidates," Nicol said of the post entitled "Mike Soubirous for Riverside City Council, Ward 3." "The name itself was a statement of support for him as a candidate."Jonathan Reichental, chief information officer of Palo Alto noted he tends to believe a city's Facebook page is a public resource, maintained by municipal employees."I would not be surprised if we see more and more of these dilemmas. A lot of what we're seeing in terms of technology is moving faster than policy," he said.

| License Photo	June 19 (UPI) -- Miami Heat forward LeBron James got an unexpected makeover during the fourth quarter of the NBA Finals game 6 Tuesday as his headband fell to the ground during a dunk. James's staple headband has become something of an NBA inside joke as fans have witnessed how the player has moved it back throughout his career as he "attempts to hide a receding hairline." But last night with 8:59 minutes left in the fourth quarter, Tim Duncan knocked the band off James's head during a dunk and he was forced to finish the game without the accessory. Many fans and sports aficionados took to Twitter to point out how naked the player looked without his headband. Others simply dubbed the game -- the result of which forced game 7 -- the "LeBron Headband Game." Here are some of the comments: Please put the headband back on, LeBron. It's like you're naked. I feel like I'm supposed to avert my eyes.— SBNation NBA (@SBNationNBA) June 19, 2013
If I'm Pop I call a timeout just to allow LeBron to put the headband back on.— Tom Fornelli (@TomFornelli) June 19, 2013
Maybe the headband was actually LeBron's kryptonite?— PTI (@PTI) June 19, 2013
Man, Lebron looks weird without his headband. #NBAfinals— Robert Flores (@RoFloESPN) June 19, 2013
LEBRON HEADBAND GAME— Brian Floyd (@BrianMFloyd) June 19, 2013
So here's the real question going forward: Headband or No Headband for Game 7?— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) June 19, 2013
Wow. I thought it was Jerry. Stack house. But it's Lebron without a headband— Metta World Peace (@MettaWorldPeace) June 19, 2013

SEOUL, April 9 (UPI) -- South Korean lawmakers said Tuesday that sending U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to North Korea may be a good way to ease ongoing tensions.The North Korean government accused the South Korean and U.S. governments of "watching for a chance to start war," the Yonhap news agency in South Korea reports. North Korea is said to be preparing some form of missile launch in the coming days as tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalate. Japan deployed its Patriot missile systems as a defensive measure against any such launch that would cross its territory.North Korea reacted angrily to a U.N. Security Council resolution that censured its February underground test of a nuclear device. The North Korean government said the test was part of a campaign against the United States.Interim leader of the opposition Democratic Unity Party, Rep. Moon Hee-sang, was quoted by Yonhap as saying the U.N. secretary-general was a good candidate to try to broker some kind of deal with the north.A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity that "Ban's visit to the North would allow the communist country to find a kind of exit strategy in a relatively easy fashion."Ban said Monday from The Hague he was "urging the (the North Korean government) to refrain from taking any further provocative measures."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 (UPI) -- The Israeli ambassador to the United States said Sunday his country had drawn a "red line" against Syrian chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands.Appearing on "Fox News Sunday," Ambassador Michael Oren said that while Syrian President Bashar Assad was "reckless and irresponsible and ruthless," a bigger threat to regional stability would be allowing al-Qaida and its ilk to get their hands on Assad's chemical weapons arsenal."Can you imagine if Hezbollah, with its 70,000 rockets, got its hands on chemical weapons that could kill thousands of people," Oren said.The ambassador declined to comment on media reports Israeli intelligence had agents inside Syria monitoring the chemical-weapons situation. He said, however, Israel was aware of what was going on and had drawn a "red line" in terms of weapons falling into the wrong hands."The jihadist presence is big and getting bigger," Oren said. "And the longer the conflict goes on there, the bigger it will get."
