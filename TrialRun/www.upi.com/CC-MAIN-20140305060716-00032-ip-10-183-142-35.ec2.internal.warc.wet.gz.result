WASHINGTON, May 17 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was requesting a funding increase to investigate hydraulic fracturing technologies.The EPA said it made a budget request of $8.3 billion for fiscal year 2013. About 10 percent of the budget would target science and technology funding.EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told a U.S. Senate appropriations committee that part of the $807 million in funding for research includes hydraulic fracturing.Hydraulic fracturing uses water mixed with abrasives and chemicals to coax oil and natural gas out of rock formations deep underground. The method is controversial because of the perceived threats to the environment."This budget continues EPA's ongoing congressionally directed hydraulic fracturing study, which we have taken great steps to ensure is independent, peer reviewed and based on strong and scientifically defensible data," said Jackson in prepared remarks.U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, ranking member on the appropriations committee, said she was concerned the EPA was making assumptions about the dangers of hydraulic fracturing.Critics of U.S. President Barack Obama's domestic energy policy have said the EPA was overreaching in its oversight of the oil and natural gas industry.The United States has some of the richest deposits of shale natural gas in the world.

PARIS, June 20 (UPI) -- It might be game, set and match for Barack Obama, but the United States is still not out of domestic political turmoil. In international affairs the United States is worryingly out of the political loop. Halfway through 2008, here are my thoughts on some political happenings. In the United States the primaries are over, but the selection of a vice president -- both for the Republicans and Democrats -- will not be an easy task. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., must deal with his own party's religious-political right and pick someone youngish and economically oriented. Sen. Obama, D-Ill., must grapple with the Hillary factor and pick someone who exudes gravitas and brings defense and international parlance.Only a handful of states are up for grabs in the general election. Of those five to seven states, the majority are centrist, working-class, in trouble economically and distrusting of change. The race is too close to call. In Poland the government is not at all sure it wants to support the Missile Defense Shield. Now the United States is approaching Lithuania. In February the talented tandem of Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski and Polish Undersecretary of State Ryszard Schnepf hosted the Global Panel/Prague Society 7th North Korea Initiative. Many of the ideas now being publicly advocated by the United States were proposed then. The cornerstone of Global Panel's strategy is the 500 billion euro North Korea/Korean Peninsula Investment Fund to be grown now but used in the future. It belongs to a series of strategies Global Panel has advocated off-the-record for years. The Poles often have played a behind-the-scenes role in negotiating these difficult issues. I think the Poles are right in questioning the shield in its current form. The fact that the United States should now approach Lithuania shows the current administration uses its allies as pawns to be used and thrown away at will. It is a disturbing trend that has gone on for eight years and it must end -- no matter who takes the U.S. presidency in November.In Germany political party Die Linke (The Left) again has backed the former premier of the state of Saarland as its leader, albeit with a severely reduced majority. Oskar Lafontaine was Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's finance minister early on, before he was dumped for being disloyal. He left the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, and formed a political party to its left with disaffected Social Democrats and former members of the East German Communist Party, or SED/PDS. Lafontaine already had danced around with the communists for years. He saw nothing wrong with publicly complimenting Erich Honecker, the last DDR leader, on official visits to the East. The vice chairs and leadership are linked to the former Stasi (East German Secret Police) -- so is much of the party; the former Social Democrats in Die Linke are not too happy with this. Die Linke has made it nearly impossible to form a centrist coalition in Germany because they are siphoning off votes. Kurt Beck, the current SPD leader, has not shied away from suggesting he would be prepared to form a coalition with Die Linke; the right of the SPD desperately wants to dump Beck. Next year there are elections in Germany. Die Linke is currently at 11 percent in the polls, and the SPD is disastrously weakened at 20 percent.In Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is stealing the elections. In tactics right out of the fascist handbook, he is intimidating, imprisoning, torturing and murdering his opponents. All of this is happening under the watchful eye of the West, which is doing too little too late to stop the S.O.B. Meanwhile, African leaders are doing nearly nothing at all. The U.S. ambassador in Zimbabwe, James D. McGee, has been warning this would happen. He now is being threatened by the Zimbabwean government. Luckily, he is not easily intimidated. Morgan Tsvangirai and his supporters fight on under the threat of death. It is high time to get rid of Mugabe and his thugs -- using any means necessary.In Serbia the Western-oriented parties have been doing everything to give control to the nationalist and pro-Russian parties. There might now be a breakthrough brokered by Western diplomats that would enable the pro-West faction to put aside egos and govern together. Unfortunately, it is the same egos that enabled Slobodan Milosevic to govern for years before he was arrested. Prime Minister Zoran Djindic paid for his courage with his life. Serbians are a complicated and proud people. I have known many of their leaders. As a European-based U.S. citizen, I know Serbs want and deserve better. It lies within Serbia's grasp to give success to itself. Threatening Western diplomats will do nothing but turn Serbia's allies against it. Do not let success slip out of your grasp. Tensions between Georgia and Russia continue because of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. World governments would be wrong to underestimate the will of the Georgians to keep these areas, nor the will of the Russians to help them stay separate. It is one of the real powder kegs facing international politics. The United States and European Union need to develop a strategy -- quickly!In Nepal an ancient monarchy has been abolished by an elected parliament. It remains to be seen if that will bring stability. China's tensions with Tibet continue, and it is not clear governments know how to deal with this issue either. Having just landed in Prague, I will take 24 hours before leaving for London.I doubt governments will solve any of their problems over the weekend.--(UPI International Columnist Marc S. Ellenbogen is chairman of the Berlin, Copenhagen and Sydney-based Global Panel Foundation. A venture capitalist who straddles the continents, he is president of the Prague Society for International Cooperation.)

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 19 (UPI) -- One-in-5 employees age 45-74 say they expect to take time off of work to care for a spouse, a parent or relative in the next five years, AARP officials say. An AARP report, "Keeping Up with the Times: Supporting Family Caregivers with Workplace Leave Policies," also said 1-in-4 retirees said they left the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill spouse or other family member. "The aging of the population, changing workforce demographics and increasing demands on family caregivers are colliding at the expense of working caregivers," Lynn Feinberg, senior strategic policy adviser with the AARP Public Policy Institute and author of the report, said in a statement. "Even as workforce participation and caregiving demands are increasing for caregivers, workplace policies protecting or supporting them have remained stagnant." Close to 3-of-4 women of prime caregiving age are in the workforce and 74 percent of adults with eldercare responsibilities have been in the workforce at some point in their caregiving, the report said. The Family and Medical Leave Act limits leave for caregiving for elderly relatives to parents or spouses, effectively excluding those caring for in-laws, grandparents, or aunts and uncles. In addition, because FMLA leave is unpaid, it is irrelevant to many low-income workers and it is totally unavailable to those working for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Nearly two-thirds of workers eligible for FMLA who didn't take it reported they couldn't afford to take unpaid leave or were afraid of losing their job, Feinberg said. Unpaid family and medical leave, paid family and medical leave insurance and earned sick time could ease the burden on both caregivers and employers.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- Los Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick will be out 6-to-8 weeks with a broken hand and a torn elbow ligament, the team said Sunday. Redick, averaging a career-best 15.8 points per game over 17 games with the Clippers this season, sustained a fractured bone in his right hand as well as a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during Friday's win over Sacramento. The 3-point specialist was hurt in the second quarter of the game when he collided with Kings center DeMarcus Cousins in midair and fell hard onto the court.Redick came to Pacific Division-leading Los Angeles from Milwaukee in an offseason trade.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- President Bush Thursday nominated Republican Mike Johanns, a two-term Nebraska governor, as secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture."I've known Mike a number of years ... Governor Johanns is a man of action and a man of complete integrity," Bush said in announcing his nominee.If approved by the Senate, Johanns would succeed Ann Veneman as 28th secretary of the USDA. Veneman originally had said she was interested in continuing her post within the Bush administration, but announced her resignation Nov. 12. Johanns thanked Bush for the opportunity and added he looked forward to working to promote the administration's agenda."It is a privilege for me to be nominated to serve in your Cabinet," he said in the White House nomination ceremony. "I have enormous respect for you and for the work that you are doing for our country."

WASHINGTON, April 30 (UPI) -- The woman dubbed the D.C. Madam said Monday she's "genuinely sorry" for a customer who resigned his high-level job in the Bush administration.Former Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias gave up his job last week after being asked about Deborah Jean Palfrey's high-priced escort service by ABC News. Tobias said he "had some gals come over to the condo for a massage" but there was no sex involved, ABC News said."I unfortunately know first-hand the impact such a revelation can have upon one's life," Deborah Jean Palfrey, 50, said Monday.Palfrey, who is facing federal charges, denies her escort service offered sexual favors to her thousands of customers during the 13 years she ran Pamela Martin & Associates, MSNBC News reported.Palfrey's alleged prostitution service allegedly involved scores of women who kept half of the fees and mailed the rest to her, authorities allege. No date had been set for her trial.Two weeks ago, Palfrey alleged that Harlan K. Ullman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies also was a customer. Ullman responded that the allegation was "beneath the dignity of comment," ABC said.

MOSCOW, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- A close adviser to the Russian president said the Kremlin was paying close attention to "events" in former republics of the Soviet Union.Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council of Russia, said the Kremlin is keeping a close eye on potential "color revolutions" in former republics."Events are in motion in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Ukraine; we're dealing with it every day. Are these (events) a danger for us? Yes," he was quoted by state-run news agency RIA Novosti as saying.A series of revolutions in former republics Georgia and Ukraine during the early part of the 2000s brought in new governments that upset status quo relationships with Moscow.Russia has witnessed growing frustration with Putin's hold on power. He was re-elected to a third non-consecutive term as president this year in elections considered by some observers to be fraudulent.The Kremlin last week expressed frustration with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said Russian efforts to create a Eurasian trade bloc were tantamount to a move to "re-Sovietize" Eastern Europe and Central Asia.The European government recently launched an anti-trust investigation into Russian energy contracts in the region.

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 27 (UPI) -- Lebanon must take responsibility for ensuring its own security but it needs support from the international community, the British foreign secretary said.Foreign ministers gathered to discuss Lebanon's security Thursday from the sidelines of the 68th session of the U.N. General Assembly following the end of the general debate.Lebanon's security is jeopardized by civil war raging in neighboring Syria. A series of recent bombings inside Lebanese territory were seen as a response to Hezbollah's support for pro-government forces in Syria.British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Lebanon needs help with addressing the influx of Syrian refugees and support on the national security front. Its commitment to national security must include a "policy of disassociation from the Syrian conflict," he said in a statement.The U.S. Defense Department confirmed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman during Thursday's conference. The U.S. government has expressed frustration with Hezbollah's meddling in Syrian affairs.Suleiman told the U.N. General Assembly his country needed support from its allies "to face the negative repercussions of the external conflicts.""There is no doubt that Lebanon's stability is in all of our interests, but we must invest in that stability," added Hague.

MOBILE, Ala., April 24 (UPI) -- The severe beating of a Mobile, Ala., man by a group of adults after he reprimanded some boys over a basketball game had racial overtones, his sister said.Mobile police spokesman Cpl. Christopher Levy said the victim, 40, went outside his home Saturday and spoke to the boys, who were playing basketball in the street, the Mobile Press-Register reported Monday. The boys left but soon after a large group of people, including adults and children, went to the man's house and confronted him, Levy said.Matthew Owens, hospitalized in critical condition, was beaten so brutally that he hasn't been able to identify or describe his assailants, Levy said. No arrests had been made. The race of the victim, the youths and the other adults wasn't provided in several media accounts."The victim had approached the kids that were playing basketball in the street and fussed at them about playing basketball," Levy said. "After they left, what is believed to be a number of adults came back and assaulted our victim with pipes, paint cans and some chairs."Levy said police still were trying to determine what happened Saturday, WKRG-TV, Mobile, reported.Levy said the confrontation was "one of those situations where there was a ton of people there, but for some reason, not a lot of details were given to investigators that night. So we're hoping somebody knows what happened. We're hoping someone will come forward and give us that information."WKRG also reported the victim's sister said she heard one person say "now that's justice for Trayvon" Martin, the unarmed black teen shot and killed in February by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla.WPMI-TV, Mobile, said Owens' friends and family said tension had been building before the attack, mainly over basketball being played on the residential street. They said there had been other confrontations and racially charged comments by several people have made the situation more volatile.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 10 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama put Medicare and Social Security back on the table, along with funding universal pre-kindergarten in his version of the budget.Obama revealed his 10-year budget blueprint Wednesday that would seek nearly $250 billion in new spending for jobs, infrastructure and expanded pre-school education and nearly $800 billion in new taxes, including an additional tax on cigarettes.Obama's plan also would cut more than a trillion dollars from federal programs as well, and includes targeting Social Security benefits, a first."Our economy is poised for progress, as long as Washington doesn't get in the way," Obama said when introducing his spending plan, saying his budget represents "a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle-class jobs and growth" that won't "add a dime" to the deficits.His budget document would build on the $2.5 trillion in deficit-reduction measures already signed into law by reducing U.S. deficits by nearly an additional $2 trillion so that "all-told, we will have surpassed the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that independent economists believe we need to stabilize our finances, but it does so in a balanced and responsible way -- a way that most Americans prefer," Obama said.House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, noted the lower chamber passed a balanced budget "that will help foster a healthier economy and to help create jobs. Unfortunately, the president's budget never comes to balance. Every family has to balance its budget, Washington should as well."While Obama "backtracked" on some of his entitlement reforms under discussion 18 months ago, "he does deserve some credit for some incremental entitlement reforms that he has outlined in his budget," Boehner said. "But I would hope that he would not hold hostage these modest reforms for his demand for bigger tax hikes. ... The president got his tax hikes in January; we don't need to be raising taxes on the American people."To attract new jobs to America, Obama said his budget would invest in new manufacturing hubs, innovation and research. Investments also would be made to help the country achieve energy independence and address climate change."And I'll rebuild America partnership that will attract private investment to put construction workers back on the job, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, and our schools, in turn, attracting even more new business to communities across the country," the president said echoing comments he made in his State of the Union address.He also included funding to ensure "high-quality pre-school available to every child in America."Obama drew applause when he said it would be paid for by "raising taxes on tobacco products that harm our young people. It's the right thing to do."He also said his budget would "reform" high schools and job-training programs "to equip more Americans with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century economy.""And we'll help more middle-class families afford the rising cost of college," he said."He said his budget would help build "new ladders of opportunity" into the middle class by partnering with 20 communities hit hardest by the recession to help them improve housing, and education and business investment. "My budget also replaces the foolish across-the-board spending cuts that are already hurting our economy," Obama said. "And I have to point out that many of the same members of Congress who supported deep cuts are now the ones complaining about them the loudest, as they hit their own communities."He said his budget "replaces these cuts with smarter ones, making long-term reforms, eliminating actual waste and programs we don't need any more."Obama repeated his vow not to balance the budget by spending cuts alone that hurts the middle class and the economy."When it comes to deficit reduction, I've already met Republicans more than halfway," Obama said. "So, in the coming days and weeks, I hope that Republicans will come forward and demonstrate that they're really as serious -- as serious about the deficits and debt as they claim to be."Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, called Obama's budget one "that doesn't balance.""I'm a numbers guy," Walden said on CNN, "and this doesn't add up."Obama's budget was submitted "65 days late and it doesn't add up," he said, referring to the Feb. 4 deadline Obama missed to submit his budget.

LONDON, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has decreed the children of the duke and duchess of Cambridge, aka Prince William and Kate Middleton, will be royal highnesses. In "Letters Patent Under the Great Seal of the Realm" dated Dec. 31, the queen said her great-grandchildren will have "the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names," The Daily Telegraph reported. They will be entitled to be formally addressed as "your Royal Highness."The queen's decree was published Wednesday in the Royal Gazette. Under a 1917 decree by her grandfather, George V, only the oldest son of the prince of Wales is automatically entitled to the rank of prince at birth. The royal succession is currently in a state of flux with Britain and the Commonwealth countries that have the British monarch as head of state agreeing to make the process gender neutral. If the duchess's first child is a daughter, she has a good chance of becoming queen. Wednesday was also the duchess's 31st birthday. Prince William, taking a day off from his Sea Rescue duties in Wales, celebrated with her in London, the Telegraph said.

| License Photo	April 8 (UPI) -- Glenn Beck opened his Monday morning show with a rant against an MSNBC promo where anchor Melissa Harris talks about children's education."It's almost a parody of reality," Beck said of the clip. "It is so far beyond what we have ever thought as a nation, it's remarkable..."In the ad, Harris explains that children should be thought of in a "collective notion" in which they are "our children." She proposes that people break from the idea that kids belong to their parents and their families and suggests that "kids belong to the community."According to Yahoo news, Beck spent almost an hour discussing the ad on his show explaining how it connects to greater issues that affect today's world. The host said many Americans would love the commercial because they would perceive it as a chance to let the government handle a problem they can't work out on their own: their childrens' education. "I think that there's a good 20 to 30% of America, maybe even higher now, I'm not sure, [that] will gladly have the State take that over so they don't have to worry about it. Yet another one of your responsibilities taken from you -- I'm sorry. Another one of your responsibilities that you will gladly hand over because you don't know what to do. And so they will do it for you: Don't worry! We'll raise your kids. We'll train your kids. We'll educate your kids because it's working out so well."In addition, Beck referred to "the collective" idea mentioned in the promo as a conspiracy theory that is now being taught to children in school. "It's already being implemented with Common Core. It's already been implemented here in Texas with CSCOPE," he said. "You don't have a right to see as a parent what your children are learning. You go to a Texas school and say, 'Let me see the curriculum.' You can't. 'Let me see that test that you are teaching through CSCOPE.' You can't. You're a parent. You don't have a right to know."To summarize, the host said the commercial was basically trying to tell parents their children didn't belong to them, adding that this was a good thing because they were at least "being honest.""I told you there would come a time when they would show you their true colors," Beck said.
