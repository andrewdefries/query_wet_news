LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Market analysts are betting that gasoline prices in the United States may remain in the grips of an early season spike, an oil analyst said.Motor group AAA reports that U.S. commuters paid, on average, $3.60 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, up 30 cents compared to last month and 10 cents higher than the same time last year.Daily price records were reported for California markets, where prices increased 14 cents in one week to more than $4 per gallon.Tom Kloza, an oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, told the Los Angeles Times "there has never been this much money bet on higher gasoline prices this early in the year."Higher crude oil prices and refinery shutdowns may explain some of the increase in prices. The U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration states that crude oil prices are responsible for about 68 percent of the cost of retail gasoline.Bloomberg News reports Brent crude oil futures are up nearly 7 percent for the year on signs of economic recovery in the United States. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in its February report stated that its forecast for world oil demand growth for the year has also been revised higher.Southern Colorado Public Radio reports that a gasoline price spike in the state is outpacing the national average. Despite the increase, commuters there paid, on average, $3.35 for a gallon of regular unleaded, about 25 cents less per gallon than the national average.

| License Photo	June 19 (UPI) -- Miley Cyrus just released her new music video for the single "We Can't Stop." In the video, she is seen kissing a mannequin, wrestling with a female friend and twerking. She wears outfits that could have been pulled straight from an American Apparel catalog -- a pair of onesies, a beanie a la bank robber with an attached birdcage, and several crop tops. The video also features a singing floating head, people wearing giant grand-prize-at-a-carnival-worthy teddy bears strapped to their backs and a beer-bottle piñata filled with cigars.Suffice it to say, the only way to understand the video is to watch it, and assume she's just being Miley.

| License Photo	BOSTON, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- Processed meats -- hot dogs, bacon, ham, hamburger -- are linked to lower amounts of normal sperm in men, U.S. researchers say.Dr. Myriam Afeiche of the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and colleagues said men in sub-fertile couples presenting for evaluation at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center were invited to participate in an ongoing study of environmental factors and fertility.The study involved 156 men -- undergoing in vitro fertilization with a partner -- who provided 364 semen samples and completed a validated food frequency questionnaire. The researchers tested semen samples and adjusted for age, body mass index, abstinence interval, prior fertility evaluation, smoking status, race, caloric intake and dietary patterns.The study found the men who regularly ate processed meat had the lowest amount of normal sperm, compared to the men who ate limited amounts of processed meat. Men who ate the equivalent of less than a serving of of bacon a day had 30 percent more normal sperm than those who ate higher amounts of processed meats, the study said.However, the men who ate white meat fish -- cod, halibut -- were associated with higher amounts of normal sperm. In addition, eating dark meat fish -- salmon, bluefish, tuna -- was related to higher total sperm count, the study said.The findings were published in Fertility and Sterility and presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 16 (UPI) -- A California man whose car was stolen from a carwash said he was relieved when the car was returned with his late wife's ashes still inside.Melvin Hayes, 78, of Sacramento, said his 2011 Ford Fusion contained the ashes of Anamarie Hayes, his wife of 48 years, when it was stolen from an Elk Grove car wash by a woman who posed as an employee, the Sacramento Bee reported Monday."I was more concerned about where my wife's ashes were than with my car," he said. "I wanted to make sure that I gave my wife a proper burial. I was concerned that the ashes would be dumped some place, and that was extremely upsetting to me."Hayes said he received a phone call around 2 a.m. Saturday saying the car had been found and two suspects were arrested. He said he was relieved when he was told 6 hours later the urn containing his wife's ashes was found in the trunk of the car."I don't know why they kept them, but I'm glad that I got the ashes back," he said.Police said Danielle Dorsey, 34, and Antwanne Batten, 35, were jailed on charges of felony vehicle theft and a misdemeanor count of attempting to receive stolen property.Hayes said he will pursue charges against the woman and her accomplice."I am pressing charges but more than anything, I long to see her locked up [for a long time] for all the grief she caused me," he said. "It was a very, very rough time for me."

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- Jay Don Blake grabbed a two-shot lead at the Charles Schwab Cup Championship Saturday, putting himself in position for his second Champions Tour win.The mustachioed Blake fired a 5-under-par 66 for a 54-hole total of 8-under 205. After going 20 years without a professional win, he broke the jinx two months ago at the Songdo IBD Championship in Korea and now is looking for his second title of the season. Second-round co-leader Michael Allen stumbled Saturday with a pair of late bogeys and finished with a 2-under 69, good for 6-under after three rounds. He was knotted with David Frost (70) and Jay Haas (67) in second place.In the race for the Charles Schwab Cup Points championship, Tom Lehman (72) came into the tourney as the leader, with Mark Calcavecchia (70) having a chance to unseat him if he can finished with at least sole possession of second place this weekend.Calcavecchia, however, slipped from fourth to sixth Saturday.

| License Photo	PITTSFORD, N.Y., Aug. 9 (UPI) -- Jason Dufner, despite narrowly missing his chance at golf history Friday, vaulted into a 2-shot lead at the midway point of the PGA Championship.Dufner shot a 7-under 63 at the Oak Hill Country Club, breaking the course record by a shot and recording the 26th such score ever posted at a major championship.Johnny Miller shot the first of those 63's to win the U.S. Open 40 years ago and although the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Gary Player have equaled the mark through the years, no one has been able to break what is one of the most significant records in the annuls of the sport.Dufner reached 7-under for the day by holing a six-foot birdie putt at the par-4 16th and a birdie on either of the final two holes -- the two hardest tests on the course -- would have given him the lowest 18-hole total in the history of major championship golf.He had two excellent chances to shoot a 62, first missing a 20-foot birdie attempt at the 17th that barely slipped by on the left side of the cup. Dufner then put his second shot at the 18th hole to within 12 feet of the hole, but his uphill putt at history came up a foot short."There was a lot of pressure," said Dufner, who lost the PGA title to Keegan Bradley in a playoff two years ago. "I guess I felt it."Nevertheless, his two-day total of 9-under 131 put him two strokes in front of Matt Kuchar and first-round co-leaders Adam Scott and Jim Furyk. Kuchar shot a 66 while both Scott and Furyk had a 68. Scott, who won the Masters in April, is trying to become the first player in five years to win two majors in the same season.U.S. Open winner Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson were tied for fifth at 134 while Steve Stricker and Robert Garrigus finished at 135. Webb Simpson, last year's U.S. Open champ, was among those at 136. Simpson shot a 64 that briefly tied the course record before Dufner did even better.Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, the world's Top 2 players who shared the spotlight coming into the tournament after having pulled off significant achievements in recent days, left themselves needing a sensational round on Saturday to climb into contention.Woods, the winner of last week's Bridgestone Invitational, shot a 70 for a 141 total that tied him for 39th place. Mickelson, who captured the third leg of a career grand slam last month in Scotland, was another shot back after his second straight 71.Rory McIlroy, ranked third in the world, birdied four of the last seven holes to tie Woods at 141.Dufner's round was highlighted by his second shot at the par-4 second, which landed about 15 feet past the hole and spun back into the cup for an eagle. After a light rain had fallen on the early starters, Dufner was able to take advantage of the soft greens to birdie the par-5 fourth and par-4 fifth and made the turn in 4-under.Birdies on the 11th, 13th and 16th gave Dufner his shot at the history book.Dufner burst on the golfing scene with his near-miss at this event in 2010, then shot up the world rankings last year when, in less than two months, he won in New Orleans, got married, won again at the Byron Nelson Classic, finished second at the Colonial Invitation and wound up tied for fourth at the U.S. Open.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 19 (UPI) -- Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah met in Lebanon with Turkish and Qatari officials to address the political crisis in Beirut, Hezbollah said.Nasrallah welcomed the Turkish and Qatari foreign ministers to Lebanon as part of an effort to help mediate the political crisis unfolding in Lebanon."The meeting addressed the current political crisis in Lebanon, notably the issue of the international tribunal and the new government," Hezbollah said in a statement on its al-Manar news station.The ministers met with Nasrallah before official visits with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman and caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri.Hezbollah led an opposition walkout last week that collapsed the fragile unity government while Hariri was visiting with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington.Hezbollah is upset that Hariri is supporting the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is investigating the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.Saudi officials announced they were giving up their efforts to help broker a political settlement to the STL crisis.The tribunal this week handed over a sealed indictment to a pretrial judge but stressed anyone named in the indictment is innocent until proven guilty.Hezbollah, which is suspected to be connected to the assassination, says the STL is part of an Israeli plot.

DETROIT, Feb. 27 (UPI) -- Detroit could run out of money and be unable to pay its employees by April, barring union concessions and other spending cutbacks, city figures reveal.Based on cash-flow stats as of Jan. 27, posted on the city's Web site, Detroit had only $76 million on hand last month and would run out of cash in mid-to-late April, The Detroit News reported Monday.The city has forecast the amount of cash would decline to $55.9 million this month, $42.2 million in March and $2.5 million by early April. "Things are going down, down, down," said Edward Rago, who had served as city budget director under Mayors Coleman A. Young and Dennis Archer. "All the evidence points to the fact that things are bad, they are getting worse, they are going to be negative in eight weeks or so."The city had been forecast to take in $97 million in revenue through the end of January but actual revenue fell $21 million short of projections, the News said.Rago said the budget crunch threatens employees' pay."If you don't have any money, what are you going to pay with? I don't think you can issue bonds for payroll," he said.The News said city officials couldn't be reached for comment on the latest figures.

BERKELEY, Calif., Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Noted U.S. poet Jack Gilbert, beset by dementia years ago, died Tuesday at 87 of complications of pneumonia, friend and fellow poet Bill Mayer said.Gilbert, who was attended by a group of friends when he passed at a nursing home in Berkeley, Calif., gained international acclaim with his 1962 collection of poems "Views of Jeopardy," which won the Yale Younger Poets Prize and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, the Los Angeles Times noted."I think it's fair to say that Jack was America's greatest living poet," Mayer told the Times in a telephone interview. "He was unique in that he was not a part of any [literary] school or group. He went his own way, and he lived pretty much entirely for his life and his art."The newspaper categorized Gilbert as a literary rebel among rebels known as an intimidating personality who made many enemies among the literary establishment."I want poems that matter," the Times quoted him as having said.After "Views of Jeopardy" was published, Gilbert walked away from the public attention, traveling abroad before returning to the United States to teach at San Francisco State and start a poetry workshop.He seldom published any works until "Monolithos" in 1982, which was a Pulitzer finalist. Three more collections, and more awards, followed, though his works haven't found their way into modern anthologies.The Times noted some critics disliked his repeated use of familiar themes such as the moon, the Aegean and women's breasts. But his admirers point to the emotion he brought to bear while writing in a spare and direct style.

PANAMA CITY, Fla., Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Former longtime Florida Democratic Party Chairman Charles Whitehead has died of natural causes, his family said. He was 83.Screven Watson, a Tallahassee political adviser and former party executive director, said his father-in-law died Saturday at his home in Panama City, the Tampa Bay Times reported.The liberal Whitehead, who ran a car dealership in Panama City, led the state's Democratic Party in the 1980s when it enjoyed a run of power and returned to the post in 1999 in an effort to revitalize the flagging party. "He wasn't just a Democrat or a Republican. He was a Floridian -- Mr. Integrity," said Bob Butterworth, a former four-term state attorney general. "He considered his role as party chairman to be a public service. He did it with dignity, grace and professionalism and he made you feel good to be in public service."Whitehead is survived by Betty Feagle, his companion of more than 30 years, the Times said.

Alexander Vladimirovich Rutskoy (Russian: Александр Владимирович Руцкой) (born September 16, 1947) is a Russian politician and a former Soviet military officer. Rutskoy served as the only Vice President of Russia from July 10, 1991 to October 4, 1993, and as the governor of Kursk Oblast from 1996 to 2000. In the course of the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, he was proclaimed acting president of Russia, in opposition to Boris Yeltsin.
Alexander Rutskoy was born in Proskuriv, Ukraine. Rutskoy graduated from High Air Force School in Barnaul (1971) and Gagarin Air Force Academy in Moscow (1980). He had reached rank of Colonel when he was sent to the Soviet war in Afghanistan. He was in command of an air assault regiment and was shot down twice, in 1986 and the second time in 1988 by an F-16 flown by Sqn. Ldr. Athar Bukhari of the Pakistan Air Force. Rutskoy was then flying a Su-25 aircraft and strayed into Pakistani airspace by mistake. He managed to eject but was captured by mujahideen, interrogated by the Inter-Services Intelligence, given an offer to defect by the Central Intelligence Agency, and subsequently released. For his bravery in 1988 he was awarded Hero of the Soviet Union. As a soldier and a populist, he was chosen by Boris Yeltsin to be his vice presidential running mate in the 1991 Russian presidential election.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
