| License Photo	TRIPOLI, Libya, Jan. 25 (UPI) -- Two major oil companies in Libya say they expect to restore their pre-war production levels by the end of the month, just in time to help pick up the slack for energy-hungry Europe if Persian Gulf crude supplies are cut off in the confrontation between Iran and the West.Other firms make equally optimistic forecasts as damage to the oil industry is repaired.But the security situation in the North African state five months after the overthrow and death of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi remains as precarious as it is in the gulf.That could adversely affect oil production."With Iran threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz to oil shipped from the gulf, Libya's oil takes on increasing geopolitical importance," Oxford Analytica observed Tuesday."Security is key to production increases but oil revenue is key to achieving stability."While the situation in the oil fields seems to be fairly secure, in the cities it is more uncertain. Many former rebel fighters are still armed and the process of forming a national security force is moving forward slowly."The government is in desperate need of funds to stabilize the country and has, in its oil industry, a major potential source," the analysis noted."However, the country also has a major unemployment problem, with almost a quarter of the population out of work."Political tensions in Libya will remain until oil revenues increase, providing the funds for infrastructure projects necessary to provide employment."Libya has oil reserves of 46.4 billion barrels, the largest in Africa.The rebel alliance that drove Gadhafi from power in an eight-month revolution in 2011 has splintered and several militias, based on particular clans and regions, remain heavily armed.They have repeatedly clashed with each other and the new interim government, the Western-backed National Transitional Council.It was plunged into crisis this week when mass protests broke out in Benghazi over the close ties some NTC officials had with Gadhafi's regime.Gadhafi loyalists have reappeared recently and fought gun battles with NTC forces. The marauding militias, vying for influence and power in the post-Gadhafi era, have become the biggest threat to security and stability as the NTC struggles to exert its authority.The militias are scaring foreign oil companies into delaying the return of their technicians who are vital to keeping the oil industry functioning."We're now between two bitter options," NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil declared in Benghazi recently. "We deal with these violations strictly … or we split and there will be a civil war."The combination of Libya's location on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and its "sweet" oil -- light and low in sulfur content, which makes it easy to process -- has made it attractive to consumers, particularly refineries in carbon-conscious Europe.And with Europe facing the loss of around 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day following the European Union's decision Monday to impose an oil embargo on Iran over its contentious nuclear program, Libyan oil is all the more attractive to EU states."In the light of Iran's threatening stance over the Strait of Hormuz … the relative strategic value of Libyan crude is increased, given its location outside the gulf," Oxford Analytica noted.Tehran has threatened to close the narrow, 112-mile strait at the southern end of the gulf through which one-fifth of the world's oil supply passes daily, if the United States and the EU enforces the oil embargo.U.S. President Barack Obama approved a campaign to choke off Iran's oil exports, which supplies some 80 percent of its state revenues, on Dec. 31.When Gadhafi was toppled, oil production had fallen from the pre-conflict level of 1.6 million barrels per day to less than 100,000 bpd. Since then the Libyans have built that back to 1 million bpd, months earlier than expected.Industry analysts say raising production further could prove to be technically challenging, even though output was 3 million bpd before Gadhafi seized power in 1969 and ran down the industry."The unstable security situation and weak central government are also likely to hinder the recovery," one commented."Foreign oil companies will also face uncertainty over possible changes to existing contracts and modification to the oil law until an elected government takes over," Oxford Analytica noted.

Upsets in the first major races of the year for older horses shared the spotlight during the weekend with some early Kentucky Derby preps.The day's biggest shocker was the $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park where Spring At Last held on to win by 1/2 length over A.P. Arrow while the odds-on favorite, Daaher, faded badly in the stretch to finish seventh of eight.The victory by Spring At Last wasn't surprising in itself. The 5-year-old son of Silver Deputy won the Godolphin Mile in Dubai last spring -- and may be headed back there in two months for a repeat engagement. But after that, the Kentucky-bred went to the sidelines with an ankle chip, returning with a victory in an optional claimer in late December in California.Saturday, Eibar Coa took Spring At Last back as Daaher set a pressured pace. Coa then steered outside at the quarter pole to take the lead, opened a clear advantage and held on. He ran the 9 furlongs on a fast track in 1:48.35.Winning trainer Doug O'Neill said the victory at 9 furlongs opens the door to other opportunities for Spring At Last. "We all needed to see that before he stamped himself a classic distance horse," O'Neill said from California where he saddled a pair of unsuccessful runners Saturday. "When he trains in the morning, he doesn't get tired. But there are a lot of horses like that. When you put them in the afternoon, they don't hold up under the competition."O'Neill and Elliott Walden, vice president of the breeder and co-owner, WinStar Farm, said it remains to be decided whether Spring At Last will be pointed back to the Godolphin Mile or attempt the 1 1/4-mile Dubai World Cup.Kiaran McLaughlin, trainer of Daaher, who won his last three races in 2007, including the Jerome and the Cigar Mile, said his steed's performance was "very disappointing. It's obvious that something went wrong. The jock said it felt like he overheated." But he said Daaher appeared okay after the race, adding, "Hopefully, we'll live to fight another day."Across the continent in Saturday's $300,000 Strub Stakes for 4-year-olds at Santa Anita, Monterey Jazz led all the way to a mild upset of even-money favorite Tiago, who came from last in the eight-horse field but could get no closer than 4 1/2 lengths at the finish. Monzante was third.Monterey Jazz, a Kentucky-bred colt by Thunderello, ran the 9 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:45.65 under David Flores. Craig Dollase trains the colt, who won his third straight and second straight graded stakes."He's really improved immensely," Dollase said, "and hopefully, we've got some bigger and better races down the road."John Shirreffs, trainer of Tiago, said his horse "ran good." But he added, referring to Monterey Jazz, "Somebody let the tiger out on that one, huh?"Both are likely candidates for the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap on March 1.Kentucky Derby preps:-- Crown of Thorns pulled rider Victor Espinoza into contention along the backstretch in Saturday's $200,000 Robert B. Lewis Stakes at Santa Anita, got past the leader along the inside on the turn and drew off handily to win by 2 1/2 lengths over Coast Guard. Reflect Times finished third. Crown of Thorns, a Florida-bred son of Repent, ran 1 1/16 miles on the all-weather track in 1:40.76. Richard Mandella trains Crown of Thorns, who was coming off his maiden victory on New Year's Day. He now is 2-for-3 in his career. Asked what might be next for Crown of Thorns, Mandella said, "Maybe the Sham (March 1) and then the Santa Anita Derby (April 5)." Espinoza said the colt "is getting better with every race and he can do anything."-- After a very slow pace, Barrier Reef and Roman Emperor turned for home in Saturday's $100,000 Whirlaway Stakes at Aqueduct locked in a tight duel. Barrier Reef, with outside position, got a head in front and Roman Emperor could never recover, with Barrier Reef eventually winning by a 1/2 length. Texas Wildcatter finished third with a mild late bid while the favorite in a contentious field, Cave's Valley, never ran much and finished next-last of seven. Barrier Reef, a Kentucky-bred colt by Mizzen Mast, ran the 1 mile in 1:44.47 under Alan Garcia. Thomas Albertrani trains for Darley Stable. Barrier Reef came into the race off a fourth-place finish behind undefeated Giant Moon in the Count Fleet a month earlier. He now has won two of four starts. "He trained a lot better going into this race," Albertrani said. "He was really on his game in his last couple of works. He was always on the bridle." Both Barrier Reef and Roman Emperor are likely to contest the Gotham Stakes on March 8, the last local prep for the Wood Memorial.-- Eaton's Gift jumped quickly to the lead in Saturday's $150,000 Swale Stakes at Gulfstream Park and kept running, winning by 3 1/2 lengths over extreme longshot Surrealdeal. Wincat, the favorite, was another neck farther back in third. Eaton's Gift, a Kentucky-bred colt by Johnannesburg, ran 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15.63 with Kent Desormeaux up for trainer Dale Romans. Eaton's Gift had won two straight sprints before fading badly at 1 1/16 mile in his last start, the Hollywood Futurity. Romans said he's not sure where Eaton's Gift will go next. "When you have a fast 3-year-old at this time of the year, you always think about stretching them out," he said.-- Big Glen rallied from well back in a 10-horse field to win Saturday's $50,000 WEBN Stakes at Turfway Park in Northern Kentucky. Your Round also came from behind the moderate pace to take second with early leader Mr. Harry hanging on for show money. The favorite, U.S. Cavalry, winner of the Turfway Prevue in his last outing, raced close to the lead all the way but lacked a late punch and settled for fourth. Big Glen, a Kentucky-bred colt by Cactus Ridge, ran the 1 mile in 1:38.48 on the all-weather track. James Lopez rode for trainer Frank Brothers. -- Vanderkaay rallied from far back to upset Saturday's $50,000 Dancing Count Stakes at Laurel Park in Maryland, winning by 2 3/4 lengths over Ghostly Thunder. Vigors Storm was third. Vanderkaay, a Kentucky-bred colt by Malibu Moon, finished the 6 furlongs on a "good" track in 1:10.7 with 19-year-old Rosie Napravnik up. "We have been treating this horse like a come-front-behind sprinter," said winning trainer Ferris Allen. "We were more than happy there was speed in this race."-- Doble Quebrado battled head-to-head with Pantara Phantom most of the way around in Saturday night's $125,000 Premier Night Prince Stakes for Louisiana-breds, winning by a head with a late surge. Cubera was third under the wire. Doble Quebrado, a gelded son of Ide, ran the 7 furlongs in 1:27.29 with Cody Meche aboard.Kentucky Oaks preps-- Passion battled for the lead in Saturday's $100,000 La Habra Stakes at Santa Anita, got to the front halfway down the hillside turf course, then battled through the stretch to hold off Ariege and win by a nose. Sweet August Moon was third. Passion, a Kentucky-bred daughter of Came Home, got the "about" 6 1/2 furlongs down the firm course in 1:13.52 with Rafael Bejarano in the irons. Todd Pletcher trains the winner for the Tabor-Magnier-Smith combine. "I rode the best horse in the race," Bejarano said. "She broke sharp but she relaxed real well. I think that's the key with this race (down the hillside turf course.)"-- Love Co was quickly on the lead in Sunday's $65,000 Glory in Motion Stakes at Aqueduct, opened up a 15-length lead and won by 12 3/4 lengths without being asked for her best. Philly Gal was second and Deities Day finished third. Love Co, a New York-bred daughter of Not For Love out of the Cozzene mare Cozzekiki, ran 1 mile and 70 yards on the fast inner track in 1:42.43 for jockey Ramon Dominguez.-- Superior Storm led from gate to wire in winning Saturday night's $125,000 Premier Night Starlet Stakes for Louisiana-bred fillies at Delta Downs.

She ran the 7 furlongs on a fast track in 1:26.58.In other weekend racing:InternationalTrainer Saeed bin Suroor's four winners on a seven-race card Thursday at Nad al-Sheba in Dubai overshadowed the feature race -- the $200,000 al-Rashidiya, seen as a potential springboard to the $5 million Dubai Duty Free on World Cup night March 29. Bin Suroor captured both ends of Thursday's 1,600-meter turf handicap and both the 1,600-meter and the 2,000-meter dirt races. "We have a much bigger string than in previous years," the winning trainer allowed. "And the horses are simply better than last year." In the al-Rashidiya, however, it was long-time Dubai Carnival workhorse Lord Admiral first across the line in a bit of an upset. Winning trainer Charles O'Brien, son of former Irish conditioner Vincent O'Brien, said Lord Admiral likely will be less ambitiously placed than the Duty Free for his next start. "We'll have a look at the al-Fahidi Fort or Jebel Hatta next," he said.Santa AnitaIntangaroo rallied three-wide into the stretch and was just up at the wire to post a huge upset in Saturday's $250,000 Santa Monica Handicap, winning by a nose over Society Hostess. Overly Tempting was third and the heavy odds-on favorite, Hystericalady, faded to finish fourth. Hystericalady was making her first start since losing the Breeders' Cup Distaff by a nose to Ginger Punch last October at Monmouth Park and took some bridge-jumper money with her Saturday, inflating show payoffs for those who hit the board. Intangaroo, making her first start out of the allowance ranks, ran the 7 furlongs on the all-weather track in 1:20.71 under Alonso Quinonez. "We were running for third," admitted winning trainer Gary Sherlock. "She's a nice filly and I would have been happy to hit the board." It was the first Grade I win for both trainer and rider.Storm Military led most of the way in winning Saturday's $75,000 Thunder Road Handicap by 3 lengths over Mr Napper Tandy. Frank the Barber finished third. Storm Military, a 6-year-old, Argentine-bred son of Bernstein, set a quick pace, was headed on the turn and then quickly drew clear again. With Garrett Gomez riding, Storm Military finished the 1 mile on firm turf in 1:34.17.Gulfstream ParkSunday, Green Girl had a rough trip in the $100,000 Suwannee River Handicap for fillies and mares but then managed to win a four-horse cavalry charge to the wire. As the photo was snapped, the 6-year-old, French-bred daughter of Green Sails was 1/2 length in front, with La Dolce Vita second and the favorite, J'ray, just a nose farther behind in third. Green Girl, with Rene Douglas up, ran the 9 furlongs on firm turf in 1:46.46.Philadelphia ParkJet Away Jane just caught pace-setting favorite S W Aly'svalentine in the final jumps of Saturday's $75,000 Foxy J.G.S Stakes, winning by a neck. Coffee Shop finished third. Jet Away Jane, a 5-year-old, Pennsylvania-bred mare by Unbridled Jet, got the 6 furlongs in 1:10.85 with Angel Rodriguez in the irons.Marina Ballerina led from gate to wire in Saturday's $65,000 Manatee Stakes for fillies and mares, winning by 1 length over Meredith Bee.

Amazing Results, an Illinois-bred colt by Grand Slam, ran the "about" 5 1/2 furlongs on "good" turf in 1:06.12. Julien Leparoux rode for trainer Richard Scherer and owners Team Block.Oaklawn ParkSemaphore Man led from the start and won the $50,000 King Cotton Stakes by 2 3/4 lengths over Junior College, the favorite.

BAMAKO, Mali, Jan. 8 (UPI) -- A Malian defense official said the military was engaged with Islamic rebels who have moved close to the south of the country, under civilian control.Foreign fighters and Islamic rebels, some of whom are aligned with al-Qaida, claimed authority over northern Mali last year following political upheaval in the nation's capital, Bamako.Military sources were cited by the BBC as saying on background that government forces fired "warning shots" on unknown Islamic fighters who were making their way south.Malian Defense Minister Col. Yamoussa Camara told Radio France International that "jihadist elements" had deployed along a de facto north-south line.The U.N. Security Council has approved an African force for deployment to Mali to help ensure territorial integrity in the country. Salamatu Suleiman, head of political affairs of the Economic Community of West African Affairs, said last month the regional bloc was losing patience with Malian developments.Dialogue is the preferred course of action, though "some of the elements involved in the crisis are not amenable to dialogue," she said in a statement.Some rebel movements have agreed to peace talks set for this week in Burkina Faso.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- The Transportation Security Agency denies an 85-year-old woman's allegation she was strip-searched at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.Lenore Zimmerman said the invasive search took place at a JetBlue airlines terminal Nov. 29, WCBS-TV, New York, reported Sunday."After they patted me down, they took me into a private room and they strip-searched me," Zimmerman said. "I said: 'Why are you strip-searching me? Do I like look a terrorist?'"She said her family wants justice and she intends to sue.The Hill reported TSA officials deny the elderly traveler was made to remove her clothes."TSA contacted the passenger to apologize that she feels she had an unpleasant screening experience; however, TSA does not include strip searches in its protocols and a strip search did not occur in this case," TSA blogger Bob Burns said in a post on the agency's Web site. "We're currently gathering information and reviewing the screening of this passenger, but we wanted to share what we know so far."Zimmerman said she missed her flight and had to wait 2 1/2 hours for the next one.Her son, Bruce Zimmerman, said he wanted some sort of consequence for the incident."I think the two agents that escorted or initiated the strip-search should be terminated," he said.The Long Beach, Calif., woman, who winters in South Florida, said she wanted a patdown because her defibrillator cannot go through the screening machine, WCBS said.TSA said its review of security camera footage showed Zimmerman was asked to remove a back brace she told security personnel she was wearing."The passenger opted out of advanced imaging technology screening, requested a patdown and told the officers that she was wearing a back brace or support belt which required private screening," the agency blog said. "Private screening was conducted by two female officers. The item was removed, rescreened and the passenger was cleared for travel."Nothing unusual was depicted on the [closed-circuit television] as the passenger and two female officers entered and exited the room."New York state Sen. Michael Gianaris said he wondered how TSA can be so certain of events, since there are no cameras in the private screening rooms."It's outrageous," he said. "What they need to find out is exactly what happened and if someone crossed the line they need to be penalized."Another woman, 88-year-old Ruth Sherman of Sunrise, Fla., said her visit with family members in New York ended when screeners wanted to physically check the lump created by a Sherman's colostomy bag -- also near the JetBlue terminal at JFK, WCBS said."This is private for me. It's bad enough that I have it," she said. "I had to ... pull my underwear -- my underwear -- down."

CLEVELAND, Sept. 11 (UPI) -- The Cleveland hate-crimes trial of breakaway Amish bishop Samuel Mullet Jr. and 15 followers is headed to closing arguments after both sides rested Tuesday.After prosecutors wrapped up the presentation of their case in U.S. District Court following eight days of testimony, defense attorneys announced they would not call any witnesses and rested as well, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported.Judge Dan Aaron Polster rejected the defense request that he dismiss the charges for lack of evidence."I think a reasonable jury could conclude that there was a general religious motivation behind all of these attacks, and that the cases should go to the jury," Polster said.The judge referred to a statement to the media soon after the beard-cuttings in which Mullet said, "We know what we did and why we did it," the newspaper reported."The jury could conclude the 'we' included himself, that he approved it and ratified it," Polster said.Closing arguments will begin Wednesday morning.Mullet, 66, leader of an Amish community in Bergholz, Ohio, is accused of ordering a series of beard- and hair-cutting attacks last fall on religious enemies and estranged family members. He and his co-defendants were arrested in November by the FBI and local authorities and charged with hate crimes.Earlier in the day, Amish religion expert Donald Kraybill continued his testimony from the previous day, saying the practices of Mullet's group of 18 families resembled a cult, what he called a "lone ranger group.""There was ample evidence that since 2009 they no longer held church services, and showed a complete disregard for traditional Amish doctrine," Kraybill said.He said Monday the alleged attacks were clear violations of Amish principles."The Amish believe that we should do no harm to anyone in any way," he said. "The rejection of revenge, the rejection of force, and forgiveness, is central" to Amish teaching.Kraybill mentioned a 2006 conclave of several hundred Amish bishops in Ulysses, Pa., at which six of Mullet's excommunications were overturned."This was like an earthquake in the Amish world," Kraybill said.Federal prosecutors said Mullet was furious at the rebuke, and point to the bishop's decision as the motive for several of the humiliating hair shearing.To obtain hate-crime convictions, prosecutors must prove the cutting of beard and head hair is an example of bodily harm, and the attacks were religiously motivated, the newspaper said.

| License Photo	March. 22 (UPI) -- Conservative talk-radio host called out Beyoncé for what he called a "180" shift in her image, blasting her for supposedly abandoning the feminism she promoted in her solo work and her former group Destiny's Child, and for now telling women to "bow down" to their husbands in the new song "Bow Down/I Been On.""[Destiny's Child] songs were attempts to inspire young women not to take any grief from men. She's done a 180. Beyoncé, now having been married, having been impregnated and giving birth to Blue Ivy…she's got a new song, 'Bow, Down Bitches'… Beyoncé is now saying, 'Go ahead and put up with it!'You know why? I'll tell you why. Because she married a rich guy. She's even calling herself Mrs. Carter on the tour…She has shelved Beyoncé…She now understands it's worth it to bow down."As E! News points out, a more likely interpretation of "Bow Down" is it's a tough message aimed at aspiring singers challenging her place on the pop-music throne. Limbaugh should have taken a minute to read the lyrics:"I know when you were little girls/You dreamt of being in my world/Don't forget it, don't forget it/Respect that. Bow Down Bitches."She does mention rapper husband Jay-Z in the song, singing, "I took some time to live my life/But don't think I'm just his little wife."
