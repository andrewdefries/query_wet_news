| License Photo	PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 20 (UPI) -- U.S. investors of modest means are not enthusiastic about the stock market when asked if it is a good vehicle for growing wealth, Gallup said.In a quarterly poll conducted Nov. 7-11, only 37 percent of respondents indicated the stock market was a good or excellent way to increase wealth. The largest group, 46 percent of respondents, indicated the stock market was a fair choice for growing wealth, while 16 percent indicated they believed it was a poor choice.The odds shift when respondents indicate they have $100,000 or more to invest. Fifty percent of respondents with that much available to invest indicated the stock market was an excellent or a good option.The survey included U.S. adults with $10,000 or more in savings or investments, about 40 percent of the general public, Gallup said.Opinions also shift when respondents considered only short term investing.Fifty percent of the respondents indicated they were somewhat or very optimistic about the stock market for the next 12 months, while a smaller group, 39 percent, indicated they were optimistic about economic growth. Even fewer, 36 percent, were optimistic the unemployment rate would drop, while 30 percent indicated optimism about inflation.Confidence in the stock market appears low when considering how markets have performed this year, Gallup said. "The stock market is poised to end the year up nearly 25 percent, offering investors impressive gains that should help many recoup the losses they experienced during the 2008-2009 recession," Gallup said."Still, U.S. investors' positive outlook seems muted," the firm said.Results of the survey were derived from a random sample of 1,014 responses to Gallup's daily tracking survey, limited to respondents with $10,000 or more available for investment.The results have a margin of error of plus and minus three percentage points, it can be said with 95 percent certainty, Gallup said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is expected to appoint seasoned U.S. diplomat and former U.S. Ambassador to Algeria and Syria Christopher Ross as his personal envoy for Western Sahara. This appointment hopefully will continue the momentum of the current negotiations process to end the three-decades-old conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, an Algerian-backed rebel movement that has challenged Morocco's historical sovereignty over a Colorado-sized desert territory in North Africa (sometimes known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).Despite a cease-fire that dates back to 1991, the United Nations has had little success in resolving this dispute or bringing relief to the thousands in Polisario-controlled refugee camps whose lives hang in the balance.As former U.S. ambassadors to Morocco who closely follow U.S. policy in the region, we were encouraged by the recent significant shift in how the U.S. administration addresses this long-standing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Over the past months the U.S. government publicly, and on several occasions, acknowledged that compromise, in the form of autonomy for the Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty, is the only viable and realistic solution. This new development creates real possibilities for ending the conflict in the Western Sahara, which has contributed to significant economic and political instability in North Africa.This compromise did not appear by chance. Determined to end this conflict "from a long-gone era," as described by Morocco's King Muhammad VI, Morocco has compromised its long-established position for integrating the Sahara by offering broad-ranging autonomy consistent with international standards for self-determination. This opening enabled the Security Council to sponsor negotiations aimed at resolving the conflict and ending the humanitarian crisis for the tens of thousands of refugees held in camps around Tindouf in southwest Algeria.Since April 2007, when Morocco presented its compromise proposal, the United Nations has mediated four rounds of negotiations between the parties, which have shown promise, but little progress. At the conclusion of the fourth round of negotiations, Ban and his personal envoy Peter van Walsum briefed the U.N. Security Council on the status of the negotiations, after which the members unanimously opted for "realism" rather than prolonging the stalemate that has existed for more than 30 years. The United States played a significant role in this sea change, noting in its statement following the briefing, "For our part, we agree with Mr. van Walsum's assessment that an independent Sahrawi state is not a realistic option for resolving the conflict and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution."This position and its subsequent elaboration by U.S. State Department and White House officials represent an enormous step forward in engaging the parties to finally resolve the Western Sahara conflict. This shift in U.S. policy, and the appointment of Ambassador Ross, may provide the impetus for overcoming the challenges that have bedeviled U.N. efforts to date.The U.S. Congress has also strongly endorsed Morocco's compromise initiative. In fact, 173 members of the House, including its bipartisan leadership and most of the members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, signed a letter circulated by Reps. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., supporting the Moroccan initiative.Ending the Western Sahara conflict makes sense for the parties themselves, the refugees and U.S. national interests.Resolving this conflict would clear the way for greater economic cooperation among the five countries of the Maghreb, which is long overdue.The increase in terrorist activities in the region can be combated effectively only through transnational strategies based on greater cooperation between Morocco and Algeria. Algeria must be strongly encouraged to support this U.S. policy shift to advance our mutual interests in the region. And giving the refugees the opportunities for normal lives, a return to their families and an end to the isolation of the refugee camps is a goal that should be achieved sooner rather than later.This change in U.S. policy and the support of the Security Council bring resolution of the Western Sahara conflict into the realm of the likely; we should not let this real chance for peace be squandered.--(Thomas A. Nassif, Michael Ussery, Frederick Vreeland, Marc Ginsberg and Margaret Tutwiler served as U.S. ambassadors to Morocco under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William J. Clinton and George W. Bush.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island, March 19 (UPI) -- Staff at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada said a fox has taken up residence in a crow's nest on campus.University workers said the fox has been residing in the nest, located in a slanted tree behind the school's utility building, for about two weeks, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Monday.The workers said the home chosen by the fox, which is believed to have been living in the area for two years, has led to daily standoffs between the mammal and local crows.The fox isn't the first interloper, though. Squirrels were living there last fall, workers said.

BURLINGTON, Vt., Feb. 20 (UPI) -- While electric vehicles are good in terms of reduced oil consumption and air pollution they may strain an aging U.S. electrical infrastructure, researchers say.As more and more Americans opt for plug-in electric cars -- more than 96,000 were sold in the United States in 2013 -- the growing fleet will put a lot of new strain on the nation's aging electrical distribution systems like transformers and underground cables, especially at times of peak demand, researchers at the University of Vermont said.How to accommodate all those cars seeking a socket at the same time -- in preparation for the morning rush hour to work, for example -- without crashing the grid or pushing rates to the roof has some utilities concerned, but the researchers say they have a novel solution."The key to our approach is to break up the request for power from each car into multiple small chunks -- into packets," Vermont engineering and mathematical sciences Professor Jeff Frolik said.By using the nation's growing number of "smart meters" -- household electric meters that communicate information back and forth between a house and the utility -- the new approach would let a car charge for, say, five or ten minutes at a time, then it would "get back into the line," Frolik says, and make another request for power.If demand was low, it would continue charging, but if it was high, the car would have to wait. That would allow electric utilities to spread out the demand from plug-in cars over the whole day and night, the researchers said."The vehicle doesn't care," study co-author and power system expert Paul Hines said. "And, most of the time, as long as people get charged by morning, they won't care either."By charging cars in this way, it's really easy to let everybody share the capacity that is available on the grid."

GLENDALE, Ariz., March 1 (UPI) -- Two goals from Dany Heatley helped Minnesota build a 4-1 lead Thursday and the Wild survived a late Phoenix charge to down the Coyotes 4-3.Minnesota won for the fourth time in five games with Niklas Backstrom making 25 saves to collect the victory.Heatley scored late in the first period and early in the second to stake the Wild to a 3-0 lead. Jared Spurgeon's power-play tally with 3:58 left in the middle stanza gave Minnesota its 4-1 advantage heading into the final 20 minutes.Things heated up, however, when Keith Yandle scored a fluke goal for Phoenix with 4:39 to play and Shane Doan produced a shorthanded tally with 59 seconds remaining.Backstrom then stopped the only other shot the Coyotes got off to preserve the victory.Mike Smith allowed four goals on 19 shots and was removed after two periods in favor of Jason LaBarbera.

MINNEAPOLIS, July 30 (UPI) -- Homosexuality is threatening to divide the Episcopalian church at its eight-day convention in Minneapolis, a report said Wednesday.More than 1,000 Episcopalians are gathered for what promises to be a contentious General Convention. The bishop of Washington, The Rt. Rev. John B. Chane has criticized conservatives who have threatened to split the church if delegates confirm a gay bishop or move toward the blessing of same-sex couples. He says they are trying to provoke fear among the delegates.The convention, which meets every three years, is scheduled to vote Sunday on whether to confirm the June 7 election by Episcopalians in New Hampshire of the Rev. V. Gene Robinson as their new bishop, the Washington Post reported.Robinson, 56, would be the first openly gay bishop in the Anglican Communion, a worldwide family of churches with 75 million members, including about 2.3 million U.S. Episcopalians.The convention will also decide, probably on Monday or Tuesday, whether to develop an official liturgy for blessing gay unions.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 (UPI) -- The Pentagon said mistakenly discarded remains from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks did not include any victims from the airliner crash in Pennsylvania.Earlier reports said the incinerated material that wound up in a landfill came from the crash at the Pentagon and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa. However the chief of staff for the U.S. Air Force, Gen. Norton Schwartz, said Wednesday that none of the remains came from the Pennsylvania site.Schwartz told reporters it was his understanding that the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base actually had not processed any Shanksville remains and only handled remains from the Pentagon crash site, The New York Times said.Relatives of Flight 93's victims had been stunned by a report this week that unidentified remains from the Pentagon and Shanksville had been cremated and disposed of by a private contractor. A spokeswoman for the families said Tuesday they had been assured by the local coroner that no remains had been turned over to the Dover mortuary.Even Schwartz said the Air Force had been caught off guard by the report from an independent committee, saying Tuesday the media and members of Congress had seen it before he had. The Times said the Air Force would decide in a few weeks whether there would be any shakeup of the leadership at Dover, which is a first stop for the bodies of U.S. troops killed overseas.

ISTANBUL, Turkey, April 21 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Sunday outlined an international plan to bolster moderate forces in Syria in their struggle against President Bashar Assad.In a marathon meeting in Istanbul including Kerry, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Syrian Opposition Coalition President Moaz al-Khatib, the three concluded a commitment "to a pluralistic Syria, to a Syria in which every minority has minority rights protected."In order to accomplish that goal, Kerry announced a pact to funnel military aid through a coalition of moderate opposition forces -- with the hope the new funds will strengthen moderates against radical Islamist elements within the broad coalition fighting for Assad's ouster, the Wall Street Journal said Sunday.U.S. aid to Syria's rebel forces has been doubled to $250 million, he said.The hope, Kerry said, is to allow moderate forces to gain the upper hand once Assad is gone and eventually create a democratic state in Syria."That includes all the minorities, in which everybody will have an ability to be able to make choices for the future. It is a vision that rejects terrorism and rejects extremism. It is a vision that is pledged to never use chemical weapons. It is a vision that is committed to a political solution, first of all," Kerry said from the Adile Sultan Palace.U.S. diplomats, along with other Western partners, have sought to create a moderate-led transition government capable of taking over security operations and humanitarian aid once the Assad regime falls."We want to see the coalition lead the way by ramping up its ability in order to be able to provide assistance, deliver services, and respond to the needs of the Syrian people," Kerry said.The U.S. aid would be funneled to Syria through opposition Gen. Salim Idris, who, Kerry said, "could not have been clearer about his determination to separate what he and the opposition are doing from what some of the radical and extreme elements are doing."

Feb. 25 (UPI) -- Michelle Obama surprised Oscar viewers by helping screen legend Jack Nicholson introduce the nine nominees for Best Picture Sunday night. Clad in shimmery silver gown by Naeem Khan, Obama joined the awards ceremony via video screen from the Diplomatic Room of the White House with American servicemen and women at her side. "These nine movies took us back in time and all around the world," the first lady said. "They made us laugh, made us weep, and they made us grip our armrests just a little tighter. They taught us that love can endure against all odds and transform our lives in the most surprising ways. And they reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage to believe in ourselves."
