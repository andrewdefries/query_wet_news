NEWPORT NEWS, Va., April 2 (UPI) -- Huntington Ingalls Industries has been contracted by the U.S. Navy to refuel and overhaul the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is worth $2.6 billion.HII said the nuclear-powered carrier arrived at the company's Newport News Shipbuilding facility in Virginia last week for the refueling and complex overhaul. The arrival had been delayed due to "uncertainties surrounding the defense budget and funding of the work.""Our focus will continue to be on the task at hand: modernizing and improving upon Lincoln's capabilities for another 25 years of successful service," said Chris Miner, NNS vice president, in-service aircraft carrier programs."We have worked closely with our Navy partners throughout the budget process and have made good progress getting starting on the planned work during the extended period at Naval Station Norfolk."Now that the ship is in dry dock the shipbuilder-Navy team is eager to finish what we've started here at Newport News Shipbuilding."The refueling and complex overhaul represents 35 percent of all maintenance and modernization in an aircraft carrier's 50-year service life, HII said.In addition to refueling the ship's nuclear reactors, extensive modernization work to more than 2,300 compartments, 600 tanks and hundreds of systems aboard the carrier will be conducted. Major upgrades to the Lincoln's flight deck, catapults and combat systems will also be performed.

The Dubai World Cup Carnival, Opening Day at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas and the California Derby share the marquee in weekend racing.In addition, there are stakes hither and yon for Kentucky Derby and Oaks hopefuls and graded stakes on turf and dirt on both coasts.Looking first to the "hither":The influx of revenue from "instant racing" gaming has Hot Springs looking a little like Dubai in terms of purses -- and interest from horsemen. A record $20 million in purse money is on offer for the 56-day meeting. The stakes program offers a record $5.7 million and $2 million of that in the four-race series for 3-year-olds that culminates in the $1 million, Grade I Arkansas Derby on April 13. The largess has attracted a dozen new trainers and an equal number of new jockeys to the scenic Arkansas oval.Friday's Opening Day program includes the $75,000 Fifth Season Stakes for 4-year-olds and up, with Win Willy, It Happened Again, Eye of the Leopard and Endorsement among the expected starters. Action quickly swings to the 3-year-old filly set in Saturday's $60,000, 6-furlong Dixie Belle Stakes. Seven young hopefuls are on tap for that early Oaks test.On the "yon" side of the world at the plush Meydan track in Dubai, 9-year-old Barbecue Eddie captured the Group 2 Al Maktoum Challenge Round 1 on Thursday evening as the "Carnival" got under way. The Carnival is a buildup to World Cup night on March 30.With Dan O'Neill up, Barbecue Eddie was always close to the pace, struck the lead inside 300 meters and galloped home. Early leader Out of Bounds held gamely to finish second, 1 1/2 lengths back, and Rutland Boy was third. One mile on the all-weather surface went in 1:37.24.Winning trainer Doug Watson said his goal for the veteran Stormy Atlantic campaigner is the Godolphin Mile on World Cup night."We will space his races out with World Cup night in mind," the trainer said. "He may be 9 now but he retains his ability and has proved 1,600 meters to be ideal on an all-weather surface he just loves."Barbecue Eddie picked up his fourth Dubai World Cup Carnival victory and scored his third "course and distance" win of the season.Sharestan, making his first start for Godolphin and trainer Saeed bin Suroor, won a conditions race on Thursday evening's card that could be a step toward the Dubai Duty Free on World Cup night. Sharestan, a 5-year-old son of Shamardal, won as he pleased under Silvestre de Sousa, with So Beautiful 4 lengths in arrears at the wire. "I think he will be all right in bigger races," said bin Suroor, who took the horse over from trainer John Oxx and owner the Aga Khan.Elsewhere this weekend:Derby trailIt's really time to start paying attention now as a couple of these races are important, albeit early, steps along the major Roads to the Roses.At Golden Gate Fields on Saturday, the $100,000 California Derby is 1 1/16 miles and attracted a field of seven. Zeewat, Condiment and My Best Bet -- the top three finishers in the local Gold Rush Stakes, are back to try again. Tree of Life was fifth in the Grade III Generous Stakes at Hollywood Park. Will True Up comes north off a third-place finish behind Avare and Gabriel Charles in the Eddie Logan Stakes at Santa Anita. Wildcat Moon finished second in each of his first four starts, then third and now has won two in a row over the local strip. Butterfly Soul, the only filly in the field, was second in the Pike Place Dancer Stakes at the San Francisco Bay oval. The Pike Place Dancer Stakes is named for the filly who won the 1996 California Derby, then went on to win the Kentucky Oaks. The California Derby is a prep for the $200,000, Grade III El Camino Real Derby on Feb. 16.At Tampa Bay Downs on Saturday, 10 are entered for the $50,000 Pasco Stakes at 7 furlongs. Among them are Dynamic Sky, a Sky Mesa colt who was second in the Dixiana Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland, then sixth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and Purple Egg, undefeated in three earlier starts, including the local Inaugural Stakes. The race is a prep for the $250,000, Grade III Sam F. Davis Stakes on Groundhog Day. That, in turn, is the final local preview of the $350,000, Grade II Tampa Bay Derby on March 9.3-year-old filliesSaturday's card at Tampa Bay also includes the $50,000 Gasparilla Stakes, with 11 fillies facing 7 furlongs. Likely favorites are Martha's Moon, winner of the Catcharisingstar Stakes at Calder and Blue Hen Stakes at Delaware, and Vitameta, who finished second in the Dec. 1 Sandpiper Stakes at Tampa. This race is a prep for the $150,000, Grade III Florida Oaks, which is run Feb. 2 on the turf, or the $100,000 Suncoast Stakes on March 9.The 75,000, 6-furlong Ruthless Stakes on Saturday at Aqueduct could be more of a refuge for sprinters than a test for fillies hoping to stretch out in distance. Little Rocket has won both her starts against fellow New York-breds for trainer Mike Hushion, who said she can compete against open company but perhaps not over a distance of ground. "That's not to say she won't get a mile," he added. Also cutting back after fading in longer stakes tries are Kimono and Kiss the Lady. And don't forget the Dixie Bell Saturday at Oaklawn.Santa AnitaSaturday's $150,000, Grade II San Fernando Stakes features 11 somewhat questionable 4-year-olds tackling 1 1/16 miles on the main track. Battle Force comes to the race off a second-place finish in the Grade II Sir Beaufort. But that was at 1 mile on the turf on Boxing Day last month. Handsome Mike won the Grade II Pennsylvania Derby back in September but then finished ninth in the Breeders' Cup Classic and 10th in the Grade I Hollywood Derby. Despite earning more than $750,000, he is still eligible for a second-conditions allowance event. Fly Lexis Fly was second in the Grade II Super Derby at Louisiana Downs after shipping up from South America. None of trainer Bob Baffert's starters -- Fed Biz, Sky Kingdom, Mile High Magic and Guilt Trip -- has particularly impressed lately. The race is the middle leg of the Strub Series.Action moves to the green course on Sunday for the 9-furlong San Gabriel Stakes, a Group II event with $150,000 in the purse. Slim Shadey drew smack in the middle of a seven-horse field as he tries to return to the form that found the winner's circle after the Grade II John Henry Turf Championship in September. He subsequently ran eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf and fourth in the Grade II Hollywood Turf Cup. Out-of-retirement jockey Gary Stevens will try to breathe some life into Tale of a Champion. Jeranimo, who has had some success at a mile, will try to stretch out.Gulfstream ParkSaturday's $150,000, Grade II Fort Lauderdale Stakes, at 1 1/16 miles on the grass, drew a well-matched field of 11 with Pants on Fire an intriguing "main-track-only" entry. Dominus, Hollinger, Nikki's Sandcastle, Big Blue Kitten and Fifty Proof are all among the morning-line favorites. Nikki's Sandcastle has won two straight over the Gulfstream weeds and finished second in three straight before that. Hollinger comes off a second-place showing in the Grade III Tropical Turf Handicap at Calder and finished second in this race last year. He hasn't won since October of 2011. Fifty Proof won the Sir Barton Stakes at Woodbine in his last start, off a 14-month layoff. If he truly is back to form, he could be tough against these. Ditto Big Blue Kitten, who came off a long vacation to win an optional claimer early in the Gulfstream meeting. If the race does come off the turf, do not ignore Pants On Fire, who has been working like a fire engine for trainer Kelly Breen at Palm Meadows Training Center. On Sunday, older milers are featured in the $100,000, Grade III Hal's Hope Stakes. Pants On Fire is set to go here if the Saturday race stays on the green. Pool Play won the Grade II Hawthorne Gold Cup last fall, then ran an undistinguished eighth in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Soldat won the Fountain of Youth on this track two years ago, followed that with a fifth-place showing in the Florida Derby and 11th in the Kentucky Derby, then raced only twice last year. Delegation got home third in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile at Santa Anita and finished second in the local Harlan's Holiday Stakes last month. Csaba won the Harlan's Holiday -- his third straight triumph in South Florida. Cool Blue Red Hot was third in this race last year but hasn't run since.

BEIRUT, Lebanon, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- Dialogue is the best way to usher in the spirit of reconciliation in a new Lebanese government, the U.N. special envoy to Beirut said.Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati met in Beirut with U.N. special envoy Michael Williams to discuss efforts to form a new government.Williams in a statement stressed that inclusive political dialogue was the best way to preserve the peace in Lebanon."As events in the Arab world have shown, dialogue among all sides in the country is the only way to resolve differences but also to move forward with any country's political, social and economic needs," he said.The previous government led by caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri collapsed Jan. 11 after Hezbollah led its opposition allies in mass resignations. Hezbollah was upset by the previous government's support for a tribunal probing the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Saad Hariri's father.The tribunal released a sealed indictment in January. Hezbollah is widely expected to be named by the tribunal, though the Shiite resistance movement claims to have evidence linking Israel to the Hariri plot.Williams in his statement reminded Mikati that any government in Beirut must remain committed to its international obligations.Mikati, a one-time ally of Saad Hariri, hasn't been able to form a new government because of spats between rival political factions.

PHILADELPHIA, July 24 (UPI) -- A Catholic cleric found to have endangered children by failing to turn in priests who preyed on them was sentenced to prison Tuesday in Philadelphia.In giving Monsignor William J. Lynn a three- to six-year state prison term, Common Pleas Court Judge M. Teresa Sarmina said Lynn was in a position to prevent "monsters in clerical garb" from sexually abusing children but looked the other way, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported."You knew full well what was right, monsignor, but you chose wrong," Sarmina said.Lynn, the first Catholic Church official accused of enabling child-sex abuse, had faced a maximum of seven years in prison, which prosecutors had requested. The priest's attorneys had asked for probation or a county jail term. He must serve at least three years behind bars before becoming eligible for probation, the Inquirer said.Lynn expressed sorrow for his "failings" during the 12 years he was responsible for assigning priests and investigating clergy-sex abuse allegations for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.He said he did his best, "But the fact is, my best was not good enough -- and for that I'm truly sorry."Lynn -- convicted June 22 of felony child endangerment -- served as secretary for clergy for the 1.5 million-member archdiocese from 1992 to 2004.Lawyers for the 61-year-old former cardinal's aide had argued he poses no danger to the public and was sufficiently rehabilitated during the legal battle, which began in 2002.The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests said it believes Lynn still poses a public-safety threat.Prosecutors presented evidence Lynn had not acted strongly to keep suspected molesters away from children, let alone to report them to law enforcement -- and often transferred predatory priests to unsuspecting parishes.Lynn testified he tried to curb abuses, but only Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua -- who died in January -- had the authority to remove priests.Prosecutors said Monday they would retry a priest originally tried with Lynn on charges of attempted rape and endangerment of a child after the jury that convicted Lynn became deadlocked on the priest.The Rev. James J. Brennan, 49, is accused of trying to rape a 14-year-old boy in 1996 at Brennan's apartment. Brennan's accuser, now 30, testified in the first trial he was molested while he shared Brennan's bed.To convict, the jury had to find that Brennan had not only abused the boy but continued to put children at risk during later years of ministry.Prosecutors were unable to find other victims in the first trial."It is extremely important that Brennan be held accountable for his crime, not just for his victim, but for all victims of sexual abuse," District Attorney Seth Williams said in a statement.The district attorney's office didn't explain the decision to retry the case.

VISALIA, Calif., Dec. 24 (UPI) -- A man required to register as a sex offender for an act committed in 1989 with his future wife says the California law is unconstitutional. Lonny Leon Rivera has sued the state of California for removal from the list of registered sex offenders, Courthouse News Service reported Monday. Rivera pleaded guilty to a single consensual act of oral sex. He was 19 and his girlfriend, who has been his wife for many years, was 17. One quirk of the California law is that having oral sex with a minor carries a penalty of lifetime registration as a sex offender, while the presumably more serious crime of statutory rape does not. Rivera's lawyers say that violates the equal protection clause in the Constitution. Rivera has admitted that he did not provide authorities with updated information after 1991, although he did register as a sex offender. A complaint was filed last year charging him with violating the law.

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Dec. 2 (UPI) -- Several people were killed Monday in northeastern Nigeria after suspected Boko Haram terrorists planted hundreds of explosives in the capital of Borno state.The terrorists attacked an air force base in Maiduguri and the city's international airport, and placed more than 300 explosives around the city, the Nigerian newspaper Vanguard reported.A newly constructed trailer park, military check points, and residential and public buildings also were hit in the attacks, which began about 3 a.m.An official total of the dead and wounded was not yet available, but more than 100 militants were reported killed in military airstrikes.At least 24 people were reported killed and 15 others injured Saturday as members of Boko Haram sneaked weapons and ammunition into Borno state along its border with Chad, the Lagos-based newspaper The Guardian reported.The attacks occurred at the village of Madayi, located on Lake Chad about 160 miles north of Maiduguri, and in the town of Sabon Gari, about 70 miles south of the state capital.Col. Mohammed Dole, a spokesman for the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, said the attacks occurred as militants traveled to hideouts in a game reserve and elsewhere."Once the bandits sight villagers crossing the roads, they open fire on them and warn them not to disclose information to the security agents on their hideouts," Dole said.Militants burned several houses and fishing boats in Madayi, he added. Some 56 homes around Sabon Gari also were torched.Dole said four separate locations in northern and southern Borno have been identified as terrorist camps. One, on the border with Cameroon, could be difficult to attack, he said, because it extends into the neighboring country.
