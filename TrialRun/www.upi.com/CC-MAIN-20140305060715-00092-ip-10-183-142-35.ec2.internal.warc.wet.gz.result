WATERLOO, Ontario, Aug. 13 (UPI) -- Microsoft Corp. is among the tech giants BlackBerry Ltd. advisers are eyeing as likely buyers of the smartphone maker, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.The Redmond, Wash., software company expressed an interest in the Waterloo, Ontario, pioneer in wireless handheld devices and services more than a year ago, but it didn't result in a deal.A Microsoft-BlackBerry combination could make Microsoft a more substantial player in the smartphone race, the Journal said.But it would also likely create difficulties with Microsoft's current partnership with Nokia Corp., another former cellphone leader, the newspaper said.Nokia makes smartphones based on Microsoft's Windows operating system.Microsoft declined to comment.The Journal report came a day after BlackBerry said it decided to "explore strategic alternatives" after a line of wireless devices operating on a new operating system, dubbed BlackBerry 10, got a tepid response in the consumer market at its launch this spring.BlackBerry was betting the devices would help it catch up with Apple Inc.'s iPhone and phones running on Google Inc.'s Android software.The company said Monday its board set up a special five-person committee and hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. to examine its options, including a sale, joint ventures and strategic partnerships.It also hired Hill+Knowlton Strategies Inc., which Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail said has experience seeking government approvals for major international takeovers.The reported interest in Microsoft comes as BlackBerry said Prem Watsa, chief executive officer of its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., resigned from the BlackBerry board Monday "due to potential conflicts that may arise" from the strategic review.The Globe and Mail said Fairfax executives were exploring ways of putting together a group to acquire BlackBerry.Fairfax, which owns 10 percent of BlackBerry, is talking with private-equity and industry players that might be interested in participating in a buyout, people familiar with the situation told the newspaper.Watsa has said Fairfax intends to retain its stake in BlackBerry and feels the market is undervaluing the company, the newspaper said.BlackBerry declined to comment. Watsa had no immediate comment.BlackBerry was a pioneer in the smartphone industry with the introduction of phones capable of sending and receiving messages wirelessly.It once controlled more than half of the U.S. market for phones that could handle email and Web-browsing as well as phone calls.BlackBerry now has a global market share of just 2.9 percent, U.S. technology research company International Data Corp. said last week, down from 4.9 percent in the same second-quarter period last year."However, BlackBerry has shown steady progress since the launch of its BB 10 platform, which has grown to three models, additional mobile operators, and a greater presence within its total volumes," IDC said. "It is still early days for the platform, however, and BlackBerry will need time and resources to evangelize more end users."The BB 10 operating system includes two smartphones and a tablet handheld device.BlackBerry has a market capitalization of about $5.8 billion. It had nearly $3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 1. It also had no debt, which The New York Times said meant it could likely support the financing a leveraged buyout would require.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 7 (UPI) -- Israel will collaborate with India, one of its key arms customers, to develop an integrated missile-defense system intended primarily to counter Chinese nuclear and conventional missiles, and Israeli defense industry executive said.The U.S. Defense News weekly reports the program, approved by India's Defense Ministry, is a joint effort by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with India's Defense Research and Development Organization, state-owned Bharat Dynamics Ltd and Bharat Electronics Ltd.The enterprise sounds remarkably like the four-tier missile defense shield that the Jewish state has developed over the last few years -- accelerated by the 2006 war with Lebanon's Hezbollah, during which northern Israel was battered for 34 days by nearly 4,000 rockets, an unprecedented bombardment of civilian areas, with no defenses.Defense News reported the proposed system will integrate India's long-range Prithvi air defense missile system, which is understood to be ready for deployment in 2015, with a mobile radar system being developed by BEL in partnership with IAI.India's DRDO will work with IAI and Rafael on this program. India is currently expanding and upgrading its armed forces and is one of the world's biggest arms importers.Defense News quoted a Rafael executive attending India's Defexpo defense show as saying the network will involve short-range and medium-range Israeli and Indian systems.IAI, with heavy U.S. funding, developed the Arrow anti-ballistic system first deployed in 2000. Today, it's almost finished testing the Arrow-3 variant which it has developed with the Boeing Co. of the United States.Arrow 3 is designed to intercept Iran's Shehab-3 and the more advanced Sejjil-2 ballistic weapons in space outside Earth's atmosphere. It's expected to become operational in 2016.The larger Arrow-2, currently in service, operates at a lower altitude and will be used as back-up for Arrow 3 to intercept any hostile missiles that get past Arrow-3.Rafael builds the mobile Iron Dome system, which counters short-range missiles like those used by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip against Israel.Iron Dome, whose computer system can differentiate between rockets that will impact in populated areas and empty countryside, has by official Israeli tally destroyed 84.2 percent of all rockets it has engaged with its Tamir interceptors since it was deployed in early 2011.Iron Dome is the bottom rung of the missile defense shield the Israelis are constructing.Rafael is also developing another system known as David's Sling, which is designed to intercept medium-range missiles, as well as ballistic weapons that get past Arrow-3 and Arrow-2.Defense News reported the Rafael executive in India said the company has offered to build India a dedicated command, control, communications, computers and intelligence system known as C4I, to integrate with the planned missile defense system.The new joint program does not yet have a name, but a contract is expected to be signed within six months, Defense News reported.India has in the past expressed interest in acquiring IAI's Arrow and Rafael's Iron Dome systems, and the Israeli defense companies have clearly hoped to secure lucrative export sales with these systems.But since the Americans are now involved in the development of these programs and are sharing technology, the Pentagon could block such exports to safeguard these advanced technologies.Even so, in February 2013 Rafael put its rocket-killing Iron Dome system, and the Stunner interceptor used in David's Sling, on display outside the Jewish state for the first time at the Aero India exhibition in Bangalore, the hub of India's growing high-tech sector."The Ministry of Defense has given Rafael the green light to sell the systems to other countries, although no contracts have been reported yet," Israel's Globes business daily reported at the time.In November 2012, Indian newspapers reported the country's defense planners were considering the acquisition of an indigenous version of Iron Dome.DRDO scientists had earlier suggested India look at the possibility of a joint development program with Israeli companies to produce an Indian version of the system.India is slated to spend in excess of $150 billion on modernizing its military over the next decade as it prepares to confront the burgeoning military power of northern neighbor China.IAI, flagship of Israel's defense industry, secured a $1.1 billion contract with the Indian navy in 2009 to provide the advanced Barak-8 tactical air-defense missile for its warships.

HOLIDAY, Fla., June 27 (UPI) -- Authorities in Florida said they arrested a man who neighbors said was naked when he used a golf club to smash up a car that was stranded by floodwaters.Pasco County sheriff's deputies said a pizza delivery driver abandoned the car when it stalled in floodwaters Sunday night in Holiday and returned the following day to find the side mirror had been smashed off, a headlight had been ripped out, the roof was caved in and the doors were open, allowing floodwater to enter the vehicle, the Tampa Times reported Wednesday.The woman reported the damage to deputies, who were told by neighbors that the damage had been caused by Larry Norman Hill, 57. The neighbors said Hill was "completely naked" when he pummeled the car with a gold club and told neighbors who confronted him that he was claiming the car as his own.Hill told a deputy he smashed the car's roof because he was trying to rescue a baby he believed was in the car. "I asked him why he opened the doors to the vehicle and he told me he wanted to air it out," the deputy wrote.Hill was charged with criminal mischief and ordered held in lieu of $1,000 bail.

LONDON, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- Teenagers are abandoning Facebook in large numbers, citing their parents as the biggest deterrent to their using the service, a European study found."Facebook is not just on the slide -- it is basically dead and buried," researcher Daniel Miller, professor of material culture at University College London, said.A study of teens 16 to 18 years old in eight EU countries found as parents and older users saturate Facebook, its younger users are shifting to alternative platforms, the Guardian reported Friday.The key age group of older teenagers is moving from Facebook to other services such as Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat, researchers conducting the Global Social Media Impact Study said."Mostly they feel embarrassed to even be associated with it," Miller said. "Where once parents worried about their children joining Facebook, the children now say it is their family that insists they stay there to post about their lives."What appears to be the most seminal moment in a young person's decision to leave Facebook was surely that dreaded day your mum sends you a friend request," Miller said."It is nothing new that young people care about style and status in relation to their peers, and Facebook is simply not cool anymore," he said.

NEW ORLEANS, March 20 (UPI) -- A tip-in by Anthony Davis with three-tenths of a second remaining Wednesday brought New Orleans an 87-86 triumph over Boston.The Hornets snapped a four-game losing streak, overcoming a seven-point deficit midway through the final period.New Orleans held Boston scoreless for the final 1:54 after Brandon Bass had given the Celtics a five-point lead with a follow shot.Two free throws by Ryan Anderson brought New Orleans within one with 35 seconds to go, after which Boston's Paul Pierce missed a jumper near the end of the 24-second shot clock.New Orleans worked the ball to Eric Gordon for a drive and an attempt at a game-winning layup. That shot missed, but Davis was there to tip it home.Anderson led the way for the Hornets with 21 points and Gordon had 18. Kevin Garnett, coming back from a two-game absence due to a thigh injury and flu-like symptoms, scored 20 points for Boston while Pierce had 28.Boston was coming off a 105-103 loss to Miami, a game in which Jeff Green scored 43 points. Green had 13 against New Orleans.

NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- Two jurors at the New York trial of reputed mob boss Alphonse Persico said they were not frightened by apparently threatening gestures he made toward them.The jurors told the New York Daily News they did not want the public to believe that the trial ended in a hung jury because they were frightened. They said the final split was 10-2 for conviction."No one was intimidated," the forewoman said.Persico, nicknamed "Allie Boy," is reputedly the head of the Colombo crime family. He and co-defendant John DeRoss were charged with killing Colombo underboss William "Wild Bill" Cutolo in 1999.Cutolo's body has not been found.The jurors said Persico gave them hard stares and occasionally put his finger to his head in what seemed to be a shooting gesture during the trial."Whether he was saying that would be our fate, I wouldn't go that far, but it was noticed," one juror said.Three jurors were crying when they came into the courtroom for the last time. The two who talked to the Daily News said that was partly because one of the holdouts started behaving in an out of control way just before the mistrial was announced.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 12 (UPI) -- Only 30 percent of U.S. residents now believe the country should be fighting in Afghanistan, a poll released Thursday indicated. The ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 66 percent of respondents oppose the war. Support for the effort is at its lowest level ever and has dropped below the lowest point in support for the Iraq war. While Republicans remain far more supportive of the Afghanistan mission than Democrats and independents, only 44 percent said they now believe the war is worth fighting. That is a low point while support among the other groups is a few points higher than their record lows. Attitudes toward the mission have often turned sharply because of external events. The Afghanistan mission was almost as unpopular a year ago and then support increased sharply after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Opposition increased after the Koran burnings and the protests that followed among Afghans. It jumped 6 percentage points after the Kandahar massacre when a U.S. soldier allegedly targeted Afghan civilians. While approval of the war is down 13 points, approval of President Obama's handling of Afghanistan has dropped only 5 points. His overall approval rating has improved to 50 percent. Langer Research Associates interviewed 1,003 adults by telephone last Thursday to Sunday. The margin of error is 4 points for the full sample.

| License Photo	DENVER, Dec. 8 (UPI) -- Aron Ralston, who cut off his own forearm when trapped by a boulder while hiking a decade ago, was jailed on domestic violence charges in Denver, police said.Ralston, whose harrowing experience was recounted in the 2010 movie "127 Hours," was arrested Saturday night and was being held in the city jail on one count of assault and one count of wrongs to minors, the Denver Post reported. He is to appear in court Monday.Ralston, 38, was taken into custody at a single-family residence along with the person listed in property records as the owner, Vita Shannon, the newspaper said. Shannon faces identical charges, the Post said.Ralston became widely known in April 2003, after the story got out about he sliced off his own limb, thinking he'd die if he didn't. He had gotten trapped when a boulder dislodged while he was descending a narrow canyon in Utah. After being stuck for five days, he broke the bones in his forearm and cut off the limb with a small knife.
