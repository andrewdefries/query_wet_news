SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 13 (UPI) -- A new data encryption system by General Dynamics C4 Systems has received U.S. National Security Agency certification for protecting secret-level information.The system, called ProtecD@R PC encryptor, secures data, imagery, video and other information on computer hard drives and prevents unauthorized access to classified information."Data at rest (are) data at risk," said Chris Marzilli, president of General Dynamics C4 Systems. "Considering the high value of information stored on military and government computers, the ProtecD@R PC encryptor fills a potential gap in information security that can occur after sensitive data (are) downloaded from a network."ProtecD@R PC is about the size of an external hard drive. It is connected to a computer using an industry standard interface."Once connected, the encryptor automatically secures the data as it moves between the computer's processor and the hard drive, leaving the stored information encrypted and secure without reducing the computer's processing speed," the company said.

MOSCOW, July 17 (UPI) -- Russia says its Arctic Floating University may have discovered a new branch of the Gulf Stream in the Barents Sea on the ship's maiden voyage.The Gulf Stream branch, either newly emerged or previously undiscovered, may be active around Russia's Novaya Zemlya archipelago, Federal Meteorological Service head Alexander Frolov announced in Moscow."This may be no Higgs boson, but this is important, too," he said. "But let's wait until we've analyzed the data better."The discovery is significant because the arctic region governs Russian winter temperatures that in turn have a serious impact on the economy, Frolov said.The Arctic Floating University, a program that may open its doors to foreign student next year, saw 25 Russian master's and postgraduate students take a 40-day tour of the Barents Sea, RIA Novosti reported.The university ship, the Professor Molchanov, crisscrossed ice fields in the Barents Sea and gathered some 8,500 samples of water and seabed along the way between June 1 and July 10, expedition officials said.

He struck out 10 and walked one.But the Astros got to reliever Chad Qualls for a pair of ninth-inning runs. Carlos Lee drove in Jordan Schafer, who led off the ninth with a double. With two out, J.D. Martinez singled to right and pinch-runner Brian Bogusevic was able to score when Pence misplayed the ball.Jason Castro doubled, putting Houston runners on second and third before Diekman came on and struck out Marwin Gonzalez.Philadelphia took the lead in the second inning when Brian Schneider hit a two-run home run for his first homer of the season.

WASHINGTON, May 17 (UPI) -- Corruption and economic growth must be considered when assessing the underlying cause of Middle East revolutions, a U.S. lawmaker said.A vendor frustrated with economic conditions in Tunisia committed suicide in December 2010, sparking the country's Jasmine Revolution and opening the door to the so-called Arab Spring.Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testifies before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs next week on the economic issues tied to the regional uprisings."If we fail to consider the underlying causes of unrest, which can be traced to a lack of legal protections for personal property, endemic corruption and other constraints to economic growth, no amount of U.S. foreign assistance will help bring stability to the region," committee Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., said in a statement.He said he wanted to know if the $1.5 billion set aside for democratic and economic support in the region did any good.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its March report that economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa should weaken as post-revolutionary stimulus packages expire.Royce has been a critic of spending plans from the Obama administration. He said last month the president was trying to raise taxes without corresponding spending cuts.

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 6 (UPI) -- U.S. voters are more likely to view an endorsement by the National Rifle Association negatively than positively, a Public Policy Polling survey indicates.A bare majority also support a ban on assault weapons.The PPP poll found 39 percent say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who had the NRA's backing, compared to 26 percent who say they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate with NRA backing.The poll said 32 percent said it wouldn't influence them one way or the other. Among independents, 41 percent consider an NRA endorsement negatively compared to 27 percent who view it positively.The PPP poll indicated 53 percent of voters say they support stricter gun laws in the country, compared to 39 percent opposed.In a statement, PPP said the figures are basically identical to a 53/40 percent spread a month ago -- indicating the desire for stronger legislation has not receded as the Newtown, Conn., massacre fades from voters' minds.The poll also said 51 percent of voters back an assault weapons ban, compared to 42 percent opposed.Congressional Republicans saw some improvement in their support in the last month: They have a 22 percent approval rating with 68 percent disapproving -- up from a 15/75 spread a month ago, the poll said. Most of the improvement came from GOP voters, with anger over the fiscal cliff subsiding, the poll said.On the immigration front, 64 percent of voters nationally think illegal immigrants should be given a chance to apply for citizenship, compared to 27 percent who think they should be deported.PPP surveyed 800 voters nationally Jan. 31-Feb. 3 through automated telephone interviews. The margin of error for the survey is 3.5 percentage points.PPP said the poll was not paid for or authorized by any campaign or political organization.

SYDNEY, May 4 (UPI) -- A former justice of the Australian High Court says he should be able to marry the man who has shared his life for more than four decades.Michael Kirby testified in favor of same-sex marriage at a hearing in Sydney this week, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.He said he is a "second-class citizen" because there is no public recognition of his relationship with Johan van Vloten, who has been his partner for 43 years.Kirby, who served on Australia's highest court from 1996 to 2009, came out in 1999 by naming van Vloten as his partner in his Who's Who entry. On the court, he was known for frequent dissents.Kirby said he does not see how acknowledging gay relationships harms heterosexual ones.''A loving relationship of tenderness, of gentleness and affection, and fidelity and support is a beautiful thing and anyone who would disrespect it is not a kind person,'' he said.Three bills have been introduced in Parliament that would legalize same-sex marriage.

| License Photo	Jan. 22 (UPI) -- A New York woman is facing a DWI charge after allegedly crashing her car while drunk driving. The twist? She was only wearing an unzipped jacket when she did it.Catherine Giaquinto, 36, crashed her car into a New Jersey stone wall and drove off Friday, New Jersey police reported. Though police said they found her with only a leather jacket on, Gianquito denied being naked when asked why she was driving in the nude, WTSP reported.Soon after she was stopped, police asked her to put on a dress they found in the back seat of her car. After 10-minutes of struggling, Giaquinto managed to put it on inside out and stepped out of her car, Sgt. John-Paul Beebe said.Once dressed, the woman was asked to perform a series of field sobriety tests, but failed to keep her balance or even listen to Officer's instructions, Beebe told WTSP.Giaquinto was then taken into custody and charged with driving while intoxicated, refusing to submit to breath testing, leaving the scene of an accident, failure to report an accident, careless driving, failure to wear a seat belt and a documentation violation, WTSP reported.Giaquinto was released a few hours later to a sober adult. Her vehicle was impounded.

Wiki
Chiang Kai-shek (October 31, 1887 – April 5, 1975) was a political and military leader of 20th century China. He is known as Jiǎng Jièshí or Jiǎng Zhōngzhèng in Mandarin.
Chiang was an influential member of the Nationalist Party, the Kuomintang (KMT), and was a close ally of Sun Yat-sen. He became the Commandant of the Kuomintang's Whampoa Military Academy, and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT when Sun died in 1925. In 1926, Chiang led the Northern Expedition to unify the country, becoming China's nominal leader. He served as Chairman of the National Military Council of the Nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC) from 1928 to 1948. Chiang led China in the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which the Nationalist government's power severely weakened, but his prominence grew. Unlike Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek was socially conservative, promoting traditional Chinese culture in the New Life Movement and rejected western democracy and the democratic socialism that Sun Yet-sen and other left-wing members of the KMT embraced in favor of an authoritarian nationalist government.
Although Chiang's predecessor, Sun Yat-sen, was well-liked and respected by the communists, under Chiang's leadership the Nationalists soon engaged in a longstanding civil war with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Even after the Japanese invaded China, Chiang ignored this military threat to concentrate on a controversial campaign of systematic eradication of his political opponents—namely the communists. It was only with U.S. intervention that Chiang was forced to address the problem of the Japanese invasion and cooperate with the communists to drive the Japanese out. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Chiang once again became embroiled in a bloody civil war with the Communist Party of China. Ultimately, with support from the Soviet Union and popular support from the largely rural Chinese population, the CCP defeated the Nationalists, forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to Taiwan, where martial law was imposed during a period known as the White Terror, and from where the government continued to declare its intention to take back mainland China. Chiang ruled the island securely as the self-appointed President of the Republic of China and Director-General of the Kuomintang until his death in 1975.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
