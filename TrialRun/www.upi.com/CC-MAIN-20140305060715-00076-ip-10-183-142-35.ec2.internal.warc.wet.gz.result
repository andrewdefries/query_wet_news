WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (UPI) -- Al-Qaida has released a new video featuring American member Adam Gadahn, who declares the current U.S. economic crisis a victory for the terrorist organization.During the 32-minute video, released Saturday, Gadahn, who grew up in California before embracing radical Islamic ideology and moving to Pakistan, calls the economic meltdown part of a "crushing defeat" for the United States, according to Virginia-based IntelCenter. Gadahn is on the FBI's most wanted list and also has been indicted on treason charges in the United States. Since 2004 Gadahn has been featured in eight al-Qaida videos. In the video, Gadahn, who some security analysts believed had been killed after a February U.S. Predator drone strike in Pakistan, says the ongoing U.S. effort in Iraq, Afghanistan and the recent strikes in Pakistan are unsustainable and a direct cause of the economic crisis. "The enemies of Islam are facing a crushing defeat, which is beginning to manifest itself in the expanding crisis their economy is experiencing -- a crisis whose primary cause, in addition to the abortive and unsustainable crusades they are waging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq -- is their turning their backs on Allah's revealed laws," Gadahn said in a statement, according to IntelCenter.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 12 (UPI) -- Depressed women have a greater risk of stroke than non-depressed women and those who take antidepressants face an even higher risk, U.S. researchers say.A Harvard University study found women with a history of depression have a 29 percent greater risk of having a stroke and those taking antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac or Zoloft, face a 39 percent higher risk, USA Today reported Friday.The study did not link increased risk directly to the medication but rather to the level of depression the use of such medications can indicate."Although we found women who took antidepressants were at higher risk, I don't have anything to indicate it's because of the medications," said senior study author Kathryn Rexrode, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Rather, use of antidepressants most likely indicates more severe depression, the researchers said, and depression has been linked to stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, smoking and physical inactivity.The study results show "modest elevations in risk," Rexrode says, and should not lead women to consider stopping their medications.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Jan. 2 (UPI) -- Police in Florida said a stray bullet, possibly from an AK-47 assault rifle, struck a woman on the wrist while she was watching New Year's fireworks.Laurie Eberhardt, 67, said she was on a second-floor balcony at the St. Petersburg Yacht Club just after midnight New Year's Day when she felt the bullet enter her right arm at the wrist, Tampa Bay (Fla.) Online reported Wednesday."It was one of the most horrifying experiences of my life," Eberhardt said.Police said the bullet appears to have come from an AK-47 assault rifle.Police said they do not know where the gun was fired from, but it could have been several miles away from the yacht club.Eberhardt said she has a message for the shooter."I would say, 'There's got to be a better use for your weapon,'" she said. "Maybe protecting your home. I can't see any reason to be shooting off an AK-47 like this. Please fire it in another way."

| License Photo	PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., March 1 (UPI) -- Rory McIlroy, the world's top-ranked player, withdrew Friday from the PGA Tour's Honda Classic in Florida due to wisdom tooth pain, he said.McIlroy, the tournament's defending champion played eight holes Friday, with a triple bogey, double bogey and two bogeys on his card. He'd shot even-par 70 Thursday.McIlroy started Friday's play at the 10th hole, which he parred. But he ran a chip through the green on 11 and ended up with a 6 on the par-4 hole and poor drive left him with a bogey at 13.After two more pars, McIlroy hit two balls in the water on No. 16, finishing with a 7 on the par-4 hole. He had a 3-putt for bogey on the par-3 17th, after which he left the course."I sincerely apologize to the Honda Classic and PGA Tour for my sudden withdrawal. I have been suffering with a sore wisdom tooth, which is due to come out in the near future," McIlroy said in a statement."It began bothering me again last night, so I relieved it with Advil. It was very painful again this morning and I was simply unable to concentrate. It was really bothering me and had begun to affect my playing partners."He finished saying he regretted "having to make the decision to withdraw but it is one I had to make."McIlroy is scheduled to play in next week's Cadillac Championship in Doral, Fla.

| License Photo	HERNDON, Va., Dec. 18 (UPI) -- For those who have served in uniform, there is a feeling of family those who haven't cannot appreciate. The family is generational, creating a bond among all who serve -- whether past, present or future. The bond is such that any loss on today's battlefields is felt by survivors of past ones -- for it is still a family member lost.There is irony in two events that took place, half a world apart, on Dec. 10.In Washington, an annual charity concert known as "Christmas in Washington" was held. For 30 years the event has been attended by the first family. The main performer was South Korean rap star Park Jae-sang, known as "Psy."The 34-year old artist emerged out of nowhere July 15 when his YouTube video "Gangham Style" went viral, capturing close to 1 billion views. A somewhat addictive video shows Psy rapping in Korean, performing the "horse dance" as he gallops in place and twirls an imaginary lasso.But Psy came to the concert with some anti-American "psychological baggage" not made public until two days before the Washington event.Psy, who attended college in the United States began a 2002 performance in South Korea by smashing a large model of a U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicle on stage, feeding into public anger over the accidental deaths of two teenage Korean girls run over by a U.S. military vehicle.Psy claims he was caught up in the emotion of the moment. That incident could be excused -- had it stopped there.But a far more outrageous demonstration of Psy's anti-Americanism occurred two years later. He performed a song, written by a popular Korean metal band, entitled "Dear Americans." Referencing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the lyrics clearly left little room for misinterpretation: "Kill those f____ Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives/Kill those f____ Yankees who ordered them to torture/Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law, and fathers/Kill them all slowly and painfully."When these two performances were reported prior to his Washington gig, Psy immediately apologized, saying he fully regretted "using those kinds of words."Meanwhile, within hours of Psy's Washington performance, Navy SEAL Team 6 was risking life and limb to rescue of American doctor Dilip Joseph, kidnapped Dec. 5 by the Taliban in Kabul province, Afghanistan. As intelligence found the doctor's location and reported he was in imminent danger of execution, a special operation was undertaken to rescue him. The raid was successful and the doctor rescued -- but at the cost of the life of a SEAL team member.The White House issued a statement praising the mission as being characteristic of U.S. troops' "extraordinary courage, skill and patriotism." Of the lost team member, U.S. President Barack Obama said, "He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our nation to stay strong, safe and free."Psy tried to justify his 2004 singing of anti-American lyrics by being caught up in his generation's political culture of the day. He was 26 at the time -- older than most SEAL Team 6 warriors involved in Sunday's raid; warriors caught up in the far different and selfless culture of preserving the lives and freedoms of others.Everyone makes mistakes and deserves a second chance. That argument could justify Psy's 2002 performance but in no way can it justify 2004 -- there is a big jump between exercising poor judgment and wishing death upon the U.S. military and their families. Claiming he is "deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted" suggests there is room for misinterpretation when there isn't.More bothersome, however, is what happened after Psy's performance. A newspaper photograph showed Obama with daughter Sasha on stage shaking hands with a smiling Psy.While attending the program was a presidential responsibility, embracing Psy was not. To an awe-struck Sasha, as well as any other young viewers watching, it gave credibility to a man who maliciously and irresponsibly attacked -- way beyond the realm of what is socially acceptable -- the U.S. our military.Yet, ironically, as Psy finished his performance, met the president and regained his breath, a Navy SEAL had drawn his last.It is doubtful Obama will reach out to the family of the fallen SEAL as he did to Psy.Psychological operations or "psyops" are undertaken against foreign targets for the purpose of inducing or reinforcing behavior favorable to U.S. objectives. Although a different kind of "Psy"op, Obama's conduct on stage was a failure by doing just the reverse -- i.e., leaving a negative domestic impact on youthful minds.There is another performance on YouTube which, unfortunately, will never tally the hits Psy has. It is a song written and sung by Purple Heart recipient U.S. Marine Capt. Mark Trouerbach, who goes by "Markus 'T'." As the title, "Not Everyone Comes Home," suggests, it is a tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0tm1D4fD2k). He donates all sales proceeds to "Homes for Wounded Warriors Program."Trouerbach's concern and charity gets back to the family bond mentioned earlier among warriors who, better than anyone, understand the sacrifices made, feeling an obligation to care for those who left a part of themselves on the battlefield.Tragically, Psy -- as part of a generation never required to fight for freedom won with the blood of their grandparents' generation and the Americans who fought alongside them -- will never understand that.With the Dec. 10 death of a courageous Navy SEAL, the first line of Markus "T"'s song is sadly appropriate for yet another member of the military family: "Not everyone comes home for Christmas."--(James. G. Zumwalt, a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer, is author of "Bare Feet, Iron Will -- Stories from the Other Side of Vietnam's Battlefields," "Living the Juche Lie -- North Korea's Kim Dynasty" and "Doomsday: Iran -- The Clock is Ticking.")--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

| License Photo	June 25 (UPI) -- Casey Anthony won what the Orlando Sentinel dubbed a "small legal victory" in court on Tuesday, when a bankruptcy judge ruled that the 27-year-old was too "destitute" for defamation suits against her to proceed in state court. Anthony's legal team wanted defamation lawsuits brought by Zenaida Gonzalez and Roy Kronk to be handled federally in U.S. Bankruptcy Judge K. Rodney May's court, so that he could decide whether the suits are dischargeable. Anthony, who was found not guilty of murdering her daughter, Caylee, in 2011, says she is $800,000 in debt. Gonzalez says Anthony damaged her reputation by saying that someone with a similar name kidnapped Caylee. Kronk claims that Anthony's lawyer implicated him in Caylee's death.
