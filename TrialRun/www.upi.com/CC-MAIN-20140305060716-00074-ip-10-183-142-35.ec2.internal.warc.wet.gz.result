MANILA, July 10 (UPI) -- The Philippine government says it is declaring all-out war against poachers of wildlife species, especially those endemic to the country.The announcement came after authorities recently seized a large number of protected animals during a raid on a home in Manila, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.The newly formed Philippine Operations Group on Ivory and Illegal Wildlife Trade will file criminal charges against the suspected owners of the confiscated animals, Environment Secretary Ramon Paje said.The raiding team recovered 78 myna birds, 12 parrots and five juvenile crocodiles in the operation, but all were dead, officials said."What's particularly alarming about this poaching incident is that there were reports that most of these endangered animals were intentionally killed to avoid detection by authorities, and such act carries a higher penalty," Paje said.Under Philippine law, illegal trade of endangered species is penalized by a fine of $4,610 and a jail term of two years, while the killing of endangered animals carries the penalty of six-year imprisonment and a fine of $11,500.Paje condemned the killing and insisted the government "won't tolerate such cruelty to animals."

Hong Kong's international races lived up to their name Sunday as Agnes Digital's victory in the HK$18 million Hong Kong Cup led a near-sweep of the day's events for Japan.In addition to the Cup, Japanese horses accounted for the HK$14 million Hong Kong Vase at 2400 meters and the HK$14 million Hong Kong Mile. They failed only in the HK$8 million Sprint -- as horses from Australia and the United States repeated their 1-2 finish of a year ago."I think you can see from today that the Japanese horses are underestimated," said Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges, director of racing for the Hong Kong Jockey Club.Added Toshiaki Shirai, trainer of Agnes Digital, "I think that from this point onward, you will see many more Japanese horses competing in international races."And jockey Frankie Dettori, who twice finished second to a Japanese horse on Sunday while riding for the Dubai-based Godolphin racing, chimed in: "The Japanese had a very strong team and they won three races. Congratulations to them."Agnes Digital, an American-bred son of Crafty Prospector, capped the day for Japan with a hard-won victory in the Cup. Dettori had Tobugg on the lead at mid-stretch, only to be passed on the outside by Agnes Digital, with a French-bred filly, Terre A Terre, also charging down the middle of the track.Tobugg fought back but couldn't quite get back to even terms with Agnes Digital, who scored by a head. The French standard-bearer was another neck back in third, followed by Hawkeye, representing Great Britain.Jockey Hirofumi Shii put Agnes Digital into the running early in the 2000-meter race to deal with a short run into the first turn."I felt we had to get near to the front so we came around the turn in very strong position," he said. "From that point onward, I felt that victory was in our hands."Shirai said he would like to run Agnes Digital back in the Dubai World Cup next March, with a stop at the Breeders' Cup at Arlington Park near Chicago also on the schedule for late summer. Godolphin's racing manager, Simon Crisford, said he expects Tobugg to continue to improve next year as a 4-year-old so the Hong Kong Cup could have been the start of a major international rivalry.The Vase may have been the day's most exciting race. Again, Dettori had his Godolphin mount, Ekraar, out and winging early, leading by as much as 5 lengths turning for home. But this time it was Japanese contender Stay Gold, with superstar jockey Yutaka Take up, who came along to spoil the effort. Digging in gamely, Stay Gold, a 7-year-old son of Sunday Silence, was just up in the final jumps to win by a head. Local favorite Indigenous was third."This was just like a miracle," Take said. "He was running on his own. He wants to win very desperately."The race was Stay Gold's last. He won for the seventh time in 50 career starts.Zenno El Cid was Japan's best hope in the Mile. But, showing the depth of the island nation's racing contingent, it was Eishin Preston who came storming down the middle of the track in the stretch run to win going away. Hong Kong-based Electronic Unicorn was second and China Vist, another Godolphin horse, was third. Forbidden Apple, second in the Breeders' Cup Mile in his last previous start, finished fourth on Sunday representing the United States.The Sprint, at 1000 meters on a straight course, was a reprise of the 2000 running. Falvelon, representing Australia, got home a short head in front of Morluc, based in the United States. All Thrills Too, a Hong Kong horse, was third.The Cup was the final race of the Emirates World Series but had no bearing on the outcome, which was dominated by Godolphin. The Dubai-based outfit won all the titles -- top runner with the already retired Fantastic Light, owner, trainer (Suroor) and jockey (Dettori).Emirates Airlines has withdrawn as title sponsor of the series and no replacement has been announced. However, representatives of the race tracks involved also announced Sunday that they have added two races to their series for next year -- the Queen Elizabeth II at Hong Kong and the Singapore Cup.In other weekend racing:Hollywood ParkSiphonic, perhaps the best-running non-winner on Breeders' Cup day, confirmed his form with an impressive, 3 ½-length score in Saturday's $450,000 Hollywood Futurity. With Jerry Bailey in specifically for the ride, Siphonic was too good for the rest of the field, finishing the 1 1/16 mile in 1:42. Fonz was second, ½ length ahead of Officer, who confirmed his form as a sprinter. Siphonic drew the rail for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, was stuck on the dead rail and still ran a bang-up third. "That's the reason I came (to California)," said Bailey, who rode Siphonic for the first time in the Breeders' Cup. "I thought he would do that and he did. He lived up to my expectations. Trainer David Hofmans said he will keep the colt in California and try to keep him fresh for the classics next spring."Right now, we don't have to worry about ducking anybody," he said. "It's a pretty good position." Siphonic, a son of 1996 Hollywood Gold Cup winner Siphon, has won three of four career starts. Officer, meanwhile, will return to shorter distances. "Just too far," trainer Bob Baffert said of Saturday's trip. "Still, he's a fast horse and we're going to have fun with him."If the Futurity stamped Siphonic as the best early West Coast hope for the 2002 Kentucky Derby, Sunday's $350,000 Hollywood Starlet did the same for Habibti. The Tabasco Cat filly caught pace-setting You entering the stretch and fought off a second effort from that rival to win by a head. Tali'sluckybusride was third. Habibti ran 1 1/16 mile in 1:43.12. Habibti was disappointing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile fillies after breaking from the No. 1 hole. You, the favorite in that race, finished fourth."She was going two turns for the first time (in the Starlet) and she doesn't train over here, so it's a little bit of a disadvantage," said Baffert, who trains Habibti. "It just goes to show you the caliber of filly she really is."On Saturday's undercard, Starrer used an outside trip to capture the $150,000 Bayakoa Handicap by 1 length over Queenie Belle. Tropical Lady was third in the 1 1/16-mile event, clocked in 1:42.52. Starrer, a 3-year-old daughter of Dynaformer with Jerry Bailey up, stalked the early pace, made a three-wide move on the backstretch and was four-wide on the turn before reaching the front. David Hofmans is the winning trainer.And in Saturday's third stakes, Verruma beat Vencera by ½ length for a "sounds like" exacta in the $150,000 Dahlia Handicap. Verruma ran 1 1/16 mile on the green in 1:43 1/5.On getaway day on Monday, Lake William scored a minor upset over Texas Glitter in the $70,000 Dajur Handicap. Lake William, a 5-year-old son of Salt Lake, overhauled the pressured pace-setter in the final furlong, winning by 1 length. Shadow Caster was third. The 5 ½ furlongs on the grass took 1:02.52.AqueductHere's Zealous caught Run Kush Run midway down the stretch in Saturday's $100,000 Gravesend Handicap for 3-year-olds and up and powered on to win by 4 lengths. Peeping Tom rallied from far back to finish second and Say Florida Sandy was third in the 6-furlong test."I started walking down to the winner's circle when they crossed the quarter pole," said winning trainer Richard Dutrow. "This horse has and explosive turn of foot when he switches leads."Sunday, Eye of the Comet rallied from last of seven to win the $75,000 Damon Runyan Stakes for state-bred 2-year-olds by 6 ¾ lengths over Netcong. No Parole was third and the favorite, White Ibis, finished fifth after stumbling at the start."They all made fun of me the first time I took him to Belmont - being a $950 yearling purchase," said Eye of the Comet's owner, Cecil Fiske. He said trainer Sal Iorio Jr. probably will point the Comet Shine colt to the Big Apple Triple.Calder Race CourseAmelia got to the outside in the stretch in Saturday's $100,000 Frances A. Genter Stakes and took command in the late going, winning by a neck over Sara's Success. Ing Ing was third as the favorite. Winning trainer Shug McGaughey said he wanted jockey Javier Castellano to do just what he did - get Amelia going from mid-pack on the turn. "Then, it was just a matter of whether she could get up in time and she did," he added. He said he will send Amelia to Payson Park for a rest and resume her career late in the Gulfstream meet.Fair GroundsLa Recherche went to the lead right out of the gate in Saturday's $100,000 Pago Hop Handicap, led the field around the turf course and held on to win by a nose over Twilite Tryst. Stal Quest was just another nose back in third. "It was a great tactical ride by Ronald (Ardoin)," said winning trainer Tom Amoss. "Post position (the rail) definitely made the difference. She ran fantastic and I know this is her best distance." La Recherche finished the "about" 1 mile in 1:39 4/5.Turf ParadiseFighting Falcon, breaking from the outside, was carried wide on the first turn in Saturday's $75,000 Paradise Mile, worked his way into contention a half mile out and got home first by 1 length with a strong stretch effort. King Slayer was second and Bristolville third as part of the favored entry with Eagleton, who finished fourth. Fighting Falcon, as 5-year-old son of Manila trained by Simon Bray, finished in 1:38.00.Turfway ParkCrafty Shaw put away Horrible Evening a half mile through Saturday's $50,000 Prairie Bayou Stakes and rolled home a winner by 1 ¾ lengths over a late-running Double Affair. Glacial was third. Crafty Shaw, a 3-year-old son of Crafty Prospector, trained by Peter Vestal, finished the 9 furlongs on a muddy track in 1:50.85Laurel ParkGrundlefoot took the outside path around the leaders on the turn and drew off to win Saturday's $50,000 Walter Haight Handicap by an easy 5 ¼ lengths. Cowboy Magic was second and Summerset third. The favorite, Concerned Minister, led but faded to finish fourth. "When we got to the turn, I let him do what he wanted and he took off," said winning rider Ramon Dominguez, who picked up his 17th stakes win on the year. The win also was Dominguez' 415th of 2001 and he leads all riders in that stat.Hawthorne Race CourseWhite O Morn upset Saturday's $100,000 Illinois Breeders' Debutante Stakes with a stirring stretch effort. The filly went after pace-setting favorite Summer Mis on the turn, caught her about the sixteenth pole and drew clear to win by 2 ½ lengths. Gracility was third. The 1 1/16 mile took 1:49.75.Tampa Bay DownsBog Hunter didn't bog down at all in Saturday's $50,000 Inaugural Staeks for 2-year-olds. The son of Hunting Hard broke cleanly, went right to the front and fought off a challenge from Showmeitall before winning by 1 ¼ lengths. Showmeitall held second with How About My Place taking third. Bog Hunter got the 6 furlongs in 1:11.43.

MEMPHIS, April 1 (UPI) -- Mike Conley hit a score-tying 3-pointer and then added a game-winning layup with less than 1 second left for Memphis in its 92-90 win over San Antonio Monday.Conley's trey with 30.7 seconds left forged a 90-90 tie and, after the Spurs' Tony Parker missed a jump shot, the Grizzlies' point guard sealed the win when he banked in the deciding score with sixth-tenths of a second remaining.Conley ended with 23 points as Memphis posted a 12th straight home victory.Jerryd Bayless came off the bench to collect 17 points for the Grizzlies, who trail the Southwest Division-leading Spurs by five games with eight to play.Parker finished with 25 points for the Spurs, who were playing without the injured Manu Ginobili.San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard each sat out the game to rest their sore left knees.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- Law enforcement has nowhere near the resources needed to combat an expected wave of fraud in the $789 billion U.S. financial bailout, a top FBI official said.The FBI and U.S. Justice Department already are stretched with 2,300 open investigations into suspected illegal financial activity, including 38 probes specifically linked to the economic crisis, FBI Deputy Director John Pistole said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.The FBI expects the problems to worsen exponentially as the economy plunges and as Washington spends what will end up being more than $1 trillion on various bailout and stimulus packages, Pistole and Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita Glavin said.Pistole said he expected the number of major investigations to rise into the many hundreds, focusing on big-name companies that "everybody knows about."He said they will be similar in scope and complexity to the massive probe of energy company Enron Corp. after its 2001 collapse, the Los Angeles Times reported.Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told the Times after the testimony that he was dismayed to learn how few FBI agents were being deployed to investigate financial fraud cases.But he said his committee would "make sure there are enough people out there to start catching and prosecuting people.""They will be more aggressive in the future, I can assure you," Leahy said. "This committee is going to keep the pressure on."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UPI) -- The American Society of Civil Engineers issued a cry of alarm five years ago in the form of three separate report cards on the state of the nation's infrastructure in 15 major categories -- from bridges to rail lines, pipelines, dams, waterways, highways and all other publicly regulated facilities. Steam pipes under Manhattan are almost 100 years old and underground explosions occur with dangerous regularity, sending geysers of hot steam skywards.U.S. infrastructure repairs and new projects have been repeatedly postponed as defense requirements and two wars over the past 11 years took priority.Airports from Abu Dhabi to Singapore to Shanghai entered the 21st century with state-of-the-art infrastructure that handles Airbus's 550-passenger super jumbos faster and more efficiently than Washington's Dulles or New York's JFK can handle passenger loads half that size.The pride of America's passenger trains -- the northeastern corridor's Acela -- can reach a top speed of 150 mph on a straight stretch but seldom exceeds 120 mph due to inadequate roadbeds. China already boasts the world's longest high-speed rail network and plans to double its length to 10,000 miles by 2020.The Chinese bullet train's top speed of 220 mph cuts a 125-mile trip to 45 minutes. The 819-mile, high-speed Beijing-Shanghai track was laid between April 2008 and Nov. 15, 2010. Non-stop trains do the run in 3 hours, 58 minutes. And the passenger capacity runs 220,000 per day.The old track handles intermediary stops between the two major cities and the Beijing-Shanghai journey runs 9 hours, 50 minutes.Infrastructure has been a key U.S. priority -- on paper. On average, since World War II, the United States earmarked 3 percent of its gross domestic product to infrastructure. But this was cut by one-third to 2 percent since 1980.China and India, by comparison, respectively, spend 9 and 5 percent of their GDP on infrastructure, says U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Donahue.As U.S. national priorities changed, the U.S. government gradually shifted the lion's share of its infrastructure responsibilities from federal to state and local. Thus, the federal government moved an estimated 75 percent of public infrastructure costs off its books.Years of deferred infrastructure costs followed.Both the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers launched campaigns to rebuild America's rapidly crumbling infrastructure.Almost 2,000 bridges have collapsed since the 1960s.ASCE said in 2005 that vehicle travel on all public roads in the United States increased from 600 billion vehicle miles in the mid-1950s to 3 trillion vehicle miles -- with 700 billion of them on the interstate highway system.In other words, bridges are aging, traffic is increasing and state and local revenues are shrinking. A perfect national tsunami is in the making.ASCE gives U.S. transit systems a D+.Below ground, the United States has 2.5 million miles of pipeline -- enough pipe to circle the globe 100 times. One-third of them are 40 years old or older and, says ASCE, they don't receive the care they need.Starting next year, industry will be shedding 1.26 trillion gallons of untreated sewage every year. And ASCE estimates $2.2 trillion is needed over the next five years to fix it. And no one seems to have a clue on how to fix it before it becomes a national tragedy.The Federal Highway Administration says 11 percent of total highway bridges in the United States are "structurally deficient" and require "significant" rehabilitation or outright replacement.The average age of a U.S. bridge is 42 years. But almost 200,000 of the nation's 600,000 highway bridges are 50 years old or older. That number is expected to double by 2030. Almost $100 billion is needed "NOW!" to handle the backlog of deficient bridges.Bridge safety is a top national priority, several congressional studies state, but federal programs fail to meet the need. Funding for wars -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- is at $1.6 trillion and still a climbing priority where needs are invariably met.Congress, in yet another exercise in muddled thinking, spends only 13 percent of available funds on bridge repair and rehabilitation. Countless millions of vehicles are traveling across structurally deficient bridges.Another ASCE reports says "as dams age and downstream development increases, the number of deficient dams has risen to more than 4,000, including 1,819 high hazard potential dams. Over the past six years, for every deficient, high hazard potential dam repaired, nearly two more were declared deficient. There are more than 85,000 dams in the U.S., and the average age is just over 51 years old."The Association of State Dam Safety Officials estimates the total cost to repair the nation's dams at $50 billion; the urgently needed investment to repair high hazard potential dams at $16 billion.ASDSO also says the backlog of deficient dams is more than 4,000.In yet another report, ASCE said that by 2020 there will be an estimated 738,000 fewer jobs created "if the U.S. continues its current level of investments in seaports." And by 2040, these same job losses "will amount to 1.4 million."In this report, titled "Failure to Act: The Economic Impact of Current Investment Trends in Airports, Inland Waterways and Marine Ports," ASCE concluded that "to accommodate growth in waterborne traffic, future spending needs are estimated to total $30 billion by 2020 and $92 billion by 2040."ASCE's overall bottom line: at current investment levels, losses will accumulate every year to a total loss of nearly $4 trillion to the national GDP and $7.9 trillion in lost business through 2040.Sequestration in January won't only inflict major cutbacks in defense spending but in all federal programs, including transportation infrastructure that will translate into losses in trade, jobs and tax revenues.The Hill's Congress Blog says "evident by (ASCE's report findings) budget cuts to our waterways and seaports equate to even higher job losses and reduced GDP, which will only increase our nation's deficit."

NEW YORK, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- President Barack Obama slammed Rep. Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican on the ropes over his remarks on rape, at a New York campaign appearance Wednesday night.Speaking to about 120 people at a dinner held at the Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, Obama called Akin, who is seeking to unseat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., "an individual who sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but somehow missed science class."Akin, who opposes abortion, has drawn intense bipartisan criticism for saying women have natural biological protections against impregnation by rapists. He said he misspoke and has apologized but has defied calls from Republican Party leaders -- including presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- to leave the race.Obama said Akin was "representative of the desire to go backwards instead of forwards and fight fights that we thought were settled 20 or 30 years ago."The small crowd included a number of former NBA stars -- such as Bill Bradley, Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Walt Frazier -- prompting the president to say it is "very rare I come to an event where I'm like the fifth- or sixth-most interesting person."Earlier in the day in Las Vegas, Obama hit education themes for a second straight day, pushing for increased funding.Obama addressed a crowd at Canyon Springs High School to address elementary and secondary education a day after focusing on funding for higher education."We all understand there is nothing more important to our country's future than the education we give our children," Obama said to applause. "Nothing more important."Obama noted his sister is a teacher and said he knows education begins at home, but government has to do its part, he said, to provide the funding to enable districts to hire and retain great teachers."If we want America to lead in the 21st century, we've got to give all our children the best education possible," he said.Obama triggered a chorus of boos in noting congressional inaction -- led by presumptive Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- on legislation that would have helped states hire and retain tens of thousands of teachers."Now, not only is that unfair to our kids, it's foolish for our future," He said."Now, my opponent in this election doesn't seem to understand this. Mitt Romney says we've got enough teachers. We don't need any more. The way he talks about them, it seems as if he thinks these are a bunch of nameless government bureaucrats that we need to cut back on -- those are his words. And his economic plan certainly would do that. The plan Governor Romney has put forward would cut America's investment in education by nearly 20 percent" to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.Before addressing the crowd, Obama met with a group of three teachers.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (UPI) -- The U.S. poverty rate stabilized after rising during the recession, but more of the nation's poor are poorer than they've been in years, the Census Bureau said.Of the 15 percent of Americans living below the poverty line, the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey indicated 44 percent are considered to be in "deep poverty," defined as an income 50 percent or more below the poverty line. That's a 2 percent increase from 42 percent before the recession and near the highest level since Census data became available in 1975, officials indicated.Last year, 6.6 percent of Americans were classified as living in deep poverty, up from 4.5 percent in 2000, when the economy was strong, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. The federal poverty line is considered an income of $23,492 for a family of four.Economists offer several reasons why the number of people in deep poverty is rising, including cutbacks on cash assistance for very low-income families with children since the welfare overhaul in the 1990s, the nation's hum-drum economic recovery and the still-high unemployment rate since the 2007-09 recession, the Journal said. "People in deep poverty are likely to be the least competitive in the job market, and so when there are still a lot of job seekers out there for any opening, it's hard to break in," Luke Shaefer, assistant professor at the University of Michigan's School of Social Work, told the Journal.A separate survey by the U.S. Census Bureau indicated deep poverty rates rose in all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 2000 and 2012, with states in the South and Midwest experiencing some of the biggest percentage increases.

| License Photo	PRETORIA, South Africa, June 23 (UPI) -- The South African government said Sunday night former President Nelson Mandela's condition has deteriorated to "critical."President Jacob Zuma, accompanied by African National Congress Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa visited Mandela in his hospital room, SABC reported."The condition of former President Nelson Mandela, who is still in hospital in Pretoria, has become critical," a statement issued by Zuma's office afterward said.Zuma and Ramaphosa were briefed by Mandela's medical team, who informed them the former president's condition had gotten worse in the past 24 hours. They also met with Mandela's wife, Graca Machel and discussed his condition, the network said."The doctors are doing everything possible to get his condition to improve and are ensuring that Madiba [Mandela] is well-looked after and is comfortable. He is in good hands," Zuma said.Mandela, 94, has been in frail health in recent years and has been hospitalized in an intensive care unit since June 8 for a lung infection.SABC said Zuma and Ramaphosa were assured by the doctors that Mandela's condition was not compromised when the ambulance transporting the former president to the hospital June 8 developed engine problems."There were seven doctors in the convoy who were in full control of the situation throughout the period. He had expert medical care," Zuma said. "The fully equipped military ICU ambulance had a full complement of specialist medical staff including intensive care specialists and ICU nurses. The doctors also dismissed the media reports that Madiba suffered cardiac arrest.
