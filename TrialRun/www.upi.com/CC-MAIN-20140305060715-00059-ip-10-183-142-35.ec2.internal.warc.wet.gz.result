| License Photo	BOSTON, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- U.S. workers in their 20s are five times more likely to work in retail than in all other jobs sectors, a Millennial Branding study found.Millennial Branding studies millennials or members of Generation Y, who are, essentially, the offspring of baby boomers, but those who come after Generation X.In a study done in collaboration with PayScale, a research firm that looks at worker compensation, Millennial Branding found retail clerk was by far the most common job among millennials, even for those with college degrees and despite the point that the average pay is $19,300 a year, ranking it among the five lowest-paying jobs in the country.USA Today reported Wednesday nearly half of the floor clerks in the country indicated they had college degrees. Among clerks selling clothing, 83 percent indicated they had four-year college degrees."A lot of them will end up in these retail jobs while applying for professional jobs and hoping there will be openings," said Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Millennial Branding.On the other end of the pay scale are science and technology jobs. Huge, brand-name technology companies such as Microsoft and Google were listed near the top of all companies in terms of job satisfaction. "Tech companies play to Gen Y's entrepreneurship and wanting to work in a company that's constantly moving," Schawbel told the newspaper.

| License Photo	PASADENA, Calif., Jan. 7 (UPI) -- The U.S. sitcom "Community," which was in danger of being canceled this season due to low ratings, could be renewed for a fifth season, NBC said. Robert Greenblatt, the network's entertainment chairman, confirmed the possibility of an additional season at a press event Sunday, EW.com reported. "Absolutely," Greenblatt said of a possible fifth season. "We're always hopeful for a show to continue. And we co-own it. I'd love nothing more than to see it continue."Discussing the expected departure of co-star Chevy Chase this season, Greenblatt said: "Actors come and go on a lot of shows and this is a big ensemble. I don't think that's going to be a big negative about the future of the show."Season 4 is to debut next month.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Dec. 17 (UPI) -- A new version of the Barbie doll aimed at Alfred Hitchcock fans is hitting U.S. stores in time for Christmas -- "Bird Barbie."This "Barbie Collector" doll is modeled on Tippi Hedren, star of the 1963 horror classic "The Birds," the New York Post reports. Like Melanie Daniels, Hedren's character in the movie, Barbie is being strafed by birds.The doll's release was timed to the movie's 45th anniversary.Mattel Inc. warns that "Bird Barbie" is at least PG-13 rated and not suitable for little girls.Barbie has had a number of other classic incarnations aimed more at Baby Boomers than their daughters or granddaughters. They include a Marilyn Monroe Barbie, "Twist 'N Turn Barbie" and "Wizard of Oz Dorothy Barbie."

HULL, England, Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Three ancient river systems, now long buried, may have supported ancient human migration routes out of Africa to the Mediterranean, British researchers say.Tom Coulthard from the University of Hull, along with colleagues from other institutions, simulated paleoclimates in the region that suggested three major river systems likely existed in North Africa 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, although they are now largely buried under desert dunes.When flowing they would have created fertile habitats for animals and vegetation and served as "green corridors," providing likely routes of human migrations across the region, the researchers said.While previous studies have shown people traveled across the Saharan mountains toward more fertile Mediterranean regions, when, where and how they did so has long been a subject of debate."It's exciting to think that 100,000 years ago there were three huge rivers forcing their way across 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of the Sahara desert to the Mediterranean -- and that our ancestors could have walked alongside them," Coulthard said.In addition to rivers, the researchers said, their simulations predicted massive lagoons and wetlands in northeast Libya, some of which may have been as large as 27,000 square miles.The study has been published in the journal PLoS ONE.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, April 25 (UPI) -- The U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was used to jail admitted terrorists as well as innocent people, files leaked by WikiLeaks indicate.More than 700 classified military documents offer new accounts of the alleged terrorists detained at the military prison, as well as evidence against the 172 men still imprisoned there, The New York Times reported Monday.The documents, made available to the Times and other news organizations, reveal that most of the remaining prisoners are classified as being a "high risk" threat to the United States and its allies if released without proper supervision. They also indicate that about a third of the 600 detainees released to other countries were designated "high risk" before their incarceration at Guantanamo Bay ended.GALLERY: Protesting Guantanamo BayThe Defense Department condemned the release of the documents, including assessments of the detainees by military intelligence officials, the Times said."It is unfortunate that The New York Times and other news organizations have made the decision to publish numerous documents obtained illegally by WikiLeaks concerning the Guantanamo detention facility," a statement read. "These documents contain classified information about current and former GTMO detainees and we strongly condemn the leaking of this sensitive information." The Detainee Assessment Briefs written between 2002 and early 2009 that were released by WikiLeaks were reviewed by the Guantanamo Review Task Force when it re-examined detainee information, the Pentagon said. The task force, begun in 2009, sometimes agreed with the initial assessment, and sometimes it did not."The assessments of the Guantanamo Review Task Force have not been compromised to WikiLeaks," the Pentagon said. "Thus, any given [Detainee Assessment Brief] illegally obtained and released by WikiLeaks may or may not represent the current view of a given detainee."The documents indicate al-Qaida terrorists reportedly planted a nuclear device somewhere in Europe and threatened to unleash a "nuclear hellstorm" if Osama bin Laden is caught or assassinated, Britain's Daily Telegraph reported. The Telegraph also received access to the documents that WikiLeaks obtained.A plot to put cyanide in air-conditioning units of public buildings across the United States was exposed along with several plans to attack the country's infrastructure, the documents showed.The files of the 780 people who spent time in the Guantanamo facility include their medical condition and the information they have provided during interrogations, the Telegraph reported. About 220 of the people detained were assessed to be dangerous international terrorists and about 380 people were determined to be lower-level foot-soldiers. At least 150 people were found to be innocent Afghans or Pakistanis, the documents indicated. Senior U.S. commanders determined that, in dozens of cases, there is "no reason recorded for transfer," the documents said. Soon after his swearing-in, President Barack Obama pledged to close the facility and conduct open trials for those found to have committed crimes.The Pentagon statement said the administrations of Obama and former President George W. Bush "made every effort to act with the utmost care and diligence in transferring detainees from Guantanamo.""Both administrations have made the protection of American citizens the top priority and we are concerned that the disclosure of these documents could be damaging to those efforts," the statement said. "That said, we will continue to work with allies and partners around the world to mitigate threats to the U.S. and other countries and to work toward the ultimate closure of the Guantanamo detention facility, consistent with good security practices and our values as a nation."

WASHINGTON, April 1 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a voting rights case in Texas on whether undocumented immigrants can be considered in creating voting districts.The case, Lepak vs. City of Irving, centers on whether it was correct to draw city council districts using total population, a figure that includes Hispanics who cannot vote, or limit district sizes to only eligible voters, SCOTUSBlog.com said.One practical implication of the policy is that some council members in Irving, Texas, represent areas considerably larger in population than others.In issuing its decision on which cases to hear moving forward, the court only slated one new case for a decision. It aims to clarify a dispute in precedent in two cases in which lawsuits between two companies in different states should be heard and at whether they should be heard in state or federal courts.The justices took no action on Elmbrook School District vs. Doe for a second time. The suit was filed on behalf of a student challenging the location of his public high school's commencement ceremony, which was held at a local church.

BEIJING, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Data has been sent over the first cables linking China and Taiwan in what analysts call a sign of improving relations between the two arms-length neighbors.Two undersea fiber-optic cables carried traffic for 4 minutes during a "completion ceremony" between China and the island nation of Taiwan, which has been self-governing since 1949 but which China has long pressured for reunification.The cable is one of a number of economic commercial agreements signed since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in Taiwan in May 2008 and represents improved relations between Beijing and Taipei, analysts said."This is part of a crescendo of increasing economic, logistic and person-to-person links across the straits -- we've seen direct flights increasingly replacing the flights via Hong Kong or Macau and a growing number of tourists from the mainland visiting Taiwan," Duncan Clark, an analyst at BDA China, told the BBC.The cables were laid by collaborating Chinese and Taiwanese companies at a cost of $6.7 million."From a telecom perspective, direct links obviously helps create a more robust infrastructure, both in terms of speed and in avoiding the risks of further disruptions from either earthquakes or fishing trawlers, who have in the past inadvertently dragged up cables in their nets or anchors," Clark said.

Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Katmandu or Kaleidoscope? Jimmy Kimmel threw Kim Kardashian an impromptu baby shower on Tuesday night's episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," complete with virgin mimosas, balloons and a book of baby names that start with "K." The sisters stopped by to promote their show, "Kourtney and Kim Take Miami," but Kimmel couldn't help asking questions about the "Kimye" baby-to-be, and involving children in the family business. "[The baby] is not going to be on our show," Kim said. "When he or she decides that's what they want to do, then that will be a decision."
