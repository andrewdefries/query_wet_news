WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Over a five-year period, 1-in-6 U.S. children age 5 and under went to a hospital emergency department or clinic for influenza, a researcher says. Lead author Dr. Katherine Poehling of Wake Forest Baptist and colleagues found children age 6 months and under had the highest hospitalization rates with flu. "Parents should include a yearly flu shot to protect themselves and their children," Poehling said. "The best way to protect infants too young to receive the influenza vaccine is for pregnant women, the infant's family members and anyone with contact with the baby to get the shot, too."The study involved 8,000 children seen in inpatient, emergency department and clinic settings with confirmed flu cases in children age 5 and younger in three counties in Ohio, New York and Tennessee from 2004 to 2009.During the study period, the researchers found the overall flu vaccination coverage changed little -- less than 45 percent of children were vaccinated against the flu during a five-year study period, but the proportion of infants age 6 months and younger diagnosed with the flu increased to 48 percent compared with 28 percent in a previous study using data from 2000 to 2004, conducted by the same research team.The study, published online ahead of next month's print edition of the journal Pediatrics, found seasonal flu remained an important cause of hospitalization, emergency department and outpatient visits among children and that vaccination and antiviral medications were underused.

LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- A woman said she gave birth to her daughter on a London train during rush hour after being sent home from the hospital. Sonia Banks, 22, and her partner, Allan Stanley, 21, went to the hospital after Banks' water broke Thursday afternoon, The Daily Telegraph reported. But midwives at the hospital sent her and Stanley home, telling them that the baby wouldn't be born for a long time, The Telegraph said. The pair left the hospital and boarded a train from London to to Maidstone, The Telegraph said. They were on the train Thursday for just seven minutes when Banks realized she was having contractions. A midwife from the hospital and a police officer assisted in the birth and Banks' daughter, Phoebe, was born without any complications, The Telegraph reported. The train was delayed for 37 minutes due to the birth.

NEW YORK, Sept. 16 (UPI) -- Morgan Stanley and one of its top executives have settled charges of impropriety leveled by the National Association of Securities Dealers.The New York City-based brokerage firm and its executive were charged with improperly offering brokers more than $1 million in prizes through internal sales contests. The prizes were intended to boost Morgan Stanley's sales of in-house mutual funds and variable annuities.Morgan Stanley and Bruce Alonso, a managing director who oversees the firm's branch network, settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations, the Wall Street Journal reported.As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $2 million fine, and Alonso will pay a $250,000 fine.NASD rules prohibit broker contests intended to boost sales of specific products.

PUYALLUP, Wash., Feb. 8 (UPI) -- Relatives of a Washington state man who set fire to his home, killing himself and his two sons, said they are disillusioned with the U.S. legal system.Maurice and Patty Leach, who identify themselves as the uncle and aunt of Josh Powell, said the family tragedy was the result of a series of failures, KIRO-TV, Seattle, reported Wednesday.The couple issued a statement blaming the tragedy in part on "the various questionable government agencies' practices, religious bias, the Internet kangaroo courts, and sensationalized news media, all of whom have circumvented the laws that protect all our rights to due process."Powell left a voice mail for his family saying he could not live without his sons just 20 minutes before an explosion rocked his home in Puyallup, Wash.He was a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox, and had been ordered to undergo psychosexual testing before he could regain custody of Charles, 7, and Braden, 5.When the boys arrived for a supervised visit Sunday, Powell would not let their caseworker into the house.In a recording of one of her 911 calls you can hear a child crying inside the house, the Tacoma News-Tribune reported.Detectives said Powell meticulously planned their deaths, giving away all their toys and books to Goodwill and purchasing 10 gallons of gasoline to spread throughout the house.He used a hatchet on the boys before setting the house on fire, the report said. All three died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

TOKYO, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Japanese coast guard officers arrested a Chinese fishing boat captain they said was illegally fishing in waters Japan claims it controls.The vessel's skipper told Japanese officials he is Chinese, and Japanese officials said he tried to evade capture when Japanese cutters approached it. Eventually, coast guard officers were able to board the boat, 28 miles east northeast of Mikayo -- one of a series of uninhabited islets at the center of a fierce territorial dispute between Japan and China in the East China Sea.The last time Japan arrested a Chinese fisherman in the area was in September 2010, and the incident significantly increased tensions between the two nations, the Kyodo News said Sunday.

May 8 (UPI) -- Shape magazine unveiled their much expected June cover in a tweet Tuesday featuring none other than Britney Spears.Okay, guys, the wait is over! We're so excited to show you our gorgeous June cover featuring @britneyspears!! twitter.com/Shape_Magazine…— SHAPE magazine (@Shape_Magazine) May 7, 2013
Sporting a daring white bikini the 31-year-old singer shows off her toned abs and flaunts her iconic belly piercing. During the interview Spears shared the exercising and dieting routine that keeps her looking fit and explained that she'll need to be in top shape for her upcoming Vegas gig. “I’m doing 90 minutes of yoga twice a week in addition to a lot of cardio -- hour-long sessions three times a week with my trainer, Tony Martinez,” Spears told Shape. “The [Vegas] performances won’t be simple -- they’ll be a massive party from start to finish. And to pull this off, I have to be in top condition and running at full speed.” Shape's June issue hits stands -- and tablets -- on May 20.
