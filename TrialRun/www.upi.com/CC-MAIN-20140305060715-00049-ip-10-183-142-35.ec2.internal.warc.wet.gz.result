LONDON, Sept. 13 (UPI) -- British author Joanna Trollope is to write a modern re-telling of Jane Austen's 200-year-old literary classic "Sense and Sensibility," her publisher said.Trollope is the author of "The Choir" and "Friday Nights." She is to head up next year's Orange Prize for Fiction contest, as well.Her version of "Sense and Sensibility," which is about the loves and losses of the once-wealthy Dashwood sisters, is to be published in the fall of 2013 as part of a series of six HarperFiction novels that rework Austen's beloved books, the BBC said."This is a great honor and an even bigger challenge," said Trollope. "It's a hugely exciting proposal to attempt the reworking of one of the best novels written by one of our greatest novelists. This is a project which will require consummate respect above all else -- not an emulation, but a tribute.""Joanna Trollope and Jane Austen share an extraordinary ability to combine heart-rending plots with a social acuity which has powerful resonances for contemporary audiences," the BBC quoted HarperFiction publishing director Louise Joyner as saying.The authors of the updates of "Pride and Prejudice," "Emma," "Persuasion," Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" have not been announced yet.

LONDON, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- British actor Dan Stevens has confirmed he will not return for a fourth season of the popular costume drama "Downtown Abbey."The storyline for Stevens' character was wrapped up in the Season 3 Christmas special of the show, which has already aired in the United Kingdom. It won't premiere in the United States until next year. "We were always optioned for three years," Stevens told The Telegraph newspaper about his job playing romantic lead Matthew Crawley on the show. "And when that came up it was a very difficult decision. But it felt like a good time to take stock, to take a moment. From a personal point of view, I wanted a chance to do other things. It is a very monopolizing job. So there is a strange sense of liberation at the same time as great sadness because I am very, very fond of the show and always will be."Stevens can now be seen on Broadway in "The Heiress."

FBI shuts down Silk Road drug marketplace, arrests founder "Dread Pirate Roberts."	By KRISTEN BUTLER, UPI.com | Blog | Oct. 2, 2013 at 12:41 PM | Updated Oct. 2, 2013 at 4:59 PM | 0 comments

Oct. 2 (UPI) -- The so-called "Deep Web" isn't so dark thanks to media attention on the largely anonymous under-layer of the public Internet where child pornography and black market trade run rampant and Bitcoin is the favored currency.Federal authorities have shut down Silk Road, the most notorious of these online marketplaces, known for the trade of illegal drugs and guns.The FBI arrested Silk Road owner Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts," in San Francisco on Tuesday.Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.Silk Road, accessible only from through Tor Network, generated big business, according to the court filing.Total revenue generated from the site's launch until July 23, 2013, resulted in some 9,519,664 Bitcoins -- 614,305 Bitcoins of which were commission for Silk Road itself. At Bitcoins' current value, that converts to roughly $1.2 billion in revenue and $79.8 million in commissions."Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today," FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint, adding that the marketplace was a hub for "several thousand drug dealers."In addition to drugs and guns, Silk Road had listings for counterfeit currency, fake identifications and even hacking services.The government says a routine border search of a package shipped from Canada to an address in San Francisco that contained nine counterfeit IDs led them to Ulbricht.The government then identified the primary Silk Road server and obtained an image of its hard drive in July, providing federal investigators with a treasure trove of information about the Dread Pirate Roberts and Silk Road's operations.Ulbricht reportedly earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Texas in 2006, and later attended the Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering.The government shuttered the Silk Road site and seized some 26,000 Bitcoins worth approximately $3.6 million -- the largest Bitcoin seizure yet. The price of Bitcoins plummeted on news of Silk Road's closure.

CHICAGO, April 25 (UPI) -- Carlos Boozer helped stake Chicago to a big lead Thursday and the Bulls narrowly avoided a fourth-quarter collapse to edge Brooklyn 79-76.Chicago took a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series and will try to expand on that advantage when it hosts Game 4 Sunday.The Bulls led by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter and Chicago still had a 15-point advantage after Marco Belinelli hit a layup with 5:47 to play.Chicago managed only two more points the rest of the way, those coming when Nate Robinson and Joakim Noah hit one free throw each during the final 10 seconds.Noah's free throw came with 4.4 seconds remaining and Chicago survived a missed 3-point attempt by C.J. Watson that would have forced overtime.Brooklyn made just 34 percent of its field goal attempts, but eventually gave itself a chance to steal the game by holding the Bulls to 14 points in the final period.Boozer scored 22 points and grabbed 16 rebounds. Luol Deng added 21 points and 10 boards for the Bulls.Brook Lopez led the Nets with 22 points, nine rebounds and seven blocked shots. Deron Williams had 18 points for Brooklyn, but went 5-of-14 from the field.

June 12 (UPI) -- Jan Cooper wasn't about to let a man break into her house. So when Brandon Perez tried to break into the Stanton, Calif., home the 72-year-old Cooper shares with her husband, World War II veteran Bob, 85, she took matters into her own hands.Perez, 31, had hopped the fence into their backyard and, ignoring a barking Rottweiler, broke into the house. Cooper, who was already on the phone with a police dispatcher, pointed her .357 Magnum revolver at the burglar."Back up, you son of a bitch," she yelled at him. "Back up! Get out of here! Get the hell out of here! Get your butt out! Now!"Cooper fired one shot at Perez, missing him by inches."After I shot, there was rage that took hold," Cooper said. "My husband -- he's never heard me talk like that before."Perez was arrested in connection to the intrusion, and was already on probation for burglary.Cooper said she would do "what is necessary to literally stop them," if it ever happened again. "I'm not going to allow them to come into my home."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 28 (UPI) -- An op-ed piece by TV actress turned self-help author Suzanne Somers criticizing the U.S. Affordable Care Act required three corrections after posting Monday.The Wall Street Journal said the original article contained quotations from Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin and British leader Winston Churchill that could not be verified. It also said a dead horse was depicted on a Canadian magazine cover for an article that said animals get better care in Canada than people when the animal was, in fact, a dog. The Journal's correction read: "An earlier version of this post contained a quotation attributed to Lenin ('Socialized medicine is the keystone to the arch of the socialist state') that has been widely disputed. And it included a quotation attributed to Churchill ('Control your citizens' healthcare and you control your citizens') that the Journal has been unable to confirm."Somers in her article referred to Obamacare as "socialized medicine" and a "Ponzi scheme." She included an anecdote about a Canadian relative who had to wait two months to see a primary care physician and then another two weeks for a specialist who finally prescribed the pill she needed to clear up a medical problem. Somers starred in the ABC sitcom "Three's Company" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, until she was fired in a contract dispute. She has written 24 books, many of them pitching alternative medicine and hormone replacement therapy. Her post ran in a section the Journal calls "The Experts."

BRISTOL, England, July 17 (UPI) -- Two young men were charged Tuesday with setting a man on fire in what police in Bristol, England, described as a vigilante killing. Stephen Norley and Lee James, both 24, were scheduled to appear in magistrate's court Wednesday charged with murder, the Daily Mirror reported. Two women were also arrested but were released on bail. Police said the victim had been beaten and had serious head injuries. The dead man, described as being in his 40s, was found by three teenagers early Sunday, The Sun reported. The teens said they heard screams before they discovered the man on fire in front of his home. Neighbors said the man had been arrested Friday, possibly for questioning about child molesting, and then released early Saturday. Police refused to confirm that, the Sun said. "He is dead because of you," one yelled at police on the scene. "You released him into a hostile environment, and he came home to chants of 'paedo, paedo.'"
