VIENNA, March 15 (UPI) -- Romania's decision to sign off on a support agreement for the Nabucco West natural gas pipeline is indicative of the project's progress, an executive said.The Romanian government adopted the support agreement that establishes the means for the government to secure financing for the pipeline planned from Azerbaijan.The BP-led consortium managing the Shah Deniz II natural gas field in the Azeri waters of the Caspian Sea is expected by June to choose between Nabucco West and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline as its conduit to Europe."This is another important step forward, illustrating the advanced stage of development of the Nabucco pipeline, a project which will ensure the diversification and security of energy supplies in Europe," Reinhard Mitschek, managing director Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH, said in a statement.The 820-mile, 48-inch Nabucco West pipeline is part of the Southern Corridor, a planned network of natural gas pipelines meant to break the Russian grip on the regional energy sector.Russian energy company Gazprom is sending gas through the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic Sea as part of an export diversification strategy. Its planned South Stream pipeline could run through Southern Europe.

TORONTO, Aug. 3 (UPI) -- It may be 17 years since "Dynasty" went off the air, but the primetime prima donnas' battle resumes when Joan Collins and Linda Evans reunite on the stage.The "Dyansty" divas are rehearsing for "Legends," a theatrical comedy about two fading movie stars who hate each other but are forced to work together because they need the money, reported Entertainment Tonight.The characters in the play exchange heated barbs and trash-talk each other in commercials for the upcoming play."It gets as crazy as you can get," Collins tells Entertainment Tonight in an interview. "We get stoned on hash brownies. We have a pillow fight. There's a possibility that we might rip off each other's hair pieces.""Legends," which was first produced in 1986 starring Carol Channing and Mary Martin, will open in Toronto and tour the United States in hopes of winding up on Broadway in 2007.

| License Photo	SOCHI, Russia, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- The dominance of Dutch Olympic speed skating only increased Tuesday and a Norwegian barely avoided a mistake that would have haunted him for a lifetime.With the weather changing dramatically and affecting all the outdoor events at the Sochi Games, Tina Maze won her second alpine skiing gold, a disqualification affected the women's short-track relay medals for the second straight Olympics and American David Wise leaped and twisted through the snowflakes to earn the inaugural freestyle skiing halfpipe title.Leading the list of unlikely occurrences were the results turned in by skaters from the Netherlands. Even when one of the heavy favorites from that country is defeated, the person doing the defeating turns out to be a teammate.From time to time three athletes from the same country win all the medals handed out in a particular event.But it certainly does not happen four times in the same sport by the same country in the same Olympics. At least it never had until the Dutch were turned loose at the speed skating oval just a few hundred yards from the Black Sea.The finishing order might have been different than expected, but the overall results were the same Tuesday in the men's 10,000-meter race.All three medals were won by the Netherlands. It was the fourth medal sweep for the Dutch in a speed skating event at these Games and the sixth victory in the sport's nine events contested to date.Of the 27 medals awarded in speed skating, 19 have gone to the Dutch. That easily eclipses the record for most medals won in one Winter Olympics by one nation, besting the 14 won in alpine skiing by Austria in 2006.The 10,000-meter gold was won by Jorrit Bergsma, who set an Olympic record of 12:44.45. Sven Kramer had been the expected winner since he already had the 5,000-meter gold from these Games and also had revenge on his mind from a disqualification that cost him a win in the 10,000-meter race four years ago.Kramer was well ahead of Bergsma's pace heading into the final quarter of the race, but slowed dramatically and wound up almost five seconds behind. Bob de Jong finished off the medal sweep.The Netherlands has won only one medal in a sport other than speed skating, that coming in short-track, and the 20 total medals puts that country into a tie with the United States for most in these Olympics. Russia has 19 and Norway has 18. Germany leads in golds with eight, one more than Norway and two more than the Netherlands and the United States.The Americans picked up two medals as snow fell from dawn until well after dark. Alex Deibold won a bronze in the crash-filled sport of snowboard cross, where six competitors at a time slide down a twisting, hazard-filled course with only three advancing to the next round.David West then won the first gold medal awarded in freestyle skiing halfpipe, doing his high-flying tricks through the snowflakes.At the end of his winning routine, West knew he had done something special and pumped his first in the air to celebrate.West at least waited until his routine was over to celebrate, although it would have been hard for him to do any fist pumping while he was flipping and twisting his way down the halfpipe.It was easy for Emil Hagle Svendsen of Norway to express his delight a little early as he glided toward the finish line of the 15-kilometer mass start biathlon race. But it was not advisable.Svendsen opened a small gap over Martin Fourcade of France as they neared the finish line and the Norwegian assumed that gap was large enough to ensure victory. He raised both arms in the air, pointed both index fingers skyward and glided the final few yards toward his gold medal.Fourcade, however, was not through. He made an attempt to pass Svendsen in the final strides, then thrust his left ski forward in hopes it might reach the finish before Svendsen could get there. The first ski tip across the line determines the winner.Fourcade, seeking his third gold medal at these Olympics, had the same time as Svendsen -- 42:29.1. A look at the photo, however, showed Svendsen's right ski barely made it to the finish before Fourcade's left one.Moments later Svendsen could be seen resting his head onto the top of a small fence as he contemplated what he almost let get away.Maze won gold in the women's giant slalom after she had shared a victory in the downhill and a South Korean team won the women's short-track relay race for the fourth time in five Olympics. South Korea was disqualified from the race four years in Vancouver, costing it the gold medal and handing it to China. This time China was disqualified, depriving that country of a silver.In the first two runs of the women's bobsled competition, Americans Elana Meyers and Lauryn Williams turned in the fastest combined time and will try for the gold medal on Wednesday. Williams, silver medalist in the 100-meter dash at the Athens Olympics, is trying to become the fifth person to win a medal in both the Winter and Summer Games.The quarterfinals were also set in the men's hockey tournament with Russia blanking Norway 4-0, Slovenia posting a 4-0 decision over Austria, Latvia surprising Switzerland 3-1 and the Czech Republic holding off Slovakia 5-3. In the semifinals on Wednesday it will be Russia vs. Finland, Latvia vs. Canada, Slovenia vs. Sweden and the Czech Republic vs. the United States.

MADRID, May 22 (UPI) -- Crown Prince Felipe of Spain told guests at his wedding reception Saturday, "I can't hide it and I don't want to: I am a happy man."In a long and surprisingly frank speech replying to a toast by his father, King Juan Carlos I, the heir to the throne declared, "I am married to the woman I love ... Today, Letizia and myself have joined our lives in a union of love, responsibility, work, and mutual respect."More than 1,400 guests attended the reception at the royal palace in Madrid following the Roman Catholic marriage of the 35-year-old Felipe and 31-year-old Letizia, a former TV newscaster who now acquires the title of princess of Asturias."We hope to start a family," the prince said, pinpointing the main purpose of marriage in a monarchy, which is to ensure the succession. In his toast, Juan Carlos also stressed the importance of continuity.Felipe's marriage to Letizia, the king said, "born in love and mutual understanding, was a symbol of hope, an assurance of the continuation of the dynasty, and a guarantee of the stability of the parliamentary monarchy established by our constitution."While more than an estimated one-billion people watched the marriage on TV, cheering crowds braved heavy rains on the four-mile route of the royal procession.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. military said it doesn't believe North Korea is on the cusp of launching a missile despite activity seen at a launch site.North Korea in April tried to send a satellite into orbit atop a long-range rocket. The failed launch came after Pyongyang had pledged to suspend military and nuclear testing in exchange for food assistance from the United States.Satellite imagery company DigitalGlobe uncovered evidence that suggests North Korea is preparing for a launch in the coming weeks. U.S. military sources told CNN they've reviewed the images but didn't think a new launch was imminent. Sources said there were no rockets visible at the site.Nuclear tests by North Korea in 2006 and 2009 coincided with missile deployments.A string of assessments this year suggested North Korea was working on rocket developments. This month, the U.S. -Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University said information gleaned from commercial satellite imagery suggested North Korea had tested at least two rocket motors as recently as September.The government there said in October that it has missiles in its arsenal that could strike the U.S. mainland and its strategic interests in the region.

Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., has signed a plea agreement in which he admitted violating campaign finance laws, WMAQ-TV, Chicago, reported Friday.In the papers, signed within the past several days, Jackson admitted using campaign contributions for personal items such as a $40,000 Rolex watch, furniture for his Washington home and travel expenses for a friend.Those knowledgeable about the investigation said they think any remaining issues concern Jackson's wife, former Chicago Council Member Sandi Jackson, and whether she would be charged, WMAQ said.Under the terms of the deal, Jackson pleaded guilty to one count of misusing campaign funds and a judge is to decide whether to sentence him to probation or up to five years in prison.The plea agreement also requires Jackson to repay the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds he converted to his personal use.The only thing Jackson's father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr., said about his son's case Thursday was that "it's painful," WBBM-TV, Chicago, reported.The younger Jackson resigned from Congress before Thanksgiving amid a federal investigation into misuse of campaign funds and mental health issues. The former congressman had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was on medical leave from Congress since June.

| License Photo	(UPI) --Jennifer Love Hewitt's Client List character won't be taking on any more happy-ending masseuse clients, because Lifetime has canceled the 34-year-old actress' racy drama. TV Line said Friday that the network rejected a potential third season for the series, which was based on Hewitt's 2010 made-for-TV movie of the same name. Though The Client List experienced a slight ratings dip during season 2, the cancellation news comes months after Deadline reported that the network was more concerned about what Hewitt's pregnancy would mean for the show "creatively and logistically." Hewitt, who is expecting a child with co-star Brian Hallisay, who played her estranged husband. She wanted him to play the father of her child onscreen as well. Meanwhile, the showrunner wanted the show's other male star, Colin Egglesfield, to be the father. Follow @KateStan and @UPI on Twitter.
