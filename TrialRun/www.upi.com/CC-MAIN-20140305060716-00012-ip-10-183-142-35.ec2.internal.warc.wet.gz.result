MILWAUKEE, Jan. 12 (UPI) -- Seventy-five percent of U.S. adults don't increase their hand-washing habits during flu season and most don't wash long enough, a survey indicates. The fourth annual Healthy Hand Washing Survey conducted by Bradley Corp., a manufacturer of bathroom and locker room furnishings, found 57 percent of respondents estimated they washed their hands for 5 to 15 seconds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing for at least 20 seconds and suggests singing "Happy Birthday" twice to allow enough time to remove and rinse off germs.The survey also found 70 percent of U.S. adults said they always washed their hands after using a public restroom, 29 percent said they sometimes skipped washing hands and 1 percent said they never washed after using a public restroom."We were surprised to learn that Americans don't increase their hand washing during the cold and flu season," Jon Dommisse, director of global marketing & strategic development for Bradley Corporation, said in a statement. "It's so important to know that hand washing is the best way to help your body fight off cold and flu germs." The survey queried 1,046 U.S. adults -- half men and half women -- Aug. 1-3 about their hand washing habits in public restrooms. No margin of error was provided.

SAN ANTONIO, Sept. 8 (UPI) -- The New Orleans Saints could be marching in to San Antonio, at least temporarily.Former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, who has also served as U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, believes the Saints would sell at least 50,000 tickets for every game in San Antonio."I have every reason to believe that Saints games would be successful here, and that is what I conveyed to the league," he told the San Antonio Express.Saints Coach Jim Haslett says he would like the Saints to play in San Antonio because that is where the team has been practicing since being driven out of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. Saints owner Tom Benson told the NFL earlier this week he would like the team to play some games in Baton Rouge at Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium.Much of the Saints' hometown crowd is in Baton Rouge, with hundreds living in temporary quarters at Tiger Stadium.The Saints' season-opener against the New York Giants, originally scheduled to be played in the Superdome, has been moved to Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The NFL has rejected making the Saints into a permanent road team.

Superior Court Thursday afternoon to face two formal homicide charges.The searchers found a knife near the skeletal remains of the woman and officials said they saw no signs of forced entry to the home.D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said the causes of death had not yet been determined and Mayor Adrian Fenty said city officials were working to uncover details of the relationship Jacks had with the children and police, schools and child protective services.An anonymous police source told the Post that authorities believe one of the girls had not been seen in school in over a month.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 15 (UPI) -- Secret corporate money continues to swamp the American political process in the wake of the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United vs. FCC, evoking the words of an old folk song: "My father makes counterfeit money, My granny makes bathtub gin, My sister sells kisses to sailors, And oh how the money rolls in."And oh how the money is rolling in for 501(c)(4) groups that pretend to be "social welfare organizations" but are political right down to the bone. They operate in secret and get away with it because of lax or loose regulation by the Federal Elections Commission, and because "the Internal Revenue Service [has] no clear test for determining what constitutes excessive political activity by a [tax-exempt] social welfare group," The New York Times reported.The tens of millions in secret contributions are driven by what seems to be a white-hot desire to control the White House and Congress. And all early indications are that when it comes to secret money, Republican allies, making independent political expenditures, are giving President Obama an old-fashioned "whuppin.'"The previously most expensive presidential election in history, based on money spent per vote, occurred in 1896, at about $15 a head, to elect corporate friend William McKinley, the Enik Rising blog reported.Then the Tillman Act of 1907, with the encouragement of President Theodore Roosevelt, banned money contributions to national political campaigns by corporations. From that point on, costs per presidential vote stayed relatively low and steady until rising again to about $10 per vote in 2008.Then came January 2010 and Citizens United, which lifted the ban on corporate and union indirect contributions, and all the old measures became meaningless. About $4 billion was spent on those midterm elections, quadrupling the money spent in 2006.The U.S. public may never know how much money is being spent in the 2012 presidential and congressional elections. Unlike super PACs, regular political action committees and direct contributions to candidates and party committees, 501(c)(4) groups do not have to report donations or donors.Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, told Bloomberg last year, "This will be the most expensive campaign in American history."The New York Times -- finally waking up to the issue -- reported in a lead story last week that after Citizens United "relatively little money has flowed from company treasuries into 'super PACs,' which can accept unlimited contributions but must also disclose donors. Instead, there is growing evidence large corporations are trying to influence campaigns by donating money to tax-exempt organizations that can spend millions of dollars without being subject to the disclosure requirements that apply to candidates, parties and PACs. "The secrecy shrouding these groups makes a full accounting of corporate influence on the electoral process impossible," the Times said. But Times writers Mike McIntire and Nicholas Confessore said a "review of corporate governance reports, tax returns of non-profit organizations and regulatory filings by insurers and labor unions" gives a "glimpse" of their donors. Large corporations reportedly are holding off from rehiring employees until after the November elections, keeping U.S. unemployment high. They show no such reticence in doling out political money from corporate treasuries."From a redistricting fight in Minnesota to the sprawling battleground of the 2012 presidential and congressional elections, corporations are opening their wallets and altering the political world," the Times writers said. Some of the recipients of big corporate money are organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code. These 501(c)(4) groups are supposed to be "civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare," tax code regulations say, "or local associations of employees, the membership of which is limited to the employees of a designated person or persons in a particular municipality, and the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational or recreational purposes."The Times said the secrecy allows corporations to donate money to 501(c)(4) groups while "shielding corporate contributors from shareholders or others unhappy with their political positions."The OpenSecrets blog of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington says the Supreme Court ruling "allowed non-profit corporations under the Tax Code 501(c) to spend unlimited amounts of money running ... political advertisements while not revealing their donors." The blog said conservative non-profit groups have "spent $121 million without disclosing where the money came from."The Center for Public Integrity reports 62 percent of the money raised by the two conservative groups "associated with former Bush adviser Karl Rove have come from mystery donors."Rove and fellow former Bush adviser Ed Gillespie founded two groups in 2010 after the Citizens United ruling: American Crossroads, a super PAC which has to report the sources of funds, and Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, a non-profit organized under section 501(c) of the U.S. Tax Code, which doesn't have to say where its money originates.The center reports the two groups raised $123 million from 2010 through the end of 2011, but the lion's share, $76.8 million, went to the non-profit.Bloomberg reported last year Crossroads GPS and American Crossroads doubled their initial fundraising target to $240 million, after raising $71 million in 2010.Crossroads GPS has fewer than 100 donors, all of them secret.The Times said its review showed corporations, including Prudential Financial, Dow Chemical and drug maker Merck, poured millions into the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a tax-exempt trade group that has pledged to spend at least $50 million on political advertising this election cycle. The national chamber largely backs Republican candidates. The Times said as a non-profit "business league" under the tax code, the chamber does not have to disclose donors who helped finance its $33 million in political ads in the 2010 midterm elections. Not everyone is a fan of the chamber's political activity.Writing in the blog of The Nation online, George Zornick said, "We don't know much about how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce funds its political campaigns. In fact, that's the essential feature of its operations -- as a 501(c)(6) trade organization, the chamber has no obligation to disclose who funds its electioneering campaigns, and so corporations can give massive amounts of money to the chamber without having any fingerprints on the resulting attack ads that hammer Democrats and push for industry deregulation."The blog points out that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has issued wide-ranging subpoenas targeting $18 million allegedly channeled through charitable groups to the chamber allegedly to achieve political ends.Despite that investigation, U.S. regulatory agencies are having a tough time keeping up with the pace of independent political spending.Bloomberg pointed out last year that Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., was faced with a barrage of attack ads funded by tax-exempt groups such as the American Future Fund before he knew who his Republican challenger would be this year. Nelson since has decided to retire at the end of his term rather than seek re-election in November.The Times article notes tax-exempt groups are allowed to begin raising and spending money even before the IRS formally recognizes them.A case in point: Two years after helping Republicans win control of the House, Rove's Crossroads GPS's application for tax-exempt status is still pending. Also still pending is a petition by 10 corporate law professors who call themselves the "Committee on Disclosure of Corporate Political Spending." Last August, the group submitted a "petition for rulemaking" to the Securities and Exchange Commission with a simple message: "We ask that the commission develop rules to require public companies to disclose to shareholders the use of corporate resources for political activities."In other words, if executives want to participate in high-stakes politics using corporate funds, they should have to publicly tell stockholders, who actually own the funds, what they're doing.The committee is composed of "10 academics [from Harvard, Columbia, Yale and similar institutions] whose teaching and research focus on corporate and securities law.""We differ in our views on the extent to which corporate political spending is beneficial for, or detrimental to, shareholder interests," the group told the SEC. "We all share, however, the view that information about corporate spending on politics is important to shareholders -- and that the commission's rules should require this information to be disclosed."Disclosure of corporate political spending is necessary not only because shareholders are interested in receiving such information, but also because such information is necessary for corporate accountability and oversight mechanisms to work," the petition argued."Absent disclosure, shareholders are unable to hold directors and executives accountable when they spend corporate funds on politics in a way that departs from shareholder interests."The SEC is under no obligation to act on the petition.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Aug. 23 (UPI) -- U.S. officials held a flurry of talks internally and with allies about possible military action against Syria amid charges of deadly chemical weapons attacks.Senior officials from the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies -- including Secretary of State John Kerry, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Dempsey and National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- met for 3 1/2 hours at the White House Thursday to consider options, officials said.The options ranged from a Tomahawk cruise-missile strike to a more sustained air campaign against the Assad regime, officials told The New York Times.No decision was made, officials said.Several news organizations reported a deepening division in the administration between those advocating sending a harsh military message to President Bashar Assad or those who argue such action would be irresponsible and badly timed.Dempsey this week urged caution, saying even limited military action could embroil the United States in a deeply rooted, multifaceted conflict whose rebels have not shown they would align with U.S. interests if they defeated Assad.Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is among those believed advocating a tougher military response, British newspaper The Guardian reported.Officials would not say Thursday who advocated what position in the White House meeting.Kerry also held seven calls with his overseas counterparts Thursday, including French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who raised the prospect of military action; Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu; the Jordanian and Qatari foreign ministers; European Union senior foreign policy official Catherine Ashton, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.He also spoke with opposition Syrian National Coalition President Ahmad al-Jarba to express U.S. condolences to the Syrian people over the loss of life and for the pain and suffering, she said.More than 1,100 people were reported killed in Wednesday's assault, which opposition officials said began shortly after 2 a.m., when Russian-type Grad rockets, similar to those the Palestinian Sunni Islamic group Hamas has fired into Israel, were launched -- two from a highway bridge and others from a Damascus factory.The Assad regime has denied involvement, and Russia has accused the rebels of staging the attack."If we find these reports are true, then we will feel that this has significantly expanded the escalation of the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime," Psaki told reporters Thursday."The president, the national security team, would certainly have decisions to make, and they have a range of options to decide between," she said.Among the options discussed at the White House meeting was a Tomahawk long-range cruise-missile strike from a U.S. destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, officials told the Times.Another option would be combat aircraft -- jet fighters and bombers -- that could mount an air campaign with munitions launched from far outside Syrian territory, the newspaper said.Targets discussed for that campaign include missile or artillery batteries that launch chemical munitions or nerve gas, as well symbols of Assad's power, such as government headquarters and offices, officials told the newspaper.

ROME, April 27 (UPI) -- The United States has lifted a ban on the import of Italian cured meats, which could mean more than $325 million in export revenues for Italy, officials said.The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced the ban on Italian cured meats will be lifted May 28, Italy's ANSA news agency reported."This is a momentous event -- one of the most important for the production and export of Italian salami and the result of 15 years of [lobbying] work," Italian industry association Assica said."Until now Americans have been forced to buy low-quality imitations of Italian cured meats," said farmers' organization Coldiretti.The ban, put in place by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, cost Italy's cured meat industry more than $325 million annually in exports since it was put in place, Coldiretti said.

"Saturday Night Live" made fun of its own problems with diversity when Kerry Washington hosted over the weekend. Posted By Kate Stanton | Nov. 3, 2013 at 7:46 PM | 0 comments

(UPI) --"I feel like it's been years since I've seen you," Jay Pharoah's Barack Obama said when Kerry Washington showed up as Michele Obama during Saturday Night Live's cold open this week. He meant that the show hasn't had a black actress to play the first lady since Maya Rudolph guest-hosted in February of last year. Lorne Michael's iconic sketch show has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks, since Pharoah said in a September interview that SNL's cast was "too white." Kenan Thompson said last month that he had no interest in dressing in drag to play black women in the news. "I don't know. We just haven't done them. That's what I'm saying. Maybe [Jay Pharaoh] will do it or something, but even he doesn't really want to do it," Thompson said. SNL was frank about their own lack of diversity in the cold open, throwing this written message on to the screen while Washington changed into her Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce costumes: The producers of Saturday Night Live would like to apologize to Kerry Washington for the number of black women she will be asked to play tonight. We made these requests both because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because SNL does not currently have a black woman in the cast. As for the latter reason, we agree this is not an ideal situation and look forward to rectifying it in the near future…unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.
