NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 13 (UPI) -- Finding no oil but natural gas at an offshore Kenya exploration well, Apache Corp. said the zone deserves further evaluation from its partners.Apache said it encountered around 170 feet of natural gas across three zones during drilling offshore at the Mbawa-1 well."Although no oil was encountered, the presence of hydrocarbons warrants further evaluation," the company said in a statement.British energy company Tullow, one of Apache's partners, expressed similar sentiments about the region this week. The company said it drilled to 10,338 feet to examine a secondary target but no hydrocarbons were found.Energy companies are eying potential basins in the West African country. Kenyan Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying that while no resources proved commercial thus far, there was cause for optimism."The results give us encouragement that the next well to be drilled in the block will likely result in a bigger discovery because of the geological information being gathered from this well," he said.Kenya is to have presidential elections in 2013. More than 1,000 people were killed in fighting between supporters of President Mwai Kibaki and those of rival Raila Odinga, now prime minister, during 2007 elections. Tribal violence and fallout from conflict in neighboring Somalia have become heightened security threats.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (UPI) -- An episode of "Hannah Montana," featuring a story line about a teen diagnosed with diabetes, won't air as planned, a representative for the U.S. show said. The New York Daily News said the Disney Channel decided to yank the episode, which is about Hannah's friend Oliver learning he has the disease, because of criticism from parents who previewed the show in an on-demand version. Miley Cyrus plays Hannah and Mitchell Musso plays Oliver."During the scriptwriting stage of the 'Hannah Montana' episode in question (entitled 'No Sugar, Sugar'), the matter of depicting a character with diabetes was reviewed by our Standards and Practices executives who consulted with medical experts to inform the story and ensure that it was told responsibly," the Daily News quoted a spokeswoman as saying Monday. "Notwithstanding the measures we took, and based on the episode's preview and early feedback from parents (who saw it on demand and/or mobile platforms,) we removed the episode from Sunday's schedule and are now re-evaluating it."

| License Photo	VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 8 (UPI) -- Girls who received two doses of human papillomavirus vaccine had immune responses not worse than those who had three doses, Canadian researchers say. Dr. Simon R. M. Dobson of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and colleagues conducted a study to determine whether average antibody levels to HPV-16 and HPV-18 among girls receiving two doses were non-inferior -- not worse than -- to women receiving three doses. The study authors also looked at antibody levels to HPV-6 and HPV-11, and compared girls given two or three doses. The randomized, phase 3, multicenter study included 830 Canadian females from August 2007 through February 2011. Follow-up blood samples were provided by 675 participants. Girls age 9-13 were randomized 1:1 to receive three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at 0, two, and six months or two doses at 0 and six months. Young women age 16-26 years received three doses at 0, two and six months. Antibody levels were measured at 0, seven, 18, 24, and 36 months. "Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in women. HPV infection has been identified as a necessary cause for the development of cervical cancer, with HPV genotypes 16 and 18 accounting for approximately 70 percent of cervical cancer cases," the study said. "Global use of HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer is impeded by cost. A two-dose schedule for girls might be possible.""The geometric mean titer ratios for girls at two doses to women at three doses remained non-inferior for all genotypes to 36 months. Antibody responses in girls were non-inferior after two doses vs. three doses for all four vaccine genotypes at month seven, but not for HPV-18 by month 24 or HPV-6 by month 36."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, yielded the floor for the last time Thursday, saying goodbye to colleagues and staff from the floor of the Senate.Stevens, convicted of failing to report millions in gifts on Senate disclosure forms, said his philosophy has been "to hell with politics, just do what's right for Alaska. I've tried every day to live up to those words."Stevens conceded to his successor, Democrat Mark Begich, the mayor of Anchorage, who was declared the winner this week after Alaskan election officials began counting absentee and provisional ballots."I feel blessed by God to have served in this body," Stevens said, adding he feels the same way now as he did when he was first elected in 1968. "When Alaska needed a strong voice ... I did the best I could."He said he doesn't have a "rear-view mirror," and still envisions a day when he will be cleared of the felony charges."I yield the floor for the last time," he said.His comments were followed by a lengthy standing ovation by other senators in the chamber.Stevens is the longest serving Republican in the Senate. He has been a member of the Senate since Dec. 24, 1968.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (UPI) -- The U.S. presidential campaign mostly stood down Tuesday due to preoccupation with post-tropical Cyclone Sandy but politics was in play just the same.The White House said President Barack Obama was focusing on the government's response to the storm -- which has been blamed for at least 39 deaths in the United States, and at least 107 overall -- and Republican nominee Mitt Romney held what his campaign called a storm relief event in Ohio.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- whose state took the first, and possibly the worst, hit from Sandy -- said in several interviews Tuesday the president has been handling the storm admirably.He told NBC Obama "deserves great credit."Christie said on Fox News he had been in constant contact with the president, who called the governor at midnight Monday night to ask "what he could do.""I said, if you can expedite designating New Jersey as a major disaster area that that would help us to get federal money and resources in here as quickly as possible to help clean up the damage here," Christie said."The president was great last night," he said, telling Fox viewers he got a call 2 hours later from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the president signed the emergency declaration early Tuesday."He's done -- as far as I'm concerned -- a great job for New Jersey," Christie said.When a Fox News host asked Christie whether Romney would go to New Jersey for "some storm-related event," Christie responded with the kind of blunt talk that has helped make him a national figure in the Republican Party."I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested," he said. "I've got a job to do here in New Jersey that's much bigger than presidential politics and I could [sic] care less about any of that stuff."I've got 2.4 million people out of power. I've got devastation on the shore. I've got floods in the northern part of my state. If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics, then you don't know me."At an event in Kettering, Ohio, near Dayton -- attended by former NASCAR driver Richard Petty and country music singer Randy Owen -- Romney helped gather donations and urged supporters Tuesday to help those affected by the storm."We have heavy hearts, as you know, with all of the suffering going on in a major part of our country," he said. "A lot of people are hurting this morning and they were hurting last night."However, USA Today said the event "looked like a campaign rally and sounded like one."Although Romney did not deliver his customary stump speech, the event featured the screening of a film biography of the nominee and some of those attending chanted, "We want Mitt!" before he spoke.Former President Bill Clinton appeared at a campaign rally at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, using the storm as a context for criticizing Romney's policy on climate change, CBS News reported."He ridiculed the president [during their first debate] for his efforts to fight global warming in economically efficient ways," Clinton said."In the real world, Barack Obama's policies work better," he said.The Romney campaign Tuesday released a memo from its political director claiming battleground states Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- which previously appeared to be in Obama's column -- were trending toward Romney, The Hill reported."With one week to go, and 96 percent of the vote on the table on Election Day in Pennsylvania, this expansion of the electoral map demonstrates that Governor Romney's momentum has jumped containment from the usual target states and has spread to deeper blue states that Chicago never anticipated defending," the memo read.The Hill noted the RealClearPolitics average of polls show Obama leads Romney by 4.7 percent in Pennsylvania.Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said the Romney campaign was posturing and Obama is "leading or tied in every battleground state across the country, and he leads early voting in every state across the country," The Hill reported."Three things are now absolutely clear in this race -- we have a significant early vote advantage in states from North Carolina to Nevada, there is no Romney momentum in the battleground states, and the Romney campaign has found itself with a tremendously narrow and improbable path to 270 electoral votes," Messina wrote in a memo.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Monday refused to review a challenge to the National Security Agency's collection of domestic telephone records.The challenge brought by Washington's Electronic Privacy Information Center centered on a special judges' panel set up under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and its order to Verizon to produce data for the NSA.Congress enacted FISA "to authorize and regulate certain governmental electronic surveillance ofcommunications for foreign intelligence purposes," EPIC's petition said. "In the act, Congress authorized [FISA] judges ... to approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes."But the FISA court "compelled Verizon Business Network Services to produce to the National SecurityAgency, on an ongoing basis, all of the call detail records of Verizon customers."EPIC wanted the Supreme Court to decide whether "the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court exceeded its narrow statutory authority to authorize foreign intelligence surveillance, under [the federal law] whenit ordered Verizon to disclose records to the National Security Agency for all telephone communications wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls."The Supreme Court refused to step in, without comment. But the refusal sets no precedent, and the high court may be asked to review other challenges in the future.It was the first NSA challenge to reach the Supreme Court since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden fled the country with a bag of the agency's secrets, eventually finding temporary asylum in Russia, SCOTUSBLOG.com reported.

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, May 14 (UPI) -- Police said they questioned a teacher in Alexandria, Egypt, Tuesday for asking a politicized question on an exam that insulted President Mohamed Morsi.The question included the statement: "In the animal kingdom, a sheep cannot be king."Critics often accuse Muslim Brotherhood members of acting like sheep by following the orders of the group's leader, Ahram Online said. But English teacher Ihab el-Islamboly told Ahram Online he did not intend to insult the president and the quote is part of the curriculum. "What part of this quote has anything to do with the president or politics?" el-Islamboly asked. The incident comes after a deputy education minister in the Kafr el-Sheik area of Egypt ordered a punishment for a teacher Saturday. The teacher included a question involving an imaginary dialogue between ousted President Hosni Mubarak and Morsi, Ahram Online said.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 (UPI) -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn passed away Sunday at the age of 89 after one of the most extraordinary lives in the history of world literature.Solzhenitsyn had long since passed out of fashion and even been mostly forgotten by the conventional academia of the West, and since the economic recovery and political stabilization and reintegration of Russia under President Vladimir Putin, he had even become a largely forgotten irrelevance in his own country. But his stature as a novelist of genius, moral stature and political acumen of comparable stature to Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky was already established four decades ago. No individual did more to shatter the political and moral credibility of Soviet communism at home, or to awaken hundreds of millions of people across the West to its genocides, purges, absurdities and reprehensible nature.Solzhenitsyn's first published novel, "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich," shattered the taboos of terror and silence about openly describing the Soviet labor and concentration camp system for the first time in the nearly 45 years since the Bolshevik regime was established in 1917. His two gigantic classic novels, "The First Circle" and "Cancer Ward," compare favorably in their scope, brilliance and insights into the human condition with anything Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky ever wrote. In recognition for these achievements, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. Then his enormous "Gulag Archipelago," published in three volumes in the West through the 1970s, was the most documented, vivid and impassioned history and indictment of the entire Soviet system of tyranny.As a writer alone, Solzhenitsyn established himself as one of the finest and most important who ever lived. But his own entire life was an epic. Born already an orphan after his father died before his birth in a hunting accident, he grew up in appalling privation in Ukraine during the darkest years of Stalinist repression. As a boy he lived through the holodymyr -- the famine-genocide imposed by the Soviet authorities from 1929 to 1932 that killed up to 10 million Ukrainian peasants in what historian Robert Conquest called "The Harvest of Sorrow." (Solzhenitsyn, however, in later life, fiercely denied that the communist repression in Ukraine was in fact a genocide.) He studied mathematics at Rostov State University and fought through World War II -- known to Russians as the Great Patriotic War -- as a brave counter-artillery officer. He spent almost four years continually in the front lines of the largest, fiercest and bloodiest military campaign in human history.There was no relief for him when the war wound down. Comments in a letter he wrote to a friend criticizing Stalin's policy of universal pillage, rape and destruction in the conquest of Germany brought Solzhenitsyn to the attention of the Soviet secret police, and he was thrown into the Gulag concentration camp system for an eight-year sentence under Article 58 of the Stalinist penal code. Finally released into perpetual exile in Kazakhstan and into extreme poverty in 1953, he could not even enjoy the most modest pleasures of freedom in the arid semi-desert steppe of Central Asia. He fell deathly ill: It was diagnosed as stomach cancer.At this moment, in the most extraordinary and miraculous of developments, his luck lastingly changed for the better: He proved abnormally resistant to the negative effects of X-rays during treatments at a hospital in Tashkent in what is today independent Uzbekistan. His tumor was bombarded and went into remission. He fully recovered and led an full, active and amazingly productive life for more than another half-century.Even during his years in the Gulag, Solzhenitsyn had, at enormous risk to his survival, been gathering eyewitness accounts, statistics and every kind of fact, and he had been writing first drafts of his seminal works and memorizing them. After his release, he spent more than 20 years outwitting the Soviet internal security services, the most efficient, repressive, largest and long-lived secret police organizations in history. He continued his research, wrote his manuscripts and hid them successfully under the eyes of the so-called security "organs." He later told the remarkable story of those years of defiance in his autobiographical memoir "The Oak and the Calf." He became a devout lifelong Christian in the Russian Orthodox tradition.Solzhenitsyn succeeded in getting "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" published within the Soviet Union in 1962 in the literary magazine Novy Mir ("New World"). Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev personally approved its publication. His great novels had to be smuggled out and published in the West. But once "Gulag Archipelago" started appearing, for the rulers in the Kremlin, it was the last straw.Solzhenitsyn was by then already a Nobel laureate, and he had become far too much of a world figure to be quietly disposed of. Even the Soviets did not dare murder him or imprison him or fake his "accidental" death or fictitious "suicide." He was flown into exile in Frankfurt, West Germany. Eventually, he settled in Vermont in the United States. He lived there, working on yet more ambitious works, and survived to see the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In 1994 he returned with his family to live in the chaotic, destitute and crime-ridden but certainly free Russia of President Boris Yeltsin. He even had his own TV show for a while in which he fulminated at the sufferings, social privations, excesses, corruption and abuses of the new Russia. In his last years, he fell out of critical favor in the West and was forgotten as a relic of a long-dead past at home in Russia. The enormous historical novels of "The Red Wheel" on which he toiled in his later years proved to be unreadable, even to his greatest admirers. And the revisions he made on his classic early novels, especially "The First Circle," made them appear simplistic and strident compared with the perfect pitch of the first published editions.But in death and after, his miraculous achievements far outshadowed his understandable human limitations: Alexander Solzhenitsyn defied, survived and helped bury a monstrous system of tyranny that claimed even more lives than the Nazi Germany of Adolf Hitler. His work and testimony stripped the last remaining rose-colored spectacles regarding the Soviet system from the eyes of Western leftists and other sympathizers. He consciously saw himself as the latest descendant and heir in the great line of Russia literary and moral titans. And he proved to be a living example of the power of literature and moral dissent. He proved the truth of his conviction that "One Word of Truth Can Change the Whole World," and that, contrary to the most fundamental dictates of the Marxist-Leninist secular faith, the efforts of a single individual really do matter and can indeed transform the world for the better.

Wiki
Phileas Fogg is the main fictional character in the 1873 Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days.
Accompanied by his manservant, Passepartout, Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the late Victorian world in 80 days, or less, on a wager of £20,000 set by the Reform Club. He takes the wager and on that day leaves with Passepartout, vowing to return by 8.45 pm on Saturday 21 December 1872. Under suspicion of robbing the Bank of England, he is followed by a detective named Fix. Fogg has no idea about Fix's true intentions and Fix (wanting to get Fogg back to England so that he can arrest him) works with Fogg in the last half of the book.
While in India he saves a widowed princess, named Aouda, from a tribe of natives who wish to sacrifice her. Passepartout rescues her and she accompanies Fogg for the rest of his journey. She and Fogg eventually fall in love and marry at the end of the book. Fix, who is really supposed to arrest Fogg, attempts to sabotage him by putting him in prison near the end of the book but he is quickly released.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
