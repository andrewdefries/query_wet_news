'MONSTER' SMASH"Monsters, Inc." is rewriting box-office record books for animated features.The newest entry from Disney and Pixar grossed $45.5 million in its second weekend, reaching the $100 million mark faster than any other animated movie.Through Sunday, "Monsters, Inc." had taken in $122.1 million in its first 10 days in release, exceeding the 10-day total of "Toy Story 2," which went on to gross $245.7 million in 1999 and reach No. 18 on the list of all-time U.S. box-office hits."Monsters, Inc." is on a box-office roll, but its momentum could be slowed considerably this weekend when "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" opens on what is shaping up as a record number of screens. "Harry Potter" already is making box-office history, with record numbers of advance ticket sales.KIRK AND MICHAEL TOGETHER -- FOR THE FIRST TIMEAccording to a report in Daily Variety, Michael Douglas and Kirk Douglas will make a movie together -- the first time the Oscar-winning actor and his screen legend dad have worked together on the big screen.The project is "Smack in the Puss," described as a black comedy about three generations of a bickering family trying to settle their differences and behave like a family. Variety reported that Michael Douglas' 23-year-old son, Cameron, is likely to join his dad and granddad in the cast.Michael Douglas told Variety he decided to postpone "Till Death Do Us Part" with Billy Crystal so he could make this movie with his father, largely as a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks."A lot of this came out of Sept. 11, which has made everyone question their life's priorities," Douglas said. "If you have a rare opportunity to work with people you know in an appropriate project, you take it. I realized this offered the perfect chance to finally do a picture with my father."Michael Douglas said he and his father had come close " couple of times" but had never been able to agree in the past on a movie they could make together."He is pretty picky and so am I," said the star of "Wall Street," "Fatal Attraction" and "Basic Instinct.""We've found a lovely script that's not simply us venting our demons," he said. "There are great parts here."RAMBO IV?According to a report in London's Sunday Times, Sylvester Stallone is thinking of putting John Rambo back in the saddle for another tour in Afghanistan -- 13 years after the former Green Beret went behind enemy lines to rescue his former boss from a mountain fortress.The paper quotes sources who say the new Rambo movie would feature Stallone going mano-a-mano with the Taliban. Stallone is reportedly working on the screenplay now.Stallone has played John Rambo three times -- in "First Blood" (1982); "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985); and "Rambo III" (1988).STARS, POLS, COME OUT AGAINST AGEISMFormer Screen Actors Guild president Ed Asner and newly elected SAG treasurer Kent McCord will join other professional entertainers at the witness table Wednesday when California lawmakers hold a hearing in Los Angeles on age discrimination in the entertainment industry.The Assembly Committee and Senate Subcommittee on Aging will hold the hearing at the Los Angeles Film School Theater.The Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild of America, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and Women in Film also plan to send representatives to the hearing, which is examining the pros and cons of a bill in Sacramento that backers say would "break down negative stereotypes" about aging.Senate Bill 953 would recruit entertainment industry players in a media campaign to educate Californians about the value of older adults and life experience.CALIFORNIA OFFERS HOLLYWOOD A HELPING HANDCalifornia Gov. Gray Davis is making more than three dozen state properties available at no or low cost for use as locations for movie and TV production.The properties -- including the Metropolitan Hospital in Norwalk, numerous historic houses throughout Pasadena, and the 10-story State Building in downtown Los Angeles -- are being offered through a program operated by the California Film Commission."California is the leading production location the world over," said Davis. "By making more public properties available, we will enhance California's dominance in the entertainment industry while boosting our state's economy."The State Building will be featured in the upcoming screen adaptation of Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lechter book, "Red Dragon," starring Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton.

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 22 (UPI) -- An anti-bacterial agent called triclosan used in many hand soaps has been detected in increasing amounts in several Minnesota freshwater lakes, researchers say.Scientists at the University of Minnesota say the findings are directly linked to the increasing use of such anti-bacterial soaps and other products over the past decades.The researchers also reported detecting chemical compounds called chlorinated triclosan derivatives, created when triclosan is exposed to chlorine during wastewater disinfection processes.When exposed to sunlight both triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives form dioxins that have potential toxic effects in the environment, they said.Triclosan is added to many consumer products including soaps and body washes, toothpastes, cosmetics, clothing, dish washing liquid and kitchenware."It's important for people to know that what they use in their house every day can have an impact in the environment far beyond their home," university engineering Professor William Arnold said. "Consumers need to know that they may be using products with triclosan. People should read product labels to understand what they are buying."The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has found no evidence triclosan in anti-bacterial soaps and body washes provide any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.

OKLAHOMA CITY, June 15 (UPI) -- LeBron James hit two free throws with 7 seconds left Thursday, enabling Miami to hold off Oklahoma City 100-96 and deadlock the NBA championship series.James scored 32 points and helped the Heat rush to an 18-2 lead, but the Thunder came close to stealing the contest after trailing by seven in the final minute.With the series tied at 1-1, Miami will host the next three games and have a chance to win the NBA title at home. The first of those contests will be played Sunday.A Miami win appeared to be a certainty after Chris Bosh slammed home a dunk to give the Heat a 98-91 cushion with 58 seconds to go.Kevin Durant then made a layup for the Thunder and, after a timeout, Dwyane Wade committed a turnover that was quickly turned into a 3-point shot by Durant.James then missed a 3-pointer with 15 seconds to go and Oklahoma City had a chance to tie, which the Thunder attempted to do on a baseline jumper by Durant. Durant's shot misfired, however, and James grabbed the rebound -- setting up the two free throws that clinched the victory.Wade scored 24 points, Shane Battier had 17 and Bosh produced 16 in his first start since suffering an abdominal strain during the second-round series against Indiana.Bosh missed nine playoff games with the injury and then came off the bench in four contests, including the opener of the Oklahoma City series.Durant led the Thunder with 32 points, Russell Westbrook scored 27 and James Harden produced 21.

CAIRO, July 23 (UPI) -- Egyptians need a justice system in place to ensure national reconciliation can open the door to political reform, interim Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei said.Political violence in Egypt is in its third week. Protests turned violent when the Egyptian military removed former President Mohamed Morsi from power July 3.Egyptian prosecutors opened an investigation into clashes between pro-Morsi supporters and the military, which has left more than 50 people dead.ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, said justice and reconciliation are the only means of resolving Egypt's political crisis."The sooner we realize this the more lives will be saved," he was quoted by al-Ahram as saying Tuesday.Morsi became the first democratically elected president in Egyptian history in June 2012. ElBaredei stayed largely on the sidelines as an opposition figure during the post-revolutionary period before the election.The Egyptian military is accused of holding Morsi captive. He's not been seen in public since his ouster.Western governments have been reluctant to categorize the ouster as a military coup. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the situation in Egypt is "very complex."A coup declaration would inhibit foreign aid to Egypt. The British government last week said it was restricting some military assistance in response to the unrest.

| License Photo	CAIRO, July 31 (UPI) -- Newly elected Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi "is his own man" and is committed to democracy, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Tuesday in Cairo.Morsi "is the president of all the Egyptian people and he is truly committed to implementing democratic reforms," Panetta said after their meeting at the presidential palace, the Defense Department reported. Egypt's defense minister, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, also attended the meeting.Panetta said Morsi and Tantawi have a good relationship and share the same goals."I was pleased to hear Field Marshal Tantawi confirm his continuing commitment to transition to full civilian rule," Panetta said, adding the U.S.-Egypt defense relationship "has been an anchor of regional stability for more than 30 years, and a positive force during this transition.""We have a history of working with the Egyptian military leadership. We will continue to provide the aid and assistance we can to help them in this effort," Panetta said. "Our goal, frankly, is an Egypt that can secure itself in the region."Panetta then traveled to Israel, where he was scheduled to discuss the nuclear threat Iran poses to the region.Israeli and U.S. leaders "continue to work together in the effort to ensure that Iran does not reach that point of developing a nuclear weapon," Panetta said in Cairo before leaving for Tel Aviv."What we are discussing is various contingencies and how we would respond. We don't talk about specific military plans. We continue to run a number of options in that area, but the discussions I will have in Israel [will be to determine] the threat we are confronting and to share both information and intelligence on it," he said.

Jan. 25 (UPI) -- On Thursday McDonald's announced that it will now sell fish sandwiches and "Fishy McBites" in blue boxes with an Eco-label seal from the Marine Stewardship Council.This means that McDonald's "has agreed to audits to verify its fish comes only from Alaskan pollock, certified by the council as sustainably caught," the company said in a statement. In return, they'll be able to use the Marine Stewardship Council logo in all of their fish meals."The certification and labeling program provides a mechanism to identify and reward existing good practice," Rupert Howes, the CEO of the Marine Stewardship Council said.The partnership will be mutually beneficial for the food chain and the council, as it'll give McDonald's a chance to talk about its sustainability efforts and it'll provide a boost in visibility to the Marine Stewardship Council, the LA Times reported."It's exciting for us," Susan Forsell, McDonald's vice president of sustainability for the U.S market said. Adding that this would not only mean that the company's fish offerings would be coming from one of the most prestigious U.S. fisheries, but it would be a chance for U.S. employees to talk about McDonald's' efforts to begin sourcing its food products in a sustainable way. McDonald's has been successfully using the Marine Stewardship Council Eco-label in their fish meals in Europe since 2011 and according to the Marine Stewardship Council's CEO, the chains' decision to use certified sustainable sea food is a win-win-win for everyone involved."Working with companies like McDonald's who preference certified sustainable sea food, we can encourage less well managed fisheries into the program where the have to make improvements to the way they fish the oceans. This is good news for consumers, good news for the environment and it's good news for business," Howes said. © 2013 United Press International, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The statuette given, a nude male figure holding both a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy, is called "The Actor".[1] It is 16 inches tall, weighs over 12 pounds, cast in solid bronze, and produced by the American Fine Arts Foundry in Burbank, California.[2]
SAG Awards have been one of the major awards events in Hollywood since 1995. Nominations for the awards come from 4200 randomly selected members of the union, with the full membership (120,000 as of 2007) available to vote for the winners. The awards have been televised for the past several years on TNT, but now also airs on TBS.
The inaugural SAG Awards aired live on February 25, 1995 from Stage 12, Universal Studios. The second SAG awards aired live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, while subsequent awards have been held at the Shrine Exposition Center.[3] Bob Hope was given the first award.
