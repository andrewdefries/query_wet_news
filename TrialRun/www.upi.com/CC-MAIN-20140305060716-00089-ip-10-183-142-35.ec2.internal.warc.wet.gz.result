MOSCOW, June 28 (UPI) -- Russian energy company Gazprom said it was setting up a special-purpose company to oversee development of an LNG facility in the Far East.Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said the company, Gazprom LNG Vladivostok, was set up to oversee operations for a liquefied natural gas facility in the eastern Russian coast.The Vladivostok facility will have a production capacity of 15 million tons of LNG when it comes on stream in 2018.Gazprom said Thursday plans were under way to commission a natural gas field associated with the facility. Four exploration wells were planned in the region through 2014 and plans are under way to perform a survey of the potential for more gas reserves."Work is in progress on the preparation of a resource base for the Vladivostok-LNG project," the company said. "Pro-active efforts are being made to market the gas of the Vladivostok-LNG project and talks are under way with potential customers in Asia-Pacific."Gazprom considers Far East natural gas developments as a strategic link for Asian markets. Japan in particular is looking for new sources of energy following the 2011 meltdown of its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Japan relies completely on LNG for its natural gas needs. Russian natural gas makes up about 8 percent of Japan's annual needs.

Joey Prusak, Dairy Queen manager, gets national attention for good deed, returning $20 stolen from blind customer.	By KRISTEN BUTLER, UPI.com | Blog | Sept. 20, 2013 at 8:37 AM | 0 comments

Sept. 20 (UPI) -- Joey Prusak was working at a suburban Minneapolis Dairy Queen when he noticed a blind customer drop a $20 bill -- and saw a woman pick it up and put it in her purse.When the woman got to the counter, Prusak politely asked her to return the money to the young man who dropped it, and she refused, claiming it was hers.Prusak said again that the money was not hers, and after going back and forth with the woman, said, "Please return the $20 or get out of the store, because I'm not going to serve someone as disrespectful as you."The woman left the store without returning the money, after yelling and swearing at 19-year-old Prusak.Then Prusak took $20 out of his own wallet and gave it to the blind man "on behalf of Dairy Queen" and apologized for the incident.One customer who witnessed the incident wrote a lengthy email to Dairy Queen in praise of Prusak, saying she "never would have expected" such an act of kindness."I was in shock by the generosity that your employee had," the customer wrote. "I would proudly like to say that Joey has forever sealed my fate as a life long customer of [Dairy Queen]. Thank you for outstanding customer service and for an even better experience."The email went viral after being shared online, and now the store has seen its traffic double, and customers have been calling the store to thank Prusak and even offer him jobs.Prusak, who says he just did what most people would have done in that situation, has been working at the Dairy Queen since he was 14 saving up money to go to business school. He has been manager of the store since earlier this year.Even billionaire Warren Buffet, whose company owns Dairy Queen, called Prusak and thanked him for being a role model to other employees. International Dairy Queen is now figuring out how to reward Prusak for his good deed.

IRVING, Texas, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- The Dallas Cowboys have signed free agent tight end Tony McGee, who has 11 years NFL experience.McGee, who played 10 seasons in Cincinnati before joining the Cowboys in 2002, likely will be available Sunday, when the Cowboys host Philadelphia. He signed with Tampa Bay after being released by Dallas on the final cutdown day this summer, but lasted just four days with the Buccaneers.McGee was signed after the Cowboys learned that backup tight end Jason Whitten will be out for a time after suffering a broken jaw in last Sunday's 24-7 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Another backup, James Whalen, a special teams demon, has a strained hamstring.With the Cowboys last season, McGee had 23 receptions for 294 yards and one touchdown while playing in all 16 games.To make room on their roster, Dallas waived defensive tackle Michael Myers, who had been with the team the past five years.

HOLLYWOOD, Fla., April 3 (UPI) -- A Florida golf teacher, charged with molesting a 13-year-old boy, faces new charges after a 15-year-old boy made similar allegations, police said.Ricardo Moreno, 52, co-founder of RSM Golf, a company that runs golf instruction clinics for children in Dade and Broward counties in Florida, surrendered to police Tuesday.His arrest report says the 13-year-old boy claimed in a police interview his genitals were touched by Moreno on two occasions at the Hillcrest Golf and Country Club in Fort Lauderdale as the boy performed a stretching routine Moreno recommended."The victim advised that he thought it was weird and was very uncomfortable about the situation," the arrest report said, which added Moreno, in an interview with police Saturday, said he used a "technique of stretching the victim out and relieving tension" by touching the genital area.Moreno was arrested on two counts of lewd and lascivious molestation of a victim aged 12 to 16, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.Hollywood, Fla., Police spokesman Pablo Vanegas said detectives continued investigating the case, and located a second alleged victim, adding it isn't clear if additional charges will be made.

CHICAGO, July 22 (UPI) -- A conservative group says it has launched an ad campaign to promote an upcoming documentary about likely U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama.The group, Citizens United, contends the U.S. news media has "an early teenage crush" on the Democratic U.S. Senator from Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday. It says the ad features Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, the Rev. Joe Watkins and commentators Tucker Carlson and Dick Morris saying the media is guilty of "hype" in its coverage of Obama."Those that haven't been swept up in hype are wondering who this untested politician is and what he stands for -- that's where this film comes in," David Bossie, president of Citizens United, said in a statement to reporters.The group began its $250,000 ad campaign with a spot of Fox News Channel, the Tribune reported.

CAMDEN, Ga., Aug. 14 (UPI) -- Two skydivers missed their mark and accidentally landed in Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Camden, Ga., where officials said they were taken into custody.A strong wind blew the two skydivers off their course, and while they expected to land on the grounds of St. Marys Airport, they touched down next door at the naval base. To complicate things, one skydiver did not have a passport. After naval officers detained them, the next-door airport was notified."They said one was a naturalized citizen and one was not a U.S. citizen and [didn't have] a passport," said Jay Stanford, chairman of the St. Marys Airport Authority.Cathy Kloess, owner of The Jumping Place, told The Florida Times-Union she vouched for the two and they were promptly released."They definitely don't want people landing on their military installation," she said. "They were very stern with us." Kloess added the circumstances were the result of an "act of God," in the form of the gust that blew the divers onto the base, and of which the Navy was understanding.

BAGHDAD, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- An Iranian-backed Shiite group that attacked U.S. forces during the Iraq war has reinvented itself as a political organization, an official of the group said.Sheik Mithaq al-Humairi, who heads Asaib Ahl al-Haq's Baghdad office, confirmed the group has been expanding its presence across Iraq, The Washington Post reported Tuesday."Asaib Ahl al-Haq was founded as an Islamic resistance movement to fight the American occupation but now this stage is over," Humairi said. "Now we have entered a new phase, which is to make people aware of Asaib Ahl al-Haq."A report by Washington's Institute for the Study of War said the group's relationship with Iran is so close that a political role would "enhance Iranian political and religious influence in Iraq and greatly augment Iran's regional proxy strategy."The report's author, Sam Wyer, said it is hard to separate Asaib Ahl al-Haq's political aspirations from Iran's regional ambitions.Since the end of the Iraq war, officers of the organization have returned from exile in Iran and opened political offices that provide social services to widows and orphans.The group launched a network of religious schools, echoing the methods and structures of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement that is a close ally.

June 3 (UPI) -- A California teen is missing and presumed dead after he was pulled over the edge of Nevada Fall in Yosemite National Park Saturday.Aleh Kalman, 19, of Sacramento, was hiking the Mist Trail with a church group when he went for a swim in the Merced River, about 150 feet upstream from the falls, National Park Service officials said.The strong current pulled Kalman over the 594 foot waterfall, a drop park officials said "is not survivable."Park search and rescue scoured the river from the ground and air over the weekend, hoping to find Kalman. Search teams were not dispatched Monday, park ranger Kari Cobb told NBC.“The Merced River is very strong, even in places where it appears calm,” Cobb said. “But under the surface, it can be extremely powerful.”
