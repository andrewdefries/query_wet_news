NEW YORK, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market were slightly higher in moderate trading at midday Wednesday, lifted by strength in semiconductor issues as investors waded through a fresh barrage of corporate earnings results.The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 58.05 points Tuesday, was ahead 5.10 points to 9,718.90. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which dropped 47.81 points in the previous session, was ahead 20.20 points to 1,902.73.The broader New York Stock Exchange composite index was ahead 1.27 to 575.54 while the Standard & Poor's 500 index was ahead 4.92 to 1,124.23.The American Stock Exchange composite index was ahead 0.58 points to 823.98 while the Russell 2000 Index was ahead 1.60 to 471.03.Big Board volume rose to an estimated 566.90 million shares from 548.80 million shares changing hands during the same period Tuesday.Analysts said semiconductor issues rose after an industry group said orders and shipments rose in December, indicating improvement in the battered sector. An investment bank upgrade of the sector also helped boost enthusiasm.Makers of equipment used to build semiconductors were in focus after a report that North American makers of microchip-making equipment saw new orders rise about 7 percent and shipments gained less than one percent, according to Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International.A closely watched ratio of orders to shipments, known as the book-to-bill ratio, was 0.78 in December, an improvement from a ratio of 0.73 in November.Analysts noted the rise came as investors digested a fresh round of corporate results.This week is one of the busiest for earnings reports. About 155 of the companies in the S&P 500 and half the 30 Dow components are expected to release corporate results.Meanwhile, a prominent panel of economic forecasters said the U.S. economy is likely to emerge from recession in the second quarter of 2002, although the recovery will be slow and unemployment will remain high the rest of the year.The American Bankers Association's economy advisory committee said it expects the economy to grow 0.3 percent in the second quarter, ending a year of recession.Over the course of 2002, the economy will grow just 2.2 percent, well below its potential, it said.The unemployment rate, now 5.8 percent, will climb to 6.3 percent by the third quarter and won't drop below 6 percent until next year."Powerful forces for recover are in place: aggressive, monetary and fiscal policy, low energy prices and a significant inventory correction," said Gregory Miller, chairman of the committee.Still, he said, "capital spending in prior years has generated excess capacity in most industries and until capacity utilization rates rise significantly it will be difficult to sustain the economic recovery."The Federal Reserve, however, isn't likely to cut interest rates much more."If the Federal Reserve is not through cutting rates, it's very close to the completion of its easing cycle" the group said.The committee said it expects the Fed to begin raising rates in the third quarter.Elsewhere on the economic front, overall consumer confidence remained unchanged for the third week in a row, according to the latest ABC News/Money Magazine poll.The consumer comfort index held steady at a five-and-a-half-year low of minus 13 in the week ended Jan. 20. The index fell to this level four weeks ago -- its lowest level since August 1996 -- and hasn't budged since.According to the latest survey, 33 percent of respondents expressed confidence in the economy, up from 32 percent the week before.Also, 58 percent of those polled said their own finances were in good standing, up one point from the prior week. In addition, 40 percent of respondents assessed the buying climate as good, down one point from the week before.The consumer comfort index was based on a random survey of 1,034 respondents nationwide ended Jan. 20. The index measures typical Americans' confidence in three areas: the national economy, their own finances, and their willingness to spend money, according to the report. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.And, retail sales remained above plan in the U.S. last week, upon the resumption of normal operating conditions following the holiday season.Redbook's latest report of national retail sales showed sales rose 4.0 percent during the week ended Jan. 19 after seasonal adjustment from the same week in December.The report also showed sales during the period climbed 1.4 percent from the same period the year before.Month to date, January was 1.6 percent above January of last year.And, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg reported in their Weekly Chain Store Sales Snapshot that chain store sales moved higher in the latest week, but discounters had a better week than department stores.U.S. chain store sales rose 0.7 percent during the week ended Jan. 19, after edging 0.6 percent higher one week earlier, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg said.The BTM/UBSW Weekly Chain Store Sales Snapshot is compiled from seven major discount, department and chain stores across the country that report their weekly results.Those stores include J.C. Penney, Sears, Target, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Federated Department Stores Inc. and May Department Stores Co. The BTM/UBSW index measures sales growth with the year 1977 equaling 100. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury prices drifted slightly lower. The 10-year bond eased 2/32 to 99 21/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.40 percent from 5.38 percent late Tuesday.In Europe, stock prices ended higher in London, Frankfurt and Paris in moderate trading. The London International Stock Exchange's blue-chip FTSE-100 index rose 36.0 points, or 0.70 percent, to 5,185.2. The German DAX index gained 55.15 points, or 1.09 percent, to 5,100.87 and the French CAC-40 index added 4.09 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,450.81.Analysts said stocks were lifted by strength in the drug sector and the oil patch.The oil and gas sector was lifted as crude prices rose after U.S. refiners said they were cutting back on output.The drug sector got a boost from German pharmaceutical group Schering after Goldman Sachs raised its stock to market outperformer from market perform. The investment bank said it raised its recommendation partly on the strength of Schering's oral contraceptive drug.Earlier in Asia, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended slightly lower in narrow range bound trading, turning negative in the closing minutes of trading on profit-taking and weakness in the banking sector. Japan's blue-chip Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selective issues, which fell 229.27 points Tuesday, slipped another 10.07 points, or 0.10 percent, to 10,040.91. The broader Topix index lost 9.93 points, or 1.0 percent, at 975.20 -- its lowest close since May 1985.Analysts said investors took a wait-and-see stance ahead of quarterly earnings reports by major companies later this week, while the expected further unwinding of cross shareholdings by corporations discouraged bargain hunting.Analysts said the market was also pressured by weakness in the banking sector. Banks sank on fears over their exposure to troubled U.S. retailing giant Kmart.Elsewhere in Asia, prices ended slightly lower on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, weighed down by weakness in mainland telecommunications stocks, in a quiet trading session. The blue chip Hang Seng Index slipped 35.55 points, or 0.30 percent, to 10,762.14.Analysts said investors opted for the sidelines awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Senate on Thursday and the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week.Meanwhile, stocks ended higher on the South Korean Stock Exchange, led by semiconductor stocks, on hopes of a sustained industry recovery. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi, gained 18.26 points, or 2.5 percent, to 742.62.Analysts said semiconductor shares gained from losses earlier in the morning on reports that U.S. semiconductor equipment makers' order volume in December was higher.Meanwhile, prices ended slightly lower on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The tech-heavy Weighted Index lost 34.32 points, or 0.59 percent, to 5,769.78, after swinging between gains and losses earlier in the day.Analysts said investors locked in gains after the cabinet reshuffle boosted the index by about 4.5 percent since Monday.Elsewhere around the Pacific region, prices ended little changed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The All Ordinaries Index added 1.10 points, or 0.03 percent, to 3,363.70.Experts said a sharp spike in Australia's consumer price index in the fourth quarter from the third helped bolster confidence in the share market.The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the CPI rose 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, for an annual increase of 3.1 percent, above the Reserve Bank's 2 percent to 3 percent target band, which erodes the chances of a further monetary easing this quarter.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 4 (UPI) -- The environmental stewardship of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., helped ensure the health of countless U.S. citizens, the Sierra Club said.Lautenberg's office announced Monday the 89-year-old senator died of viral pneumonia. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune lauded the senator as a strong supporter of the environment."The Sierra Club's 2.1 million members and supporters mourn the loss of one of the U.S. Senate's strongest, most dedicated, and most principled champions for healthy communities, clean air, clean water and climate action," he said in a statement.Lautenberg used his position at the head of a Senate Environment and Public Works subcommittee on environmental health to strengthen the Toxic Substances Control Act. The act called on the Environmental Protection Agency to project public health from chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyl products, banned in 1979.Praise for Lautenberg extended beyond the environmental community, however. President of the American Chemistry Council Cal Dooley praised the senator for working up to last month on chemical management legislation."His decades of leadership on behalf of his state and the nation inspired respect and admiration from all those who worked with him," he said Monday.Lautenberg was the oldest member of the U.S. Senate.

| License Photo	Small-business owners say they believe federal clean-energy investment helps drive job creation and economic growth, even with the cloud of Solyndra's bankruptcy hanging over them, a recent poll of such enterprises in six U.S. states indicates.Results indicate 71 percent of small-business owners think government has a role in driving toward a cleaner, more competitive economy, said advocacy group Small Business Majority, which commissioned the survey.The poll also found strong support for current and new federal Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards even if enforcement meant a possible increase in utility prices.Small-business owners participating in the survey listed the cost of doing business and a lack of consumer demand as the two biggest challenges they face, John Arensmeyer, Small Business Majority founder and chief executive officer, said during a conference call about the poll's findings this week.Notably, he said, only 16 percent said government regulation was a problem."There's a lot of discussion about impact of regulations on businesses," Arensmeyer said. "We agree that there are some dumb rules out there, but only 16 percent see that as a big issue."Small businesses also said they support government investment in clean energy technologies even after questions were raised about whether the Obama administration pushed through a loan to Solyndra, a solar cell manufacturer that filed for bankruptcy after receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee.Despite what happened at the California operation, small businesses said the federal government "shouldn't stop investing in solar and wind," Arensmeyer said. "[They] want the government to play that kind of role." The survey "really shows that small businesses across country, in fairly significant numbers, understand the need for a strong partnership role of government in fostering a clean energy economy particularly as relates to the EPA regulation of greenhouse gasses and other toxic emissions," he said. "There's strong support."Small business owners in all six surveyed states also showed strong support -- 82 percent -- for recently released EPA standards that require new power plants to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. The survey showed 76 percent favor the EPA's federal rule that new power plants reduce previously unlimited emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. "The EPA regulations limiting carbon emissions make our solar technology more cost competitive and cause a surge of activity in our industry -- new business start-ups, existing company expansions and a solidifying of this nascent industry," Michelle Greenfield, chief executive officer of Third Sun Solar in Athens, Ohio. Results are based on an Internet survey of 600 small businesses in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Nevada and Colorado conducted March 21-28. The margin of error is 4 percentage points. Fifty-seven percent of participants said their businesses will be impacted by EPA oversight of carbon and other emissions. However, 56 percent said they back the EPA regulating greenhouse gas emissions even if it means a possible increase in utility prices.Greenfield, whose 12-year-old company designs and installs solar power systems in the Midwest, said government incentives make solar power in the state economical and feasible. She said most of the state's power comes from coal plants because it's cheap.Green- or clean-energy incentives have created 3,500 jobs in Ohio for the past few years and government involvement in the field will help make the United States more competitive globally.She said she tries to by U.S.-made components for her company, but that's sometimes difficult because "we haven't had as much incentive here [in the United States] as overseas."Greenfield said government investment in the solar industry and EPA regulations can add more jobs by opening up "whole new technologies and industries that are built around alleviating those issues."Jonathan Tobias, president of Michigan Green Cabs in Wixom, said EPA regulation of carbon emissions directly affects his business because it raises awareness about companies that embrace clean alternative energy sources."For every 150 old traditional [Crown Victorias] we recycle, Michigan Green Cabs can save 1.2 million gallons of fuel per year traveling the exact same distance," Tobias said, reducing pollution by an average of 70 percent. He said his company has a 25-vehicle fleet.He said he formed his company about four years ago amid concern about the environment and wanting to take "proactive steps about quality of [the] environment that we leave" for future generations.He's a booster for driving green because "the more efficiently I can run my business … the more money I have available to expand my business and hire more drivers."He said one new vehicle can create three new full-time positions and one or two part-time jobs.Plus, greater awareness means he can retain drivers "who want to work for responsible company," Tobias said. Seventy-three percent of small business owners favor proposed rules to reduce smog and soot pollution that crosses state lines, the so-called "Good Neighbor Rule," Arensmeyer said.The survey polled a politically diverse population, he said. Forty-four percent identified themselves as Republicans, 38 percent, Democrats, and 10 percent, independents.Compared with previous surveys on government incentives for green and clean energy, Arensmeyer said the latest poll was "consistent with [the] view that it's going to require an active [government] partnership role."

BALTIMORE, Oct. 8 (UPI) -- Russell Martin's tie-breaking, eighth-inning homer Sunday triggered a five-run outburst that carried the New York Yankees to a 7-2 playoff win over Baltimore.With the opener of the American League Division Series tied 1-1 in the eighth, Martin clubbed a 2-0 fastball from Orioles closer Jim Johnson (0-1) into the left-field stands.That opened the floodgates as the Yankees added a two-run double from Robinson Cano and run-scoring hits from Ichiro Suzuki and Nick Swisher.CC Sabathia (1-0) earned the victory, meting out two runs on eight hits through 8 2/3 innings as AL East champion New York grabbed a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five ALDS.Nate McLouth drove in both runs for AL wild card-winner Baltimore.The start of the game was delayed 2 1/2 hours by rain.

| License Photo	SOCHI, Russia, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- T.J. Oshie had four goals in a thrilling shootout Saturday, the last coming in the eighth round to give the United States a 3-2 Olympic victory over Russia.The Americans survived a game that was worthy of a gold medal final, but with a lot of hockey left in the Olympics the triumph Saturday merely gave the United States a chance to win Group A.That chance will come Sunday when the United States meets Slovenia.Slovenia defeated Slovakia 3-1 earlier Saturday in the other Group A game. In Group C action later Sweden clinched a spot in the quarterfinals by outlasting Latvia 5-3 and Switzerland took second place in the group with a 1-0 decision over the Czech Republic.Canada and Finland will determine the winner of Group B Sunday.The U.S.-Russia contest lived up to its billing as the most-anticipated game of the group phase of the Olympics.Russian President Vladimir Putin was in the audience and he celebrated when Russia opened the scoring on a goal by Pavel Datsyuk midway through the second period.Cam Fowler answered for the Americans late in the middle period, Joe Pavelski gave the United States the lead with 10:33 to go in regulation and Datsyuk tied it with 7:16 to go.The first overtime of these Olympics provided no scoring and it was then on to the shootout, which turned into a marathon.In the NHL, a different player takes each shot. In international hockey, three different shooters take the ice for the first three rounds. If more than three rounds are required, any player may be sent out to shoot and it can be the same one time after time if that is what the coaches desire.Oshie scored in the first round for the Americans and Ilya Kovalchuk kept the Russian hopes alive with a goal in the third round.After that, Datsyuk and Kovalchuk took turns for the Russians and Oshie took all the shots for the United States.Datsyuk scored in the fifth round, but Oshie matched him. Kovalchuk scored in the sixth round only to have Oshie tally again. After both sides missed in the seventh round, Kovalchuk was denied in the eighth by Jamie Quick.That gave Oshie a chance to win the game and he did so by putting a shot between the pads of Russian goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky.The United States got a big break in the third period when a Russian goal was waived off because the net had become dislodged.Sweden became the first team to wrap up a quarterfinal spot by going 3-0 in Group C. The Swedes were not able to breathe easy until Alexander Edler gave them a two-goal lead with 7:40 to play. Henrik Lundqvist, goaltender for the New York Rangers, gave up three scores on 23 shots.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 2 (UPI) -- U.S. President Barack Obama signed a stopgap funding measure Wednesday that would keep the federal government operational for two more weeks.The bill, passed by the Senate hours earlier on a 91-9 vote, would trim $4 billion from the current-year budget. Lawmakers faced a Friday deadline to pass a temporary funding resolution or the government could have shut down.GALLERY: Protests in Madison, Wisconsin continueObama has called on Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to meet immediately with White House Chief of Staff William Daley and Budget Director Jack Lew to work on a long-term budget agreement before funding authorized Wednesday expires March 18, The Hill reported.The Washington publication said Wednesday Senate Democratic leaders will turn over to Vice President Joe Biden the main responsibility for negotiating 2011 spending with Republicans. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., vice chairman of the Senate Democratic Conference, said Republicans should accept the administration's invitation if they "are serious about negotiating a responsible compromise."During Wednesday's Senate debate, Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, said he would support the stopgap bill "reluctantly.""I think this kind of budgeting is the worst kind you can do," Begich said. "When you think about it, no household does it this way, no business does it this way, no state government does it this way."The House voted 335-91 Tuesday to approve the two-week continuing resolution.Obama said he was pleased congressional Democrats and Republicans agreed on a plan that would cut spending and keep government running for the next two weeks."But we cannot keep doing business this way," Obama said in a statement. "Living with the threat of a shutdown every few weeks is not responsible, and it puts our economic progress in jeopardy."The Hill reported Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, both R-Utah; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both R-Idaho; Patti Murray, D-Wash.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; and Bernie Sanders, Ind-Vt., voted against the bill.The proposal would eliminate $2.7 billion in programs House Republicans designated as earmarks, although some Senate Democrats disagree with using the "earmark" label for some of the cuts, such as a $40 million reduction in Labor Department salaries and expenses.The agreement on the two-week plan buys Congress time to work on a bill that would fund the government through the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. "The clock is already ticking toward March 18," Schumer said. "We call on House Republicans to sit down at the negotiating table right away. Time's a'wasting.""We know that the final outcome will lie somewhere in between" the spending level proposed by Senate Democrats and the $61 billion in cuts over seven months favored by House Republicans, Schumer said.Senate Democrats proposed freezing non-security discretionary spending, which would set spending levels $41 billion lower than Obama's budget request for 2011.Obama said the goal of the meeting between White House officials and congressional leaders is to find "common ground on a budget that makes sure we are living within our means. This agreement should cut spending and reduce deficits without damaging economic growth or gutting investments in education, research and development that will create jobs and secure our future."He said the agreement also should be bipartisan, "free of any party's social or political agenda, and it should be reached without delay."

WASHINGTON, April 17 (UPI) -- Pushing back against gun control bills now before the U.S. Senate, a new ad by the National Rifle Association says most police don't support the measures.The 30-second spot, on which the NRA says it will spend $500,000, encourages the public to "tell your senator to listen to America's police instead of listening to [President] Obama and [New York Mayor Michael] Bloomberg."The ad cites a poll by PoliceOne, an online news site for police officers, which found "71 percent of the police say Obama's gun ban will have zero effect on violent crime.""Ninety-one percent say the right answer is swift prosecution and mandatory sentencing," the ad continues in referencing the survey.The Senate is considering legislation to ban assault-style weapons and increase background checks for gun purchases.The PoliceOne site says more than 15,000 completed the survey. The site claims 400,000 registered members comprised of "verified law enforcement professionals."Last week, a pro-gun control group backed by Bloomberg began airing an ad promoting a measure expanding background checks on gun sales. That ad also cited a poll indicating 9-of-10 Americans support stronger checks.

TORONTO, Jan. 31 (UPI) -- Parents of students at a Toronto high school say they are appalled at how much money it is costing them to produce a school play.Teachers in Toronto have stopped running extracurricular activities, so some parents with students at Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute have volunteered to help put on the school play, the Toronto Star reported.However, Jim Barry, one of the parents involved with the play, said the costs have been exorbitant -- in total about $10,000 for renting the school auditorium for rehearsals and performances, to buying insurance, to hiring police officers for security during the shows, which are all required by the Toronto District School Board."I really resent the TDSB's approach," Barry said. "I thought the TDSB would do everything it could possibly do to facilitate parents picking up the slack, but instead they are siding with the union. We are being treated no differently than someone who has no connection to the school."

April 22 (UPI) -- A 29-year-old fisherman attacked by an eight-foot crocodile Sunday made it out with just a "few holes on the head," he told ABC Australia.Yoann Galeran, 29, fought the crocodile off the northern coast of Australia. He was with friends at a yacht club when he agreed to swim to an offshore dinghy. The deckhand there said it was already dark by the time Galeran got in the water."I was swimming, and maybe four or five meters [13 to 16 feet] from the boat, I just feel rocks hitting on my head and something strong, and I just realized [it was] a croc," Galeran said. "He hit me on the top, on the left side and on top of my neck, and tried to push me down in the water."He punched the crocodile and managed to escape, shaking him off twice before getting out of the water.Watch commander Vicki Koum said he was treated for puncture wounds, but not seriously injured. "I just feel that I've been lucky, and I just think [if it was] a bigger crocodile, I maybe wouldn't have any head," Galeran said.
