WASHINGTON, July 19 (UPI) -- The U.S. electric power sector is putting a strain on the nation's water resources, a Union of Concerned Scientists report warns.The report -- "Water-Smart Power: Strengthening the U.S. Electricity System in a Warming World" -- released this week as much of the nation grappled with a heat wave, says more than 40 percent of U.S. freshwater withdrawals are used for power plant cooling."But during drought or hot weather, when plants cannot get enough cooling water, for example, they often must cut back or completely shut down their generators as happened repeatedly in 2012 at plants around the country," the report said.The U.S. Department of Energy released a report last week on the effects of climate change on the energy sector, citing instances of energy disruption due to climate conditions."Last August, Dominion Resources' Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Connecticut shut down one reactor for two weeks because the temperature of the intake cooling water, withdrawn from the Long Island Sound, was too high and exceeded technical specifications of the reactor," the government report said.The UCS report notes the nation's power sector is currently on a path that would primarily replace coal with natural gas, currently projected to supply 60 percent of the country's power by 2050.Although the shift from coal to natural gas would decrease water use, those declines in water withdrawals won't occur mostly until after 2030 -- "a 20-year delay that leaves the power industry unnecessarily vulnerable to drought and exacerbates competition with other water users," the UCS report says."Our electricity system clearly isn't able to effectively meet our needs as we battle climate change and face a future of expanding electricity demand and increasing water strain," said Erika Spanger-Siegfried, co-author of the report and a senior analyst in the UCS Climate & Energy Program, in a statement.If the nation's power sector were instead to follow a path that includes strong investments in renewable and energy efficiency, the UCS report says, water withdrawals could drop as much as 97 percent from current levels by 2050.That scenario would also cut carbon emissions 90 percent from current levels."Making low-carbon, water-smart choices is a high-stakes effort. The choices we make in the near term to define the power sector of this century will affect water resources, our climate and long-term hydrology, and the power sector's long-term resilience," said Peter Frumhoff, UCS director of science and policy.

People magazine's 2012 Sexiest Man Alive appeared on stage at the Oscars in a musical number with actress Charlize Theron. His wife was recently seen on TV's "American Horror Story."

ARLINGTON, Va., May 17 (UPI) -- Conservation International says an expedition to an Indonesian area often called "The Lost World" has resulted in the discovery of several new species.The "stunning diversity of spectacular species" was announced Monday as part of activities marking next Saturday's observance of the 2010 International Day for Biological Diversity.The conservation organization said the newly discovered species include several mammals, a reptile, an amphibian, at least 12 insects and a new bird, all found in Indonesia's remote Foja Mountains on the island of New Guinea in late 2008.Officials said the discoveries include a bizarre spike-nosed tree frog; an oversized, but notably tame, woolly rat; a gargoyle-like, bent-toed gecko with yellow eyes; an imperial pigeon; and a tiny forest wallaby -- the smallest member of the kangaroo family documented in the world.The Foja Mountains encompass more than 1.8 million square acres (300,000 square hectares) of unroaded, undeveloped and undisturbed rain forest. The health and biodiversity of the wilderness provide a critical carbon sink for the planet, as well as vital ecosystem services to a series of forest-dwelling peoples who depend on its resources, Conservation International said.A special feature on the expedition, which received financial and scientific support from the National Geographic Society, Smithsonian Institution and Indonesian Institute of Sciences, appears in the June issue of National Geographic magazine.

EL FASHER, Sudan, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- A hybrid peacekeeping mission in Sudan's Darfur region welcomed an agreement by a rebel force to end the recruitment of child soldiers.The rebel Justice and Equality Movement became the seventh militia in Darfur to prohibit the use of child soldiers. JEM made the decision following recent negotiations with members of the hybrid U.N.-African Union Mission in Darfur.UNAMID chief Aichatou Mindaoudou said she welcomed the step by what's considered one of the largest armed groups in Darfur."Child soldiering is detrimental to peace and to children, who are the future of Darfur," she said in a statement. "(UNAMID) applauds JEM's commitment toward protecting children and appeals to all members of armed groups and forces to do the same."The U.S. State Department last week advised U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to Darfur or the Sudanese states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.The warning said that although the government in Khartoum has taken steps to control the violence, armed groups in the region have threatened to attack Western interests. The State Department said the threat level in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, "remains critical."

NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- A huge winter storm Wednesday spread from the Ohio Valley to the Great Lakes to the Northeast coast, U.S. forecasters reported. At least six people were killed.Accuweather.com said the storm gave Little Rock, Ark., its snowiest Christmas in 86 years.The weather disrupted air travel and forced the cancellation of Wednesday's scheduled basketball game between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, which had been blanketed by 7 inches of snow by midafternoon.Severe winds blew the snow across Ohio and Indiana. Accuweather said the snow is expected to mount up to more than a foot across the interior of the Northeast. But rain and strong winds, and a sometimes icy mix, would hit the Northeast coast.The report cited snow accumulations Wednesday morning of 14 1/2 inches four miles south of Marion near the southern tip of Illinois and 6 inches in Muncie, Ind., with more snow falling and winds gusting to 30 mph.The National Weather Service said Christmas Day storms produced dangerous winds and tornadoes and left more than 190,000 customers without power.Weather-related deaths killed at least six people in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas.A man driving in Houston died when a tree fell on his pickup, Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Gilliland said. The Dallas Morning News reported a homeless man in his 60s was found "frozen behind a church" in Old East Dallas Wednesday morning, according to a police report. The report said the man has yet to be identified, and the medical examiner's office will have to officially determine a cause of death, but overnight temperatures were dropping into the 20s and wind chills in the single digits.In Woodward, Okla., a woman died in an accident on a snow-covered, two-lane highway and a man died when a tree fell on his home in Louisiana.The Arkansas State Police said two toddlers were killed in an accident on Highway 36 near Mount Vernon that left their father and a female companion in critical condition. KTHV, Little Rock, reported the accident occurred when the driver of one vehicle lost control and plowed into a second vehicle heading in the opposite direction. The occupants of the second car also were injured.Blizzard and winter storm warnings were in effect from the Deep South to New England and as much as 15 inches of snow was predicted for parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania to northern Maine and Canada.Accuweather.com said flash floods were possible as the storm moves northeast to the central and southern Appalachians before heading into the Carolinas and Maryland, then out to sea.Strong winds, predicted to hit 60 mph, were expected to whip the East Coast from Long Island, N.Y., to Boston.David Saraceno told CNN he was driving on Interstate 165 in Mobile County, Ala., when he spotted a tornado about 2 miles away."I put the pedal to the floor to try to get out of harm's way but it seemed to be getting closer and closer," said Saraceno, who left the highway near Chickasaw and reversed direction to get out of the way."It appeared that the tornado turned and came over the interstate about three minutes away from where we would have been if I did not get off the interstate. We saw a roof that must have blown off a house. Cars were pulled to the side of the road. There was a lady whose windows were shattered. It was too close for comfort."The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune reported a possible tornado damaged 25-30 homes, resulting in numerous injuries, in Ball, La. Police said another twister touched down in Zachary, La., but didn't cause extensive damage, the newspaper said.The Times-Picayune said the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was closed for a time because of hail and low visibility.Police said a tornado apparently touched down near downtown Alexandria, La., injuring one person and damaging more than a dozen buildings, CNN said.The National Weather Service said a tornado struck Mobile, Ala. Murphy High School history teacher Rick Cauley said he and his family rode out the storm in the school's field house. The twister destroyed an equipment barn and six mobile classrooms and damaged the roof of the school auditorium and band room."It was pretty horrific," Cauley said.A spokesman for Mobile Fire-Rescue, Steve Hicks, said several other buildings, including a church, and the storm caused several traffic accidents.Alabama's Choctaw and Clarke counties also reported damage and one person in Prichard was injured, CNN said.

| License Photo	TORONTO, Dec. 8 (UPI) -- Landscapers saved the city of Toronto $60,000 Thursday by volunteering material and labor to restore a park left in ruins by the Occupy Toronto encampment.St. James Park, co-owned by the city and an adjacent cathedral for which it's named, was left barren of grass and the soil was packed down after hundreds of protesters erected tents and lived there for five weeks before being evicted Nov. 23.Unasked, the Ontario Sod Growers Association, Landscape Ontario and various other competitors announced they would restore the soil, lay sod and mulch around trees for the oncoming winter, the Toronto Sun reported.Clean-up and soil aeration began Wednesday, and by midday Thursday, about 100 volunteer landscapers had laid 11,000 square feet of sod, helped by 35 city workers, Director of Parks Richard Ubbens said.He said area businesses had donated food and drinks for the workers as well.The city is undergoing broad and unpopular budget cuts and would have faced a $60,000 bill to restore the park.Area residents were asked to stay off the new grass to allow it to take root before the soil begins to freeze.Next week, volunteers are scheduled to string Christmas lights in the trees, the report said.

| License Photo	Jan. 24 (UPI) -- Senator Dianne Feinstein Thursday unveiled legislation to reintroduce an assault weapons ban similar to one that was allowed to expire in 2004.The proposed ban includes 150 types of firearms, which looking to eliminate high-capacity magazines, includes certain handguns and shotguns that have removable ammunition-feeding devices.With 10 different kinds of weapons at her side during the press conference, Feinstein, the California Senator who became San Francisco mayor in 1978 when mayor George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated at City Hall, was the force behind the lapsed weapons ban.The Daily Caller got hold of a list of the weapons to be banned in the proposed 2013 legislation (below the image is video of Thursday's press conference)

Wiki
Colin Rand Kaepernick (born November 3, 1987) is an American football quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. He played college football at Nevada.
Kaepernick was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is the youngest of Rick and Teresa Kaepernick’s three children (brother, Kyle, and a sister, Devon). Kaepernick is of biracial descent (European and African), having been adopted by the Kaepernicks as an infant. He lived in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin until age 4, before moving to Turlock, California. He lists Turlock as his home town where he attended elementary, junior, and John H. Pitman High School there. He is also a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.
Kaepernick, who graduated in Dececember 2010 with a bachelors degree in Business Management, is known to have high character and a relatively unassuming personality off the field, as evidenced by an incident that took place during the summer of 2010 interning at a University of Nevada-themed sports apparel shop in Reno. One woman came in and, completely unaware she was speaking to Kaepernick, asked him to find his jersey. A manager at the store would later recall, "Colin said, ‘I’m pretty sure it’s No. 10, and it’s right over here.’ He rang up her purchase and everything."	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
