Cold Mountain
CHAPTER ONE
Cold Mountain
By CHARLES FRAZIER
Atlantic Monthly Press
Read the Review
The Shadow of a Crow
At the first gesture of morning, flies began stirring. Inman's eyes and
the long wound at his neck drew them, and the sound of their wings and
the touch of their feet were soon more potent than a yardful of roosters
in rousing a man to wake. So he came to yet one more day in the hospital
ward. He flapped the flies away with his hands and looked across the foot
of his bed to an open triple-hung window. Ordinarily he could see to the
red road and the oak tree and the low brick wall. And beyond them to a
sweep of fields and flat piney woods that stretched to the western
horizon. The view was a long one for the flatlands, the hospital having
been built on the only swell within eyeshot. But it was too early yet for
a vista. The window might as well have been painted grey.
Had it not been too dim, Inman would have read to pass the time until
breakfast, for the book he was reading had the effect of settling his
mind. But he had burned up the last of his own candles reading to bring
sleep the night before, and lamp oil was too scarce to be striking the
hospital's lights for mere diversion. So he rose and dressed and sat in a
ladderback chair, putting the gloomy room of beds and their broken
occupants behind him. He flapped again at the flies and looked out the
window at the first smear of foggy dawn and waited for the world to begin
shaping up outside.
The window was tall as a door, and he had imagined many times that it
would open onto some other place and let him walk through and be there.
During his first weeks in the hospital, he had been hardly able to move
his head, and all that kept his mind occupied had been watching out the
window and picturing the old green places he recollected from home.
Childhood places. The damp creek bank where Indian pipes grew. The corner
of a meadow favored by brown-and-black caterpillars in the fall. A
hickory limb that overhung the lane, and from which he often watched his
father driving cows down to the barn at dusk. They would pass underneath
him, and then he would close his eyes and listen as the cupping sound of
their hooves in the dirt grew fainter and fainter until it vanished into
the calls of katydids and peepers. The window apparently wanted only to
take his thoughts back. Which was fine with him, for he had seen the
metal face of the age and had been so stunned by it that when he thought
into the future, all he could vision was a world from which everything he
counted important had been banished or had willingly fled.
By now he had stared at the window all through a late summer so hot
and wet that the air both day and night felt like breathing through a
dishrag, so damp it caused fresh sheets to sour under him and tiny black
mushrooms to grow overnight from the limp pages of the book on his
bedside table. Inman suspected that after such long examination, the grey
window had finally said about all it had to say. That morning, though, it
surprised him, for it brought to mind a lost memory of sitting in school,
a similar tall window beside him framing a scene of pastures and low
green ridges terracing up to the vast hump of Cold Mountain. It was
September. The hayfield beyond the beaten dirt of the school playground
stood pant-waist high, and the heads of grasses were turning yellow from
need of cutting. The teacher was a round little man, hairless and pink of
face. He owned but one rusty black suit of clothes and a pair of old
overlarge dress boots that curled up at the toes and were so worn down
that the heels were wedgelike. He stood at the front of the room rocking
on the points. He talked at length through the morning about history,
teaching the older students of grand wars fought in ancient England.
After a time of actively not listening, the young Inman had taken his
hat from under the desk and held it by its brim. He flipped his wrist,
and the hat skimmed out the window and caught an updraft and soared. It
landed far out across the playground at the edge of the hayfield and
rested there black as the shadow of a crow squatted on the ground. The
teacher saw what Inman had done and told him to go get it and to come
back and take his whipping. The man had a big paddleboard with holes
augured in it, and he liked to use it. Inman never did know what seized
him at that moment, but he stepped out the door and set the hat on his
head at a dapper rake and walked away, never to return.
The memory passed on as the light from the window rose toward day. The
man in the bed next to Inman's sat and drew his crutches to him. As he
did every morning, the man went to the window and spit repeatedly and
with great effort until his clogged lungs were clear. He ran a comb
through his black hair, which hung lank below his jaw and was cut square
around. He tucked the long front pieces of hair behind his ears and put
on his spectacles of smoked glass, which he wore even in the dim of
morning, his eyes apparently too weak for the wannest form of light.
Then, still in his nightshirt, he went to his table and began working at
a pile of papers. He seldom spoke more than a word or two at a time, and
Inman had learned little more of him than that his name was Balis and
that before the war he had been to school at Chapel Hill, where he had
attempted to master Greek. All his waking time was now spent trying to
render ancient scribble from a fat little book into plain writing anyone
could read. He sat hunched at his table with his face inches from his
work and squirmed in his chair, looking to find a comfortable position
for his leg. His right foot had been taken off by grape at Cold Harbor,
and the stub seemed not to want to heal and had rotted inch by inch from
the ankle up. His amputations had now proceeded past the knee, and he
smelled all the time like last year's ham.
For a while there was only the sound of Balis's pen scratching, pages
turning. Then others in the room began to stir and cough, a few to moan.
Eventually the light swelled so that all the lines of the varnished
beadboard walls stood clear, and Inman could cock back on the chair's
hind legs and count the flies on the ceiling. He made it to be
sixty-three.
As Inman's view through the window solidified, the dark trunks of the
oak trees showed themselves first, then the patchy lawn, and finally the
red road. He was waiting for the blindman to come. He had attended to the
man's movements for some weeks, and now that he had healed enough to be
numbered among the walking, Inman was determined to go out to the cart
and speak to the man, for Inman figured him to have been living with a
wound for a long time.
Inman had taken his own during the fighting outside Petersburg. When
his two nearest companions pulled away his clothes and looked at his
neck, they had said him a solemn farewell in expectation of his death.
We'll meet again in a better world, they said. But he lived as far as the
field hospital, and there the doctors had taken a similar attitude. He
was classed among the dying and put aside on a cot to do so. But he
failed at it. After two days, space being short, they sent him on to a
regular hospital in his own state. All through the mess of the field
hospital and the long grim train ride south in a boxcar filled with
wounded, he had agreed with his friends and the doctors. He thought he
would die. About all he could remember of the trip was the heat and the
odors of blood and of shit, for many of the wounded had the flux. Those
with the strength to do so had knocked holes in the sides of the wood
boxcars with the butts of rifles and rode with their heads thrust out
like crated poultry to catch the breeze.
At the hospital, the doctors looked at him and said there was not much
they could do. He might live or he might not. They gave him but a grey
rag and a little basin to clean his own wound. Those first few days, when
he broke consciousness enough to do it, he wiped at his neck with the rag
until the water in the basin was the color of the comb on a turkey-cock.
But mainly the wound had wanted to clean itself. Before it started
scabbing, it spit out a number of things: a collar button and a piece of
wool collar from the shirt he had been wearing when he was hit, a shard
of soft grey metal as big as a quarter dollar piece, and, unaccountably,
something that closely resembled a peach pit. That last he set on the
nightstand and studied for some days. He could never settle his mind on
whether it was a part of him or not. He finally threw it out the window
but then had troubling dreams that it had taken root and grown, like
Jack's bean, into something monstrous.
His neck had eventually decided to heal. But during the weeks when he
could neither turn his head nor hold up a book to read, Inman had lain
every day watching the blind man. The man would arrive alone shortly
after dawn, pushing his cart up the road, doing it about as well as any
man who could see. He would set up his business under an oak tree across
the road, lighting a fire in a ring of stones and boiling peanuts over it
in an iron pot. He would sit all day on a stool with his back to the
brick wall, selling peanuts and newspapers to those at the hospital whole
enough to walk. Unless someone came to buy something, he rested as still
as a stuffed man with his hands together in his lap.
That summer, Inman had viewed the world as if it were a picture framed
by the molding around the window. Long stretches of time often passed
when, for all the change in the scene, it might as well have been an old
painting of a road, a wall, a tree, a cart, a blind man. Inman had
sometimes counted off slow numbers in his head to see how long it would
be before anything of significance altered. It was a game and he had
rules for it. A bird flying by did not count. Someone walking down the
road did. Major weather changes did--the sun coming out, fresh rain--but
shadows of passing clouds did not. Some days he'd get up in the thousands
before there was any allowable alteration in the elements of the picture.
He believed the scene would never leave his mind--wall, blind man, tree,
cart, road--no matter how far on he lived. He imagined himself an old man
thinking about it. Those pieces together seemed to offer some meaning,
though he did not know what and suspected he never would.
Inman watched the window as he ate his breakfast of boiled oats and
butter, and shortly he saw the blind man come trudging up the road, his
back humped against the weight of the cart he pushed, little twin clouds
of dust rising from beneath the turning cartwheels. When the blind man had
his fire going and his peanuts boiling, Inman put his plate on the
windowsill and went outside and with the shuffling step of an old man
crossed the lawn to the road.
The blind man was square and solid in shoulder and hip, and his
britches were cinched at the waist with a great leather belt, wide as a
razor strop. He went hatless, even in the heat, and his cropped hair was
thick and grey, coarse-textured as the bristles to a hemp brush. He sat
with his head tipped down and appeared to be somewhat in a muse, but he
raised up as Inman approached, like he was really looking. His eyelids,
though, were dead as shoe leather and were sunken into puckered cups
where his eyeballs had been.
Without pausing even for salutation Inman said, Who put out your pair
of eyes?
The blind man had a friendly smile on his face and he said, Nobody. I
never had any.
That took Inman aback, for his imagination had worked in the belief
that they had been plucked out in some desperate and bloody dispute, some
brute fraction. Every vile deed he had witnessed lately had been at the
hand of a human agent, so he had about forgot that there was a whole
other order of misfortune.
--Why did you never have any? Inman said.
--Just happened that way.
--Well, Inman said. You're mighty calm. Especially for a man that most
would say has taken the little end of the horn all his life.
The blind man said, It might have been worse had I ever been given a
glimpse of the world and then lost it.
--Maybe, Inman said. Though what would you pay right now to have your
eyeballs back for ten minutes? Plenty, I bet.
The man studied on the question. He worked his tongue around the corner
of his mouth. He said, I'd not give an Indian-head cent. I fear it might
turn me hateful.
--It's done it to me, Inman said. There's plenty I wish I'd never
seen.
--That's not the way I meant it. You said ten minutes. It's having a
thing and the loss I'm talking about.
The blind man twisted a square of newsprint up into a cone and then
dipped with a riddly spoon into the pot and filled the cone with wet
peanuts. He handed it to Inman and said, Come on, cite me one instance
where you wished you were blind.
Where to begin? Inman wondered. Malvern Hill. Sharpsburg. Petersburg.
Any would do admirably as example of unwelcome visions. But
Fredericksburg was a day particularly lodged in his mind. So he sat with
his back to the oak and halved the wet peanut shells and thumbed the
meats out into his mouth and told the blind man his tale, beginning with
how the fog had lifted that morning to reveal a vast army marching uphill
toward a stone wall, a sunken road. Inman's regiment was called to join
the men already behind the wall, and they had quickly formed up alongside
the big white house at the top of Maryes Heights. Lee and Longstreet and
befeathered Stuart stood right there on the lawn before the porch, taking
turns glassing the far side of the river and talking. Longstreet had a
grey shawl of wool draped about his shoulders. Compared to the other two
men, Longstreet looked like a stout hog drover. But from what Inman had
seen of Lee's way of thinking, he'd any day rather have Longstreet
backing him in a fight. Dull as Longstreet looked, he had a mind that
constancy sought ground configured so a man could hunker down and do a
world of killing from a position of relative safety. And that day at
Fredericksburg was all in the form of fighting that Lee mistrusted and
that Longstreet welcomed.
After Inman's regiment had formed up, they dropped over the brow of
the hill and into the withering fire of the Federals. They stopped once
to touch off a volley, and then they ran down to the sunken road behind
the stone wall. On the way a ball brushed the skin of Inman's wrist and
felt like the tongue of a cat licking, doing no damage, only making a
little abraded stripe.
When they got to the road, Inman could see they were in a fine spot.
Those already there had trenched along the tightly built wall so that you
could stand up comfortably and still be in its shelter. The Federals had
to come uphill at the wall across acres and acres of open ground. So
delightful was the spot that one man jumped onto the wall and hollered
out, You are all committing a mistake. You hear? A dire mistake! Balls
whistled all about the man, and he jumped back down into the ditch behind
the wall and danced a jig.
It was a cold day and the mud of the road was near frozen to the
condition of slurry. Some of the men were barefoot. Many wore homemade
uniforms in the mute colors that plant dyes make. The Federals were
arrayed on the field before them, all newly outfitted. Bright and shiny
in factory-made uniforms, new boots. When the Federals charged, the men
behind the wall held their fire and taunted them and one called out, Come
on closer, I want them boots. And they let the Federals come as near as
twenty paces before shooting them down. The men behind the wall were
firing at such close range that one man remarked on what a shame it was
that they had paper cartridges, for if they had the separate
makings--powder, ball, and wadding--they could tamp in thrifty little
loads and thus save on powder.
When he was squatted down loading, Inman could hear the firing, but
also the slap of balls into meat. A man near Inman grew so excited, or
perhaps so weary, that he forgot to pull the ramrod from the barrel. He
fired it off and it struck a Federal in the chest. The man fell backward,
and the rod stood from his body and quavered about with the last of his
breathing as if he had been pierced by an unfletched arrow.
The Federals kept on marching by the thousands at the wall all through
the day, climbing the hill to be shot down. There were three or four
brick houses scattered out through the field, and after a time the
Federals crowded up behind them in such numbers that they looked like the
long blue shadows of houses at sunrise. Periodically they were driven
from behind the houses by their own cavalry, who beat at them with the
flats of their sabers like schoolteachers paddling truants. Then they ran
toward the wall leaning forward with their shoulders hunched, a posture
that reminded many witnesses that day of men seeking headway against a
hard blowing rain. The Federals kept on coming long past the point where
all the pleasure of whipping them vanished. Inman just got to hating them
for their clodpated determination to die.
The fighting was in the way of a dream, one where your foes are ranked
against you countless and mighty. And you so weak. And yet they fall and
keep falling until they are crushed. Inman had fired until his right arm
was weary from working the ramrod, his jaws sore from biting the ends off
the paper cartridges. His rifle became so hot that the powder would
sometimes flash before he could ram home the ball. At the end of the day
the faces of the men around him were caked with blown-back powder so that
they were various shades of blue, and they put Inman in mind of a great
ape with a bulbous colorful ass he had seen in a traveling show once.
They had fought throughout the day under the eyes of Lee and
Longstreet. The men behind the wall had only to crank their necks around
and there the big men were, right above them looking on. The two generals
spent the afternoon up on the hill coining fine phrases like a pair of
wags. Longstreet said his men in the sunken road were in such a position
that if you marched every man in the Army of the Potomac across that
field, his men would kill them before they got to the wall. And he said
the Federals fell that long afternoon as steady as rain dripping down
from the eaves of a house.
Old Lee, not to be outdone, said it's a good thing war is so terrible
or else we'd get to liking it too much. As with everything Marse Robert
said, the men repeated that flight of wit over and over, passing it along
from man to man, as if God amighty Himself had spoken. When the report
reached Inman's end of the wall he just shook his head. Even back then,
early in the war, his opinion differed considerably from Lee's, for it
appeared to him that we like fighting plenty, and the more terrible it is
the better. And he suspected that Lee liked it most of all and would, if
given his preference, general them right through the gates of death
itself. What troubled Inman most, though, was that Lee made it clear he
looked on war as an instrument for clarifying God's obscure will. Lee
seemed to think battle--among all acts man might commit--stood outranked
in sacredness only by prayer and Bible reading. Inman worried that
following such logic would soon lead one to declare the victor of every
brawl and dogfight as God's certified champion. Those thoughts were
unspeakable among the ranks, as were his feelings that he did not enlist
to take on a Marse, even one as solemn and noble-looking as Lee was that
day on Maryes Heights.
Late in the afternoon the Federals quit coming and the shooting
tapered off. Thousands of men lay dead and dying on the sloping field
below the wall, and by dark the ones who could move had heaped up corpses
to make shelter. All that night the aurora flamed and shimmered lurid
colors across the sky to the north. Such a rare event was seen as an omen
by the men up and down the line, and they vied to see who could most
convincingly render its meaning down into plain speech. Somewhere above
them on the hill a fiddle struck up the sad chords of Lorena. The wounded
Federals moaned and keened and hummed between gritted teeth on the frozen
field and some called out the names of loved ones.
To this accompaniment, the poorly shod of Inman's party climbed over
the wall to yank the boots off the dead. Though his own boots were in
fair shape, Inman made a late-night foray onto the field simply to see
what the day's effort had accomplished. The Federals were thick on the
ground, lying all about in bloody heaps, bodies disassembled in every
style the mind could imagine. A man walking next to Inman looked out upon
the scene and said, If I had my way everything north of the Potomac would
resemble that right down to the last particular. Inman's only thought
looking on the enemy was, Go home. Some of the dead had papers pinned to
their clothing to say who they had been, and the rest were just
anonymous. Inman saw one man squat to yank the boots off a body lying
flat on its back, but as the man lifted a foot and pulled, the dead man
sat up and said something in an Irish accent so thick the only
understandable word was Shit.
Later, many hours after midnight, In

Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.

Home Delivery Subscriptions
With home delivery of The New York Times newspaper, do I get free digital access?
Yes, only print subscribers get the added benefit of a free full digital access subscription which includes unlimited access to our New York Times website, NYTimes.com, and the NYTimes apps for smartphones (iPhone®, BlackBerry® 10, Windows® Phone and Android™-powered phones) and tablets like the iPad®.
Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
To start using your free digital benefits, you’ll need your New York Times home delivery account number. This will be sent to you in a confirmation email once your order is placed. If you do not receive the email you can call New York Times Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (698-4637) and obtain the number.
What time will The New York Times be delivered to my home?
In most areas, The New York Times will be delivered by 6:30 a.m. on weekdays, and 8:30 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
Can I suspend home delivery while I am on vacation?
Yes, you can choose to receive credit for the period of your suspended delivery or donate your vacation credit to provide The New York Times newspaper to schools.
