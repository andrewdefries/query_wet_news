IN A DANCER'S WORLD, THE INEXORABLE FOE IS TIME
By DIANE SOLWAY; Diane Solway writes frequently about the arts.
Published: June 8, 1986
All dancers wage a losing battle against gravity and time, their bodies the instruments of betrayal in a world obsessed with youth and fairytale illusion. Airborne grace and quicksilver technique come of daunting offstage labor and a singular passion for physical perfection. With the years, the dancer's artistry gains nuance and depth, yet, paradoxically, speed, power and flexibility begin to wane. In due course, the body simply refuses to perform as the mind wills it to. No wonder that careers in ballet assume a certain urgency: a dancer can expect about 10 years of peak performance; if recognition and fulfillment of one's goals don't come by 30, they may not come, for most dancers are professionally finished by 40, at a point when those called to other vocations are just making their mark. A handful, like Galina Ulanova, Alicia Markova, Margot Fonteyn, will defy the odds and dance into their 50's and beyond, making adjustments in technique and compensating for them by their consummate artistry, durability and, not least of all, their stature. (For various reasons, modern-dance performers - especially leaders of companies - tend to go on longer, frequently choreographing roles for themselves that take their own aging into account.) The very mention of retirement strikes terror in most dancers, says the ballerina Karen Kain. A leading dancer with the National Ballet of Canada at 35, Miss Kain has yet to grapple seriously with the topic personally, but confesses that its inevitability haunts her. President of the newly-opened Dancer Transition Center in Toronto, created to help dancers adjust to retirement, she says, ''Like everyone else, I want to go on dancing forever, but I know the day is going to come when I will have to be doing something else. You're terrified that nothing will ever give you the fulfillment that dancing has given you.'' Some dancers choose to postpone retirement as long as possible. Frederic Franklin, a major drawing card for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1940's and now a popular coach and character dancer, notes, ''They may be feeling joy in dancing, but it's not coming across the footlights.'' Georgina Parkinson, the former Royal Ballet principal dancer who is now ballet mistress of American Ballet Theater, believes most dancers pursue one of two paths to retirement. ''You know they're either going to take the path that leads to dignified resignation or they're going to bleed it dry. Rudolf Nureyev, for example, has almost destroyed his own legend. Here is this extremely bright dancer who still wants to get out there and dance. It's as if he can't live unless he dances.'' As a 17-year corps veteran of the New York City Ballet, Linda Homek, 33, recognizes that only a few dancing years remain. ''At the age of 26, when I could see 30 fast approaching, time started to mean something,'' she says. ''I was injured and getting divorced and realized that I needed to establish some kind of security after dance.'' To that end, Miss Homek, who had never finished high school, earned her Bachelor of Arts degree and, last year, enrolled in a Ph. D. program of clinical psychology at Adelphi University, with a view to one day counseling dancers. Her colleagues, she recalls, looked askance upon learning of her double life. ''Most dancers can't open up that small world. When Mr. B. was alive, it was a mortal sin to think about anything else. That's beginning to change.'' Dancers' understanding of the tenuous and ephemeral nature of their craft usually sets in with the first injury. ''It hits them, wham! They realize they are mere mortals,'' declares Dr. William Hamilton, the orthopedic surgeon of City Ballet and A.B.T. ''Dancers, like astronauts and thoroughbred racehorses, are highly tuned, but what they do is so strenuous and so exacting that this selection process eventually weeds everybody out for one reason or another.'' The primary reason, says Dr. Hamilton, is loss of stamina. ''Staying in the condition that's necessary to perform becomes more and more difficult as you get older.'' Indeed, there are few days when dancers don't hurt in some part of their body from sheer strain or from a chronic injury. ''You're always pushing yourself,'' says Rosemary Dunleavy, a corps member with City Ballet for 10 years before becoming its ballet mistress. ''When you don't want to push anymore, it's time to stop.'' Miss Dunleavy, who prepares casting and rehearsal schedules and knows the complete Balanchine repertory by memory, believes dancers retire in three stages. ''All dancers go through a period when they see it coming. Then comes the period of adjustment when they can admit it to themselves, and lastly, the point when they can say it out loud.'' ''You start to have accidents,'' explains Alexandra Danilova, who, decades ago, was the glamorous reigning ballerina of the Ballet Russe. ''The muscles give up, like an elastic that's been washed too much.'' Though she retired from the stage in 1958 and has long tended fledgling ballerinas at the School of American Ballet, she insists her dancing career is not over. ''When I teach variations class, I am performing.'' 1

Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.

With home delivery of The New York Times newspaper, do I get free digital access?
Yes, only print subscribers get the added benefit of a free full digital access subscription which includes unlimited access to our New York Times website, NYTimes.com, and the NYTimes apps for smartphones (iPhone®, BlackBerry® 10, Windows® Phone and Android™-powered phones) and tablets like the iPad®.
Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
To start using your free digital benefits, you’ll need your New York Times home delivery account number. This will be sent to you in a confirmation email once your order is placed. If you do not receive the email you can call New York Times Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (698-4637) and obtain the number.
What time will The New York Times be delivered to my home?
In most areas, The New York Times will be delivered by 6:30 a.m. on weekdays, and 8:30 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
Can I suspend home delivery while I am on vacation?
