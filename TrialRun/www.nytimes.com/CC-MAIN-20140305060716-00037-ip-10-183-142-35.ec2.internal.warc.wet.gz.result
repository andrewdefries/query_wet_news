Santo Domingo Published: March 9, 1997 (Page 2 of 2) In recent years, Santo Domingo has become increasingly noisy, bustling and crowded, its streets clogged with automobiles and motorbikes. But the Jardin Botanico Nacional, Avenida Republica de Colombia, (809) 567-6211, offers a lush and tranquil respite. Set on 445 acres in the northwest corner of the city, it bursts with tropical exuberance and boasts displays of palms, bromeliads and orchids, along with butterflies, wildfowl and chattering birds. Admission is 75 cents; guided tours by train or bus cost extra.Where to StayA 23 percent tax is imposed on all accommodations in the Dominican Republic. The rates quoted here include the tax. Lower rates may be available at some hotels during low season, which begins in June.The Sheraton Santo Domingo Hotel, 365 Avenida George Washington, telephone (809) 221-6666, fax (809) 687-8150, is reliable, efficient and convenient, making it a favorite of business travelers. It also boasts a desirable seafront location, 260 rooms, all with at least a partial ocean view, and a casino. Doubles start at $140. Farther away from downtown and the colonial center, but still offering rooms with sea views, is the Hotel Hispaniola, at the corner of Avenida Abraham Lincoln and Avenida Independencia, (809) 221-2131, fax (809) 532-2672, across from a sister establishment, the Hotel Santo Domingo. Many of the 165 rooms, decorated in tropical woods with a breezy Caribbean air, have spacious balconies, and there is also a casino, a large pool and a discotheque. Double rates, $105, include breakfast.Budget: The Hotel Naco, 22 Ave nida Tiradentes, (809) 562-3100, (809) 544-0957, is a good bet. There is the usual casino, pool and restaurant, and the 106 rooms come with cable television and kitchenette. The double rate of $52 includes breakfast.Luxury: Rooms with a view of the Caribbean Sea are plentiful along the Malecon, starting with the Jaragua Resort and Casino, 367 Avenida George Washington; (809) 221-2222, fax (809) 686-0528. There are 300 luxury rooms and suites, a large spa, health club, pool and tennis courts. A double room with ocean view costs around $196.Right down the block, at 218 Ave nida George Washington, (809) 221-0000, fax (809) 221-2020, is the Hotel V Centenario Intercontinental, which offers 200 rooms tastefully furnished in tropical style, a casino and restaurants specializing in Dominican and Brazilian dishes. A double room runs about $175, though various discount packages are available, especially on weekends.Where to EatThe cobblestone streets and squares of the Colonial Zone are full of small restaurants, cafes and pubs. One of the finest is Cafe Coco, (809) 687-9624, in a converted, tastefully maintained colonial house at 53 Calle Padre Billini. The menu here changes daily; the two Englishmen who run the restaurant emphasize international fare. They are especially strong in poultry and fish dishes, such as cod prepared with herbs or tandoori chicken.. Reservations are required. Dinner for two with a modest bottle of wine is about $75.Just down the street on Calle Padre Billini at the corner of Calle Duarte is Retazos, (809) 688-6140, a cafe specializing in Dominican dishes. That means plenty of seafood; the crab stew (guisado de cangrejo) and snapper cooked in coconut milk are particularly delicious. The setting, too, is appealing: a pair of small dining rooms kept cool by ceiling fans and framed by windows full of flowers. Dinner for two about $50.Both sides of the Malecon, the seaside promenade where most of the best hotels can be found, are lined with restaurants. One of the best is the unabashedly Italian Vesuvio, 521 Avenida George Washington, (809) 221-1954, which offers a terrific antipasto and follows it up with an array of attractive seafood pasta dishes. Dinner for two about $90.Though quite a distance from the usual tourist haunts, Sully's, Avenida Charles Summers at the corner of Calle Caoba in the Prados section, is worth the ride. Again, the emphasis is on seafood, prepared not only in traditional Dominican styles but also French and Italian. If it swims, they have it: lobster, shrimp, conch, mussels, octopus. Dinner for two about $50. (809) 562-3389For typical Dominican food at a lower price, try Lumi's, 809 Avenida Abraham Lincoln, (809) 540-4584. A favorite with residents of the capital, Lumi's calls itself a ''steak park'' because it serves its grilled-meat specialties alfresco. Dinner for two with rum or beer runs about $30.ShoppingAn accident of geology has given the Dominican Republic some of the most remarkable and abundant deposits of amber in the world. Thanks to the movie ''Jurassic Park,'' interest in the substance has grown in recent years, along with opportunities to see it being fashioned into jewelry and souvenirs. So have scams; much of what is sold on the street as amber is really plastic.The new Amber World Museum, 452 Arzobispo Merino, (809) 682-3309, houses a fascinating display of scorpions, butterflies and plants fossilized in the resin millions of years ago. Craftsmen polish and shape raw amber for sale in an adjoining salon. Open Monday to Saturday 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., Sunday 9 to noon.Around the corner at 110 Calle Restauracion is Ambar Nacional, (809) 686-5700, which sells items made from amber, coral and larimar, a beautiful sea-blue stone, at somewhat lower prices than the museum's. The most attractive pieces are probably the jewelry made of amber or larimar set in silver.Photos: V Centenario Inter-Continental Hotel. At the Alcazar de Colon, a relic of earlier days. Cafe Coco.

In-Depth From A.D.A.M. Exercise's Effects on Other ConditionsPhysical activity makes you healthier. It lowers your risk for cardiovascular disease and reduces bone loss. Physical activity also helps the body use calories more efficiently, which helps you eliminate body fat and lose weight. It also helps you maintain weight loss by increasing your metabolism and reducing your appetite.
Effect of Exercise on Cancer
A number of studies have indicated that regular exercise may reduce the risk of breast, colon, and possibly prostate cancers.
Studies confirm that exercise significantly reduces the risk of both colon cancer (by up to 50%). Exercise also decreases the risk of breast cancer in pre and post menopausal women by up to 30%.
Low intensity exercise has a protective effect against colon cancer, according to studies, including the Nurses Health Study and the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II. People with colon cancer who exercise may reduce their risk of a recurrence.
Exercise also has a beneficial effect on people receiving treatment for cancer. Aerobic and resistance training can reduce fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer. Fatigue is a common side effect of such treatments.
Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract
Endurance athletes often report stomach problems, such as bloating, diarrhea, and gas, even at rest. Moderate regular exercise might reduce the risk for some intestinal disorders. These disorders include ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion, and diverticulosis. Older people who exercise moderately may have a lower risk for severe gastrointestinal bleeding.
Effects on Neurological Diseases and Mental Decline
Studies have shown that regular exercise, particularly walking, helps reduce one's risk for memory loss. Epidemiologic studies have found an association between increased exercise and slower rate of functional decline in older adults. To date, there are no clear explanations for this apparent benefit. Aerobic exercise has been linked to improved reaction time in people of all ages.
Exercise seems to improve the physical and emotional well-being of patients who already have Alzheimer's disease. The patients exercised moderately for as little as 60 minutes each week. Doctors noted patients who exercised were less depressed, wandered away less, suffered fewer falls, and were placed in nursing homes later, compared to patients who did not exercise.
People with existing neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, should be encouraged to exercise. Specialized exercise programs that improve mobility are particularly valuable for patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with neurological disorders who exercise experience less stiffness, as well as reduction in, and even reversal of, muscle wasting. In addition, the psychological benefits of exercise are extremely important in managing these disorders. Exercise machines, aquatic exercises, and walking are particularly useful.
Effects on Emotional Disorders
Some research has suggested that exercise may have antidepressant effects. Although there is little evidence that exercise can correct major depression, a number of studies have suggested benefits in mild to moderate depression in adults. Research findings include:
Just 30 minutes of brisk exercise three times a week was as effective as medication in relieving symptoms, and reducing relapse, in many patients with mild-to-moderate depression.
Over half of older women with depression that did not respond to medication showed improvement with 10 weeks of exercise. (About a third of women who did not exercise also improved during that time.)
Studies on elderly, depressed patients report modest benefits from exercise, even in those who do not respond to antidepressants. Simply participating in a group activity may help improve mood.
Teenagers who are active in sports have a greater sense of well-being than their sedentary peers. The more vigorously they exercise, the better their emotional health.
Physical inactivity is strongly linked to depression in children 8 - 12 years of age.
Exercise decreases some of the most troublesome emotional symptoms of menopause. Women who exercise during menopause showed less anxiety, stress, and depression than inactive women with menopause did.
Specific exercises may be particularly beneficial:
Aerobics. Either brief periods of intense training or prolonged aerobic workouts can raise levels of certain chemicals in the brain. These chemicals -- which include endorphins, adrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine -- produce the so-called runner's high. Weight loss and increased muscle tone can boost self-esteem.
Yoga. Yoga practice, which involves rhythmic stretching movements and breathing, has been found to positively affect mood. It may have clinical potential as a technique for improving and stabilizing mood. A study comparing yoga to aerobic exercise found that men have significantly lower levels of tension, fatigue, and anger after yoga, compared with levels after swimming. Yoga and swimming tended to produce equal benefits in women.

Effect of Exercise on Pregnancy
Moderate exercise in healthy pregnant women does not increase the risk for miscarriage, preterm labor, or rupture of the membrane. Not exercising increases the risk for complications, including low-birth weight babies. Exercising increases the fetal heart rate, which in turn protects the baby.
Healthy women with normal pregnancies should exercise at least three times a week, being careful to warm up, cool down, and drink plenty of liquids. Many prenatal calisthenics programs are available.
The following are specific exercises that may benefit the pregnant woman:
Swimming and water aerobics may be the best option for most pregnant women. Water exercises involve no impact, overheating is unlikely, and swimming face down promotes optimum blood flow to the uterus.
Performing yoga exercises under the guidance of informed instructors can be very helpful.
Walking is also beneficial.
To strengthen pelvic muscles, women should perform Kegel exercises at least six times a day. This involves contracting the muscles around the vagina and urethra for three seconds 12 - 15 times in a row.
The following precautions are generally recommended for pregnant women who exercise:
Fit women who have exercised regularly before pregnancy may work out intensely as long as the doctor approves and no discomfort occurs. However, excessive exercise can cause undernourishment of the fetus.
As a rule for previously sedentary, low-risk expectant mothers, the pulse rate should not exceed 70 - 75% of the maximum heart rate, or more than 150 beats per minute. Any sedentary expectant mother should check with her doctor before starting an exercise program.
Vigorous exercise may improve the chances for a timely delivery. All pregnant women, however, should avoid high-impact, jerky, and jarring exercises, such as aerobic dancing, which can weaken the pelvic floor muscles that support the uterus.
During exercise, women should monitor their temperature to avoid overheating, a side effect that can damage the fetus. (Pregnant women should also not use hot tubs or steam baths, which can cause fetal damage and miscarriage.)
Note: Strenuous exercise may affect the flavor of breast milk for a short time afterward. Nursing mothers who engage in such activity might want to wait about an hour after exercising before they feed their infant.

NYT Lesson Plan: Twisted Tales
The New York Times Learning Network Lesson Plan Developed in Partnership with The Bank Street College of Education in New York City http://www.nytimes.com/learning To print document select "Print" from the "File" menu on your browser. Twisted TalesRewriting Favorite Stories from New PerspectivesRelated New York Times Article" 'Tarzan': Monkey Business -- Rewriting the Jungle Book", By JANET MASLIN, June 18, 1999Author(s)Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning NetworkGrades: 6-8, 9-12Subjects: Language Arts Overview of Lesson Plan: This lesson allows students to see and experience how a story can drastically change when told from the perspective of a character whose voice was not heard in the story's original form. After reading and discussing a New York Times review of the latest Tarzan film, students will select a favorite children's story and rewrite it from another character's point of view, focusing on the character's views of the elements of the plot, other characters, and himself or herself. Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes Objectives: Students will:
1. Evaluate the value of point of view in their favorite children's stories and the ways in which the story would change if the narrator changed. 2. Examine how the Tarzan stories have been successfully told on screen a great number of times for many years, focusing on the newest Disney version, by reading and discussing "Monkey Business: Rewriting the Jungle Book." 3. Imagine that their favorite children's stories are being retold from the point of view of a character not directly heard in the original story, and reflect on how this character would view elements of the plot, other characters, and himself or herself.
4. Rewrite a children's story from the perspective of the character analyzed in class. Resources / Materials: -student journals
-paper
-pens/pencils
-classroom blackboard
-copies of "Monkey Business: Rewriting the Jungle Book" (one per student) Activities / Procedures: 1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What is your favorite children's story, and why? What character's point of view is most closely followed in this story? What might change in this story if it were written from another character's perspective? Students may share their answers.
2. Read and discuss "Monkey Business: Rewriting the Jungle Book," focusing on the following questions:
a. How has the Tarzan character (and other characters) been changed in different Tarzan movies?
b. What characteristics does Tarzan possess in the new Disney version of this tale? (Focus on reactions to others, actions, thoughts and appearance.)
c. How do visual effects impact the new Tarzan film?
d. How is music used to affect the new Tarzan film?
e. Who are some of the other characters in this movie, and how are they characterized? f. How does the movie reviewer relay her opinions of this movie? Find specific examples.
g. Does this movie review encourage you to see this movie or not, and why?
3. Explain to students that they will be "refreshing" old children's stories by rewriting them from another character's point of view. Tell students that they may use the story that was the subject of their earlier journal exercise, or they may use another children's story that they like. Students then answer the following questions on a piece of paper, written on the board for easier student reference:
--From what character's perspective are you choosing to "retell" this story?
--Jot down the basic plot of the story for your later reference.
--How does this character view and interact with the other characters in this story? (Offer a detailed answer for every character with whom your character would be concerned.)
--How do

Hide details	Frequently Asked Questions
Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.

Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
To start using your free digital benefits, you’ll need your New York Times home delivery account number. This will be sent to you in a confirmation email once your order is placed. If you do not receive the email you can call New York Times Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (698-4637) and obtain the number.
