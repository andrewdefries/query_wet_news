A NATION AT WAR: BAGHDAD DIARY; Last, Desperate Days of a Brutal Reign By JOHN F. BURNSPublished: April 20, 2003 On the gilded marble tablets posted at the gateways of a score of presidential palaces, it was known as ''The Era of Saddam Hussein.''Yet in the 26 days of American warfare it took to bring that era down, the hallmark of Mr. Hussein's rule was revealed not as one of grandeur, but of gangsterism and thuggery. On the pediments of his palaces, Mr. Hussein mounted 30-foot bronze busts of himself as Saladin, the Mesopotamian warrior who conquered Jerusalem with his Islamic army in the 12th century. But Mr. Hussein's legacy, revealed with merciless clarity in his last, desperate weeks in power and in the looting of those palaces that followed, was not one of historical accomplishment, as he claimed, but a chronicle of terror, gre

City Officials Consulting With 'Oh! Calcutta!' Staff
May 24, 1969
City Officials Consulting With 'Oh! Calcutta!' Staff
By LEWIS FUNKE n an unusual procedure, members of city departments
have been consulting--"unofficially"--with the management of "Oh! Calcutta," the Off Broadway revue with sex as the theme that is giving preview performances at the Eden Theater.
This was disclosed yesterday by the show's producer, Hilliard Elkins, who said that his guests had been attending the theater, at Second Avenue and 12th Street, as "a special favor." Some were invited to the first preview, at which only part of the show was presented. They are expected to return. Others have seen later performances. The revue is to open officially on June 17.
The consultations reflect the management's concern with the show's contents as well as the wish to avoid running afoul of the law, as was the case with "Che!", an off-off Broadway production that opened March 22 at the Free Store Theater, 114 Cooper Square. It was ordered closed two days later.
"Oh! Calcutta!", devised by Kenneth Tynan, literary manager of Britain's National Theater and a leading figure in the successful battle to end censorship in the English theater, has described the show as having been designed to provide an evening of "elegant erotica."
Since its initial preview on May 13, it has become the season's most-talked-about show in theater circles.

Vietnam, Test of Presidents, Was Distant War and Battle at Home May 1, 1975 NEWS ANALYSIS
Vietnam, Test of Presidents, Was Distant War and Battle at Home By Leslie H. GelbSpecial to The New York Times
ashington, April 30--In Franz Kafka's "The Trial," a priest sets out to explain the mysteries of life to a character called K. They discuss a parable of the law and disagree on its meaning.
"No," says the priest, "it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary."
"A melancholy conclusion," K responds. "It turns lying into a universal principle."
From Truman to Ford, six Presidents felt that they had to do and say what was necessary to prevent a Communist takeover of Vietnam. For all, perhaps with the exception of Mr, Ford, Indochina was their initiation into American foreign policy.
