Small surgeries, huge markups
An $87,500 bill for a 20-minute knee procedure is just an extreme example of high amounts that insurers are billed by out-of-network surgery centers, experts say. Insurers are starting to fight back.

A Southern California surgery center charged teacher Lynne Nielsen $87,500 for a routine, 20-minute knee operation that normally costs about $3,000.
Despite the huge markup, the Long Beach Unified School District and its insurer, Blue Shield of California, paid virtually all of the bill from Advanced Surgical Partners in Costa Mesa. Blue Shield mailed the $84,800 check to the high school Spanish teacher last month and told her to sign it over to the surgery center.
Nielsen said she was outraged and refused to send the check. Instead, she asked the California attorney general's office to investigate the matter. "This is insane," she said.
The 61-year-old is the latest patient caught up in a growing battle nationwide over billing by outpatient surgery centers. Industry experts say some of these surgery centers seek out well-insured patients such as Nielsen, sometimes by waiving their copays and deductibles, and then bill their insurers exorbitant amounts for out-of-network care.
All too often, critics say, insurers pay these large sums and then cite high medical bills for why insurance premiums keep rising for businesses and consumers.
"This bill is so outrageous it almost takes my breath away," said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. "This is an example of what's wrong with our healthcare system, and employees and taxpayers of the school district are paying the price here."
In response to questions from The Times, Blue Shield defended its $84,800 payment as proper. Advanced Surgical Partners, through its lawyer, said the bill was excessive. Amid the scrutiny, the two sides agreed to a lower amount this week.
Nationwide, some insurers have begun to challenge these bills from outpatient centers. Last year, a unit of insurance giant Aetna Inc. sued several surgery centers in Northern California and accused them of overbilling the insurer more than $20 million. It has pursued similar actions against providers in New Jersey and Texas. Other insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. have filed similar suits in California.
In one instance, Aetna said, a California surgery center charged $73,536 for a kidney stone procedure when the average in-network charge was $7,612. Aetna said it paid some of these bills before disputing them in court.
Doctors and surgery centers say the criticism is unjustified. Surgery centers say they have helped reduce healthcare cos
