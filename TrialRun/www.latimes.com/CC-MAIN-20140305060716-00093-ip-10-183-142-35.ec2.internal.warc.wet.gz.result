Photos: Seven generations of Corvettes
By David Undercoffler
January 21, 2013, 1:18 p.m.
NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick spent $1.1 million on the first production 2014 Corvette Stingray -- and didn't even get to drive the car home. Hendrick bought the world's first production version of the newly redesigned Corvette on Saturday at the Barrett-Jackson classic car auction in Scottsdale, Ariz. But he'll have to wait to take delivery on the car -- with the coveted vehicle identification number ending in 0001 -- until the redesigned Corvette starts production in late summer.
That means, unlike other buyers, Hendrick gets to fully customize the vehicle, selecting the interior and exterior colors, the performance packages and options. A bright red pre-production Corvette was a placeholder during the auction, which was shown live on the Speed channel.
Photos: Seven generations of Corvettes The 2014 Corvette is the seventh generation of the iconic sports car, and it made its world debut at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show on Jan. 13. It's powered by a 450-horsepower V-8 and will come with either a six-speed automatic transmission or a seven-speed manual. Chevy hasn't released pricing for the 2014 Corvette, but it probably will start at under $55,000. Proceeds from the Barrett-Jackson sale will benefit the College for Creative Studies in Detroit. The school has a well-regarded automotive design program, and more than 170 graduates of the school work in General Motors' design studios, according to the automaker. The Corvette Stingray was one of several vehicles GM had Barrett-Jackson auction off for charity. Also in the mix was a 1958 Corvette owned by GM Chairman and CEO Dan Akerson. That car raised $270,000 for Habitat for Humanity Detroit's Morningside Commons neighborhood. In addition to the five GM cars sold for charity, 16 other vehicles hit the Barrett-Jackson auction block in Scottsdale to raise money for charities. The company says that since 1971, it's raised more than

Goldberg: Is disability the new welfare?
As the nature of the economy changes, disability programs are sometimes taking the place of welfare.
Comments

By Jonah Goldberg
April 2, 2013
The government in Britain recently did something interesting.
It asked everyone receiving an "incapacity benefit" — a disability program slowly being phased out under new reforms — to submit to a medical test to confirm they were too disabled to work. A third of recipients (878,000 people) didn't even bother and dropped out of the program rather than be examined. Of those tested, more than half (55%) were found fit for work and a quarter were found fit for some work.
But that's Britain, where there's a long tradition of gaming the dole. Americans would never think of taking advantage of the taxpayers or misleading the government. Well, except for the couple dozen people who have pleaded guilty to scamming the Long Island Rail Road's federal disability system in a $1-billion fraud scheme. That would pay for a lot of White House tours.
