'The Walking Dead' Season 3 cast, character portraits & previews
The zombie apocalypse survivors lead by Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) find a new home in Season 3 of "The Walking Dead," but their lives aren't going to be easier for it. The new season will see Rick's group try to take over a prison from the zombie inmates. I recently visited the prison set outside Atlanta, and it is amazing. Looks absolutely real inside and out. More on that later. The new season also introduces two fan favorite characters from the graphic novels: The Governor (played by David Morrissey) and badass warrior Michonne (played by Danai Gurira). Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), the bully older brother of Daryl (Norman Reedus), shows up to make more trouble as well.
"The Walking Dead" Season 3 debuts at 8 p.m. CT Oct. 14 on AMC. Check out the cast portraits and non-spoilery character photos for the new season below.

County crews did work on Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas' home
By Jack Leonard and Paul Pringle
11:29 PM PST, January 15, 2014

Government employees performed work on the garage of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ private home, installing drywall, an air conditioner, appliances and a security system, according to sources familiar with the job.
The detached garage at Ridley-Thomas’ Leimert Park residence appeared to have been converted into an office with a restroom sometime before the county work was done, said a source familiar with the property, who requested anonymity.

Candidate Hillary: the GOP's dream
A campaign against Sen. Clinton may give Republicans the best shot at running as the party of change.
Jonah Goldberg
October 23, 2007

The most interesting thing to come out of the umpteenth Republican debate Sunday is confirmation that the GOP is dying to run against Hillary Clinton. Like Don Rickles flaying a heckler, each candidate whacked at Clinton as if she were a pants-suited piñata. When they were done with their one-liners, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee deadpanned: "Look, I like to be funny. There's nothing funny about Hillary Clinton being president."No, but there's something deeply advantageous about having her as an opponent. So far, the commentary about the Republican offensive against Hillary has focused mostly on how it reflects poorly on the GOP (those Clinton-hating wing nuts are at it again!). What's not been fully grasped is how Hillary gives the GOP its best chance at being the party of change. Newt Gingrich, for one, has been pointing this out for months, using the electoral triumph of Nicolas Sarkozy in France last spring as an example. A Cabinet minister for the unpopular Jacques Chirac, who'd served in office for a biblically long term of 12 years, Sarkozy ran against his own incumbent party's complaisance as well as his Socialist opponent, Segolene Royal, arguing that she merely represented a return to a failed past and "more of the same."America -- obviously -- isn't France, but Democrats may be misreading America nonetheless.
