Local gifts give a sense of place
Want to capture the essence of Southern California? Think local.
You'd rather staycation than vacation. The atolls of the Maldives don't hold a candle to the view in Malibu. And all the pastries in Paris are no match for the tasty vittles in Venice -- California, that is. Whether you are gifting friends and family afar or the locavore as close as the next cubicle, there's so much to choose from that's designed in, made in or inspired by Los Angeles, be it sweet, sophisticated or playful. Consider a box of hand-molded, ornament-shaped chocolates from Valerie Confections in Silver Lake or one of Los Angeles handbag designer Clare Vivier's covetable monogrammed leather pouches. Transportation for the discerning tyke? Airflow Collectibles' antique reproduction pedal cars are made in Orange. Bigger kids can ride the waves with the most haute paddle boards around, handcrafted in wood with a carbon fiber finish by James Perse. And after all the holiday madness is done, you can sit back and bask in the California sun with a refreshing libation served in one of Sisters of Los Angeles' colorful tumblers emblazoned with the names of Southern California beaches and toast to another holiday season well spent.
