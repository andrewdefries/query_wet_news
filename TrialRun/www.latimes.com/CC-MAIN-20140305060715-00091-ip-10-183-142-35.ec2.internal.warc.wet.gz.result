Killing a teenager's laptop, loudly
Tommy Jordan tried some tough-love parenting by shooting his daughter Hannah's computer. Did he succeed in shaming her? Probably not. Comments
0
This frame grab taken from an undated video posted on YouTube Feb. 8, 2012 by Tommy Jordan of Albemarle, N.C. shows Jordan answering his teenage daughter's Facebook complaints by firing several rounds from his handgun into his daughter's laptop her computer as it lies on the ground. More than 26 million people have seen the video in which Jordan reads and replies to his daughter's rant before emptying his .45-caliber pistol into her laptop.

The candidates' fashionable wives on the campaign trail
Anyone who has glimpsed the presidential candidates' wives on the campaign trail knows that safe, boxy suits are not in the fashion vocabulary of either the Democratic first lady or the Republican who aspires to replace her. Their choices of form-fitting dresses in bright colors and edgy prints are not attempts to conjure the housewifely frocks of the "Mad Men" era. They're more an indication of a gradual shift in dress code toward a freer, more casual -- and body-conscious -- style. More: Michelle Obama and Ann Romney: No 'Mad Men' style for them -- Carla Hall
