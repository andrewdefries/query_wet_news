Patt Morrison Asks: The brain, Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa Perspective from a leading U.S. neurosurgeon who made it from illegal-immigrant California farmworker to Harvard Med.

October 1, 2011
Here's a Hollywood pitch for you: Leading U.S. neurosurgeon started life as a struggling Mexican boy who made it from illegal-immigrant California farmworker to Harvard Med. Not buying it? You should. Dr. Alfredo Qui√±ones-Hinojosa was that kid and is that man -- associate prof, surgeon and head of the brain tumor stem cell lab at Johns Hopkins. His work puts him, passionately, on the cutting-edge of brain cancer research, and his life wedges him, reluctantly, into the immigration quarrel. He tells his story -- his traumas and triumphs, and his patients' -- in an autobiography, "Becoming Dr. Q," and here, now.
You started by working with your hands -- in cotton and tomato fields in California -- and here you are, still working with your hands as a brain surgeon.
