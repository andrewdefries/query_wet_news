SFO Terminal 2. This bright space, formerly the airport's international terminal, was redone and reopened in 2011. Its 14 gates serve American and Virgin American flights, including many from LAX. Arriving, you find a yoga area, day spa, Peet's, Pinkberry, sushi, an organic café, a properly sized bookshop, a kids' playspace and even snazzy bathrooms (with those eco-chic Dyson air-blowers). Using an easy AirTrain and BART route, you can get from the terminal to Powell Street (near Union Square) in 35 minutes. Be warned, however, that fog is your foe at SFO. Airport statistics for the year ended Oct. 31 show just 70.8% of SFO departures were on time. Across the bay at Oakland International Airport (also about 35 minutes from Powell Street via BART and a shuttle bus), 80.1% of flights departed on time. 780 S. Airport Blvd.; (650) 821-8211, http:/
