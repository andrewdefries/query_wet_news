Bryan Cranston taking LBJ play to Broadway
By David Ng

Bryan Cranston, who recently completed his run in the AMC drama series "Breaking Bad," will be taking his current stage role as President Lyndon Johnson to New York. The actor will appear in "All the Way," by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Robert Schenkkan, on Broadway later this season, but no opening date has been released.
Producer Jeffrey Richards made the announcement on Sunday. (Schenkkan had broken the news earlier via social media.) Cranston has been appearing in "All the Way" at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass., where the sold-out run is set to close on Saturday.
The play depicts the early period of LBJ's presidency and his relationship with key political figures, including Martin Luther King Jr., J. Edgar Hoover and Sen. Richard Russell.

"All the Way" originated at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, where it premiered in 2012 with a different cast. Bill Rauch, artistic director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, will direct the Broadway transfer.
The play, which runs close to three hours, received mixed reviews for its A.R.T. run. The production would mark Cranston's first time perfo

THE CALIFORNIA COOK
Summertime, and the cooking is languid
Given the slow treatment, vegetables become rich and silky -- and reveal themselves as unexpected appetizers.
By Russ Parsons
Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
August 15, 2007

Walk into a really hopping tapas bar in Spain or a swanky little osteria in Italy on a summer evening, and right at the front door you're likely to be confronted with a long table full of bowls of vegetables. At first glance, you might think this is just one more sign that the end of the world is near: a salad bar in Europe?
But there's one big difference: Most of the vegetables will have been cooked, and not just a little bit -- they'll be almost limp. Well, actually, there's another difference as well: They will be absolutely delicious.
While we modern cooks have made a cult of crispness since the introduction of nouvelle cuisine back in the 1970s, it pays to remember that sometimes it takes long cooking to bring out flavor. And while it may seem paradoxical, that's especially true in the summertime.
Well-cooked vegetables have depth and richness. Even better, they are usually served at room temperature. Though some of their bright colors may have faded a bit, and though their crisp textures may have softened to the point that they flop lazily on a fork, this gives them a cool languor that is infinitely appealing when the weather is scorching.
The combination of all these things creates what can best be described as almost a negative heat. Come in from a hot, hectic day of running around, and a bowl of sweet braised zucchini -- cooked to the texture of butter, tart with lemon and perfumed with fresh herbs -- is almost as good as air conditioning.
You can serve these vegetables as the Spanish and Italians would, as appetizers (and the more the merrier -- mix and match vegetables to make an assortment of flavors).
Or you can complement them with nothing more than some sliced salame, prosciutto or chorizo, or a piece of good cheese. Add a glass of wine to make an elegant light dinner.
Under the common heading of "long-cooked vegetables," there's a wide variety of ingredients and techniques.
All sorts of vegetables can be grilled. Brush slices of eggplant and zucchini with olive oil and grill them over a medium-hot fire until they are tender. As they come off the grill, layer them on a platter with fresh herbs and sprinkle with olive oil and good vinegar.
You can do something similar by preparing the vegetables the way the Italians call in scapece. Fry eggplant, zucchini and even carrots in hot oil until they're just brown, then dress them with vinegar and fresh herbs and set them aside so the flavors can marry.
Even more simply, grill whole bell peppers until their skins are shriveled and start to blacken. After they have cooled, peel away the papery skin and toss them with olive oil, sliced garlic and Sherry vinegar. A generous grating of black pepper gives a nice bottom to the flavor.
If you're tired of grilled and fried eggplant, try steaming it. This sounds crazy, but it really works. Cut the eggplant (peeled or not, as you like) into chunks and steam it until the flesh is extremely tender (this will take only seven or eight minutes). The flavor stays pure and clean. After it's cooked, toss the eggplant with minced garlic and herbs, olive oil and lemon juice.
Build a flavor baseOR roast tomatoes: Grind fresh bread cubes to crumbs with garlic and basil; slice off the top one-third of fresh tomatoes and squeeze out the seeds; jam th
