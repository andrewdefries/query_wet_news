Newton: How L.A.'s shortfall adds up
Villaraigosa's ability to bring the city's budget under control is constrained by two key decisions made earlier in his tenure.
Comments
0
In 2007, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other city leaders approved a five-year package with the coalition of unions representing most civilian city workers that promised 5% raises each year.
(Los Angeles Times / April 14, 2012)
By Jim Newton
April 16, 2012
As Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa works to bring the city's finances under control, he's made some laudable moves, but his actions today are constrained by two decisions from earlier in his tenure that limit his options.
The first came in late 2007, when the mayor and other city leaders approved a five-year package with the coalition of unions representing most civilian city workers that promised 5% raises each year.The second was in response to the economic downturn that blew up the assumption that the city could afford those raises. When revenues suddenly declined, the city had to cut labor costs, and Villaraigosa and other city leaders tried to minimize the impact of cutbacks by shifting city workers from jobs paid for by the general fund into those that are supported by their own revenue streams â€” sanitation, for instance.
