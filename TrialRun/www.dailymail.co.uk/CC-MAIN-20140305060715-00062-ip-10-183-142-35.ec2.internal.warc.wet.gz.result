Married cancer researchers are BOTH diagnosed with breast cancer - of the same type, stage and at exactly the same age

A married couple, who have dedicated their careers to cancer research, have told how they both contracted the same type of breast cancer at 47.Dr Irene Bogler, 52, from Houston, Texas, was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in 2007, and now her husband Oliver, five years her junior, is battling the disease.Mr Bogler told ABC News: 'Because of Irene’s history really it was very odd for me to come out and say 'Hey I think I have the same thing you had'. I was really concerned about feeling stupid and foolish.'Scroll down for video Strange coincidence: Cancer researchers, Irene and Oliver Bogler (pictured with their two children), both developed stage II breast cancer at 47
Mr Bogler, who works at the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas with his wife, is about to undergo his second month of chemotherapy. He says that he is grateful his wife can relate. He explained: 'One of the things that's nice is that she understands where I'm at - that support has been great. More...

'You begin to think about the fact that you won't make it 'til 80 years old and it changes how you tackle life. It's hard to convey that unless you've gone through that yourself.' Five years ago, Mrs Bogler, whose research involves finding genes that cause breast cancer, had six months of chemo, a mastectomy and radiation therapy. She was given the all-clear just weeks before her husband was diagnosed with the disease this year.'Having a wife who had breast cancer, I thought it
would be weird saying I had it too'
While fighting breast cancer, she remembers her husband and family giving her unconditional support.She said: 'Oliver was great, he obviously didn't understand the personal experience but he understood the process.'In March, after his chemotherapy treatment, Mr Bogler will undergo a radical mastectomy.The
procedure involves the removal of the skin over the breast, all of the lymph nodes underneath the arm, and the chest muscles. There for each other: The Boglers, who have two children together, met 20 years ago while doing cancer research at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in San Diego
Reducing the risk: In March, after his chemotherapy treatment, Mr Bogler will undergo a radical mastectomy
Breast cancer in men is very rare, and is about 100 times more common among women, according to the American Cancer Society.Dr Sharon Giordano, Mr Bogler's doctor and men's breast cancer specialist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, said that in many cases men have a delayed diagnosis because they don't think they could be at risk.WHAT IS BREAST CANCER IN MEN?Many people do not realize that men have breast tissue and that they can develop breast cancer.The American Cancer Society estimates that in the U.S. in 2012 about 2,190 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among men and about 410 men will die from the disease.Breast cancer is about 100 times less common among men than among women, and the lifetime risk of getting breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000. The number of breast cancer cases in men, relative to the population, has been fairly stable over the last 30 years.The outlook for men with breast cancer was once thought to be worse than that for women, but recent studies have not found this to be true. In fact, men and women with the same stage of breast cancer have fairly similar chances of survival. SOURCE: www.cancer.org
'Men on average have an advanced disease because you have to have a lump to identify it. They don't examine their nipples,' she explained.Although she has seen over 100 male breast cancer patients, Dr Giordano said the Boglers are the first couple she has ever seen who have both had breast cancer.Some have questioned if the Bogler's involvement in cancer research is the reason why they developed the same cancer.Mr Bogler's brother, Daniel, revealed: 'First of all, we don't have a history of cancer. Second of all breast cancer is an extremely unusual thing for a man.
'It's not Irene's genes or Oliver's genes, so you do wonder why. We asked Oliver about that when he was diagnosed; we thought maybe while feeding his cells and growing his cultures.'However Mr Bogler assured his family that the radiation he and his wife receive in their research labs is no worse than one gets from an X-ray scanner at the airport. He admitted: 'I am probably not going to die of this in the next five or 10 years. I have to tell you, it would have been better to go to the doctor sooner but I couldn't imagine this happening twice in our family. 'Having a wife who had [breast cancer], I thought it
would be weird saying I had it too... It’s a very unusual diagnosis so I was really concerned about feeling stupid and feeling foolish.'Mr Bogler's family now hopes he will reach the same cancer-free stage as his wife. The couple, who have two children together, met 20 years ago while doing cancer research at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in San Diego. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.

Comment:
It is about time silent Kroenke tell the fans what he think about the situation at Arsenal and how he is going to move the club forward. Since the policy of selling better players and replacing them with average ones is responsible for getting us into this mess. The policy of turning Arsenal into a selling club has to change, and we want that change now !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Brutal, life-threatening cold descended over the East and the South, sending the mercury plummeting on Tuesday into the single digits and teens from New York and Washington to Atlanta, Nashville and Birmingham - where many people have little experience in dealing with freezing weather.After pounding the Midwest and Great Lakes over the weekend, snow from winter storm Ion started to move into the East on Tuesday.The morning weather map for the eastern half of the U.S. was dotted with lots of small, negative numbers with the Midwest and the East were colder than much of Antarctica.The historic freeze shuttered schools, businesses and made road conditions treacherous. More
than 3,700 flights - around one out
of every 10 domestic departures - were canceled on Monday with delays continuing today. The majority
of cancellations were in Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Boston.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO NASA's satellite sees a Midwest White Out at 2015 UTC/3:15 p.m. EST on January 6, 2014

Another 180 were canceled at Midway International Airport. Delays were reported at both facilities.On Monday, airlines canceled about 1,700 flights at the two airports, while 1,300 were canceled Sunday when nearly foot of snow fell on the city.The National Weather Service says the temperature was 10 degrees below zero at O'Hare on Tuesday morning, although the wind chill made it feel significantly colder. By midday, the temperature climbed to two below.Georgia, where the temperature dropped into the single digits, was colder than many cities in Alaska. While Kodiak and Juneau registered 39 and Anchorage was at 27, Atlanta dipped to 6 degrees early in the morning, or nearly 30 degrees below the
average low this time of year.'This
is severely cold for these parts,' said Brian Lynn, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Peachtree City, Georgia. 'Single digits are a rare event.'Farther south in Pensacola, Florida, a Gulf Coast city better known for its white sand
beaches than frost, streets normally filled with joggers, bikers and people walking dogs were deserted early on Tuesday as temperatures remained in the teens after sunrise. Ice transforms landscape from New York to Alabama

Map of the U.S. on Tuesday shows wind chill temperatures throughout the lower 48 states; wind chill advisories and warnings are in effect for 32 states from Montana to southern Florida
A
sign on a bank near the bus stop flashed 19 degrees at around 8am. Patches of ice sparkled in parking lots where puddles froze overnight.In
the East, a blizzard smothered western New York with up to 18 inches of
snow and wind gusts of up to 50 mph. As much as 3 feet of snow could fall there by the time the storm eases on Wednesday.In New York City, Central Park was 5F on Tuesday, the coldest January 7 since 1896, according to NBC New York. Airports LaGuardia, Newark and JFK were also hit with record lows. Newark airport fell to 4 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.Temperatures
in parts of West Virginia hit lows not seen for 25 years, while the extreme cold in Virginia broke records that had stood since the late 1950s. The National Weather Service said the mercury bottomed out at 3 degrees before sunrise at Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshal International Airport, with a wind chill of minus 16.Forecasters
said some 187 million people in all could feel the effects of the 'polar vortex' by the time it spread across the country.PJM
Interconnection, which operates the power grid supplying energy to more
than 61 million people in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and South, asked users to conserve electricity because of the cold, especially in the morning and late afternoon.Meanwhile,
recovery was the focus in several Midwestern states. The subzero cold followed inches of snow and high winds that made traveling treacherous and was blamed for numerous deaths in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.On
Monday, the temperatures reached such extreme lows across the Midwest that Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago was forced to keep their polar bear Anana indoors in a 'climate-controlled' area. More...

least 15,000 customers in Indiana were without power early on Tuesday. Utility crews worked to restore service as temperatures plunged into the

A man walks past a snow encrusted bicycle with wind chills nearing minus 30F on Tuesday, in downtown ChicagoMore
than 500 Amtrak passengers spent the night on three trains headed for Chicago that were stranded because of blowing and drifting snow in Illinois. Spokesman Marc Magliari said all the passengers, traveling from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Quincy, Ill., would reach Chicago by
train or bus later Tuesday.Warmer
weather - at least, near or above freezing - is in the forecast for much of the eastern half of the U.S. Indianapolis should reach 27 degrees on Wednesday, and other cities in the Midwest and in the East could climb above freezing later in the week. By
Wednesday, subzero high temperatures will be virtually gone from the Lower 48 States. On Thursday, highs in the 20s or 30s in much of the Great Lakes and Northeast will seem downright balmy compared to earlier in the week. The deep freeze is to blame for at least 13 deaths so far - almost all of them from traffic accidents. A
man in Wisconsin died of hypothermia, while an elderly woman with Alzheimer's was found dead in the snow about 100 yards away from
her home in New York state after wandering out. A furious blaze engulfed Happy's Pizza shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan today as icicles hung from the traffic signs nearby in the arctic temperatures

Monday's
subzero temperatures broke records in Chicago, which set a record for the date at minus 16, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the mercury fell to
13 below. Records also fell in Oklahoma and Texas, and wind chills across the region were 40 below and colder. Officials in states like Indiana already struggling
with high winds and more than a foot of snow urged residents to stay home if they could.'The cold is the real killer here,' Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard said on Monday as he asked schools and businesses to remain closed another day. 'In 10 minutes you could be dead without the proper clothes.'In
Minnesota, officials took the rare step of closing all of the state's public schools on Monday - the first time in 17 years. Schools across Chicago, Milwaukee and St Louis were also closed, while officials in Washington D.C. and as far south as Atlanta have announced school closures today. Ice covers rocks and brush on the break wall at Edgewater Park in Cleveland, Ohio as half the U.S. was battered by winter storm Ion
On Monday the winds made it feel like
55 below zero in International Falls, Minnesota, and parts of the Midwest accustomed to temperatures that are cold - albeit seldom this cold. But even the coal fields of Virginia and West Virginia, the wind chill was negative 35. A frozen bird was pictured in a backyard in Lafayette, Indiana as the temperature dropped to -13F
Every major weather-reporting station in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin reported temperatures below zero at 11am on Monday, and South Dakota would have joined them if not for the reading of 1 at Rapid City.The
coldest temperature reported in a 24-hour period through Monday was -36
degrees at Crane Lake, Minnesota. The warmest: 84 at Hollywood and Punta Gorda, Fla.On
Monday morning, Nashville was 40 degrees colder than Albany, New York. Memphis, Tennessee, was 20 degrees colder than Anchorage, Alaska. And Atlanta was colder than Moscow - either Russia or Idaho.In
the Great Lakes region, temperatures hovered in the negative 20s - before wind chill, which dropped temps to the negative 50s, making it very dangerous to go outside.Meteorologists
have warned about 'dangerous, life-threatening winds', that
can inflict frostbite on exposed skin in just 10 minutes.Temperatures are so cold across the Midwest that antifreeze in residents' cars could freeze, the National Journal
pointed out. The popular brand freezes at 34 degrees - and the coldest temperature on Monday afternoon was minus 35 in Crane Lake, Minnesota.'Skin freezes in just five minutes with a wind chill of minus 50,' said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen as wind chills are putting temperatures in northern Minnesota at 60 below zero.For a big chunk of the Midwest, the subzero temperatures were moving in behind another winter wallop: more than a foot of snow and high winds that made traveling treacherous.With wind chills as low as 45 below zero at some airports, workers could only remain exposed on the ramp for a few minutes. That made loading and unloading luggage a challenge.JetBlue Airways stopped all scheduled flights to and from New York and Boston. Operations will begin to ramp up again at 10am on Tuesday and the airline expects to be fully operational
by 3pm on Tuesday. It will allow the company to rest crew and give it time to service aircraft.American Airlines said temperatures were so cold at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport that fuel and de-icing liquids were actually frozen. United Airlines said its fuel is pumping slower than normal in Chicago.
Ice forms on the shore of the East River due to unusually low temperatures caused by a polar vortex in New York on Tuesday With temperatures in downtown Pittsburgh at -5 degrees on Tuesday, a flock of gulls huddles on the ice formed on the Allegheny river.
