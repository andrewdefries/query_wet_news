New Year's horror as 61 people including 26 children crushed to death and dozens hurt in stampede at Ivory Coast fireworks display

Comment:
What I noticed upon reading the article is that the dead include 26 children, 28 women, and 6 men. Just my own opinion, but it sounds like the women were killed while trying to protect the children as the men saved themselves. I don't mean this as a negative comment about all men - just that perhaps women and children may not be held in high regard there. I didn't research it so I can't say for sure. Just my humble opinion. Your email address:

Scotland and Edinburgh centre Nick De Luca has been handed a 13-week ban for a dangerous tackle which should see him ruled out until the end of the season.An independent RaboDirect PRO12 disciplinary committee ruled De Luca should serve the suspension following his dismissal against the Ospreys last Friday, the league announced in a statement.De Luca, who has 38 caps for Scotland, has the right to appeal. Banned: De Luca has been hit with a hefty punishment
De Luca was playing for the second time following his return from surgery on a fractured eye socket suffered in training in January, an injury which had meant he was expected to miss the RBS 6 Nations.De Luca was sanctioned following a tip-tackle on Ospreys scrum-half Tom Grabham during Edinburgh’s loss at the Liberty Stadium.A statement from the league read: 'Nick De Luca, the Edinburgh centre, appeared today before an independent RaboDirect Pro12 disciplinary committee comprising Michael Coghlan, Dr Barry O’Driscoll and David Hurley (all from Ireland), following the red card issued by the referee for a tip tackle contrary to Law 10.4(j) during the Ospreys and Edinburgh match on Friday 22 February. International: De Luca has 38 caps for Scotland
'Having considered all of the evidence presented, including the video of the incident, the disciplinary committee considered the incident to be at the top end level for this type of offence, which has a range of suspensions from 12 to 52 weeks and having taken into account aggravating and mitigating factors, decided that a suspension of 13 weeks was appropriate.'The suspension concludes at midnight on Sunday 26 May 2013. The player has a right of appeal.' More...

First look: Nicole Scherzinger in low cut leather and thigh high boots as she takes on villainous role in Men in Black III By

Scroll down for video...She is not best known for her acting career, but Nicole Scherzinger clearly got stuck in to her role as a villain in forthcoming film Men In Black III. New stills for the forthcoming sequel show the 33-year-old former X factor judge in thigh high leather boots and a revealing low cut leather dress.A severe black hairstyle and red lipstick completes the look along with some oversize hooped earrings as she moodily carries a sugary pink cake, flanked by two men in uniform with guns. Hell for leather: New film stills from Men In Black III shows Nicole Scherzinger dressed in a leather dress and thigh high boots carrying a birthday cake
Not much is known about Nicole's character, who is called Lilly. However she did tell E! News: 'She’s like a small villain role. I’m so excited because I get to die. I make an appearance. I say a couple of lines and then I die.'Nicole joins Men in Black stalwarts Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who reprise their roles of agent J and K after a decade long absence. He's back: Will Smith reprises his role of alien control agent J in the third film in the hit action franchise
Initially it seems nothing has changed too much, with the intrepid pair still spending their days monitoring alien activity in New York City.A new trailer
released yesterday shows Smith as Agent J, up to his usual tricks of putting on sunglasses while using a 'neutraliser' to erase the memories of those who have come
across extra terrestrials.He is forced to contain the activities of a giant extra terrestrial killer goldfish, let loose in the city, before discovering aliens in a Chinese restaurant. Futuristic: One shot features Smith being tied up by a gaggle of men in white suits, following a futuristic theme
The
plot then twists around to secretive agent K telling the irritated Smith: 'I promised you the secrets to the universe nothing more.'J responds: 'So there's secrets that even we don't know about.'However, things then turn mysterious when Smith meets Agent O, played by Emma Thompson, who mysteriously informs him that 'Agent K has been dead for 40 years.' Back to the future: Agent J (Will Smith) goes back in time to discover what happened to his partner K (Josh Brolin)
Dapper: Alice Eve in 1960s blonde hair style and black dress stars opposite Brolin Neutralise: Brolin wears a pair of sunglasses as he hold a classic MIB gizmo
She then adds: Soemhow history has been re-written. There has to be reason this is happening and K seems to be at the centre of it.'Cue
Smith having to travel back in time to put things right, which involves
him him using a 'time jump' control and leaping off the Chrysler Building.He arrives in the past where he encounters none other than actor Josh Brolin as the young and serious Agent K. Suited and booted: Brolin looks dapper in a dark suit and black tie in a new photograph Men in suits: Will Smith returns as Agent J, while Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as Agent K in a new teaser trailer for Men in Black 3, to be released in cinemas next year
Alice Eve also stars in the 'back in time' portion as the young Thompson and there's a new photograph of her
with Brolin, straightening his uniform, along with Smith and Brolin in a
1960s diner. The arch villain, played by Jermaine Clement, is seen standing with his face away from the camera in a padded cell. Large iron shackles and iron vest, along with what appears to be a metal weapon arm give him an even more sinister look. Villainous: Jermaine Clement plays the main baddie in the film, and in new pictures is shown sporting a bearded biker look with iron shackles
Taking aim: Jermaine plays an alien villain, known as Boris, taking on a human form with a fringed jacket and large gun A voice then states: 'We're running out of clues and there's an invasion coming,' before showing smith and Brolin on futuristic motorcycles along with a shot of giant jellyfish style aliens.Bill Hader, from Saturday Night Live, also has a cameo role as artist Andy Warhol in the film. Despite the action packed nature of the trailer, production on the blockbuster has not been without its problems, according to sources. Bonding moments: Agent J reprises his relationship with Agent K, this time back in 1969
Surprise news: Will Smith's Agent J discovers from Emma Thompson's character that his partner K has 'been dead for 40 years'
First glimpse: Emma Thompson plays hard nosed Agent O in the third instalment of the franchise to be released next year
Back to black: The new film is released in the U.S. this May
The budget of the movie is reported by TheWrap.com to have blown up to more than $215 million dollars, more than twice the budget of Men In Black II. There were also production delays, with the film supposed to begin shooting last October, but ending up being postponed until March. Then there was the unwanted publicity over the size of Smith's trailer, which stretched beyond the size of a city bus at 53 ft and which the New York Post deemed 'starship-sized.'The newspaper added that: 'The monstrosity was choking business revenues and filling the streets with exhaust fumes...'Now the I Am Legend actor will have to trek to the trailer to get his make-up done, confer with his personal writers and lounge in his marble-floored, 100-inch-screen film room – or
walk less than a mile to his own $25,000-a-month Bond Street apartment.'The delay was also said to be due to
the lack of a movie-ready script, with it changing hands between different writers several times, according to the Los Angeles Times. Building arrival: Agent J finds himself on top of the Chrysler Building in New York City as he plans to travel back in time to save Agent K
Use the time jump: Agent J is given a special time travel gadget to take him back in time to save Agent K Leap of faith: Smith's character is seen atop New York's Chrysler building where he is told to jump in order to go to the past
Back in February, a month before the movie commenced filming, Tommy Lee Jones even admitted he wasn't sure what the story was. 'There are vast pieces of the script yet unwritten,' he revealed to website Vulture. Men in Black III will be released in the U.S. on May 25. Where am I? Smith is bleary eyed as he finds himself back in the past
How do you know my name? Josh Brolin stars as the young Agent K who encounters J when he travels back in time Men In Black 3 3D Official Trailer 2 - Will Smith, Tommy Lee...
