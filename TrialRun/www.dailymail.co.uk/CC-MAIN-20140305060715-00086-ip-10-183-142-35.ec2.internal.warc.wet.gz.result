How Mum hired a psychic to sabotage my career: Shirley MacLaine's daughter on how her jealous mother tried to scupper her future

It’s the excruciatingly frank Hollywood memoir that will make you wince. In Saturday’s Mail, Shirley MacLaine’s daughter revealed how her mother bullied her into losing her virginity at 17 — and insisted she tell two waiting sex therapists how it went. Today, in this final exclusive excerpt, SACHI PARKER reveals that jealousy drove her mother to ever more bizarre and extreme behaviour . . .For someone who became one of Hollywood’s biggest stars during the hallucinogenic Sixties, my mother was surprisingly naive about drugs. I remember going to a dinner party with her in the early Sixties, at which the host brought out a bowl of cocaine.As guest of honour, my mother was offered the first dip so she poured two heaped spoonfuls — and I don’t know how many thousands of dollars worth — into her coffee.The collective gasp that followed sucked almost all of the oxygen out of the room. 'Puzzling schizophrenic': Sachi Parker (pictured with mother Shirley MacLaine in 1983) said: 'She was always encouraging, wishing me the very best, but whenever I actually did something, she didn't seem to like it'
‘How the hell was I supposed to know it was coke?’ she said afterwards. ‘What am I, a drugs mule?’I am no drug enthusiast either. I’ve smoked pot three times in my life, and thrown up three times. Yet my mother seemed convinced that if she didn’t keep an eye on me, I’d be puffing on the first joint I could find — and quickly graduating to much worse.At 26 I was living with her in Los Angeles, and since I’d spent some time in France, where I’d become a pretty good cook, she often asked me to show off my skills for her friends, usually at the last minute.‘Sach, I’m having a dinner party tonight,’ she said one afternoon. ‘Just a few people. Maybe 20. Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Sydney Pollack.’ She handed me a ten-dollar bill. ‘Here, go out and get something.’ More...

‘I can’t get food for 20 people with this,’ I said. ‘So you need more money?’ she demanded. ‘Are you on drugs? Is that what you need the money for?’I was dumbfounded. ‘What are you talking about?’‘Listen, Sachi, I’ve seen this happen to other kids in Hollywood,’ she replied. ‘Their parents indulge them, give them what they want, and the next thing you know they’re smoking pot, shooting heroin, killing people. Ever heard of Charlie Manson? Do you want to be a cult murderer? Is that what you want?’Her concern for my welfare was remarkable for someone who cut me off without a penny when I left school at the age of 17 and told me that I would have to make my own way in the world.I ended up taking a waitressing job in Hawaii, living in a roach-infested apartment and surviving on free food samples handed out in the local shopping mall until I landed a job as a stewardess for Qantas Airways.Airlines still showed films on big screens then and occasionally one of my mother’s movies would play in-flight. It was odd to look up at her face, glamorous and larger than life, while I was pouring orange juice and carrying sick bags. Go your own way: Sachi was cut off without a penny when she left school at the age of 17. Shirley told her that she would have to make her own way in the world
My mother and I met only once during this time, but she proved just the heroine I needed when, after I’d left
Qantas at the end of the Seventies, my sputtering romantic life saw me briefly involved with a plastic surgeon in his 40s. He seemed gentlemanly until I agreed to spend a weekend with him at a motel in San
Diego where he turned into a voracious sex machine, throwing me around like a rag doll and ‘making love’ to me so violently I ended up with a pain in my groin.I became genuinely frightened of him and rang my mother. Within two hours, she’d pulled up at the motel and driven me back to her beach house in Malibu.That’s
how I ended up becoming her impromptu cook — but not for long, because soon I’d moved in with David Weininger, a sweet young guy I’d met at acting classes.My mother was then making Terms Of Endearment, playing the suffocatingly over-attentive mother to Debra Winger’s spirited, cancer-stricken daughter. In an article in early 1984, just before she won her first Oscar for the part, she talked about parenthood.‘I don’t think there’s any more important profession in the world than being a mom,’ she said. 'How are you going to have any kind of career with a baby? Are you insane?'
But later that year, when I told her I had fallen pregnant by David, she thought the idea of me having a baby was ridiculous.‘You can’t have a baby. How old are you?’ she said.‘I’m 27.’‘Oh.
Well, I thought you wanted to be an actress. How are you going to have any kind of career with a baby? Are you insane?’ She vented all her objections, then shrugged resignedly.‘Well, it’s your choice,’ she said.Actually,
it wasn’t much of a choice unless she helped us financially. David and I
were penniless actors, living in a tiny apartment, and his parents couldn’t come up with much money.I
couldn’t see any way out. I didn’t want to have an abortion, but neither could I bear giving away my baby. Reluctantly, I made an appointment for the procedure.Right
up until the day I was due to go in, I kept asking my mother for help, but she refused even to engage in conversation about it. Eventually the abortion went ahead.Much though I wanted to blame her, I know it was my decision to terminate and it haunts me even now. I sometimes lie awake thinking about that child who never was. As for the acting career my mother had talked about, she seemed puzzlingly schizophrenic about it. She was always encouraging, wishing me the very best, but whenever I actually did something, she didn’t seem to like it.At one point during the mid-Eighties, when I had a minor role in a TV soap opera called Capitol, I accompanied her to a flashy red-carpet event in Hollywood.I knew the routine. She would swan ahead, escorted by her latest boyfriend or agent, and I would trail behind, basking in the residual glamour, but keeping a low profile. Sachi was a penniless actor and she couldn't see any way out other than to have an abortion but right up until the day she was due to go in, she kept asking her mother for help, but she refused to engage in conversation about it
As usual, my mother stopped to hold court with her fans, being very gracious and bubbly. I’d seen her switch on the charm like this so many times, especially when they lined up backstage at theatres to get her autograph.She’d laugh and chat and happily pose for photos with that thousand-watt smile, but the moment always came when she’d had enough.Her face went blank and she’d give them the cold stare that told them they had been dismissed — and woe betide anyone who didn’t pick up on the signals, because she’d happily spell it out for them.‘Excuse me, but I have a life. Do you?’ she’d say. ‘Have a nice day.’On the red carpet that day, the moment had arrived. Her eyes glazed over and she’d had enough.‘All right, we’re done,’ she said and headed towards the auditorium. I started to follow meekly behind, as my role demanded, but suddenly I heard someone yell from the crowd.‘It’s Sachi Parker. Sachi Parker from Capitol!’ One of Hollywood's biggest stars: Shirley with husband Steve Parker and Sachi in 1961
I was instantly mobbed by adoring fans and I loved it. For the first time in my life I was signing autographs and posing for pictures.Then I looked over at my mother for some recognition, a glimpse of maternal pride, but her eyes were shooting out beams of concentrated fury. She was livid at being made to stand around and wait while people made a fuss over insignificant me. ‘Let’s go,’ she rasped to her agent, and with that she stormed into the theatre without me. That was my last red carpet with her for a long time.She was no more supportive when I broke up with David and later became engaged to Frank Murray, a Wall Street broker and film financier. She phoned him and said I was unreliable and a self-absorbed liar.‘It breaks my heart to tell you this,’ she said. ‘But it’s probably not a good idea to marry her.’Thankfully, he ignored her. We were married in 1993 and I settled down as a suburban mother of two in Connecticut (my son, Frank, is 16, and daughter Arin is 14).That removed the edge of competitiveness that had always charged the air between my mother and me. She didn’t see me as an actress any more and our roller-coaster relationship mellowed. But then, as my children grew a little older, I decided I want to act again. I discovered what she thought of that ambition when she turned up to dinner on Christmas Day 2005 with an unexpected guest in tow — a ‘world-famous’ psychic.She announced her Christmas present to me would be a personal reading from this psychic — he hosted a cable TV show in which he claimed to put people in touch with their dead relatives. And he told me he had a message from my father, Steve Parker, who had died in 2001.‘He wants to thank you for hanging his picture in the bedroom.’ I was startled. How could he have known that? I found myself convinced we really were talking to the Other Side, and when he said he was channelling my dead grandmother, I couldn’t resist asking her if I would ever make it as an actress. He rocked back and forth, shaking as he received the message.‘Mmmmmm . . . ahmmmmmmm. . . mustn’t ride on mother’s coat-tails, must we?’He began trembling. ‘Yes, I see . . . sharp objects, knives, copper pots. Cooking. A TV cooking show!’'It breaks my heart to tell you this but it's probably not a good idea to marry her'
A cooking show? That was the career path my grandmother was recommending? My mother had tried for years to convince me this was the best use for my talents. She had clearly set up
this whole business. I was still furious when she took me aside after dinner.‘Look, I can tell you’re upset,’ she said. ‘You should be. Mediocrity is a hard thing to accept.’When
she left I said a very icy goodbye. She looked stunned. It was probably
the first time in my life I’d ever been cold to her. Perhaps
that’s why, a few months later, she called to tell me she was appearing
in a movie directed by Richard Attenborough. It would be filmed in Canada and had a part in it for me, playing her daughter.I was thrilled. The audition went really well and I got the part, but then came weeks of silence. It was left to my mother’s agent to tell me the role had gone to someone else, apparently because the number of American actors in the cast had exceeded the Canadian immigration quota.I rang my mother straight away. ‘Why didn’t you tell me I didn’t get the part?’ I demanded.‘Well, you know how it is,’ she said. ‘No one wants to give bad news in Hollywood.’‘You’re not Hollywood. You’re my mother!’ I said, but there was no point being angry because it wasn’t her fault. 'I'll never really understand my mother': Sachi said Shirley (pictured with Downton Abbey stars Michelle Dockery and Elizabeth McGovern) doesn't speak to her very much these days
Or so I thought until the following year a Hollywood publicist told me that when my mother got me the audition, she never dreamed I’d get the part. When I did, she insisted it be given to someone else.‘She sabotaged you,’ he said. ‘She is a competitor. She didn’t want you to get ahead of her. Plain and simple.’My mother later admitted the immigration story had been a front, but said it was concocted to protect me from the truth — that Lord Attenborough didn’t think I was very good.This was ridiculous. He was the one who had cast me and left me an answer-phone message telling me I was ‘marvellous’. And anyway, since when had my mother cared about protecting my feelings?Still, she had managed to plant the one poisonous seed that was sure to take root in my mind. Maybe I wasn’t that good in that screen test after all.I will probably never know, just as I will never really understand my mother. She doesn’t really talk to me these days, but, of course, her fans have never been aware of that.They still come up to me and say: ‘Shirley MacLaine is your mother? I love her! You are so lucky!’And you know what? They’re right. I am lucky. I’m here. And I survived.Adapted from Lucky Me by Sachi Parker (Gotham Books). © Sachi Parker 2013.

Love Shirley in her films, but could imagine she wouldn't make a good Mother. It's odd that she had children given her attitude, but her Daughter should move on and forget about the past, it's gone, tomorrow is what counts. 13

If she lived in a cockroaches infested apartment and worked, ... that says she might have not been paid enough, work and not been able still to afford a baby, it's pretty common...I know, it's not easy without help if a person doesn't have an education and 200,000 debt for it to show. With such a wealthy mother she shouldn't have to living in those conditions. I'm glad she married after all because that's the only way for women STILL in this part of the world to make it! As crazy as it sounds. There is no socialism in the US to help with ANY of that stuff. 41

I believe Sacha's story. I just wish she had pushed ahead on her own in her career and did small independent film roles and separated herself from asking her mom for a role. Eventually someone young new director would have hired her for her own talent. Sacha I think the cooking show was probably a good idea and a honest reading, it may have opened up a plethora of opportunities for you, some roads are reached by taking another direction.

Is this the best makeover ever? Retired teacher, 62, blows �20,000 on surgery to get the face she's always wanted and says 'it was worth every penny'

In answer to the questions on whether she has spent all her pension, I shall explain. When teachers retire they get a lump sum + an annual pension or can choose to have the lump sum added to the annual pension. I know this will stir the ' over paid under worked, public v private' argument, but we are not talking millions here! Your email address:
