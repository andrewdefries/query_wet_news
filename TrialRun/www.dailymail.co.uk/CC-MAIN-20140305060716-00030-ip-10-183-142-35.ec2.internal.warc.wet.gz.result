Different side of the bench: Judge Judy sued for $500,000 'after buying chinaware for knocked-down price from divorcing pair'

Judge Judy would never have purchased items of questionable provenance. I agree that this lady suing Judge Judy should not be allowed to burden the already overworked judicial system with a silly claim. This matter is between the former spouses and has nothing to do with Judge Judy. I love watching Judge Judy's programs.

A Twitter storm has erupted following David Beckham's exclusion from the London 2012 Great Britain football squad.Footballers and celebrities have rushed to defend the former England captain on what has become the darkest day of his illustrious career.Star striker and now BBC presenter Gary Lineker said it was 'terrible' Becks had been excluded 'having given so much' for British football and London 2012, adding he thought Team GB manager Stuart Pearce had been stringing him along. Others including Gavin and Stacey star James Corden, a close friend of Becks, and Boyzone singer Ronan Keating, branded the snub 'disrespectful' to 'one of the greatest ambassadors for the game'.Many Twitter users have also been posting messages of support using the hashtag #pickbecks. Scroll down for video Snubbed: David Beckham, pictured bringing the Olympic torch to Britain from Greece this year, has revealed he is 'very disappointed' to have been left out of the Team GB 2012 football squad
Disappointment: Last month Becks lit the flame seven years after he fought so hard with others to bring the Olympics to London
England's record joint top scorer Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Terrible shame for Beckham having given so much to the
Olympic bid and football.'Never thought for a second that David Beckham would be excluded from GB’s team. What I don’t understand is stringing him along by including him in a short list?' More...

Despite his age, 37-year-old Beckham had hoped his efforts to bring the Games to his native east London would get
him into manager Stuart Pearce's side. But is dream has been cruelly taken away.And there has been huge uproar since it was announced today. Back to the day job: Beckham appeared to take the snub in his stride when he was pictured today training with his club side LA Galaxy in California
His pal James Corden, who got to know him through Comic Relief, said: 'To ask David Beckham to give everything to winning the Olympics for London and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful.'Ronan Keating tweeted: 'Don't understand why David Beckham was not picked for Olympic team. One of the greatest ambassadors for the game. And still totally capable.'Former Deputy prime Minister John Prescott also said: 'David Beckham deserves to be in Team GB. Played a crucial part in the bid & least he'd be good at penalties!'Beckham has been widely credited with helping win the Games for London in 2005 and has been involved ever since.Only last month icon he flew in from Los Angeles to light the Olympic torch when it landed in Cornwall from Greece, marking the flame's arrival on UK soil. THE CELEBRATED CAREER OF DAVID BECKHAM 1975: Born Leytonstone, east London.1991: Joins Manchester United as trainee.1996: Helps United to Premier League and FA Cup double.1999: Helps United win the Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup2000: Collects fourth championship winner`s medal as United win title by a record 18 points.2003: Awarded an OBE, above right, in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to football. Joins Real Madrid for £25million.2005: Captains England for 50th time and helps win Olympics for London in Singapore.2008: Wins 100th cap in the friendly against France.2010: Part of England's backroom staff for World Cup.2011: Wins the MLS Cup with LA Galaxy. 2012: Announces he has not been included in Team GB's squad for the Olympic Games.
He was also a key part of the delegation that travelled to Singapore in 2005 and won the Games. The rival Paris bid had been expected to win but in an amazing turnaround London beat them.He also represented Britain at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics by kicking a golden football.Beckham, who has more than 100 England caps and is seen as one of the country's greatest ever players, had seemed to be certain to be part of the summer event but Micah Richards, Craig Bellamy and Ryan Giggs have been picked as the over-23 players. Beckham said today: 'Everyone knows how much playing for my country has always meant to me. So I would have been honoured to have been part of this unique Team GB squad.'He
added: 'Naturally I am very disappointed, but there will be no bigger supporter of the team than me. And like everyone, I will be hoping they can win the gold.'As a Londoner, I will have been really proud to have played a small part in bringing the Olympics to my home town as part of Seb's [Coe] team, and I
can't wait for the games to begin and enjoy every moment along with the
rest of Great Britain.'The celebrated midfielder is also a proud Londoner, so the snub is a double blow.Whenever he's in the capital, Beckham always makes the effort to visit a restaurant for his favourite meal, pie and mash, having been a fan of the traditional English meal since childhood.In fact, Beckham paid for a delivery of pie and mash for all the Tottenham Hotspurs players when he finished training at White Hart Lane last year.He had trained with Spurs during the US close season in order to try to play for England again after he was dropped by Fabio Capello.
Yet Pearce called dedicated Beckham onWednesday night
to inform him of the decision to leave him out, explaining that he had enough midfield players and he wanted to add experience to his defence.The
37-year-old superstar, who currently plies his trade for MLS side LA Galaxy, played a massive role in Britain securing the Games seven years ago, and has stayed involved in a huge capacity since. Star: Despite being 37, Becks is still playing regularly for LA Galaxy, pictured here last week after a 3-0 win over Toronto
Watching: Stuart Pearce went to see Beckham in action before he made his decision and told him he was not making London 2012
Beckham was included in Pearce's 35-man shortlist for the Games but will now not made the final cut.TWITTER REACTION TO THE AXEING OF BECKS FROM LONDON 2012 TEAM
Gary Lineker ‏@GaryLineker
Terrible shame for Beckham having given so much to to the Olympic bid and football.
Never thought for a second that David Beckham would be excluded from GB's team.
Their are arguments for and against DB selection. What i don't understand though, is why string him along by including him in a short list? James Corden ‏@JKCorden
To ask David Beckham to give everything to winning the Olympics for London and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful.
Ronan Keating ‏@ronanofficial
Don't understand why David Beckham was not picked for Olympic team. One of the greatest ambassadors for the
game. And still totally capable
Lee Westwood ‏@WestwoodLee
I'm amazed David Beckham didn't get picked for the Olympic football team!
John Prescott ‏@johnprescott
David Beckham deserves to be in Team GB. Played a crucial part in the bid & least he'd be good at penalties!
Piers Morgan ‏@piersmorgan
Relax everyone - #Beckham can still go the Olympics. He just has to buy a ticket like the rest of us.
As a football's biggest star, Beckham would have been a big pull for fans to come and watch Team GB at the games and
get excited about the Olympic football - which is not normally a major draw for spectators. He is still expected to come to the Games in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony.Former footballers today expressed their anger at the decision.Former Welsh midfielder Robbie Savage said: 'Why was beckham on the shortlist in the first place, then not to pick him ! Disgrace ! Stuart Pearce does make some stupid decisions , ie Parker captain of England and no beckham in gb Team , clueless!'Bookmaker Ladbrokes has now slashed the odds on Beckham being given the honor of lighting the Olympic flame at the July 27 opening ceremony, making him 5-1. Five-time rowing gold medalist Steve Redgrave is the 1-2 favorite. The British Olympic Association will also be surprised by the decision to leave Beckham out. But BOA chief Andy Hunt had previously said Pearce will have free reign to do as he pleases with the squad.
He
said: 'Stuart Pearce will make a decision on the best squad available given where he is in respect of now having assessed the players that are
not involved in the Euros and the current state of injuries. 'He
will then make the best call he can - on merit. I am not putting any pressure of him whatsoever to pick anyone. 'We discussed the whole topic of selecting over-23 players back more than a year ago but I haven't subsequently.

'We have been very clear from the outset, it's absolutely Stuart's choice and he is totally free to make the selection of the team he believes will put in the best performance. It's as simple as that.'As a global superstar Beckham would have been a big pull for fans to come and watch Team GB at the games and get excited about the Olympic football - which is not normally a major pull. Beckham is still expected to come to the Games in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony.VIDEO: Beckham snubbed by Team GB despite all his work to secure the games...

Serena Williams claimed her second Wimbledon crown in a day, teaming up with sister Venus to clinch the ladies’ doubles title in another late-night thriller under the roof on Centre Court.After witnessing Jonny Marray become the first British doubles winner in 76 years, the crowd were treated to a display of dominance which proved the Williams family are once again a force to be reckoned with, even more brilliant together than Serena was on her own earlier in the day. Serena equalled Venus’s tally of five Wimbledon singles titles with a three sets win over Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska, and made it 14 Grand Slam singles title in the bag. Top form: Serena and Venus celebrate securing a fifth ladies' doubles Wimbledon title
Respect: Serena and Venus are congratulated by Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka following the women's doubles final match
Serena Williams literally jumps for joy as she beat Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska in the Wimbledon women's final, taking the title for the fifth time to match her sister Venus's record at the Championships
The U.S champion dominated the first set, although the Polish player won the second as she began to gain confidence and fight back. However, in the third set the younger of the Williams sisters took the title
The 30-year-old winner crumpled to the ground in relief as she sent the final ball past Radwanksa, then clambered into the stands to embrace her father and sister
Before the match Williams said she was determined to beat Radwanska, who she complimented and said had been consistent in her playing throughout the year
U.S player Serena Williams couldn't contain her excitement and immediately ran to embrace her father and her sister following the win
Hours later, she showed no sign of weariness in swatting away the challenge of Czech pair Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka. The 7-5, 6-4 win clinched a historic fifth Wimbledon doubles title and 13th total Grand Slam title for the sisters.VENUS' DELIGT WITH SISTERS' VICTORY After watching Serena, 30, win her three-set battle against Agnieszka Radwanska in the singles, Venus was delighted to play an active role on court and at one point produced a stunning volley despite falling on to her bottom. 'I felt I played a match with her earlier so I felt like it was my second match too,' a beaming Venus said after accepting the doubles trophy in the Royal Box. 'It was a great day for all of us.''If anyone knows what that (winning the singles and doubles here on the same day) feels like, it's me. It's an amazing feeling.'
Earlier in the day, Serena defeated Radwanska in the Wimbledon women's final, taking the title for the fifth time to match her sister Venus's record at the Championships.The U.S. champion dominated the first set, although the Polish player won the second as she began to gain confidence and fight back. In the third, however, the younger of the Williams sisters finished the job in clinical fashion.The 30-year-old winner crumpled to the ground in relief as she sent the final ball past Radwanksa, then clambered into the stands to embrace her father and sister.Radwanska was seeded three places higher than Williams at No 3 and had surprised many by emerging through the top half of the draw to reach her first Grand Slam final.Before today's match Serena Williams insisted that she would not be taking Radwanska lightly in the Wimbledon women's final.

Williams is the player every other fears at Wimbledon and there have looked to be few flaws in her game during impressive quarter-final and semi-final victories over Petra Kvitova, the winner last year, and Victoria Azarenka, who takes the world number

Adding to the likelihood of a Williams victory was the fact Radwanska has been ill.Radwanska had a respiratory illness affecting her nose and throat, which forced her to cancel a planned press conference and stay away from the practice courts.Pointing
her finger at the miserable British summer weather, Radwanska said: 'I have been playing a lot of matches here in the rain and cold wind, and I
haven't been well for a few days.'But,
despite being an overwhelming favourite for the title, sixth seed Williams said before the match: 'I have to go out there and win. Appreciative audience: Comedian Michael McIntyre, back left, and Miranda Hart, watch the tense match unfold

She deserves to be.'I have to go out there and fight for this. This is by no means going to be easy. Never, ever do I underestimate any opponent. She's out there to try to do her best.'I really like Aga. She's a great girl.'Radwanska is the first Polish player for
75 years to have reached a Wimbledon singles final. Jadwiga Jedrzejowska was the last, in 1937, when she lost to Britain's Dorothy Round. Delay: Serena Williams and Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland walk off the court as rain delays play

Training: Andy Murray warms up today with the help of fitness coach Jez Green on the practice court. Yesterday he was victorious against France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
Determined: Andy Murray trains before his men's final tennis match on Sunday against Roger Federer of Switzerland
OXFAM SET TO COLLECT THOUSANDS IF FEDERER TAKES TITLE AGAINST MURRAY ON SUNDAYWhile the nation roots for its first British Wimbledon champion in 76 years, one charity could be hoping that Federer takes the title.Oxfam is set to collect £101,840 if Federer wins tomorrow, in a payout from a wager staked nine years ago.Nick Newlife bet £1,520 in 2003 that the Swiss tennis legend - who then had just one Wimbledon title - would win seven or more times. Bookmakers William Hill offered Mr Newlife, from Oxford, odds of 66/1.Mr Newlife died in 2009, aged 59, bequeathing his entire estate - including the bet - to Oxfam The charity estimates around 12% of its income is from legacies.William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'This will be one of the very rare occasions that we will payout with a smile on our face.'William Hill is currently giving odds of 13/8 for Murray to lift the trophy, with Federer at 8/15.The bookmaker has previously said tomorrow will be the biggest tennis match in its 78-year history and a win by Murray will prompt a £5 million industry payout.Mr Adams added: 'If he lifts the trophy we will probably have the worst day of tennis betting in our long history, with a probable industry payout of £5 million.'
Krakow-based Radwanska said: 'The most important thing is that I'm feeling good on the court and playing some good tennis, despite not being able to talk much away from the court.'I will do whatever it takes to make sure I'm ready to play the best I can.'Williams fired a women's Wimbledon record of 24 aces past Azarenka in their semi-final.The 30-year-old puts her proficiency down to experience.'The older I get, the better I serve, and the more I like to hit aces,' Williams said.'But in my whole career I've hit a lot of aces throughout tournaments.'I don't know how it got better. I really don't know. It's not like I go home and I work on baskets and baskets of serves. Maybe it's a natural shot for me.'Meanwhile Murray's surprise victory in the Wimbledon semifinals, after losing at the same stage three years running, has left British royalty, politicians and celebrities scrambling for a spot to watch Sunday's showdown between the Scot and Roger Federer. By powering past France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to become the first British man to reach the final in 74 years, Murray took Britain's collective mind off the dreary weather and dismal economy and gave the country a new hero - at least for now. The joy was tempered by surprise that Murray had really pulled it off - and a sense that it would be tempting fate to expect him to beat Federer and become the first British Wimbledon men's champion since Fred Perry in 1936. Bunny Austin made the final two years later, but lost. Virginia Wade won the women's title in 1977.

A 52-year-old man has been arrested after a commuter was filmed racially abusing a woman on the London Underground.The video, which has been posted on YouTube, shows the drunk man launching a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent woman.Commuters were left horrified as the man, from Watford, Hertfordshire, reeled off a series of insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch'.Scroll down for video Shocking: The 52-year-old man launches a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent Japanese passenger
Abuse: He reels off insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch'
He has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, police have confirmed. In an expletive-littered rant, lasting almost six minutes, the man claims his uncle died in the River Kwai during the Second World War. More...

He then aggressively points his finger at the young woman and accuses her of torturing his relative.'You tortured him. Get yourself off the train, get yourself off the train,' he can be heard telling the passenger, who is sat on the other side of the tube on the Bakerloo line. 'You're nasty people. I mean this s***. You're nasty people. 'F*** off, get out of my country.' 'Racist' abuses Japanese girl on London Underground
Illogical: He aggressively points his finger at the female passenger and accuses her of torturing his uncle The unidentified man, who appears to be under the influence of alcohol, then repeatedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye' - adding: 'Don't you torture my relatives'. He ignores the shocked woman's cries of 'I'm not nasty. You're nasty', before turning his attention to the English man filming the footage and asking where he comes from. The passenger replies: 'Does it matter, really? Are you going to start sorting everyone on the train, man, one by one? Why are you blasting at her? What have you got against the Japanese?'Leaning forward, the man shouts: 'They killed my f****** two f****** cousins in the Second World War.' 'But she didn't kill your cousins, did she?' asks the passenger. 'Why is she going to apologise? What has she done to you?'The
man, pointing his finger at the Japanese woman, replies 'She doesn't even f****** realise that she's a bad man. The Japanese are bad - same as the Germans.' Menacing: The unidentified man then repetedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye'
Despite the cameraman's best efforts to calm him down, the man then becomes increasingly violent - threatening to knock him out in 'one punch'.'I’m ex-Parachute Regiment! What do you know? You're a f****** boy man. Shut the f*** up,' he says.'I’ve done two tours in Northern Ireland and the Falklands. Don’t even f****** look at me.'He then produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig, before dangling the bottle menacingly in the passenger's face. 'Do you want some of that?' he asks threateningly. 'No, because you don't drink.' A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'A 52-year-old man from Watford was arrested on Saturday, October 19, on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence.'An
investigation was launched after we were made aware of a YouTube clip of a man using racist language on board a Bakerloo line train.' Intoxicated: He produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig, before dangling it in the cameraman's face
She added that the man has been bailed, pending enquiries. He is expected to be brought before magistrates on October 30. The abuse is not the first of its kind to be filmed on the Underground. Last year, a woman was jailed for 21 weeks for hurling racist abuse at fellow passengers while drunk.Jacqueline Woodhouse, then 42, snarled at stunned commuters seated beside her: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.'Her champagne-fuelled rant was recorded by a passenger, who posted the seven-minute clip on YouTube where it caused a sensation. Speaking at Westminster Magistrates' Court at the time, District Judge Michael Snow said: 'Anyone viewing that would feel a deep sense of shame that our fellow citizens could be subject to such behaviour.'
