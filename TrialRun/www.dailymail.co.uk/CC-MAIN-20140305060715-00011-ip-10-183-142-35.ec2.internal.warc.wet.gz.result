Strange how Sturridge picks up mystery thigh injury but plays the full 90mins today.
- Sister Brendan, London, United Kingdom, 03/02/2013 20:42
Don't make such silly comments, if you
Actually watched the match you would see as soon as he complained of the strain he didn't sprint after the ball fully or make full effort to run with the ball in the entire second half like he did before he pulled up in the first half. Secondly players can be given pain relieving injections for certain injuries but would only be wise to do this seldom, but to do it for a pointless glamour friendly mid season is daft as it will in all likely cause it to aggravate and worsen.

Why DO babies calm down when they're picked up and carried? Because it lowers their heartbeat, say scientists

Babies love being carried and cuddled. I used to pick mine up a lot and the only time they were in a pram was if we were walking somewhere( I had two close together so could not carry two!)
we used to cuddle them all the time and mostly sat on the floor with them as they started to crawl and play. My mother in law used to say I was spoiling them but like I said thats why I had them. They turned out beautifully may I add!

No 'slam dunk' proof Assad was behind Syria chemical attack, say US officials: Obama prepares to go it alone with airstrike

Intelligence reports on the Syrian chemical attack far from prove that President Bashar al-Assad was responsible, US officials said last night.One admitted the evidence was ‘not a slam dunk’ - a pointed reference to language used by the CIA to describe intelligence on weapons of mass destruction ahead of the Iraq war.Despite those doubts, United States is expected to go it alone to launch a limited airstrike on Syria. Military intervention: A US Air Force plane lands at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey yesterday. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said the inspection team in Syria is expected to complete its work by today
President Barack Obama is prepared to go ahead despite last night’s rejection of military action by Britain, according to senior US administration officials.Last night the White House briefed national security staff and senior lawmakers to lay the groundwork for missile strikes, which could come as soon as tomorrow.On Wednesday, President Obama declared that the Syrian regime was responsible for the chemical attack.

Yesterday he ordered a classified report which makes America’s case for intervention to be made public. But Washington officials insisted that the report was ‘not a slam dunk’. The basketball term was a deliberate reference to claims made by former CIA director George Tenet in 2002.He said US intelligence showing that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a ‘slam dunk.’ That intelligence turned out to be wrong. Plan: President Barack Obama is prepared to go ahead with a limited airstrike on Syria despite last night¿s rejection of military action by Britain, according to senior US administration officials
The declassified report does not contain a smoking gun directly linking Assad to the massacre that killed
at least 350 people last week, officials said.American
satellites have captured images of Syrian troops moving trucks into weapons storage areas and removing materials, but analysts have not been
able to track what was moved or, in some cases, where it was relocated.This means a possible series of US cruise missile strikes aimed at crippling Assad’s military infrastructure could hit newly hidden supplies of chemical weapons, accidentally triggering another attack.The US also intercepted a phone call in which Syrian military officials discussed the strike, but the staff were only low-level, the officials said. It did not contain any direct evidence tying the attack back to Assad or even a senior Syrian commander – the link the White House is looking for. It wants to rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the military decided to use chemical weapons without authorisation.So while Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that links between the attack and the Assad government were ‘undeniable,’ US intelligence officials are not certain that it was carried out on Assad’s orders. Claim: Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that links between the attack and the Assad government were 'undeniable'
They are not even completely sure it was carried out by government forces. Despite these reservations, Mr Obama was said to be confident that there was sufficient evidence to act once UN inspectors have left Syria tomorrow. The strike is likely to be a cruise missile bombardment from US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, probably only lasting for a couple of days.A fifth US warship was expected to arrive in the region today. A US State Department official said President Obama would not wait for Britain, explaining: ‘We can’t wait. We need to act according to our own national interests. We need to act. Why do we need to wait for a UN report to tell us what we already know?’ Asked why the US had to go it alone in Syria while Europe hesitated, congressman Eliot Engel, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ‘It’s difficult to answer that question.’ He didn’t openly criticise Britain, but added: ‘As the US we stand for something. We stand for democracy. We stand for human rights. In the US we have principles. 'These are difficult decisions. We don’t take them lightly. I think the world has to show its revulsion and this is a way of doing it. The worst choice we can do is to do nothing.’Russia is sending an anti- submarine battleship and a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean in a move described as ‘gunboat diplomacy’ over Syria. Experts say the bolstering of Moscow’s naval presence could potentially give the Assad regime early warning of Western submarine cruise missile launches, or jam radars and navigation systems.

Just how many engagement rings does one girl need? Tamara Ecclestone swaps between two HUGE diamonds By

As one of the wealthiest socialites in the UK, it stands to reason that Tamara Ecclestone would have been presented with the biggest diamond around from hew new fiancé Jay Rutland.But judging by pictures of the F1 heiress out and about in London since news of her plans to wed broke earlier this month, lucky Tamara has a choice of two huge diamonds to sport on her left hand.The 28-year-old star has been swapping between a large pear-shaped diamond and a jagged-cut option for various nights on the town. Just how many rings does one girl need? Newly-engaged Tamara Ecclestone has been switching between a pear-shaped diamond and a jagged cut jewel Switching things up: Tamara has been keeping fans guessing about which is her actual engagement ring by consistently swapping them around
As she partied at Annabel's in the capital on Tuesday night, Tamara proudly showed off her exquisite pear-shaped diamond, teaming the glittering jewel with a black long-sleeved dress with sheer spotted lace panels.However, as she enjoyed a meal at C London last week, Tamara had switched the ring for an equally large four-piece diamond cluster.And to further confuse matters, as she headed out in London earlier in the day on Tuesday, Tamara went entirely without any ring.The reasons for Tamara's switching of her rings is as yet unclear. Dressed to impress: Tamara wore a black minidress with sheer spotted panels for a night out on Tuesday at Annabel's
Toned and tanned: Tamara looked as bronzed as ever for the night out in the capital
Last week, Tamara confirmed her engagement to 31-year-old former City stockbroker Jay who proposed just one month after they met.
Tamara told Hello! Magazine of her engagement: 'Our engagement has been very sudden and I get that there are people who won't understand that and will read things into it. But my response to that would be, "When you know, you know."
'The
thing is, I'd heard people say that before and I'd never really understood it, because I hadn't experienced it for myself. But when I met Jay, I just knew this was the man I was going to marry. Where have they gone now? Neither of Tamara's rings were seen as the socialite was spotted in the capital earlier in the day
Monochrome chic: Tamara looked stylish in a cream peplum top and black skinny trousers with heeled boots
'I
don't think the amount of time you are together has anything to do with
it. All I know is that I have never felt more comfortable with anyone so quickly, or felt as happy as I feel right now.
'I've
never been in a relationship before where I've been able to be myself and feel so comfortable so quickly. When you find true love, why wait?'
And
the socialite claims she is impressed with her new man despite his colourful background after he sold cocaine to reporters in a Sunday newspaper sting in 2002 and banned for insider training.
She
said: 'Everyone has a past and the downside to my life is that the past
gets dragged up. I feel protective of Jay and I don't ever want him to go through unnecessary anxiety because of his relationship with me. What
I do know for sure about Jay is that he is a very good, loyal person and without trust, you have nothing.' Whirlwind: Tamara and stockbroker Jay Cutler announced their engagement earlier this month
