I bought a waterproof pouch for my camera for 2 quid. Used it in the sea on holiday, it's not really a new idea is it.

Article:
Loanee Lukaku reveals he is a TRUE BLUE. So is the striker backing Everton to get one over on his parent club Chelsea?

Comment:
Two things about this. One, Lukaku will still be feeling angry towards Chelsea as I bet he feels (with good reason I think) he should have been given a chance to lead Chelsea's line and not farmed out on loan again. There will be a bit of that in his wish for an Everton win! Second, if he had to go out on loan again, Lukaku wanted to go back on loan to West Brom. Why wouldn't he? He had a successful time there last season, gets on really well with Steve Clarke, knows his methods and is loved by the fans. Why is he at Everton then? Of course it's nothing to do with a £5m loan fee that Everton have paid is it?!!
