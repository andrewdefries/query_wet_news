At least the airplane will get better gas mileage with all that hot air providing buoyancy.
I love the slap in the face to Bill Clinton when his boss got to ride in AF-1 and he had to ride with Carter. Too funny. Maybe NOW he will learn what Barry REALLY thinks of him.

Made to last! Welsh brothers who are still wearing the same cardigans knitted for them by their mother 55 years ago - and they still fit perfectly

Comment:
Lovely that the brothers have worn these beautifully patterned knitted jackets for all these years. Hand knitted garments are special, knitted with love. There is something special about having a jersey or jacket that has been made just for you, something that has taken time to make, it is a personal act of love to knit something for someone.
These brothers mother would be so thrilled to know her sons love their jackets so much.

Peering through the windswept snow on a dark February day, the rescue party finally came on the first sign of life — the flapping remains of a tent pitched on ski poles on an uppermost slope of Kholat Syakhl, ‘Mountain of the Dead’ in the native language of northern Siberia.But where were the nine young Russian students who should have been sheltering beneath the canvas?Curiosity turned to mystery as human tracks were seen in the snow heading downhill away from the tent in single file for a third of a mile... barefoot human tracks. Oblivious to what fate had in store: Four of the victims - Nicolai Thibeaux-Brignolle, Luda Dubinina, Semyon
Zolotarev and Zina Kolmogorova
In temperatures of minus 24! And mystery became horror when an inspection of the tent showed its front flaps still buttoned tightly together but huge knife slashes down the sides — through which the occupants apparently fled.Inside was like the Mary Celeste, with everything intact — warm clothes, waterproof jackets, blankets and sweaters that would have been essential to survive in the Siberian weather; plus cameras, diaries and cooking utensils, all apparently abandoned in a moment of madness.

So began the story of what became known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident, one that has baffled the world for more than half a century since whatever horrific tragedy overtook the nine in February 1959.They had been missing for almost a month after trekking out into the bleak wildness of the Ural mountains — seven men and two women, all of them fit, hardy and experienced hikers on what was supposed to be a short and invigorating break from their graduate studies. Eerie: The tent as the rescuers found it on February 26, 1959, which had been cut open from inside
Haunting photographs from the film in their cameras show the happy and relaxed faces of good friends on an exhilarating adventure, capturing their journey by train, road and on foot to this desolate area. They smile out fresh-faced and jolly from black-and-white snaps, rugged, healthy young people in the anoraks, plus-fours, waterproof galoshes and gaiters of the day, oblivious to what fate has in store for them.When they failed to return, search parties went out, with every expectation of finding at least some survivors — hopes that were soon dashed.The first bodies — frostbitten and frozen stiff — were discovered lying in the snow on flat land near a river, a mile from the tent, next to the remains of a long burnt-out fire.Around 350 yards away lay the corpse of Igor Dyatlov, the 23-year-old engineering student from Ural Polyetchnic who had put the expedition together and was its leader. (His name would later be given to the area where the tragedy took place.) Nearby, a search dog sniffed out the remains of Zina Kolmogorova, 22, under four inches of snow, and then that of Rustem Slobodin. The bodies were in a line 200 yards apart, as if they had been trying to crawl behind each other back up to the shelter of the tent, but never made it.Another two months went by before the rest of the group were found, under 15ft of snow in a den they had desperately hollowed out for themselves before succumbing to the cold. Some of this group had broken bones and terrible internal injuries but, strangely, no external wounds, not even scratches on the skin. Stranger still, odd bits of their clothing contained higher than normal levels of radiation.Indeed, post-mortem examinations of all nine bodies threw up a string of bewildering anomalies. Why were some fully clothed, but others nearly naked? Most disconcerting of all was Lyudmilla Dubinina’s body, which was missing her tongue and eyes. Unsolved mystery: The skiers setting up camp on February 2, 1959 in a photo taken from a roll of film found at the camp of the Dyatlov Pass
What had gone on in those dark and dreadful hours on the Mountain of the Dead? What had caused nine highly educated, young adults to plunge panic-stricken into the sub-zero night to their deaths?The official Soviet investigator into the tragedy, Lev Ivanov, could find no answers. He concluded in his hastily composed report that all nine deaths had been caused by what he described as ‘an unknown elemental force which they were unable to overcome’.Privately, he told people he thought they’d been killed by aliens in a UFO.And that was where official investigations ended. Case closed. Access to the entire area was sealed off from prying eyes for the next four years, by which time the authorities believed this incident would have disappeared off the radar, as many strange happenings did in the old Soviet empire.But the mystery would not go away. The ingredients were too potent.Now the riddle has been revisited in a new book by British writer and researcher Keith McCloskey. It is also the subject of a gripping new film — released this weekend — by Hollywood director Renny Harlin, a veteran of mystery, thriller and horror movies.‘There is no theory that makes sense,’ says Harlin, ‘only guesses.’ And he’s right. The explanations put forward over the years for what made the Dyatlov Nine flee mindlessly from the relative haven of their tent to die in the snow range from the obvious to the bizarre and then to the insane, with large doses of conspiracy theory along the way.There is the sexual explanation, for example — did a massive drunken punch-up break out among the men, possibly over advances made to the alluring Zina Kolmogorova? But while human nature is always suspect in the claustrophobic conditions of a tent on a blizzard-swept mountainside, that doesn’t explain why they fled en masse into the night.Wild bears on the prowl for prey are another proposition — but no animal tracks were found.An avalanche might have been enough for them to lose their nerve and run. Perhaps, in confusion, they raced away from the immediate danger but then could not find their way back in the pitch black of the night and against Arctic winds.Yet there was no sign of snow pouring over the tent, which was still largely upright when found. And these were experienced adult hikers, not likely to be easily scared. At least one of them surely would have kept calm enough not to join the lemming rush to their doom?Were they, perhaps, caught up in some bizarre military accident in the lonely (and top secret) vastness of the Russian interior — a missile misfiring or a low-flying jet sending out shock waves and noise that frightened them out of their wits?This was the height of the Cold War with both sides of the East-West divide searching for the ultimate weapon to knock the other out. But there is no evidence of experimental weapons sites within hundreds of miles. There has been speculation about the development of ultra-sonic weapons that destroy with sound alone, but no
proof that such arms even exist.What
is known is that nearby the Mountain of the Dead were gulag camps for those unfortunates who crossed the Communist leadership in Moscow. Could
a bunch of desperate escapees have pounced on the unsuspecting hikers and slaughtered them? Experienced skiers: Yuri Yudin hugging Lyudmila Dubinina as he prepares to leave the group due to illness, which saved his life as he left the expedition before the deaths
Or were the campers — as another unprovable theory suggests — collateral damage after a mass escape of criminal thugs from one camp in the area?This was supposedly foiled by the KGB using missiles loaded with nerve gas or vacuum bombs that sucked the oxygen from the air — perhaps explaining the internal injuries some of the hikers suffered.But there were no other footprints in the snow around the site suggesting more people were involved — which also rules out suggestions that the Nine stumbled on Soviet Spetznaz special forces testing secret weapons and were eliminated on the spot to shut them up.Conspiracy theories are two-a-kopek. While sceptics might dismiss the Soviet investigator’s talk of aliens, believers are encouraged by reports of strange lights and ‘bright orbs’ hovering in the night sky at around this time.The last photograph on the film in one of the cameras found in the tent appears to capture a giant flash against the night sky — but it could equally be the result of an accidental over-exposure.Then we must consider (but quickly pass over) the possibility of wandering yetis or abominable snowmen pouncing on the hapless hikers and squeezing the life out of the victims with those massive internal injuries.A centuries-old horror legend in the Urals speaks of a fearsome zolotaya baba — a ‘golden woman’ — lurking in the area. But the simple fact is no theory holds up to scrutiny. As Keith McCloskey concludes, we will probably never know for sure what actually happened on that remote mountainside.The one thing he feels sure about is that there was some sort of an official cover-up, which has served only to add to the mystery. But the Soviet Union was a place where concealing the truth was second nature to officials, high and low.Accidents were routinely airbrushed from the record. Twenty years after the Dyatlov incident, a fatal release of anthrax from a germ warfare research establishment in the Urals was hushed up. The KGB seized all hospital records and, to this day, the site is off-limits.McCloskey blames the deaths of the Dyatlov Nine on some unspecified accident caused by the Soviet military, but precisely what and where and how eludes him and us.Harlin’s provocative film, on the other hand, provides an answer. With impressive starring roles for young British actresses Holly Goss and Gemma Atkinson, it follows five modern-day American students as they trek to the Urals to make a documentary about the Dyatlov disaster, then succumb to . . .To what? It would be wrong for me to spoil the surprise for those who want to see this taut film drama for themselves. Let’s just say they stumble on a secret that builds slowly and atmospherically to a climax of horror that’s great on screen — but a time warp or two away from reality.The mystery of the Mountain of the Dead goes on, as intriguing and unresolved as ever. Mysterious landscape: Siberia is known as a beautiful part of Russia but its desolate countryside can be unforgiving for walkers and hikers
The only certainty in the whole mind-bending story is the luck of the tenth member of the group, 21-year-old Yuri Yudin. A fellow student, he set out on the expedition with the rest, but was in such pain from lumbago, exacerbated by the cold, that he reluctantly had to drop out three days before his friends reached the mountain and encountered whatever horror killed them.That ‘unknown elemental force’ identified by the original Soviet investigator more than half a century ago still lacks a convincing name. There will undoubtedly be more theories in this story. Watch this space.Adapted from Mountain Of The Dead by Keith McCloskey (History Press, £9.99). © Keith McCloskey 2013.

"Surprisingly, one of the most extraordinary and astonishing versions came from none other than Lev Ivanov himself. In 1990, the retired Prosecutor published an article, "The Enigma of the Fireballs", where he admitted that in spring of 1959, under the pressure of A. P. Kirilenko, and of his deputy, A. F. Yeshtokin, he withdrew various key materials from the case that indicated the true cause of the accident: "fireballs" or a UFO: "When E. P. Maslennikov and I examined the scene in May, we found that some young pine trees at the edge of the forest had burn marks, but those marks did not have a concentric form or some other pattern. There was no epicenter. This once again confirmed that heated beams of a strong, but completely unknown, at least to us, energy, were directing their firepower toward specific objects (in this case, people), acting selectively." Later on, Kirilenko professed a lively interest in UFO's, and received memos about sightings of UFO's from KGB chief Andropov."

It appears from other reports that, in heading into the woods, the last four survivors probably intended to try to descend to the valley below where they had passed a fixed shelter the day before, intending to use that instead of the ruined tent. By error and in thick snow, they descended into the wrong valley and met their doom in the ravine rather than safety in the shelter. Lead investigator Lev "Ivanov was the one who first noticed that the bodies and gear found were all radioactive, and said that a Geiger counter he'd brought with him went nuts all around the campsite. He also has said that Soviet officials told him at the time to clamp the case shut, despite reports that "bright flying spheres" had been reported in the area in February and March of 1959. "I suspected at the time and am almost sure now that these bright flying spheres had a direct connection to the group's death," Ivanov told Kazakh newspaper Leninsky Put in an interview dug up by the Times."

"The question (among many) I want answered is how were Lyudmilla Dubinina's tongue and eyes removed?" - John Taylor, Vancouver, Canada, 25/8/20" - John, according to the rescuers, she was found face-down in a spring in the ravine, completely frozen in. They had to remove her with pick-axes. Her tongue and eyes may have been removed by predators after she died but I find this all strange. Battlefield lore is that injured parties roll over automatically to protect their stomachs while those about to die roll onto their backs, and this appears to be the case with obvious exceptions. If she also had chest and heart injuries it's unlikely that she'd be found face down unless she was later moved or pulled in that way (by a large animal?). The medical examiner didn't find her missing parts strange, though, given the circumstances. But what about the note allegedly found by the two victims at the pine tree, which said "Now we know that snowmen exist"?.

I have a question for all of you who think the explanation is so simple and obvious. Why was it not so simple and obvious to the Soviet investigators? Why dis they conclude that it was some mysterious force that killed the hikers and not an avalanche or tent party that went awry etc? What do you know that the Soviet investigators don't and what facts/information/sources are you using to come to your conclusion and why didn't the Soviet investigators find those facts/information/sources adequate to base any firm conclusions on?

The question (among many) I want answered is how were Lyudmilla Dubinina's tongue and eyes removed? That will give us an important clue. If they showed signs of clean surgical removal you would have pretty good evidence that they weren't removed by an animal or in a fall or by thugs or member of the party but by a skilled individual(s) eg someone in the sciences or medical field

I am absolutely fascinated by this case. Apart from the terrible tragedy of these deaths, I am well familiar with winter camping in the Canadian wilderness at very low temperatures and I know how very quickly extreme cold can kill. That they managed to re-group and build a fire out of damp wood and then survive for hours, poorly-clad, under these conditions (with a low temperature reinforced by wind chill) indicates outdoor knowledge, skill and resourcefulness of the highest order. They may have been panicked into fleeing for their lives from the tent but everything they did thereafter shows a remarkable degree of improvization and care for each other. I think you can only appreciate the intensity of the danger the cold immediately posed to them if you've experienced those kinds of winter wilderness temperatures yourself. As someone who has, I really do admire their response and resourcefulness. How sad to have lost such fine young lives, whatever the initiating cause! 5

Anothedr intriguing snippet, this time from a Moscow contributor to a website commentary on this incident who seems well familiar with the facts: "The rescue teams were mainly students and Mansi volunteers, as well as prison guards from the nearby camp, soldiers - no KGB, no secrecy. There was some government interest and supervision in place, but that's because two of the missing hikers were engineers at the top-secret plutonium production facility (Mayak). " - 'prison guards from the nearby camp'? Reportedly, 11 - not 9 - bodies were found and the three members of the group who tried to struggle back to the tent were found dead, one shielding his head, the second with a fractured skull and the third with unknown blood beside her body. Is it possible that some prisoners who had escaped the gulag camp appeared at the closed tent flap, demanded food and the women. and that the decision was made to slash the tent walls and flee? Later, some tried to return and were attacked?

To add to the mystery, I came across this intriguing original source information also: "Three hundred meters from the fire and in the direction of the tent searchers find the body of Igor Dyatlova. He is laying on his back with his head towards the tents, one hand is holding a small birch tree branch and the other is shielding his head. 180 m from the body of Igor Dyatlow and in a direction towards the tent the searchers find the body of Rustem Slobodin. He is lying face forward in the snow. Slobodin was also found to have a skull fracture of about 17 cm in length. however, experts have determined that his death was most probably from hypothermia. A further 150m from the body of rustem Slobodin and even closer to the tent, the searchers discover the body of Zinaida Kolmogorov. Traces of blood are found nearby. (We don't know the source of the blood yet.)" 'Shielding his head', 'skull fracture', 'unknown blood', and 11 bodies - not 9 - allegedly found? Were two Gulag escapees?

Here are a couple of other interesting snippets, taken from another source: "A chance meeting...on a train with a medical assistant at the accident site - Maria Ivanovna - revealed that she recalled 11 bodies being discovered and not nine. Two were hurriedly removed to a destination unknown to her." and "Yuri Yarovoi (a Sverdlovsk writer and journalist who was the photographer for the original rescue mission and later involved in the inquest) wrote a fictional book entitled 'of the highest Rank of complexity'.." (a romanticized version of this incident) "He was allegedly made to rewrite it twice before the authorities permitted its publication. In this version only the team leader dies. Now this is the interesting part: Yuri and his wife were killed in a car crash in the mid 1980¿s a few short years before the partial declassification of the Dyatlov papers. According to this source all his papers, records and private notes of the Dyatlov Pass Incident have gone missing." 7

Here's what a review of the facts indicates (from original sources): the group is tired but relaxed at the campsite. Some feel comfortable enough to strip to their underwear ready for sleep following their shared meal. Something then terrifies them enough that they suddenly cut through the sides of the tent to flee and scatter, unprepared, into temperatures that they know will kill them in hours. They come together again under a large pine at the forest tree line, about 1.5m away. Here they share some clothes. They light a fire in an attempt to ward off the cold. One member climbs the tree, breaking branches, to try to see what is happening back at the tent. They stay there two hours. Desperate, the leader and two others try to return to the tent. They die from cold at intervals. Two of the remaining group members die. The others take clothes from them and set off into the woods, away from the tent. They reach a ravine, huddle or fall into it together, and there die.

Tennis faces more potential drugs controversy after claims that world No 15 Cilic tests positive

Tennis has been left facing more awkward questions about doping after widespread reports that world No 15 Marin Cilic tested positive at the Munich Open three months ago.According to the media in his native Croatia, Cilic was informed of the test results during Wimbledon, which may be connected to him unexpectedly pulling out of his second-round match against Kenny de Schepper.This development comes within days of former world No 12 Serbia’s Viktor Troicki receiving an 18-month ban for refusing to take a blood test at the Monte Carlo Open this summer in the week prior to the German event.On Monday, a spokesperson for the International Tennis Federation, which administers an anti-doping programme that is in the process of being beefed up, stuck to its policy of refusing to comment on individual cases.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cilic investigated over 'failed' drugs test Withdrawal: Cilic pulled out of Wimbledon ahead of his second round match against Kenny De Schepper
A ban for Cilic could have ramifications for British tennis. In September, Britain are due to meet Croatia at the seaside resort of Umag for a place in next year’s elite 16-team World Group of the Davis Cup; Cilic’s absence would dramatically
weaken their team.
When he missed last week’s regular ATP event at the same venue, it appears to have led to the media reports
in Croatia, with daily Slobodna Dalmacija claiming he had failed the test.
Another daily, Jutarnji List, suggested that the positive result may be related to an ‘incautious use of glucose’. His manager, Vincent Stavaux, was quoted as saying: ‘There
are no comments until we are able to comment.’
In tennis, there is roughly a three-month time lag between a positive test being discovered and a formal announcement after a tribunal hearing — but only if the player is
found guilty. That is what happened last week to world No 53 Troicki. Handshake: Cilic lost to Andy Murray in the final of the AEGON Championships at Queen's last month
Given that the Munich tournament took place the following week after Monte Carlo, between April 29 and May 5, any formal findings in the case of Cilic could be revealed in the next few weeks. The ITF policy is not to announce provisional suspensions.
Cilic would be the sport’s highest-profile case since Frenchman Richard Gasquet was handed a 12-month ban in 2009 after traces of cocaine were found in his system. He was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which accepted he accidentally ingested the substance through kissing a woman in a Miami nightclub.
The 24-year-old Croat has been ranked as high as No 9 in the world and reached the semi-finals of the 2010 Australian Open, where he lost to Andy Murray. He won the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club last year and reached the final this summer, again losing to Murray. In Munich, he was beaten easily in his first match by compatriot Ivan Dodig. Later in May he split from his long-time coach, Australian veteran Bob Brett. Banned: Troicki has been suspended for 18 months after failing to provide a blood sample for a test Suspended: Richard Gasquet was handed a 12-month ban in 2009 after cocaine was found in his system
At Wimbledon, he won his first-round match against Cyprus’s Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, but then withdrew
on the morning of his match on the first Wednesday against the much-lower-ranked De Schepper, citing a continuing left-knee problem. He has not played since.
Troicki was the sixth and most high-profile player of either sex to have been banned for doping this year, supporting claims from the likes of Murray and Roger Federer that tennis needs to step up its efforts to keep the sport as clean as possible. Troicki, protesting his innocence, aims to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
