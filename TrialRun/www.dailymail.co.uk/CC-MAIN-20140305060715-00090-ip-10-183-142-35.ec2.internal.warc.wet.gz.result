Mother livid as teen who 'shot dead her 13-year-old daughter on school bus' is allowed to attend school while out on bond

A mother in South Florida is shocked that the teen who accidentally shot and killed her 13-year-old daughter is returning to his normal life and already back at school while he is out on bond.Lourdes 'Jina' Guzman-DeJesus was shot to death on November 20 in Miami, Florida when Jordyn Howe, 15, took a gun out of his backpack and accidentally shot her in the neck while they both rode on the school bus. DeJesus' mother, Ady, was furious after she found out in court on Monday that Howe is back at school after the accident that claimed her daughter's life. Victim: Thirteen-year-old Lourdes was tragically shot to death in front of her younger sister and seven other children while riding a school bus Fatal wound: The teen was killed when another student took a gun out of his backpack and accidentally shot her in the neck
Police believe that the gun went off accidentally while Howe showed the weapon to other students, from the Palm Glades Preparatory Academy charter school, on the bus. Jordyn Howe, 15, has been charged with manslaughter in the death of his classmate
Eight
other children, including the victim's 7-year-old sister, were on the bus but were not harmed. Howe has been charged as an adult with manslaughter, possession of a firearm and possession of a concealed weapon.He was not in court on Monday and so his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. But his absence infuriated the victim's mother. 'He still goes home. He still goes to school. He still has a life,' the girl's mother, Ady DeJesus, said according to WSVN-TV.An attorney for the family said that the terms of Howe's bond should be reviewed. 'I think the judge made it clear that on Wednesday she's gonna set down conditions that will tighten Mr. Howe's ability to move through the community freely.'The judge set a hearing for Wednesday for the review. The family's tragedy was doubled when the girls' father committed suicide just five weeks after his daughter's death. The girl's father, Armando 'Alex' Guzman, 34, did not have a close relationship with the girl but was said to have been overcome with grief and guilt at the tragedy.He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and his body was discovered in a vehicle in Broward County on December 28. Family members said that the father was overcome with grief at the loss of his daughter. 'It had to be that whole thing of guilt that really got to him,' said David Font, who is DeJesus' cousin.'I heard that he had been very depressed.' Family sorrow: Lourdes 'Jina' Guzman-DeJesus, left, was killed in November and her father, Armando 'Alex' Guzman, right, committed suicide five weeks after the 13-year-old's death

Google forced to pay $22million fine for 'spying on web users' - but REFUSES to admit they were wrongFine is the largest in the history of the Federal Trade Commission

Google is paying a record $22.5million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking millions of Web surfers who use Apple's Safari browser.The penalty announced Thursday by the Federal Trade Commission is the largest fine imposed against a company for violating a previous agreement with the agency.In spite of their hefty payout, Google isn't admitting any wrongdoing in the latest settlement. Shady dealings: The fine comes as the FTC argues Google used it's cookie software to track user's information without their knowledge
They claim that the fine does not directly pertain to Google's data collection, but for misrepresenting what was happening. Last October, Google had signed a 20-year agreement that, among other things, included a company pledge not to mislead consumers about its privacy practices.The FTC opened its investigation into the Safari activities six months ago after a researcher at Stanford University revealed that Google had overridden Safari safeguards that are supposed to prevent outside parties from monitoring Web surfing activity without a user's permission.The tracking occurs through snippets of computer coding, known as cookies, that help Internet services and advertisers target marketing pitches based on an analysis of the interests implied by a person's Web surfing activity. Paying up: Google CEO Larry Page and his fellow officials deny any wrongdoing in the case but are paying the fine because they misrepresented previous findingsGoogle immediately withdrew its intrusive technology from Safari after the manipulation was reported.But the circumvention of Apple's built-in settings appeared to contradict a statement in Google's online help center assuring Safari users that they didn't need to do anything more to ensure their online activities wouldn't be logged by Google.The apparent contradiction between Google's words and actions became the focal point of the FTC investigation.Google's fine surpasses a nearly $19million penalty that the FTC slapped on a telemarketer accused of duping people into believing they were donating to charities.Google's stock price increased 60 cents to $642.83 in midday trading Thursday, after the FTC announcement.

Transfer woe for Arsenal again as Freiburg slam talk that Ginter's £6.1m deal is done

Arsenal face more hard bargaining for one of their top transfer targets after Freiburg dismissed claims of a done deal for Matthias Ginter as 'nonsense'.Gunners manager Arsene Wenger wants a physical presence at the heart of midfield and was reported over the weekend to have agreed a £6.1million fee for 6ft-plus Germany Under 21 anchor man Ginter.But there was a swift rebuttal from the Bundesliga club’s sporting director Joachim Saier, who insisted Arsenal have yet to make a bid and made it clear it would take more than the figure quoted to prise the 19-year-old away.Scroll down for video Rubbish: Reports suggestion that Matthias Ginter's move to Arsenal is 'done' were rebuffed by Freiburg
‘There have been no offers for Matthias, and to suggest we have agreed a fee, as mentioned, is nonsense,’ said Saier. ‘The fact of the matter is, we have no thoughts about selling him.’ Though Saier’s stance may sound a sales pitch to try to drive up the price, Freiburg are genuinely reluctant to lose their youth team graduate.Freiburg were in danger of going down when they faced relegation rivals Augsburg towards the end of the 2011-12 campaign. But Ginter, marked his debut just two days after his 18th birthday by heading the only goal of the game, two minutes from time, to steer his side towards safety. In the process he became the youngest Bundesliga goalscorer in the club’s history. Impressive: Ginter has made a good start to his career in Germany
Not impressed: Arsene Wenger has struggled again in the transfer market this summer
After establishing himself as a holding midfielder just in front of the back four, he again played a pivotal role in continuing the Freiburg revival last season as they qualified for the Europa League in fifth, just missing out on a first-ever place in the Champions League.Ginter’s forceful performances earned him Under 21 recognition and brought him to the attention of Wenger, who wants a Patrick Vieira-like robust presence in midfield and has frequently been linked with Everton’s Marouane Fellaini.But, as he has discovered with his drawn-out pursuit of Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, he may have his work cut out landing his prime target.
