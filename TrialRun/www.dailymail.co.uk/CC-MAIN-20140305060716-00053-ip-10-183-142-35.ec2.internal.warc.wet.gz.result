Parliament has risen for the summer and is not scheduled to sit again until early October. This is usually the cue for commentators to complain about the length of the holidays taken by MPs and ‘working peers’.If you are expecting me to join in the chorus of disapproval, I’m afraid you’ve come to the wrong place.As far as this column is concerned, the recess couldn’t arrive quickly enough. And if the politicians don’t return to their desks for another six months, so much the better. No peace: Parliament is out, but there is no rest from the constant barrage of politicians on our TV
Britain is suffering from a debilitating surfeit of politics, most of it utterly pointless and self-serving, almost all of it positively harmful.From jumped-up, full-time local councillors with grandiose job titles such as ‘Cabinet Member For The Built Environment’, via the third-rate pygmies and bottom-feeders who populate the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, right up to the grandstanding egomaniacs in both houses at Westminster, our elected and appointed representatives are a menace.They believe it is their duty — nay, entitlement — to be in our faces 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, preening themselves in television and radio studios, engaging in puerile name-calling and points-scoring.As I remarked recently in relation to a hatchet-faced, lemon-sucking shadow spokesbabe who spread herself across all channels and media outlets one weekend, blaming localised flooding caused by heavy rain on the ‘savage cuts’ in public spending: don’t these people ever take a day off? Matthew who? Lord Oakeshott's comments about the Chancellor have apparently thrown the coalition into 'crisis'
Admittedly, they are encouraged and indulged by my own trade. The Boys In The Bubble invest every mindless tweet and rent-a-quote soundbite with biblical significance.For instance, according to some sections of the media, the most important thing that happened in the world this week was a man you’ve never heard of calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to resign, which apparently plunged the Coalition into ‘crisis’.This great sage is someone called Lord Oakeshott, described portentously as a ‘senior’ Liberal Democrat, but in reality a person with no position, of no importance and with no relevance other than to serve as a gob-on-a-stick for reporters with a deadline to meet and a space to fill.Matthew Oakeshott was elevated to the peerage after twice failing to get elected to Parliament — first as a Labour candidate, then on the old SDP-Liberal Alliance ticket. He served for a while as a Lib Dem Treasury spokesman before standing down by ‘mutual consent’ over some long-forgotten difference of opinion about something to do with the banks.

Oakeshott is regarded as an ‘outrider’ for Vince Cable. But seeing as Saint Vinny is not noted for his reticence or lack of self-regard, Cable would seem to need an ‘outrider’ about as much as Boris Johnson needs another bicycle.Of course, as this week’s grim figures illustrate, Boy George’s bold ‘Plan A’ is failing to fish Britain’s economy out of the mire.But no one else appears to have much of a ‘Plan B’ which doesn’t involve spending public money we don’t have — the same recipe that got us into this mess in the first place.Neither the Government nor the Opposition is prepared to countenance the only genuine alternative — which is ruthlessly to slash spending, slash taxes and slash the regulatory burden on business. There’s no point asking the preposterous Ed Balls, who brought us ‘post neo-classical endogenous growth theory’ and conspired with Gordon Brown to bankrupt Britain. You might just as well ask Plan B, the Essex rapper, for his ‘Plan B’.Lacking the courage and commitment to embrace radical reform, the politicians are reduced to trading insults while the economy goes to hell in a handcart.Just in case they missed the photographs of a packed Bournemouth beach this week, no one is actually listening.Out here in the real world, everyone is trying to get on with their lives and take their comfort where they can — catching a welcome snatch of sunshine to divert attention from the everyday struggle.We can do without their political displacement activity, delivering incendiary lectures on the morality of paying tradesmen in cash and suggesting that anyone who organises their financial affairs in accordance with the law to minimise their tax liabilities is a reprehensible criminal taking food out of the mouths of babies.All this is merely a smokescreen to disguise their own clueless inadequacy and failure to tackle the real problem facing this country — the Government’s refusal to stop wasting billions of pounds every year and start living within our means.With Parliament in recess, it is probably too much to hope that the politicians will pack their trunks and wave goodbye to the circus for a couple of months.Much as a period of silence and invisibility would be welcome, I fear the political class will continue to bicker and bore for Britain while simultaneously trying to claim the credit for any sporting success achieved by our Olympic athletes. Team work: Wiggins' win was an amazing achievement, but Cameron shouldn't try and jump on board
Call Me Dave has already tried to wrap himself in the reflected glory of Bradley Wiggins and his winning Tour de France team.No doubt, if we fail to collect as many medals as expected, there’ll be some opportunistic Opposition spokesman blaming it all on the ‘savage cuts’ and demanding more ‘investment’ in British sports.The heart sinks in anticipation. I wish the political class would just shut up, go away and let the rest of us enjoy what’s left of the summer. And don’t hurry back. Olympic Asylum Chaos: Cartoon by Gary for the Daily Mail
Immigration authorities fear that up to two per cent of all visiting Olympic athletes, officials and supporters will try to stay on in Britain once the Games are over.Already, an African middle distance runner has walked into a police station in Leeds and asked for asylum. And that’s even before the opening ceremony has been held. Others are expected to follow suit. Enlarge
Asylum claim: The man, believed to be an African middle-distance runner in his 20s, is now being questioned by UK Border Agency officials. File picture
Don’t be surprised to see athletes from some of the world’s more unsavoury regimes carry on running once they’ve breasted the tape and leg it out of the stadium and along Stratford High Street before vanishing without trace. Maybe we should station stewards with giant butterfly nets at the finish line to stop them escaping.We’re going to need the Olympic village to accommodate all the ‘overstayers’. It looks like the ‘legacy’ of the Games is going to be another milestone in Britain’s world-class record for accepting asylum seekers, no questions asked.Australian diver Matthew Mitcham (left) has been posting pictures of himself on the internet. He can be seen larking around on statues and other public structures.Mitcham, 24, who won gold at the Beijing Games, is seen standing on a set of Olympic rings, lying on a bronze gorilla and astride his country’s national bird, the emu. Apparently, he has a reputation as a bit of a joker. He may think he’s at the cutting edge of comedy, but when I saw the pictures all I could think of was Seventies funnyman Bernie Clifton (right).Justice? Certainly, but not a show trialSince when did the Director of Public Prosecutions start giving stage-managed Press conferences to announce charges against murderers, drugs dealers and armed robbers? I certainly can’t recall any.So why did the CPS think it was necessary to hold a high-profile media event to reveal charges against journalists accused of phone hacking? It all smacked of a U.S.-style ‘perp walk’.In the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, it is clear that certain sections of the political class and the police have declared war on the Press.

'Are we ready? Yes we are!' Mayor of London Boris Johnson attacks U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney as he issues Olympics rallying cry to 60,000 at Hyde Park
New Met commissioner Bernard Hyphen-Howe has discouraged his officers from talking to reporters asking legitimate questions. And, under the cover of Leveson, his sidekick, Sue Akers, has levelled a number of so-far unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against journalists. Heavy-handed, early morning fishing expeditions have been conducted at the homes of reporters and executives.This column has always argued that those accused of illegally hacking phones should be brought to justice and the cases tested in court. If convicted, they should be punished.But this is in danger of turning into a show trial.Knee-jerk ‘security’ stupidityThe Colorado multiplex massacre was a shocking tragedy, but it took place on another continent, thousands of miles away.So why was it necessary immediately to impose tighter security at British cinemas showing the same film, the new Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises?It was justified on the grounds that the distributors feared a copycat attack here. Was there any evidence that a madman had managed to get his hands on a selection of semi-automatic weapons and 6,000 rounds of ammunition and was planning to shoot up his local Odeon?Of course not. This was just another example of the kind of knee-jerk stupidity all too often arbitrarily imposed in hi-viz, risk-averse Britain in the name of ‘security’.Any lame excuse will do when it comes to inconveniencing the paying public and treating us all like potential terrorists.What were they expecting to find — a high velocity rifle concealed in a woman’s handbag?Holy hysteria, Batman!

Scientists develop brain scan to pick up early signs of dementia By

Scientists are developing brain scans to detect Alzheimer's even before sufferers show any symptoms. They will employ an imaging agent that lights up areas of the brain harbouring a protein associated with the disease. It is thought that doctors will offer the scans to patients at risk of developing dementia. The new scans would use an imaging agent to highlight proteins associated with dementia It is already being tested in a trial of 70 patients who show signs of cognitive impairment. The results will be published later this year. Developed by GE Healthcare, the imaging agent is injected into the bloodstream and binds to any plaque surrounding the tell-tale protein. Its signal can be picked up on an MRI scan. More...
So could Terry Pratchett's sci-fi helmet really halt Alzheimer's?
Currently Alzheimer's is identified by memory and cognitive tests - with a definitive diagnosis possible only after death through examination of brain tissue. Author Terry Pratchett has been diagnosed with a rare form of early onset Alzheimer's Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said 'Diagnosing dementia early and accurately can be an immense help, providing the first step toward ensuring that patients receive the right care and treatments while developing a better understanding of what is happening to them.' Professor David Brooks, head of neurology at Imperial College London, helped develop the tests and believes they could be ready within five years. Any development that could help with the eventual treatment of Alzheimer's will be welcomed by sufferers.Bestselling author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s in 2007, is a staunch campaigner for those with the disease.The 60-year-old science fiction writer has even been testing out a revolutionary helmet which is claimed to slow down or even reverse the effects of the illness.
