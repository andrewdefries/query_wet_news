I'm dreading the next world war we are overdue and you can only imagine the destruction with technology today it won't take out a few houses it will take out a whole city.
- Danny Davison, Sunderland, 17/11/2011 16:58
Forgive me, but have you not heard of Hiroshima or Nagasaki? Indeed the residents of Dresden and Coventry might think a "whole city" could be taken out years ago.

...and one of the worst is Spartacus...a wonderful production spoiled completely by poor enunciation. No-one these days is capable of opening their mouths and enunciate. Young actors particularly are at fault...they gabble on at a rate of knots, and directors completely fail to demand proper oration. Americans, particularly younger ones are terrible, speaking through closed teeth, down their noses, so it is almost impossible to hear them. Directors please note...get them to open their mouths and speak clearly....that's what actors do...anyone can just ...talk.

Top US Senate hopeful in Texas draws Hitler mustaches on Obama, wants him impeached and she's a DEMOCRAT!African-American candidate polls higher than other Democrats, but the party wants nothing to do with herKesha Rogers is a disciple of Lyndon LaRouche, a political conspiracy theorist who has spent time in prison for fraudShe wants the U.S. to fund bases on Mars and the moon so missiles can intercept near-earth asteroidsRogers is polling above every other Democrat in the U.S. Senate race for a seat held by Republican John Cornyn

Kesha Rogers is an unconventional African-American Texan: She wants President Obama removed from office and she's happy to draw a Hitler moustache on poster-size photos of him – and she's eager to expose London bankers as the string-pullers behind everything that's wrong with the world.She's also running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, and leading the pack. The state-wide party isn't amused.Rogers ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012 and won the Democratic primary both times, despite being trounced in both general elections by Republican Rep. Pete Olson. In 2012 her campaign produced an anti-Obama music video, set to the tune of the Mary Poppins hit 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' – titled 'Super-Ego-Genocidal-Narcissist-Psychosis!'It's little wonder the Texas Democratic establishment wants some distance.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Kesha Rogers, a Texas Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, collects supporters with roadside signs depicting President Obama as an impeachment-worthy Nazi That's not Michelle: African-American Kesha Rogers (L) is waging a knife-in-the-teeth campaign for the U.S. Senate and is leading all Democrats, even though her own party wants nothing to do with her
Do they think they're voting for Ke$ha? The latest Texas Tribune poll shows Rogers outpacing the well-funded David Alameel and every other Democrat
The state-wide party has 'attempted to hide our campaign from their websites,' her campaign manager Ian Overton told Mailonline. And the influential African American Political Alliance 'have purposefully said she's running in a different race than for U.S. Senate.''The Texas [Democratic Party] executive committee has passed resolutions condemning her candidacy and denying all support or acknowledgments,' Overton said.'They are more committed to sinking with the ship than returning to the Constitution.' More...
Woman, 80, arrested 'for removing poster that depicted Obama as Hitler after she found it offensive'
Billboard in small town that features Obama with Hitler mustache draws ire from residents
Republican congressman 'photoshopped picture of campaign rival shaking hands with the President to make it look as though he supported Obamacare'
Sen. Mitch McConnell 'looks and fights like a TURTLE' says Texas U.S. Senate candidate, blasting his opponent for working with the minority leader
Her coffers are almost empty, with barely $2,500 on hand and less than $27,000 in total donations. Yet she leads the rest of the Democratic field, according to a new Texas Tribune poll.The practical oddness of Rogers' platform, which also includes 'interplanetary defense' and Mars colonization – so the U.S. can shoot down asteroids approaching the earth – comes from her allegiance to Lyndon LaRouche, a 91-year-old conspiracy theorist who spent five years in federal prison for fraud in the early 2000s. LaRouche, she has said, is 'the world’s leading economic forecaster.' He also claims to have invented the Strategic Defense Initiative, President Ronald Reagan's proposed 'Star Wars' missile shield program. Senate hopeful who draws Obama Hitler mustaches is a DEMOCRAT
Conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche has attracted a global following of mostly young idealogues with his anti-establishment messages
Rogers doesn't run from the Lyndon LaRouche name, even though critics call him a cultist and a lunatic
The perennial presidential candidate's broader set of goals includes the restoration of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from doubling as investment speculators. He also wants to end the NSA's wiretapping programs and re-tune the world's orchestras a hair lower than normal.
Rogers advocates for more NASA funding so it can engage in 'planetary defense' by stationing missiles on the moon to intercept asteroids as they hurtle toward the earth
Overton upped the ante from the concert hall by insisting that the Obama administration is 'supporting the swastika wearing Nazi Svoboda Party' in Ukraine. 'This is putting us directly into a thermonuclear war confrontation with Russia,' he said in an email.Rogers has turned heads with her Hitler-moustachioed Obama posters, as much as for her other 'far out stuff,' columnist David Freddoso told MailOnline. 'What can I say?' Freddoso shrugged. 'LaRouche is a nut and he has a big following. Often, when tea partiers are blamed for "Hitler=Obama" signs, it's actually the LaRouchies.'It was Freddoso who brought Rogers a wave of perhaps unwanted attention on Monday with an entry in his Conservative Intelligence Briefing blog.The Dallas Morning News, he noted, wrote that she 'has compared the Affordable Care Act to 1930s-era Nazi eugenics policies.'Regarding the Mary Poppins cover tune, he insisted he was 'not making this up.'

How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky.There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state. The first is the most important.
1) Healthcare - Control healthcare & you control the people..
2) Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people easier to control & will not fight back if you are providing everything for them.
3) Debt - Increase the debt to unsustainable level. Then you are able to increase taxes, & this will produce more poverty.
4) Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Govt. That way you are able to create a police state.
5) Welfare-Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, & Income)
6) Education - Take control of what people read & listen to - take control of what children learn in school.
7) Religion - Remove the belief in the God from the Government & schools.
8) Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy & the poor. 5

Not even close to anything ever written by Alinsky. I'm not an Alinsky devotee, but I like to read up on things before I post them. You should probably do the same.

Gene responsible for the unique development of human brains is 'discovered'

The single gene responsible for the unique development of human brains has been discovered, scientists claimed today.Researchers say the laminin gamma3 gene is behind the defining feature of our cerebral cortex - the folds and ripples that aid memory and our capacity for complex thought.They made the discovery after analysing a Turkish patient whose brain lacks the characteristic convolutions. Grey matter: Unique folds on the cerebral cortex, at the back of the brain, are due to the gene LAMC3, scientists claim
The mutation was due to a tiny variation in the LAGMC3 gene, according to the scientsists from Yale University, Connecticut, and several institutions in Turkey.‘The demonstration of the fundamental role of this gene in human brain development affords us a step closer to solve the mystery of the crown jewel of creation, the cerebral cortex,’ Professor Murat Gunel, of Yale, told the journal Nature Genetics. The folding of the brain is seen only in mammals with larger brains, such as dolphins and apes, and is most pronounced in humans. More...

These fissures expand the surface area of the cerebral cortex and allow for complex thought and reasoning without taking up more space in the skull. Until now, however, no one had been able to explain how the brain manages to create them. But it appears that the LAMC3 gene may be crucial to the process. An analysis of the gene shows that it is expressed during the embryonic period that is vital to the formation of dendrites, which form synapses or connections between brain cells. ‘Although the same gene is present in lower organisms with smooth brains such as mice, somehow over time, it has evolved to gain novel functions that are fundamental for human occipital cortex formation and its mutation leads to the loss of surface convolutions, a hallmark of the human brain,’ Professor Gunel said. The discovery could help scientists in Switzerland build a computer model of a human brain.The Human Brain Project is set to receive a £1billion grant in a bid to develop a replica that could lead to cures for various diseases like Parkinson's.The project has already created an artificial neocortical column which is unique to mammals. We have many of these columns to cope with complex cognitive functions including parenthood and social interactions.It was digitally constructed using a software model of tens of thousands of neurons.
