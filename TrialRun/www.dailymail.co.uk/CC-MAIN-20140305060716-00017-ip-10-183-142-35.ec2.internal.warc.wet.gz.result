As a Sunderland Fan, I would say Fellani (apart from 2minutes) had a shocker! He is however in my opinion the one of the best midfielders in the world and is a snip at Ã�Â£30 million
- AB_Sky God, Sunderland, 13/11/2012 17:12
AB the best players only need small amount of time to win a game!
Gutted if he leaves but we will want more than Â£30m

'Why I joined the ladies who punch': Inspired by Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams, Lucy Fry describes why she decided to take up women's boxing

Stop this senseless sexism - with female soldiers, police officers and firefighters all getting equal pay for facing the same dangers as men (right?) let's get rid of this sexist discrimination and have women competing against men.
Boxing is the perfect sport to start with since it is already divided into weight classes - let's have women boxing with men so they can show just how equal they are.

Outrage as picture of bodies of Arizona firemen appear online which families say should have been kept private

A photo that allegedly shows the body bags of the 19 Arizona firefighters covered by American flags has caused a controversy over the rights of the grieving families. The photo was posted onto a Facebook group dedicated to the fallen heroes, and it is unclear who took it or how they obtained the picture. Viewers are now split over whether the image pays tribute to the 'hotshot' crew who died on Sunday or if it is an invasion of privacy. The crew: 19 of the 20-man crew were killed in the wildfire on Friday and now a photo of their body bags is being circulated against the families' wishes
Final hours: Andrew Ashcraft sent this photo to his wife shortly before they got closer to the fire and were killed
According to The Arizona Republic, the picture had no caption or credit when it appeared on Facebook but that didn't stop it from gaining a massive fan base. It was shared by 1,000 people on their own profile pages. More...
'Nobody ran': Heartbreaking details of the final moments of 19 firefighters who died in Arizona as colleagues describe how leader was the 'calmest they've ever heard him'
The only facts about the photo are inferred: it was likely taken on Monday when a separate team of firefighters went to the scene to remove the bodies from the charred forest. Members of the recovery crew were the ones to drape the flags over each body bag as an honor guard watched on. Tribute: Residents built a memorial to the 19 firefighters in Prescott, Arizona
Darrell Willis, the head of the Prescott Fire Department's wildlife division, said that the photo was not approved by the department, but he did say that it was authentic. 'This is totally unauthorized. It's totally against anything we committed to,' he told The Arizona Republic. Though it was likely posted as a sign of respect for the men who gave up their lives in an effort to protect others, it was not interpreted that way by some Facebook users. Grieving: Juliann Ashcraft (left, the widow of Andrew Ashcraft) said that she thought the photos would be private but she doesn't know what can be done at this point
'This picture is very overwhelming. This is a picture that should be kept private. This does not show respect for these heroes or their families. I would hope this picture would be removed,' one person wrote. One of the widows, Juliann Ashcraft, had a similar reaction, saying that she knew they were going to take photos at the scene but thought they would be kept solely for the families. 'It makes me sad. But it doesn't make or break things in the end,' she said. The victims were honored at the town's Fourth of July parade and Vice President Joe Biden will attend the memorial service in Prescott on Tuesday.A map pieced together by investigators on Friday shows that the 19 highly trained Hotshots were just over a quarter of a mile northwest of the safety zone using chain saws, axes and other gear to build a line between the wildfire and the small town of Yarnell on Sunday. But the fire, which was northeast of the team, suddenly changed directions after the winds shifted nearly 180 degrees and cut off their access to the safety zone, a large ranch property. Sole survivor: Brendan McDonough (right) was the 20th member of the team and he was serving as the 'lookout' for the crew. He warned them that the winds were erratic and they were in danger, but it was too late
The circumstances of the firefighters' deaths have been known for days but Friday's confirmation offers the most detailed picture about their location and how close to safety they appeared to be.Officials said the 20th member of the Prescott-based Granite Mountain Hotshots, who served as a lookout for the Hotshot crew and whose exact location during the fire is unclear, was on a hilltop and warned the team that erratic winds had shifted the fire's direction and they were in danger.The crew had designated a ranch house and its surrounding cleared area as their safety zone, a spot they should be able to reach if things went bad. Unfortunately, the fire moved too fast for them to reach the ranch house, killing the 19 firefighters; the lookout, 21-year-old Brendan McDonough, was able to make it to safety.

Leader: Warren Jeffs, left, smiles during his 2007 trial for coercing the marriage and rape of a 14-year-old follower to her 19-year-old cousin in 2001
Convicted pedophile and imprisoned FLDS leader Warren Jeffs continues to wield enormous power over two notorious polygamist towns on the Arizona and Utah border he used to call home and that non-Mormon residents are spied on a new lawsuit alleges.The Department of Justice has filed a civil-rights motion against Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, which claims that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day, of which Jeffs is the president, runs both town's and not the elected leaders.As part of the lawsuit, fawning letters sent by Colorado City Mayor George M. Allred to Jeffs, 57, were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to God.While the allegations of theocratic rule in Hildale and Colorado City are not new, the two letter's the Department of Justice claim to be from Allred offer up the most clear-cut evidence to date of how the lines between civil and religious authority are blurred in the polygamous heart-land.Attorneys with the Department of Justice allege that members of the FLDS prevented a non-FLDS family in the twin-towns, which are collectively known as Short Creek, from getting water, engaged in questionable surveillance and kept some female members from 'escaping'. Secretive: A woman walks ouside a large wall surrounding the compound of Warren Jeff's the prophet leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) in Hildale, Utah
The first letter sent by Allred is dated June 6th, 2012 and is covered with the instruction 'Private' over it and was delivered to the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice near Palestine, Texas where Jeff's is serving a sentence of life in prison plus 20 years, to be served consecutively, and a $10,000 fine for the sexual assault of one 12 and one 15-year-old girl.Allred's letter begins with religious praise for Jeffs, 'As my spiritual leader I write to you today with joy and rejoicing in the Lord our God, even Jesus Christ.;'It is my firm belief that you have all rights, power and ability to get the very word of God for all who desire it.'

Allred's alleged letter welcomes Jeff's suggestions on who should fill the recently retired post of chief of police as if he is in direct conversation with God.'If the Lord had someone he would like to have in that position,' Allred writes according to the Salt Lake Tribune, 'it would be very helpful to get his sure word on who he desires to occupy that position.'The Department Of Justice lawsuit which is scheduled to go to trial on January 28th next year also includes the action of plaintiffs Ronald and Jinjer Cooke, a non-FLDS couple who believe they were actively discriminated against along religious lines. Colorado City, Arizona. Warren Jeffs, of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is still the leader of the polygamist Mormon sect living in Colorado City and Hildale, Utah
Court documents seen by the Salt Lake Tribune allege direct collusion between the church and the city which would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion.In a second letter sent by Allred to Jeffs, dated December 14th, the town's mayor asks for Jeff's opinion on changing the town's charter.Indeed, in a bizarre request, Allred seeks the opinion of the convicted sex offender on the prospect of minting the town's own currency.In a final aside, Allred seeks the approval of Jeff's in his handling of the twin city's civil disputes before going on to add, 'I am so grateful the Lord has chosen You (sic) as his mouthpiece to all the world.'The letter's were intercepted by Department of Justice attorneys working with the Cooke's own legal team. Surveillance: Ex-security members for the FLDS in Hildale and Colorado City allege that female members were stopped from 'escaping' the twin-towns
The worrying claims were matched by a declaration from Willie Jessop, who ran the FLDS security in the twin towns until he left the church in 2010 that he met with elected officials to 'convey to them the FLDS Church's view on the events' in the two twin-towns.And in another unsettling development Jessop's junior Patrick Barlow has provided a statement to the Justice Department that claims the FLDS security apparatus had access to and would use surveillance cameras in the two towns.'It is my understanding and belief that church elders and senior government officials knew of and authorized the linkage of the church surveillance system with the cities’ surveillance system," Barlow continues according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'We could also broadcast church messages over the local fiber-optic network.'Barlow also alleges that he spied on the Cookes for five years because they had become a 'threat to the church' and that the town's religious leaders wanted to prevent them from getting connected to the water supply and to drive them from the community.

Another serious allegation to emerge from the lawsuit is that church security would warn the community leaders when outside law enforcement were arriving and that they had instructions to stop female members of the FLDS from escaping.'I am aware that church security was also used to keep the FLDS ladies from getting away from the community,' Barlow states in court documents. However, Blake Hamilton, an attorney representing the towns is adamant that the letters will not be able to authenticate the letters because George M. Barlow, not George M. Allred, was the mayor of Colorado City at the time the letters were written.However, the Attorney General's office in Arizona claims that the same man used both names. Read more:

I don't understand how he is even allowed to speak or have any communication at all with anyone. Why isn't he in solitary, or in the general population with a shirt that says I fu*% little girls??

He looks kind of beat up and battered in this pic. Hope so. Surely, he must be in isolation or solitary in that prison or else the other prisoners would have croaked this fithy pevert by now.

So, it's terrible when a group you willingly participate in uses cameras to watch you. But when the unelected government implements cameras, it is acceptable. Sheeple!

Want to feel more feminine? Get yourself a tall partner, claim scientists (and they say you'll even feel more protected)Researchers found women were far more concerned than men about the height of their partnerRespondents said they wanted to wear heels and still be shorter than their partnerBy

The height of your partner really does matter in a relationship - for women at least, researchers have found.They say having a tall partner can make women feel more feminine and protected.They also found that men care far less about the height of their partner. The researchers say having a tall partner can make women feel more feminine and protected - but that men care far less about the height of their partner.
HOW THEY DID ITThe study, 'Does Height Matter? An Examination of Height Preferences in Romantic Coupling,' was conducted in two parts. Part one, which used data from the Yahoo! personal dating advertisements of 455 males (average height of 5 feet 8 inches and average age of 36 years) and 470 females (average height of 5 feet 4 inches and average age of 35 years) from throughout the U.S.It found that 13.5 percent of the men wanted to date only women shorter than they are.In contrast, nearly half of the women – 48.9 percent – wanted to date only men taller than they are.The second part of the study included 54 male (average height of 5 feet 9 inches) and 131 female volunteers (average height of 5 feet 4 inches) recruited from a U.S. university. The participants answered open-ended questions in an online survey. The findings were similar to the first part of the study: 37 percent of male respondents wanted to date only women shorter than they are, while 55 percent of female respondents wanted to date only men taller than they are.
The new research from Rice University and the University of North Texas, analysed dating profiles then asked participants to fill out an online survey.They say the results show that current theories that we look for similar people may not be true.'Evolutionary psychology theory argues that ‘similarity is overwhelmingly the rule in human mating,’' said Michael Emerson, the Allyn and Gladys Cline Professor of Sociology, co-director of Rice’s Kinder Institute for Urban Research and the study’s co-author.

'However, our study suggests that for physical features such as height, similarity is not the dominant rule, especially with females.'According to the data, the main reasons females gave for preferring a tall partner were for protection and femininity.'As the girl, I like to feel delicate and secure at the same time,' said a woman in the study who is 5 feet 3 inches tall. 'Something just feels weird in thinking about looking ‘down’ into my man’s eyes. 'There is also something to be said about being able to wear shoes with high heels and still being shorter. 'I also want to be able to hug him with my arms reaching up and around his neck.'Men were much less likely to say that height mattered, the study found, and those that did preferred shorter women, but not so short that it would cause problems with physical intimacy.'I like it when the body of your partner fits yours,' said another study participant, a male who is 5 feet 11 inches tall. 'It also makes it easier to kiss, hold hands and do other activities with your partner.' According to the data, the main reasons females gave for preferring a tall partner were for protection and femininity.

'And in a society that encourages men to be dominant and women to be submissive, having the image of tall men hovering over short women reinforces this value.' Share or comment on this article
