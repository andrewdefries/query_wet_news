Working closely with the SPLENDA team, Nadia has also created a range of figure-friendly, simple recipes. Switching from sugar to SPLENDA is an easy swap which can make a big difference - One teaspoon of SPLENDA (0.5g) contains 2 kcal compared to a spoonful of sugar (5g) which contains 20 kcal. This means that switching just one spoonful of sugar to SPLENDA every day could save over 6,500 calories in a year. Seems like a no brainer to us.

EXCLUSIVE: Jodie Foster 'to tell sons who their father is when they turn 21,' claims mother of the man who took the secret to his grave

Comment:
just because `randy's mum' thinks she knows something, or says she knows whatever doesn't make it fact. i'm pretty sure that if the boys have asked (and knowing boys/kids/teens etc they HAVE) then Jodie and Cydney (who are BOTH the boys parents) they will have been given an answer. just because the whole world doesn't know there is absolutely NO reason to think that the boys dont know. maybe they dont care. it is concevable that they are so happy with the parents they have that they dont have any interest in where the sperm came from. and as an aside....it isn't necessary for boys to have a close and involved male role model. as long as they are raised well and well loved they will be happy, well adjusted, normal high achieving men when grown. i should know, i have two fine and wonderful young men myself!

Stores 'ashamed' to sell religious cards... but obscene ones litter the High Street

Supermarkets have become ‘ashamed’ of selling Christmas cards with religious themes, Christian leaders said yesterday.They claimed a creeping ‘multicultural indoctrination’ had led to an aversion to Christianity, and that shops were worried about stocking cards that might offend other faiths.The rebuke to Britain’s big four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – came as a snapshot poll by the Daily Mail revealed the tiny number of religious cards on sale. One of the offensive cards (left) on sale in branches of Scribbler. Each costs around £2.50. One Store, a Tesco in Manchester, didn't have a single religious card (right) on sale
THE OBSCENE CARDSChristmas cards emblazoned with obscenities are on sale across Britain’s High Streets.One card showing a quintessential 50s family inside a wreath reads ‘Merry Christmas W*****’, while another depicts a pair of carol singers with the words ‘Merry F****** Christmas.’ A third says: ‘Merry Christmas You F****** F*****.’In total, dozens of the explicit cards are on sale in branches of Scribbler. Each costs around £2.50.Mike Judge, of the Christian Institute, said: ‘You don’t have to be a prude to see this is inappropriate at what is, after all, a special time for families.’Christian Concern’s Andrea Williams added: ‘Christmas is a time when we remember the birth of Jesus, a message of hope and peace for all people. It is a great shame if Scribbler use it to promote obscenities.’In the branch of the store in London’s Kensington High Street, the filth-ridden cards are part of a large display containing other family-orientated festive greetings.One shows Santa saying: ‘Shh! Nobody knows I’m gay’ while another shows him with a cigarette in hand and the words: ‘F*** off! I’m smoking.’ A third shows a cheery-looking Father Christmas with the phrase ‘YOU ain’t getting s***!’But Scribbler’s managing director John Procter described the cards as having a ‘schoolboy’ sense of humour. ‘It’s our company policy not to use expletives or such words in a gratuitous way. If we think it makes a joke then we will use one,’ he said.‘We do group all of these rather rude cards together and keep them at eye level so children can’t see them.‘I understand why some people might find them offensive. But they really are our best sellers and in reality we get very few complaints.’
Of 6,576 cards sold individually, just 36 – 0.5 per cent – featured scenes such as Jesus in a manger or angels.Multi-packs
fared little better, with only 5 per cent of 1,337 on sale at the stores visited containing at least one card that reflected the season’s
Christian message.One store, a Tesco in Manchester, didn’t have a single religious card on sale. Many others had just one or two.The
worst offender overall was Asda, which had just four Christian cards out of 2,638 sold individually across all the stores visited – 0.15 per cent. More...
The great Christmas getaway begins as shops open until midnght for the busiest days of the year... and 18million cars are set to hit the road
Forget the Three Wise Men... DOZENS flocked to see Jesus, ancient document reveals
It also had the lowest proportion among multi-packs, with 13 out of 427, or 3 per cent. Stephen Green, national director of Christian Voice, said: ‘I can’t believe this is being led by consumer demand.'I believe there is anti-Christian prejudice in the buying departments involved.‘There’s too much of this multicultural indoctrination and too much of an idea that if they put out Christian cards they will alienate or discriminate against or offend other faiths.‘There’s a kind of militant atheism and nasty secularism at work in this country which is completely opposed to Christianity.’Dr Don Horrocks, of the Evangelical Alliance, said supermarkets were ‘helping to kill off the Christian theme at Christmas’.‘There appears to be an aversion in society to Christianity being public,’ he said.‘Supermarkets appear to be ashamed to put cards on shelves because there is a perception it is dodgy.'Half a per cent of cards with religious themes when 70 per cent of people describe themselves as Christian shows this is totally out of kilter with the country.’The Bishop of Colchester, the Right Reverend Christopher Morgan, said Christmas church services were among the most popular of the year.He added: ‘It is disappointing that so few of our Christmas cards now portray symbols and scenes at the heart of the Christmas story.’ In total, dozens of the explicit cards (left) are on sale in branches of Scribbler. The company's managing director John Procter described them as having a 'schoolboy' sense of humour
The comments follow the Pope’s criticism of ‘aggressive secularism’ in Britain during his visit last year. And last week Prime Minister David Cameron called on the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, to speak up for Christianity.The Mail visited stores owned by the four biggest supermarket chains in seven areas – Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Colchester and Witham, London, Manchester and Newcastle-upon-Tyne.Last year 0.2 per cent of cards sold individually and 3.5 per cent available in multi-packs depicted religious scenes. 'We do group all of these rather rude cards together and keep them at eye level so children can't see them,' said Procter An Asda spokesman said: ‘We sell a variety of cards that meet the demand of our customers.’Tesco said: ‘Our religious Christmas card range has increased for the second year running.’ Sainsbury’s also said that what appeared on shelves was based on customer demand, adding: ‘It is wrong to suggest we are ignoring religious themes at Christmas.’And Morrisons said its range of religious cards included a multi-pack aimed at children that included the Nativity scene.

Steven Gerrard caused a stir when he returned to his old school for a picture to celebrate his 100th cap and the feel-good factor has continued following the release of the image.Huyton-With-Roby Church of England Primary School has been abuzz all day and deputy head teacher Kath Whitehouse and spoken about the excitement and impact Gerrard’s visit has had on starry-eyed pupils. Impact: The deputy head explained how excited everyone got when Steven Gerrard visited his old primary school, Huyton-and-Roby, Church of England
‘It has been the talk of the school,’ she said. ‘The kids were bringing in copies of the picture all morning and everyone thinks it is wonderful. It was lovely to be involved in. ‘We had done a lucky dip to see which children would be involved, so there was a lot of excitement but when Steven actually turned up on the morning, it reached fever pitch.‘The whole experience has just created a lovely atmosphere around the school, it has brought people together and Steven could not have been any more helpful. He was so lovely with the children. He might be a superstar but he is so down to earth.’The Liverpool and England captain was genuinely overwhelmed by the response he received and he took time to sign autographs, pose for pictures and chat with as many children as possible after the formalities of the photoshoot had been concluded. Mrs Whitehouse described him as an inspiration.‘We have got a football team that is doing quite well at the minute,’ she said. ‘Steven had a quick picture taken with them before he left and as he had got the kit for them. He is a role model for them, as he is for everyone here.‘Our school is in a deprived area and there are low aspirations and expectations for our children, so to see Steven back in amongst everyone, was really inspirational. He knows the community, he knows the children and they know him.' 'Role Model': Gerrard, with England manager Roy Hodgson (left), was described as such by the deputy head
