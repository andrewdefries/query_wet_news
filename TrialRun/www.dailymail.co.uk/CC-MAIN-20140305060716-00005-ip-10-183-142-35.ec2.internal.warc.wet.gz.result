The bitter final words of Malcolm McLaren: How punk king cut son out of will (and left everything to his girlfriend instead)

Comment:
That sentence may have had to be inserted for legal reasons and not as a snub to the son. The son should understand the practicalities of distributing (what to him is a) relatively minor sum of money. However there are rich relatives (who one has not seen for years) who will turn up at the end and demand "their inheritance" from even the most insignificant amounts of money or possessions when a partner has tofind a new way forward in life. More likely this is about a savvy business man (the son) getting some more publicity for himself & his companies. Your email address:
