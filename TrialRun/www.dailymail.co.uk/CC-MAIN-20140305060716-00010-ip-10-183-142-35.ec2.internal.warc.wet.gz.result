slowly does it... bit by bit the world will legalize cannabis. 40grams is Â£400 worth round here.. probably roll 20 pure doobies. none of that nasty tobacco. Blatently sell brownies too. I wonder if they'll use the rest of the plant for clothing and paper.. even bio oil.. It was only made illegal in the first place because of the cotton trade... As far as Smoking and driving goes the police will find an instant test and so they should.. Travel by Floating only. Who's holidaying here?? Their local economy will boom!

Does Taylor have a beer in that picture?! I knew she drinks sometimes, but I think that's the first picture I've ever seen of her with a drink. Your email address:
