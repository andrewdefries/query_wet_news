Comment:
really you idiot? instead of praying, hows about getting his butt institutionalized? That's the problem with people today, their kids are idiot loud mouth entitlement fools and the parents don't do anything but "pray". Give me a break. it's your kid, take a stand. - Don't tell me you could not have done anything. My parents would have had me carted off before I could say boo if I was pulling any of this . selfish weak people.
