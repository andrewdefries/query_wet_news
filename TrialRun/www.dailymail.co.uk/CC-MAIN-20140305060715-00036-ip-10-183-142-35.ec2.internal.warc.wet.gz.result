Ask the doctor: Should I try this new £15 heartburn cure?

For many years I’ve suffered from acid reflux, which triggers painful heartburn. My GP prescribed Nexium, which is meant to prevent acid being released, but this has had limited success. I recently received a junk email from the U.S. recommending a ‘natural’ cure which costs around £15. This may be a waste of money, however my problem is gradually getting worse and I am keen to give anything a try. Could you advise?
David Rabone, by email Matters of the heart: Don't use a natural remedy to cure heart burn
How very frustrating for you. But let me first reassure you that your situation isn’t unique and that there are other options available.At least one in ten patients with your condition does not respond to the powerful acid-suppressing medicine Nexium. But before describing why this occurs, and offering some suggestions that might help, I want to explain the nature of the condition.Gastro-oesophageal reflux — often called acid reflux — is thought to be caused by a weakness in the valve between the oesophagus (also called the gullet) and the stomach. The valve is meant to prevent the contents of the stomach splashing up the gullet, but in some people it does not seal properly, and the acidic contents slosh back, causing irritation and pain. Some people suffer to such a degree that the acid gets into the throat, causing hoarseness and a sore throat or a cough.Furthermore, some people develop chemical burns on the lining of the gullet — also known as an ulcer. While this does heal, if damage recurs over a long period, it can cause scarring and the gullet may narrow. This can trigger further pain or a sense of blockage on swallowing. In extreme cases, surgery may be necessary to widen the gullet.In some cases, this damage can also cause normal cells that line the lower part of the gullet to be replaced by ones that have a small chance of transforming into cancer cells. The condition is called Barrett’s oesophagus and is diagnosed with endoscopy — a flexible tube about the diameter of a pencil is passed through the mouth, under local anaesthetic or mild sedation, and used to inspect the gullet and take a tissue sample. Those diagnosed with Barrett’s are advised to have their gullet lining checked by endoscopy every two or three years.CONTACT DR SCURRTo contact Dr Scurr with a health query, write to him at Good Health Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk — including contact details.Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence.His replies cannot apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context. Always consult your own GP with any health worries.
These complications make effective treatment of heartburn essential. One possible reason for the failure of
your treatment is if the Nexium is not being taken 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before the evening meal: the drug must be fully
absorbed to ensure regular acid suppression. It could also be that the burning discomfort you’re experiencing is not due just to acid reflux, but part of a bigger picture of irritable bowel syndrome. This is called ‘functional heartburn’.
Finally, there is non-acid reflux and bile acid reflux — different problems with similar symptoms. In non-acid
reflux, the gullet is overly sensitive to chemicals in food, and becomes sore and irritated when stomach contents reflux. In the second condition, bile (which is released by the liver and helps digest fats) backflows from the intestine into the stomach and even up into the gullet, causing pain.
As for the ‘natural remedy’ you have been recommended, there is no such thing, and what is on offer here is quackery.
Instead, further medical investigations are needed. Endoscopy may be required, as well as 24‑hour
acidity and pressure monitoring. This would involve a thin catheter or capsule inserted through your nostril and into your gullet. You then go about your normal business
of eating, sleeping and working while the device collects information that is then analysed once the catheter or capsule is removed.
However, the first step is requesting referral to a specialist. Once this is achieved, you will be on the road
to receiving a firm diagnosis. The best of luck.Around 18 months ago I started suffering numbness and pins and needles in my hands at night. Usually the outer parts of my hands — the little fingers and ring fingers — are affected. The feeling wakes me in the night, but if I shake my hands and rub them, it disappears. I do not sleep on my side, so I do not think that the cause is pressure.Mrs Paula Taiano, Sittingbourne, Kent
This can be a frightening syndrome. Often patients with these symptoms come to me fearing they have a circulatory problem or a neurological illness such as a brain tumour or multiple sclerosis.But please be assured that what you have is not serious, and is called nerve compression syndrome. This occurs when nerves get pinched — in your case, I’d suggest it’s the elbow that’s affected. More from Martin Scurr...

The ulnar nerve, which runs from the shoulder down to the little finger, tracks around the back of the elbow and the funny bone. It supplies the little and ring fingers, part of the middle finger and the border of the hand on that side. It can be irritated or squeezed in the channel where it passes around the elbow, and tingling and numbness will be the consequence. This squeezing is more likely to happen when the channel is tight and narrow, which occurs when you sleep with your elbows bent. When you wake, straighten your arms and shake your hands and the alarming sensation will melt away. However, the symptoms might also be partially caused by compression of a nerve at the wrist joint, which supplies the thumb, index and part of the middle finger, as well as much of the palm. The source of your trouble can be diagnosed using a nerve conduction study in which tiny electrical impulses are passed through electrodes stuck on to the hand. The test, which takes 15 minutes to an hour, can detect which nerve is affected. In severe cases the trapped nerve can be relieved with an operation, but it is rarely necessary. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, patients often find it preferable to tolerate and live with the symptoms.By the way... Don't put up with long waiting listsJust after I qualified as a doctor, my anaesthetist father Dr Cyril Scurr — who very sadly passed away at the beginning of this month at the venerable age of 92 — joined the Health Services Board, a quango charged with arbitrating the removal of private, or ‘pay’, beds from hospitals in the NHS. Don't be patient: Being on a long waiting list for treatment can be costly for your health (posed by models)
The then Labour government had pledged to tackle the shortage in NHS beds by closing pay beds — effectively pushing those who’d previously been private patients into NHS beds. The problem with this policy was that pay beds weren’t the source of the shortages. The real cause, as my father endlessly hammered home, was that healthcare was being silently rationed via the waiting list. The NHS had not long passed its 21st birthday, and there was a dawning realisation that the cake was of limited size, with only so much to go round. Subtle strategies were evolving to make sure that somehow people were not over-claiming on the bounty of free healthcare, and so the waiting list was born.All too soon the electorate found this unacceptable. As medicine has become more and more expensive with advancing technologies, the pressure has become ever greater to introduce better-disguised mechanisms of rationing.Last week, it was reported that a patient in Kent with acute gallbladder infection due to gallstones (cholecystitis) wasn’t being given surgery to remove the diseased organ as they should have been. (Once gallstones start to play up, they continue to do so, with recurrent infections or pain due to gallstone colic.)Yet in Kent the rule now is that you may not be referred until you have had at least two episodes of cholecystitis. Is this fair? No. Is this safe? Certainly not. But it’s not just Kent that is making these subtle rationing decisions. More than 90 per cent of primary care trusts impose limits on referrals for procedures they deem ‘non-urgent’. However, urgency is entirely a matter of opinion. Even my father’s fellow quango member, the ‘idealistic socialist’ Ray Buckton, from the trade union ASLEF, had to have treatment in the private sector (paid for by the late Robert Maxwell) when rationing meant he couldn’t get what he wanted on the NHS. We all have our weaknesses and sometimes cannot practise what we preach. Free healthcare at the point of delivery is a splendid aim when the delivery is not rationed by cunning administrators.It can take weeks to get over an attack of gallbladder infection, and it is a third-world level of care to expect someone to go through it all twice to earn the right to an operation that will cure them. So when you hear about rationing and poor service, shout about it from the rooftops and write to your MP. Share or comment on this article

'I don't ever want to humiliate somebody': Keith Urban explains his gentle approach on American Idol

He is the softer judge out of the four stars on the American Idol panel.And Keith Urban insists there is a reason behind his decision to be kind to budding stars on the TV talent show.The country singer admits that despite his fellow judges being at the top of their field, sometimes they just can’t be empathetic to the contestants on the programme, not having been in their shoes. Soft judge: Country musician Keith Urban has explained why he is easy on some American Idol contestants
He told People magazine: ‘It is not easy for us a lot of the time because we are just coming from a different place. More...

Mariah Carey whizzes home to read twins a bedtime story after American Idol duties... and is still camera-ready in glamorous dress
'That was your worst performance!' Lazaro Arbos sobs onstage as the judges turn against him on American Idol
‘We're artists talking to a young artist on camera in front of millions of people, trying to give constructive criticism in a way that doesn't humiliate them. I don't ever want to humiliate somebody.’The show’s mentor Jimmy Iovine recently commented that the panelists need to be tougher and despite Keith agreeing, she insists it’s more difficult when you’re in the position to crush an artist’s dream. Considerate: The 45-year-old Australian won't lay into a fragile singer after their performance
But the country superstar says being an artist critiquing artists is harder than it looks. The man who sits in front of a live studio audience with Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey and Randy Jackson, said: ‘He is right,’ however, ‘Sometimes they are in a particularly fragile state.’The 45-year-old explained that there are times when extensive commenting could be wasted on a singer and there are moments when his words could cause a vocalist to crumble. Fellow experts: Keith sits on the panel with Nicki Minaj, Randy Jackson and Mariah Carey
Instead he only speaks his truest when he feels the person in question can handle the feedback.Keith went on: ‘You can just see it. They are not ready for [criticism] to be delivered to them and I am going to defer in that situation. Someone else, it might look like they are listening ... ‘Then let's talk about why [the performance] wasn't so good and they're receptive to that. I am trying to find balance always.’Although he took part in in televised singing competitions as a youngster in Australia, he confessed that American Idol is a rather brutal process.The industry professional admitted that even he may not be able to deal with the stages that this year’s bunch have to go through. Need to be tougher: Keith agrees that judges should critique like InterScope Records Chairman Jimmy Iovine said
Keith added: ‘The very first thing you are going to do on this show is walk into a room, see the four of us, and have to sing with no band, no microphone, no nothing. No other show does that. That has got to be tough. I don't know that I could do it.’ Despite the hype of everything happening on the programme, Keith can’t help but get excited by the suspense of it all.He emphasised that even the faces of the Season 12 show don’t know what the results will be in advance.Keith highlighted: ‘I don’t know who is staying. I don’t know how the voting works out. I didn’t know who the top 10 were until they were chosen by America when they read it out in the moment. I prefer it like that. I love the raw energy of it all.’ Busy man: The father of two daughters with actress Nicole Kidman has a tour coming up
The husband of actress Nicole Kidman is keeping very busy around his new gig on primetime TV and has just added additional cities to this summer's 2013 Light the Fuse Tour. He and Vince Gill are hosting their fourth annual fundraising benefit concert for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville on April 16 – and he is busy looking after his daughters Sunday Rose, two, and Faith, two. He told the publication: ‘The kids got to play with their friends [in Nashville] they hadn't seen in a while and that's fun. My wife is in London shooting a film so we've been doing a lot of travel between L.A., London and Nashville in the last couple of months.’
