Comment:
- Nick , Virginia, 15/5/2013 22:30...... I agree and if you pay close attention all these duets, guest appearances, songs included in movies, magazine covers and glowing reviews all have common denominators. Some people have the mistaken impression that their "idols" have the country's best interest in mind when all it is a club of liberal self admirers getting rich off them and burying our country in debt and loss of personal freedoms. People need to vote with their wallet and quit giving what little money they have left to these fools. Your email address:

The tall and leggy model is not one to ditch her heels, even if her new squeeze isn't up to her level.George Clooney's former arm candy Elisabetta Canalis is moving on as she's been spotted out and about in Los Angeles with her new, albeit shorter, man - Italian producer Daniele DiLorenzo.The loved-up pair shared a cosy date night on Thursday as they took in a night at the theatre. Quite the pair: Elisabetta Canalis stands well above her new boyfriend, Italian producer Daniele Di Lorenzo as they go to the theatre in Los Angeles on Thursday
The brunette looked stunning in a simple and sleek black mini dress with a minor slit that showed off her famous pins.The 34-year-old showed off one of her many tattoos on her right foot in a pair of platform grey stilettos that placed her miles above her new love.Inside, the couple sat beside one another and kept close throughout the entire show. Loved up: The couple stayed close during the show
Powder break: Elisabetta probably thought nobody was watching as she attempted to fix her make-up
Elisabetta and the director, who is known in his home country for his a taste for tall Italian actresses, were first spotted together back in December when they vacationed in Miami.They spent much of their winter holidays together and were photographed laughing together and getting close in the Floridian city.According to reports, the two have known each other for years and were introduced through mutual friends. Just his type: Daniele is notorious in Italy for dating tall female celebrities
And on Friday the Italian beauty, who now calls Los Angeles home, shared some snaps from her sunny beach excursion in Malibu.Elisabetta appeared solo in the shots, which showed the lingerie model frolicking in the shallow water as well as lounging on a wooden stairwell.In another photograph the former Dancing With The Stars hopeful is seen jumping in the air and clutching her bikini as well as trying to attempt a handstand as the waves crash around her. Malibu maiden: The Italian beauty shared pictures on her Instagram of herself enjoying a beach day in Malibu
Taking the leap: Elisabetta showed off some of her fitness skills on the sand
Last weekend Elisabetta attended the Oscars as a presenter for E!But instead of backing her ex-boyfriend George Clooney's film Argo to win Best Picture, Elisabetta revealed that she wanted Quentin Tarantino's film Django Unchained to scoop the coveted award.Argo went on to win in three categories: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. Sitting around: The model, who became famous for dating George Clooney, now calls Los Angeles her home
Ready to roll: In one of the photographs Elisabetta showed off her fondness for tattoos
Back when they split up in 2011, George and Elisabetta released a joint statement saying the split was 'very difficult and very personal.'Since then, George has moved on very nicely with Stacy Keibler, 33, who was his date at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday to watch him accept the award with director Ben Affleck.Elisabetta is known for her varied taste in men, from distinguished A-lister Clooney and hunky True Blood actor Mehcad Brooks to outrageous stuntman Steve O. Getting close: Elisabetta shared a snap of the two at dinner together with friends
Spotted: Daniele peeks from behind the crowd as Elisabetta is photographed outside a Pre-Oscar Party on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood on Sunday Share or comment on this article
