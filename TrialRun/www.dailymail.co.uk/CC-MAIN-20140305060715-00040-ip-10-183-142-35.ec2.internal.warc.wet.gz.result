Very sad. Hopefully the time apart will bring them back together. My husband and I did just that... Children are hard on a marriage. Especially a new one. Your email address:

Dawn Approach gives a winning lift to Sheik Mohammed who watches first race since drugs scandal

The brilliant victory of Dawn Approach in the Qipco 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket Saturday delivered a timely burst of oxygen to the fortunes of Godolphin.With one of its stables in lockdown following a drugs scandal and the other becalmed, Godolphin’s founder, Sheik Mohammed, was in urgent need of good news.It was delivered in the handsome shape of Dawn Approach, who claimed a stunning success which saw him immediately promoted to favourite for the Derby on June 1. Back in town: Sheik Mohammed surrounded by his security as he prepares to watch Dawn Approach
Angry: Sheik Mohammed has condemned the trainer who has admitted to drugging the horses
Sheik swerves questions from Balding Sheik Mohammed abruptly cut short an interview with Channel 4’s Clare Balding in the aftermath of Dawn Approach’s handsome victory at Newmarket.Balding managed only three questions before the ruler of Dubai turned on his heel and stalked off.She will be hoping for better luck when she interviews riders at Badminton today.Had the Sheik, she wondered, considered not turning up at Newmarket to face the music after the shame of Mahmood Al Zarooni’s drugs ban.‘I come from the Arabian peninsula and we face challenges every day,’ he replied.Balding then quickened the pace by asking if he was happy with the BHA’s handling of the Al Zarooni inquiry.‘That is up to them,’ he said with a dismissive wave, before wheeling round in military fashion and rejoining his large entourage surrounding Dawn Approach. Some had wondered if the Sheik would appear at Newmarket after the crushing embarrassment of seeing his trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni banned for eight years for administering illegal steroids to 15 horses. The Sheik’s rage at the time was said to be of such volcanic proportions that it briefly seemed the future of his vast army of horses in Newmarket might be in question.But his presence at the course surely offered compelling evidence that he is not about to withdraw to Dubai.At times like this it is sometimes best for the horse to do the talking. Dawn Approach duly produced a command performance which will live long in the memory. He is trained by Jim Bolger in the hills of County Carlow and the Irishman had the good sense to retain 49 per cent of the horse when he sold him to the Sheik last summer.Whatever the price, Dawn Approach looked
every inch a bargain as he bounded eagerly up the Newmarket hill five lengths ahead of 150-1 shot Glory Awaits, with Van Der Neer a creditable
third. The race turned out to be little more than a lap of honour once the heavily-backed second favourite Toronado dropped out tamely in the closing stages. Easy: Dawn Approach streaked clear in the end to earn sheik Mohammed the victory
Bolger said he would hold talks with Sheik Mohammed before deciding on a tilt at the Derby. Although the trainer has always harboured doubts about the colt staying 12 furlongs, he said: ‘If the Sheik wants him to go, I’d be happy to go along with that.’Jockey Kevin Manning said: ‘It helps that he has such a fantastic temperament. But none of us will know if he stays a mile-and-a-half until he tries it.’ Focused: Sheik Mohammed (second left) says that he is up for the challenge of redeeming his reputation
