Yeah... blasted TYesco sold out of the stuff the day before I was going to take my kids to the cinema!!!
the price in the cinema takes the MICK!
If they reduced their prices... people would buy more!
Can't the idiots see... that bumping up the prices means less customers!!!???
Unless you get dumb lovestruck idiots who don't care how much theiy're spending???

Sick of these articles asking the reader to 'congratulate' some rich celeb for spending time with their own kids, like they're donating blood plasma to blind orphan aids homeless babies. It's not a task worthy of sainthood. Your email address:

Model Carmen Carrera leaves little to the imagination as she wears just a TINY strip of lace over her cleavage at The Blonds NYFW party

Comment:
I don't know why they must point out that she was born with male organs? Can't she just be a model? Most native tribes in Canada have a place for those who" share both sexes" or don't fit the norm. They are respected and consulted for their wisdom. Christianity has tried to wipe out that most sincere form of acceptance and understanding but thank god they failed...mostly. I respect this about our native people. A human being is a living being just like all life. Your email address:
