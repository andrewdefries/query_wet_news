My heart goes out to Kate. When your son or daughter take their own lives a parent will never stop blaming themselves for it and to do this on New Year's Eve will ruin any further celebrations she has at this time of year. RIP

I was worried about Lancaster's appointment in the beginning but, as with many appointments to important positions, some people grow into them and some simply do not. Lancaster is certainly growing . For many years now we've had two steps forward and one backward but at last the English team is growing and going forward. They may lose from time to time but there is a solid foundation in place based on respect, discipline and enthusiasm. Wonderful to see young players and new players out there playing rugby; not some dour, attritional version of the game we love. Of course matches will be hard, and hard-fought but we now have the depth of personnel starting with the front row all the way to fullback to build a world beating tea. Sad that Martin Johnson didn't have the ability to grow in the position and build on his vast experience, but thank heavens we are where we are.

Comment:
Diego Maradona was a gifted player but he just is not a manager.
Although all players respect and admire him, sucsesful management is about many things that do not involve ball control, vision, balance , pace and a great touch.
Perhaps, Diego is just does not know how to diminish, to let his players flourish.

I hears some one here mention U.K gets only one snow day in a year, as a justification NOT to have winter tires. So does it justify Winter tires now that its a rather frequent occurances now in U.K, like rest of Europe. Just a question. I bet if you have driven a proper winter tires on snow and ice, you will never leave home without one in Winter ever. Your email address:

Oh he is moaning about being jeered at the British GP? But again, he was booed on the podium at the Canadian GP. What is he whinging on about. I tell you what I am getting bored with f1, he is winning yet whinging. If I do not see any substantial updates on the McLaren during P1 and P2 Monza free practice then I am refusing to watch the rest of this season. Surely people switching off would hurt Vettel more than a few people booing him.- Lee , London England, 05/9/2013 13:34------------- You DO NOT want to be at the same level of Canadian fans, they even boo national Anthems. Despicable lot and have no respect for anything. Your email address:
