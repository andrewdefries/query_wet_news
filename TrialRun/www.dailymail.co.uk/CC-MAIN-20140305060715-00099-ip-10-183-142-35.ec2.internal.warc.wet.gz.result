Hands off the snooze button! Wake up tired - and need an hour to feel human? Here's how to bounce out of bed

We all need a little help to wake up in the morning — for some it’s the offensive ‘bleep bleep’ of an alarm clock, for others a mug of black coffee or the unmistakable sound of Radio 4’s John Humphrys tearing apart a hapless politician. It is estimated that 62 per cent of Britons need between 15 minutes and an hour after waking before they feel human. But why is this? Here, with the help of leading sleep experts, we reveal why you may be finding it so hard to wake up — and the simple changes that can make your mornings less hellish. If you set your alarm for the same time every day - even weekends and holidays - in a matter of weeks your body will accurately be able to tell the time
WHY YOU’RE HIDING UNDER THE DUVETIf you woke up this morning feeling groggy, dozy and desperate for another hour of sleep, there are two things going wrong, explains independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley. ‘First, you’re probably sleep deprived — you haven’t had the right amount for you individually — but also, your body’s natural rhythm is out of synch.‘The body loves rhythm and predictability. Most tiredness happens because we are very bad at sticking to regular bedtimes — going to bed and getting up at the same time every day.’ More...

Is Audrey Hepburn the key to stopping the obesity epidemic?
The body has an extremely accurate natural clock, he adds — and in the hour before waking it starts preparing. ‘It’s a bit like when you turn on the computer and it clicks and whirs before the screen comes on,’ he says. ‘Sleep becomes lighter, body temperature starts rising, and hormones are released such as cortisol, the stress hormone, which gives you energy and “get up and go”.‘But if your body doesn’t have rhythm, it doesn’t know when you’re waking up and so it doesn’t prepare like this. The alarm goes off and your body’s not ready, and that’s why you feel so exhausted.’But, he adds, it’s easy to re-jig your bodyclock. ‘If you set your alarm for the same time every day — even weekends and holidays — in a matter of weeks your body will accurately be able to tell the time.‘That’s why you sometimes wake up five minutes before your alarm. Your body knows you don’t like the sound of your alarm and so it does the job for you.’Studies show that a surprising one in five of us wakes up relying on our natural bodyclock. Sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley says it's far better to set your alarm for when you have to get up
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON’T DROP OFF AGAINMany people swear by hitting the snooze button when the alarm goes off in the morning — giving them an extra ten or 20 minutes to recoup sleep before they really have to get up. But experts say this is the worst thing you can do.It all goes back to the body’s need for a special pre-waking hour, when it prepares for morning.‘During its preparation hour, sleep gets lighter, so that it’s easier for you to wake up,’ says Dr Stanley. ‘If you hit the snooze button you may go back into deep sleep and you’re not supposed to wake from deep sleep — you’re supposed to pass to the lighter preparation stage first, then open your eyes. So snoozing creates a huge shock to the body and it makes you feel awful.‘If you wake up feeling worse, you’ll only be tempted to hit snooze again and then you’re in for a vicious cycle.’Dr Stanley says it’s far better just to set your alarm for when you have to get up.‘Ideally, as soon as you can bear it, pull back the curtains and let the sunlight into the room. It kick-starts your internal clock and tells the body it’s daytime.’WAKING UP CAN BE MURDERThe change from being asleep to being awake is a stressful transition for the body, says Leon Kreitzman, author of the book Seasons Of Life. ‘When you’re asleep at night, all sorts of things are happening — your body temperature starts to fall, for example, and your blood pressure goes down.‘When you get up, you stand upright and you’re much more active, so your heart, and everything else, just has to work that little bit harder. ‘It takes time for your body to get ready for that change.’ This explains why most heart attacks happen in the morning, he adds. ‘The theory is that if you’re already at risk, and have a bit of plaque in your arteries, the rise in blood pressure from waking up causes the attack.’ Soak up the sunlight If you're having problems sleeping, or problems getting out of bed in the morning, it's vital to make sure you get plenty of time outdoorsHumans are diurnal animals — we sleep at night and are active during the day — and we all have a natural Circadian rhythm that controls when we feel sleepy and when we feel active. Crucially, this Circadian rhythm is set by sunrise and sunset.Light receptors in the eye send messages to the brain and set our bodyclock, explains Russell Foster, professor of neuroscience at Oxford University. ‘Interestingly, only a small amount of those cells are involved in vision. That’s why blind people are still affected by their bodyclocks and feel tired at the same time as everyone else.’So if you’re having problems sleeping, or problems getting out of bed in the morning, it’s vital to make sure you get plenty of time outdoors.‘When you look at the sun, for your body it’s like looking at Big Ben and checking the time — a process called entrainment, where your bodyclock synchronises with the local time,’ adds Kreitzman.This explains why you can recover from jetlag — when you get to your destination, spending time outside in the sunlight resets your bodyclock to the time in that country. Kreitzman says most Britons’ sleep problems can be explained by our growing indoor lifestyle, particularly during winter months when many people wake up in the dark, go to work on the Tube, sit in an office all day then travel back by night — getting no sunlight at all.And if you’ve wondered why older people often say they need less sleep, Kreitzman believes it’s also down to sunlight.‘Older people tend to wake up earlier,’ he says. ‘One of the reasons is that they don’t get outside as much as other groups.’To keep a good rhythm, he says, you should be outside in the daylight for at least one or two hours each day. Blue light — light from a blue sky on a clear day — is thought to be particularly beneficial. It is believed that humans have evolved this way because the sky is bluest at dawn and at dusk, which are the most crucial times for setting our bodyclocks. ARE YOU GRUMPY? BLAME YOUR GENESAround 10 per cent of us are natural ‘larks’, who go to bed early and wake up early — and another 10 per cent are ‘owls’, who don’t feel tired till late at night and love to snooze in the morning. The rest of us are somewhere in between.‘Some people just aren’t morning people,’ says Dr Stanley. ‘They experience something called sleep inertia — that feeling of slowness, grumpiness, lack of get-up-and-go — for anything up to two hours after waking up.‘Equally, others spring out of bed — I’m one of them. Both these have a genetic basis and we see these characteristics running in families.’It’s thought there are around 12 genes linked to the body’s internal 24-hour clock. These work together to create proteins and trigger hormones that make us sleepy during the night and alert during the day. ‘In larks these processes are slightly altered and their clock runs slightly fast,’ explains Professor Foster. ‘So they start feeling sleepy earlier in the evening than others. The owl’s body clock, on the other hand, is running a bit slow.’THE TROUBLE WITH TEENAGERSWhy do teenagers love criminally long lie-ins? They’re not lazy — they really do need more sleep than the rest of us, says Kreitzman, to cope with the many hormonal, physical and emotional changes their bodies are going through. Professor Foster adds that sex hormomes such as testosterone and progesterone, which rise during puberty, can interact with the bodyclock, meaning teenagers naturally wake up later.In fact, lie-ins could boost your teenage child’s academic performance. Last week Professor Foster received the results of a study he carried out with a secondary school in North Tyneside in which the headteacher changed the school day to start at 10am so the pupils could have more of a lie-in. ‘It’s well known that sleep duration affects memory, and this year the school has had a dramatic improvement in its GCSE results,’ he adds.For more information visit thesleepconsultancy.com.

So the advice to get our body clock reset and get the best sleep is to 1) Open the curtains and let the sunlight stream in. 2) Spend time outdoors in the sunlight to reset the body clock. 3) Blue light from a clear blue sky is best. So, basically, us Britons are stuffed then.

I hate how everyone who isn't a 'morning' person is looked on as lazy. I don't particularly need any more sleep than anyone else, I'd just rather go to bed at 1am and not wake up til 9 or 10am! 14

This is why I think it's ridiculous and unnecessary for work to begin at 8am. I refuse to miss out on socializing at the weekend just so I can wake up at 6:30am on Saturday and Sunday too. It's bad enough Monday-Friday!

I am about to be forced to work internal rotation and am dreading it, it is not right to expect a person to leave off at 21.30 and be back at 7.00 the next morning, I know I will end up with migrane's. due to lack of sleep.

That sounds like heaven for many of us working in the catering industry! Try finishing past midnight and then have to be back for breakfast at 5 or 6 in the morning.

My husband gets up at 430 am for work & goes to bed at 9pm. He does that ever day even on weekends & vacations to keep his "internal clock" set. Imagine someone getting up at 430 am in a hotel room with children. It makes me want to kill him :) I'd rather be sleep deprived then let me bedtime/wake time rule my life.

A massive fire engulfed the arrivals hall at Kenya's main international airport today, forcing the closure of East Africa's largest hub and the re-routing of all inbound flights.Dark black smoke was visible across much of Nairobi as emergency teams battled the blaze at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The blaze - which broke out on the 15th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Nairobi and neighbouring Dar es Salaam, Tanzania - raged for
four hours before being contained.Scroll down for video Inferno: Black smoke billows from the international arrival unit of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport

immigration and retrieve their luggage. On the scene of massive blaze at Nairobi airport

Kenya Airports Authority said the airport had been closed until further notice so emergency teams could battle the fire.
While there were no immediate signs that terrorism played any role in the fire, Kenya's anti-terror police chief, Boniface Mwaniki, said he wanted to wait for the fire to be put out so he could inspect the scene before making any judgment.
Michael Kamau, the cabinet secretary for transport and infrastructure, said the fire began at 5am in the immigration section of the arrivals hall. He said no injuries had been reported. Inbound flights were diverted to the coastal city of Mombasa, he said.
The Kenyan capital's airport is the busiest airport in East Africa and its closure will affect flights throughout the region. Flames: Passengers said they heard as explosions believed to be gas canisters on fire at the airport
Emergency: Stranded passengers said they were surprised the airport was not closed sooner as the fire spread
Engulfed: The blaze spread through the arrivals hall of the international airport on Wednesday morning
A British passenger, Martyn Collbeck,
said he was surprised that the airport was not shut down sooner so emergency vehicles could respond. 'When I arrived there were one or two
fire engines parked outside the international arrivals. It spread very fast,' said Mr Collbeck, who had been scheduled to fly to London on an early morning KLM flight.
'There were a couple of explosions which I think were a couple of gas canisters. I would have expected more
fire engines to respond faster.'
Barry Fisher, a trade specialist who lives in Nairobi, described the scene as chaos.
'It was huge, the smoke billowing, and it didn't seem to be stopping. There was no one stopping any traffic
going to the road to the airport. 'A number of fire trucks and ambulances were trying to negotiate their way through the lane. They were trying to weave their way through a solid two lanes of cars.' Raging: Images posted on Twitter show smoke and flames billowing from one of the main buildings Diverted: Inbound flights were diverted to the coastal city of Mombasa as the fire raged
The country's largest newspaper, the Daily Nation, reported last month that Nairobi County does not have a single working fire engine, and that three fire engines were auctioned off in 2009 because the county had not paid a repair bill.
'It is a disgrace of biblical proportions that the entire Nairobi County does not have a public fire engine in working condition,' the paper wrote in an editorial last month. 'When (government leaders) were debating their budgets, they did not deem it fit to set aside money either to buy new ones or repair the old ones. But they did set aside money to build mansions for governors, (buy) big vehicles for county executives and other needs without a direct benefit to Kenyans.'
The paper said the collapse of the fire department means responses to disasters are in the hands of private
companies and the military.

Arsenal are considering a dramatic move for Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas as they step up their pursuit of a replacement for error-prone Wojciech Szczesny. The Spain captain is known to be unsettled at the Bernabeu after losing his automatic place in the first team under Jose Mourinho and the Gunners are keeping a close eye on his situation. Arsenal - shocked by their Barclays Premier League opening-day defeat by Aston Villa - are desperate to land a world-class goalkeeper and the World Cup winner and European champion would certainly fit the bill. London calling? Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas is a target for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger

The north London club discussed moving for Chelsea No 1 Petr Cech before the transfer window opened, believing that Thibaut
Courtois would return from his loan spell at Atletico Madrid and replace Cech in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. Although
Arsene Wenger is keen on Casilllas, the stumbling block could be his price. Casillas is 32 and ever-prudent Arsenal do not want to pay big money for a move knowing full well they cannot sell him on. They would consider a fee of around £8million but fear Madrid would not listen to offers below the £15m mark.

Arsenal, who trained on Tuesday ahead of their crunch Champions League play-off with Fenerbahce, have endured a
frustrating summer in the transfer markets.Key
targets including Gonzalo Higuain, Luis Suarez and Luiz Gonzalo have failed to arrive at the Emirates while a clear out has left Wenger's squad looking thin on the ground.The Gunners have also been linked with a move for QPR keeper Julio Cesar but the Brazilian has claimed he is happy to remain with the Championship side.

Martinez: To sign Lukaku permanently we MUST qualify for the Champions League

Roberto Martinez believes Everton will need to offer Champions League football if they are to stand any chance of signing Romelu Lukaku permanently.The Belgium international has made outstanding progress this season since he joined Everton on a season long-loan and his tally of nine goals is better than the combined total of Chelsea’s three strikers Demba Ba, Fernando Torres and Samuel Eto’o.Everton, according to Martinez, have not asked Chelsea during this window about the possibility of making his switch to Merseyside full-time and there is nothing in the agreement they struck in September that would allow them to do that now. Impact: Lukaku has made outstanding progress since he joined Everton on a season long-loan, scoring nine goals Struggling: Lukaku has scored more goals than Chelsea strikers Eto’o (left), Ba (right) and Torres (below)
As things stand, Martinez expects Lukaku to return to Chelsea at the end of the campaign but with Jose Mourinho is still looking for another top level forward, Everton’s manager believes their prospects of keeping the 20-year-old would be enhanced by a top four finish.‘We want to keep Rom as long as we can but the reality is he’s on loan for the season,’ said Martinez.‘Rom is enjoying his football and I don’t think it would be beneficial to anyone to go into a conversation that’s not going to change the agreement we have until May. Brazil bound: Lukaku is set to lead the line for Belgium at the World Cup
‘Rom is highly regarded at Chelsea, we are talking to them all the time and we need to wait until the end of the season to see how the experience went. 'He’s focused on one thing, which is developing this season, being as good as he can be and trying to take Everton into the Champions League. Head-to-head: Everton travel to West Brom on Monday night where the Baggies new Spanish boss Pepe Mel (left) will pit his wits against Roberto Martinez (right)
‘That’s always in his head. I’m sure as a club we have a better chance of attracting players like Rom if we are in the Champions League than not. In my eyes we need to get into the Champions League to attract players like him.’ Everton’s hopes of attracting top players will also be aided by the fact they are on the brink of securing Leighton Baines’ on a long-term contract and are also in negotiations to reward the outstanding progress of exciting midfielder Ross Barkley.‘It doesn’t matter whether they have one year left or four or five, like with Seamus Coleman, Ross Barkley - we always want to rewards those players who do well,’ said Martinez, who wants to sign a striker during this transfer window. New deals: Ross Barkley (left) and Seamus Coleman (right) have signed extended contracts with Everton
‘Leighton I feel he’s in the best moment of his career.‘He has a short term contract (18 months remaining) so that (new deal) gives him a bit more tranquillity, so he can focus on his football. We will carry on working behind the scenes to make sure those long term deals are there. We want to keep him here as long as we can.’ Big change: Roberto Martinez has seen transformation in Leighton Baines
‘What is encouraging is to see someone like Leighton still being hungry to learn and develop. I’ve seen a big change from Leighton. I think he’s been different in the way he had to play and behind the scenes he is a big personality and has a massive role in this squad.’ More...

Got a point. I reckon the lak would sign if Everton got champs lge football. Its close at the moment. Why not. Got to say if I could choose a football club to play for in the top 4 it wouldn't be chelsea with ther history and dodgy support. Lakaku I know is loving life in liverpool and loves Evertons warmth and incredible support. I am a season ticket holder for several years and I cant get a away ticket. 2

What a foolish post. He'll be off to Dortmund? United & Newcastle have got better squads?
Tip 1: if you want people to take what you say seriously, make sure your argument is rational, preferably backed up with facts. 1

He`s not as prolific now, only scored the odd goal in ages-he`ll improve again at a big club.Sturridge has scored as many in 5 games as Lukaku and Sturridge has only played for 15 minutes of those 5 games !!

No chance of Lukaku staying at Everton ! Firstly they`ll be scrambling to try and get a Europa place with Man United and probably fail, secondly they always say they are skint despite getting the same big money fro being in the PL as everyone else plus fees such as Fellaini`s but they won`t shell out, thirdly he will want to go to a big club not go through the motions at at club that hasn`t won even a Carling Cup in 20 years.
