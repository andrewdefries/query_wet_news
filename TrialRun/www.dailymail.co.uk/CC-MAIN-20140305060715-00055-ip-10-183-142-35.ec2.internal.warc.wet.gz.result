Van Gerwen hoping to make amends for World final with Premier League crown

Michael van Gerwen is ready to make amends for his World Championship final disappointment against Phil Taylor by winning the Premier League title in London on Thursday night.The Dutchman finished top of the round-robin table in his debut Premier League as his impressive form over the past 12 months continued.But, despite his series of flawless performances, Van Gerwen missed out on the World Championship when he lost 7-4 in the final to Phil Taylor - a match that he feels he should have won. Final: James Wade, Phil Taylor, Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Berneveld pose with the Trophy
He told Sportsmail: 'At the Worlds I think I was the best player over the two weeks but that doesn't always mean you'll win. Phil played his best game of the tournament in the final and that was class.'Before the final against Phil I was very confident. I had an amazing tournament and was very unlucky not to win the final. I had two darts to go 5-2 up.'I come here (to finals night) as winner of the table and no one has done that before other than Phil. I'm quite confident and I hope I can show my game and show everyone my class.'Phil is always the man to beat. He's not 16-time world champion for nothing.' Van Gerwen will play James Wade in the second semi-final at the O2 Arena, where over 10,000 fans are expected to be in attendance.Despite this being his first Premier League, the Dutchman is no stranger to the arena having played there in the World Youth Final last year.He said: 'It's going to a great atmosphere. Last year I was here for the Youth Final and I was thinking "I hope I can be here with the big boys" and now I come here in the finals and that feels a bit strange.' Taylor, meanwhile, is excited about stepping onto the O2 Arena stage, and sharing the spotlight with some of the world's most famous musicians.He said: 'It’s exciting. You walk in there and think ‘wow', see the people and music is on. It's inspiring really to think that you’re on the stage where Barbra Streisand is going to be singing in three or four weeks time. Or Take That have been on. I am on there as well with my picture. It’s weird.' Taylor plays old rival Raymond van Barneveld in the first semi-final on Thursday night, a man who has never beaten 'The Power' in the Premier League.Taylor said: 'This Premier League has been tough, because the schedule has been tough.'Some weekends I have been working. It has been difficult for me. I haven’t done loads of exhibitions but the ones I have been doing have been busy, with lots of autographs and photographs, answering questions to 1am or 2am.'I can’t do it now. I still feel 18 but my body is saying, "you’re getting old - you have to start looking after yourself now".' More...

Why so shy? Katie Price tries to hide after big night out in Essex with her worse-for-wear sister

Model given rolling road block escort by police to slip away from photographersEx-husband Peter Andre 'furious' over sauna burn on daughter's backShe has made her millions posing in next to nothing as a glamour model, and then letting cameras into her home for series after series of fly-on-the-wall reality television shows.Yet suddenly, Katie Price has come over all camera shy.First, she outraged motorists on the A3 when she was given a rolling road block as an escort this week to get away from photographers who she used happily pose for.And last night, the 32-year-old attempted to hide again as she left Essex nightclub the Sugar Hut at 2am looking slightly worse for wear.
We
see you: The reality star came over all camera-shy and attempted to hide under a blanket as she left Sugar Hut in Brentwood at 2am Despite currently working on her new Living TV reality show, due to be aired in April, Katie now appears keen to carefully manage exactly what pictures of her are available - and falling out of nightclubs doesn't seem to have made the list.Katie slumped in the back seat of her people carrier with a group of girlfriends including sister Sophie, but hid under a red blanket when she saw photographers.

While Katie looked a little bleary-eyed, it was her sister he appeared to need the blanket more, as she lay curled up on the seat with her shoes kicked off and the contents of her bag spewing on to the floor.
Worse for wear: Katie Price slumps in the back of her car after a night out in Essex last nightOnce again, the reality star had received royal treatment with no less than six police officers on hand to help her leave the Brentwood nightclub through the back door. According to witnesses, Katie was assisted to her car by security, and another of their group had to be carried out.The girls night out began at Nu Bar in Loughton before moving to the Sugar Hut, owned by former The Only Way Is Essex star Kirk Norcross.Norcross, who quit the show after the first season, was clearly thrilled by his celebrity guest, tweeting this morning: '@MissKatiePrice thanks for tonight Katie! X' Party bus: Katie's sister Sophie appeared more than a little worse for wear as she lay in the back seat with her bag's contents emptied onto the floor
Onlookers say the party appeared to be continuing in the car too, as there were vodka bottles on the floor of the people carrier.Her police assistance is the latest luxury afforded to Miss Price, who outraged motorists and sparked a police enquiry when she was granted a rolling road block this week.
In security measures usually reserved for heads of state and the royal family, police officers escorted her for eight minutes along the A3, leaving dozens of frustrated motorists trailing behind. Treated like royalty: Once again, the model was given police assistance as she left the nightclub
The helpful boys in blue have not only angered those unfortunate enough to be caught behind the block as Katie made her way from her Surrey home, but a police spokesperson has confirmed that an official complaint
has been made and an investigation has been launched into the incident. And although the model is thought to be worth £40million it is unlikely that she footed the bill.Photographer Ben Benjilali was one of four snappers who had been waiting close to the reality TV star’s home and has told agency reporters that it was not unusual for paparazzi to follow Ms Price and she would normally happily stop and pose for pictures. But as her Range Rover car joined the A3 from the M25 a police vehicle appeared and introduced a 50mph speed limit behind the car. Police protection: Katie Price kept other cars at a distance from her Range Rover as police made motorists slow down to 50mph on the A3 allowing her to get away
Tailback: Dozens of motorists were delayed by police who allowed Katie Price to drive off after they formed a rolling road block which lasted for eight minutes
Mr Benjilali said: ‘It was like a mad pursuit.’‘Her license has been revoked so her little sister was driving and she drives like a pensioner, so it was just a normal traffic flow.’The photographer filmed the incident and said that the road-block was in place for eight minutes as the traffic headed towards London.‘I think it is an outrage really, said Mr Benjilali and added: ‘the taxpayers have had to foot the bill.’ Why do shy? Katie didn't want to be pictured and hid behind two bright pink plastic bags as she left a ballet shop in Surrey
Not so inconspicuous: Katie was wearing a bright fur gilet and a fur hat for her outing but didn't want attention from the snappers during her shopping trip
One Surrey resident Ian Whittaker, from Hindhead, was so infuriated by the incident that he has lodged a formal complaint with Surrey police. ‘As a Surrey taxpayer, I am concerned that limited police resources are being abused in this manner,’ he said.‘If any of the press or other road users were driving above the speed limit, they should have been prosecuted. ‘This looks like star-struck Surrey Police officers pandering to the ego of a minor celebrity.’A spokesman for Surrey Police said: ‘The officer did the right thing on this occasion and Surrey police fully support his actions.'The following day Katie was equally shy as she visited a ballet shop in Caterham near her home in Surrey.As the mother-of-three emerged from the shop she hid her face behind two huge pink ballet bags from the shop and got into her car for home. The aversion to the cameras comes just days after the star was all smiles at Asda in Milton Keynes as she signed copies of her autobiography. As you'd expect from the glamour model formerly known as Jordan, she kept smiling for her meet and greet with her fans in the supermarket, and was wearing yet more fluffy clothing. Lonely figure: Alex Reid was spied looking glum as her drove away from Katie's Surrey mansion last weekShe was sporting the hat, along with a furry poncho and one of her favourite glittering cocktail rings on her wedding finger, at the signing was the last for her latest autobiography - her fourth - You Only Live Once. The star is apparently gearing up to serve divorce papers on Alex next week on the day of their one year anniversary - 10 February.They married in Las Vegas after a whirlwind romance and less than nine months after Katie's split from her previous husband, Peter Andre. Alex Reid is rumoured to be asking for £700,000, which is thought to be less than the pair earned from their 11 month union. Alex is said to still be holed up at the Surrey mansion they once shared happily, though they are now living separate lives. He was spied leaving the pile in a blue BMW car looking rather glum as he drove away last week.Meanwhile Price's ex-husband Peter Andre sought legal advice this week after discovering a burn on their daughter Princess' back.His representatives confirmed: 'Princess ­arrived at Pete’s house with a burn on her body he hadn’t been made aware of. He has been ­trying to find out how she ­sustained the injury.'When he was unable to get a r­esponse from Princess’s mother he decided to deal with it ­legally. But needless to say, he’s very concerned,' they told the Sunday Mirror.it turns out that the burn was sustained while Princess was in Klosters last month with Katie, in a sauna.Price's spokesman said last night: 'Katie is deeply saddened that a minor ­accident that was explained has been turned into a public issue.'Princess is fine. Katie loves her children very much.'

Sympathy pains? Alec Baldwin rubs and stretches his back as he steps out with heavily pregnant wife Hilaria after she passes her due date By

She has just passed her due date and could be forgiven for being a tad uncomfortable. But it seemed as though Alec Baldwin was the one feeling uneasy when the couple stepped out on Sunday in New York.The 30 Rock actor was seen rubbing and stretching his back as they pair took their prized pooches for a walk. Seriously stylish: Despite being over her due date the 29-year-old yoga teacher does not look phased and certainly hasn't compromised on her style
Stroll: Alec Baldwin looks like he is feeling the toll of his wife's pregnancy as they cross a road in New York whilst walking their dogsWhile most pregnant women who are past their due date perhaps opt to dress down in sweatpants whilst resting at home, Hilaria seems to be the exception to the norm.The brunette, who is
expected to go into labour any day now, looked perfectly composed and elegant as she headed out with her husband and dogs for the stroll.The 29-year-old was stylish in blue and white long sleeved silk dress which hung just above her knees. Her baby bump was accentuated by a sash with the same design, tied just under her chest and at the top of her tummy .
Still wearing heels at the end of her stretch, Hilaria tottered around in a pair of beige stilettos. Parents to be: The couple are no doubt eagerly anticipating the arrival of their little one who will be their first child together but Alec's second child.
The yoga teacher looked serene and calm with her dark hair hanging loose around her face, which looked to be
relatively make-up free apart from some pink lip gloss and a pair of large dark oversized sunglasses covering up her eyes.
With a leash holding onto her dog in one hand and a bright yellow umbrella in the other, she gracefully smiled at photographers as she crossed the street.
Her 55-year-old husband didn't look to
be on such good form as his elegant wife in dark sweatpants, a T-shirt and some open-toed sports sandals.
Sympathy pains? Husband Alec looks like he may be experiencing sympathy pregnancy pains as he rubs his back and stretches whilst his heavily pregnant wife pops into a shop
Their other babies: The parents to be give plenty of love and affection to their canine 'babies'
The talented but often volatile star looked rather disheveled and grumpy as he winced in pain at one point and held onto his lower back.
Perhaps Alec was suffering from sympathy
pregnancy pains for his wife, although given her graceful demeanour it is fair to say she seems to be sailing through the final stages of pregnancy.
The couple will have their first child in New York where they reside.
He is loveable really! Despite his often volatile temperament the 50 Rock star shows he is a softie deep down as he kisses and cuddles his adorable puppy

when she is a blossoming 39 y.o., he will be 65. Considering that he did not really take good care of himself, as the photos show, he would need quite a bit of care then, hardly any sex. Did she think of that or was she simply driven by the desire to be spotted by paparazzi because of her famous husband? Or is it that it does not really matter then, because, rich and famous by that time, she will be elsewhere, anyway?
