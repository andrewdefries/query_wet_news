Human brains are hard-wired to enjoy the calm of the countryside – while cities make us confused, anxious and aggressive
Looking at rural images makes the limbic or 'calm' area of the brain light up
Whereas images of cities cause the ‘visual complexity’ area to be activated
This causes anxiety, confusion and can increase levels of aggression
Researchers compared this to how animals feel when kept in zoos

Many of us dream of escaping to the calm and tranquillity of the countryside, leaving the rat race behind - and it seems this may be due to the fact our brain is telling us to. Researchers from Exeter have discovered we are hard-wired to seek out rural landscapes because they make us feel calm, while cities confuse us and make us aggressive - even if we’ve only ever lived in urban areas. This could be due to the fact humans lived in rural environments for hundreds of years, or may be because our brains just aren’t equipped to handle the huge amounts of stimuli in busy cityscapes. Scientists from Exeter University studied what happened to people's brains when they were shown images of rural and urban landscapes. They found that when people look at rural environments, pictured, the limbic system and area of their brain associated with calm and peacefulness lights up
WHY LIVING NEAR BUSY ROADS IS DANGEROUS - BUT JUST FOR MENLiving near busy roads could put men at higher risk of premature death - even when air pollution levels are rated as ‘safe’, claim researchers.A major study from Utrecht University in the Netherlands found exposure to traffic pollutants can push up the risk of dying by seven per cent, compared with living in quieter neighbourhoods.They estimate that for every increase of 5 micrograms per cubic metre (5 µg/m3) in annual exposure to PM 2.5, the risk of dying from rises by seven per cent.The risk of death increased only in men, not in women. To test their theory of rural versus urban living, scientists at Exeter University wired up participants to an MRI scanner before showing them images of cities and country landscapes. More...

Google plans to embed microchips in our heads and microphones in ceilings - and it could happen as soon as 2018
When rural images were flashed onto a screen, the limbic area of the brain was activated and lit up on the scanner. This area is associated with feelings of calm and peacefulness and is part of the brain shared with monkeys and primates. However, when images of cities and busy streets were shown to the participants, the area of the brain associated with ‘visual complexity’ - the visual cortex in the occipital lobe - was activated. This caused the brain to try and scan the image, make sense of everything it was seeing and process all the information, which can lead to confusion and anxiety. This was even the case when ‘dull’ rural images were shown leading the researchers to conclude its not just
idyllic-looking places that cause this feeling of calm. These
findings are just preliminary results shared with The Independent and the researchers plan to test the theory further to find out exactly why this happens. Images of cities, such as Chicago pictured, cause the 'visual complexity' area of brains to be activated. This can cause anxiety, confusion and increase levels of aggression while the brain tries to process everything it's looking at. Researchers found this was the case even when people were born in the city
Dr Ian Frampton, an Exeter University psychologist told The Independent: ‘When looking at urban environments the brain is doing a lot of processing because it doesn’t know what this environment is.‘The brain doesn’t have an immediate natural response to it, so it has to get busy.‘Even if you have lived in a city all your life, it seems your brain doesn’t quite know what to do with this information and has to do visual processing.’When the brain is confused and anxious it can also lead to increases in angry and aggressive behaviour and Professor Michael Depledge, also from the university, siad that a similar experience is seen in zoos. ‘If you don’t get the conditions right in zoos, the animals start behaving in a wacky way. 'There have been studies done with laboratory animals showing their feeding is abnormal. Sometimes they stop eating and sometimes they eat excessively. Read more:

So all’s well that ends well. West Ham United got by without Andy Carroll and, more significantly, without taking a torch to the Football Association’s disciplinary process. Realistically, there was more chance of them overturning that 6-0 first-leg Capital One Cup defeat by Manchester City than Carroll’s ban, considering the club’s record in the law courts. West Ham, remember, contrived to lose a case that hinged on Sheffield United being able to prove they were not responsible for their own league position.

Still, it was a lucky escape. Had West Ham’s challenge to the FA over Carroll succeeded, football would have resembled the Wild West. No disciplinary measure would have been allowed to stand without all parties traipsing to arbitration for a shootout. Signing up to a due process — as West Ham did at the start of the season — would no longer have meaning.It is easy to condemn West Ham’s opportunism, or mock their desperation, but this ignores a wider question: why? Why, in this of all seasons, are clubs going to such extremes in the fight against relegation? West Ham may be frantic over Carroll but a look at the league table will confirm that they are one of only two teams in the bottom seven not to have sacked their manager. In total, seven managers have been dismissed this season, six for fear of relegation. It is too simplistic to blame this on trigger-happy foreign owners: West Bromwich Albion, Crystal Palace and Swansea City do not fit that model at all.The truth is the Football League has made itself such a hostile landing strip, such an inhospitable place to end up, that club owners now recoil at the very thought of it. Furious at the increased parachute payments offered to relegated Premier League teams, the Football League has implemented an extreme form of financial fair play in which clubs are even held to account for debts accrued trying to survive in the higher league.Blackburn Rovers and Queens Park Rangers, particularly if promoted this season, could be hit with punitive fines.Instead of imposing control, this has served only to increase the febrile atmosphere at the foot of the major league, where Michael Laudrup was sacked less than a year after winning Swansea’s first major trophy following a run of poor form. The first win for new manager Garry Monk then shot Swansea to 10th. Reaction? Swansea beat Cardiff 3-0 on Saturday just days after Laudrup departed the Liberty Stadium
Hindsight: Monk was the hero in south Wales, but how do we know Laudrup wouldn't have done the same? Swift: West Brom acted quickly to get rid of Steve Clarke (left), while Palace didn't waste time with Holloway Was it so unthinkable that Laudrup, too, might have found a way past 19th-placed Cardiff City on Saturday?Swansea are the epitome of a well-run, efficient, small Premier League club, and when their board is rattled, something is most definitely wrong.The gap between the first and second tiers has never been greater, yet the Football League has compounded that with what appears to be outright hostility to new arrivals, who will already be eyeing the £163.8million debt at Bolton Wanderers — over £150m of it owed to owner Eddie Davies — in terror.‘I would prefer death to relegation,’ said Norwich City chief executive David McNally recently.Meanwhile, Richard Bevan, chief executive of the League Managers’ Association, is calling for sanctions on clubs dismissing a manager mid-season.Yet the clubs are not to blame. The Football League has created this climate with their vicious circle. The cost of dropping out of the Premier League is already immense in terms of revenue lost, so clubs spend to survive and also to compete. All to play for: 'I would prefer death to relegation,' said Norwich City chief executive David McNally recently Trouble ahead? Blackburn and QPR, if promoted this season, could be hit with punitive fines
Then the Football League introduces new rules so that existing debt can also be met with huge fines if carried over after relegation — upping the imperative to spend to survive and avoid relegation; or sack to survive; or take the FA to arbitration over a straightforward red card to survive.Clubs do not want to reside in a league in which financial options are so limited. It is the reason that, increasingly, promotion demands a whirlwind spending spree to accumulate a Premier League standard squad and relegation guarantees a fire sale. Rules intended to avoid the madness have simply created more of it.Carroll may have been the victim of injustice in West Ham’s match with Swansea. Chico Flores certainly made a meal of an incident to get his opponent a red card but the referee, Howard Webb, stood by his decision.The FA, sensibly, did not add to an existing three-match ban, by branding West Ham’s appeal frivolous and there the matter should have ended. Big cost, big risk: Struggling Fulham spent big in January in an attempt to keep their Premier League place
Eternal struggle: Sunderland changed their boss early on, but are still nowhere near on the road to safety
West Ham are threatened by relegation and laden with debt, and that combination spells disaster; so for that reason alone the FA’s disciplinary system was placed in jeopardy. It would only have taken one rogue arbitration ruling last Friday to throw English football into chaos and with Fulham and Cardiff also facing the drop, do not rule out further outbreaks of insanity — a third manager at Craven Cottage in one year, perhaps — before the season ends.Rules designed to calm and regulate have only contributed to fresh lunacy.Eddie Izzard had a routine about the coffee-morning ineffectuality of the Church of England when set against more blood and thunder religions. He imagined the Spanish Inquisition as run by the C of E. ‘Right, you — cake or death?’ ‘Er, cake please.’Yet Norwich’s chief executive would choose the furnace ahead of the Football League.This represents a colossal failure.Relegation is bad enough. It should never be a fate worse than death. Locked up: There was more chance of West Ham coming back from 6-0 down against Man City in the Capital One Cup semi-final than overcoming Carroll's ban, such is their history with the FA in the law courts
Beeb must put partisan pom-poms in orderJenny Jones was in silver medal position in the women’s slopestyle, heading for Great Britain’s first Olympic medal on snow. It was a momentous occasion. One of the two squealing ninnies representing the BBC then attempted to put it into perspective.He said whether Jones was the first depended on how you viewed the bronze medal won by skier Alain Baxter in 2002. ‘I still think he’s a bronze medallist,’ said snowboard expert Aimee Fuller, who had failed to make it through to the final that morning. Presumably, she thinks Ben Johnson won the 100metres in Seoul, too. Baxter failed a drugs test. He tested positive for levomethamphetamine, having won bronze in the slalom event at Salt Lake City. That's the one: Jenny Jones celebrates after her second run in the women's slopestyle in Sochi
He claims he did so inadvertently, thinking a Vicks nasal spray bought in America contained the same ingredients as Vicks spray in England. It doesn’t, and athletes should know enough not to take a chance with medication these days anyway.All sports people are frequent travellers with an understanding that medicine differs from country to country. America, in particular, is known for the strength of its over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.The British Olympic Association supported Baxter through many appeals but the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne backed the IOC decision to give his medal to Benjamin Raich of Austria. They decided, rightly, that Baxter was responsible for
what he put up his nose.And then, 12 years later, a BBC commentary team decided he wasn’t. ‘Still a bronze medallist,’ according to Fuller. Not recognised: Alain Baxter failed a drugs test after winning bronze in the slalom in 2002 at Salt Lake CityOf
course, when Jones genuinely won bronze soon after, these lapses of reason were forgotten. Fuller’s microphone actually got turned off as she expressed such delight when the final competitor Anna Gasser went down on her backside, guaranteeing Jones’s podium position. After which, no mention of Baxter’s tainted achievement at all. Jones was lauded as the first British medallist on snow, quite rightly.She gave a wonderful interview, full of innocence and joy and humanity, and met up with her parents live on camera. It was great television.But the BBC has a decision to make. Is
it the nation’s broadcaster, or the nation’s cheerleader? Some of the commentary is quite ridiculous, all screams and sobs, like a gathering of Beliebers.After Jones won bronze — a fantastic achievement with recourse to hyperbole — one excited BBC voice declared that Britain had dominated the slopestyle event, which may have come as a
surprise to the United States, who won both gold medals.
High-flying: Miss Jones's bronze win was Britain's first ever medal on snow
Some like their coverage patriotic and overwrought with emotion, others prefer a stiff upper lip.Personally, I think if you want to be a fan, buy a ticket, but it is a matter of taste. A failed drugs test, however, is a failed drugs test, and no fervour for Team GB should ever cloud that issue. The BBC needs to get its pom-poms in order. There is a reason Baxter isn’t the first British medallist on snow. If he was, he would be in a BBC commentary box. The benefit of a family affairTom Ince scored his first goal for Crystal Palace on Saturday. ‘A lot of players are more interested in looking like players than being players,’ said his dad Paul. ‘Tom has no earrings, no tattoos. He’s different to other kids. 'They just go on their Playstations. Thomas will sit and watch Spanish, French and Italian football with me. I can have a conversation about any player. I don’t just want him to play the game, I want him to understand the game.’Whatever his faults, it is a pity that Ince Snr has been unable to make his mark as a manager.Maybe his future lies in youth development. He does not simply talk it, either. His son is living proof that he can produce a footballer, too. Dream: Thomas Ince celebrates after scoring on his debut for Palace against West Brom on Saturday
Nurtured: Former England midfielder Paul Ince (left) has produced a real footballer in son Thomas
And while we're at itSo that was it. Inappropriate whistling. Those searching for the reason England ditched Kevin Pietersen now have their answer. After getting out in Sydney, he entered the dressing room whistling. It was the last straw, the final confirmation of his appalling attitude towards the team ethic.Or maybe he was just nervous.Remember when you whistled as a kid? Walking home at night, taking that short cut through a dark alley maybe? Wasn’t a sign of confidence, was it? Bittersweet tweet: Pietersen posted this on Twitter with a link to this Instagram picture (below) showing him leaving the Sydney Cricket Ground, but his reaction in the dressing room wasn't taken to kindly
Pietersen no doubt knew he was not the most popular man in the dressing room. Maybe he was embarrassed and a little on edge about facing his team-mates again after getting out. His whistling was probably bravado, not nonchalance. Tony Adams had it right. In his autobiography, Addicted, he described England’s preparation for the 1998 World Cup under manager Glenn Hoddle. ‘A lot of what Glenn was doing and saying did not impress me,’ revealed Adams. ‘He seemed quite nervous and was whistling a lot — not the sign of a relaxed man.’ Opinion: Adams said in his book he was not impressed with England manager Hoddle's preparation in 1998
Yet in their desperation to oust Pietersen, the ECB has recast his every move as an act of disloyalty. A team meeting was arranged so that players could air their feelings and be totally honest, yet what Pietersen said within those four walls is now cited as an act of mutiny. How can a meeting be honest if negative views about the coach and captain are heresy? Not so much clear the air as add to the fog. Pietersen should have been able to say whatever he liked in that environment without it being held against him. But whistling? The ECB should just put its lips together, and blow. Mauricio Pochettino, lying ninth with Southampton following the home draw with Stoke City, is being linked with Real Madrid. He is believed to be on a shortlist if Carlo Ancelotti fails to win La Liga or the Champions League this season. One can imagine what a dilemma that would prove for the socios. Crazy talk: Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a move to Real Madrid if Carlo Ancelotti doesn't succeed
‘Now you’ll remember Mauricio here from Espanyol, where he won almost a third of his games, and was sacked in 2012 for being bottom of the league. But, don’t worry, after that he got Southampton to ninth. Of course, if that’s not enough for you there’s always Zinedine Zidane. Oh. I see.’ And now, Philosophy for Beginners with Cheryl Cole. ‘There really is no point dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Neither of them exist,’ she told Twitter last week. (Not that I’m on it, I just get made aware of the important stuff.) Now, we can get bogged down in semantics about the existential status of the future, but I have it on good authority that the past most certainly is there and, if it wasn’t, you wouldn’t have to study Shakespeare and the Romans in school.In other news, Ashley Cole has expressed surprise at suddenly being lauded as the brains of an operation. Translate that, please: Cheryl Cole had some interesting things to say on Twitter in the week More...

I don't get the argument that by so-called living beyond your earnings you are cheating and you should only spend what you earn. On that logic, no one would ever take out a mortgage. Or move to a better house with a bigger mortgage. The point is whether you can meet your debts. So given the massive difference in income streams between the Premier League and the Championship, it's easy to see why clubs are so keen to avoid relegation and to get promoted. There's a massive loss of revenue. What I don't get though is imposing fines for it. That's like fining someone because they lost their job, accepted a lower paying one and moved to a less expensive house, or fining them because their income improved and they could move to a better neighbourhood. It makes no sense. 1

Ince, Farrell and Beattie to name three...Son of sportsmen tend to get better extra tuition and genes in the sport than most other kids...However the next step is much harder if their dads are legends in their chosen sport as younger Cruyff, Maradona and Botham will tell you. Some people seem to have ridiculous expectations or more correctly expect good comparisons with dad. It would have been harder in some respects for Farrell to play League than Union for this reason. Ince would make an excellent youth development officer type but so would many ex-professionals/internationals provided they have patience and enthusiasm.

The yaya Toure ruling and some recent refereeing decisions show that the FA and the EPL is rotten to the core. They will do anything to maintain the status of the doc called big four.

Without wanting to get into the Andy Carroll situation, I think it is very clear that the FA's disciplinary and appeal procedures are deeply unsatisfactory. It is a matter of time before one victim asks for a judicial review or refers the matter to the international appeals system.That really could bring the whole pack of cards tumbling down. 1

from paul ince, 'Tom has no earrings, no tattoos. He¿s different to other kids.' hmmmmmmmm really paul ince. The reason why he doesn't is because you are still under his arm pit making sure he is on the right path. Just like lewis hamilton, and you know what happened there don't you?!?!!? he sacked his father, got a tatto and partying hard with beautiful women. So yes ince keep gloating about your perfect son because i say, in a year, this ince will no longer exist. As a chelsea fan I don't really have a place to say this BUT PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE JOKING AND CARLO ANCELOTTI?? he is doing extremely well there, has intergrated bale into the team perfectly. What more could the really want?!?!?

Unlike a lot of other countries, we have a fully professional second, third and fourth division full of very old clubs with very rich and long histories. Why should only the 20 at the top of this system now get all the financial benefit? Sick of playing teams in the championship whose parachute payment alone is 8 times our actual annual playing budget. 1

I'm really sorry, but you can't compare Alain Baxter to Ben Johnson. Baxter made an honest mistake, had no intention of enhancing his performance and what he put up his nose will have done nothing for his performance. Johnson was pumping himself with anabolics, knowingly cheating with drugs designed specifically to improve his performance. He was a hardened criminal, Baxter's error was one of naive incompetence.
But you are right, rules are rules and Baxter had to be DQed.

Cricket is a team game. Playing across the line when losing your wicket costs your team matters less to you than your personal vanity...... I would have dropped him ages ago. As I suspect would have Boycott. He came as a mercenary, and played like one. It's all about me. Could we please produce better pitches to produce our own players? At the moment we are S.

I kind of think The FA could also help themselves if their disciplinary process wasn't so arbitrary, and didn't represent such a closed-off, mysterious operation. I'm an Arsenal fan and I cannot fathom how Howard Webb took a second look at the Carroll incident and, with perfectly straight face, confirmed that he stood by the decision. This is what happens; bad decisions are routinely upheld with no explanation, hiding behind FIFA directives which apparently prevent overruling a decision where the referee saw the incident, which we know is rubbish because it has been done before. I reckon defendants in a North Korean Court of Law have a better chance of a successful appeal. Yes we don't want every decision going to arbitration but sometimes The FA bring it on themselves.

I cannot fathom how you took so many looks at the incident and missed the INTENT that was in Carroll's arm swing. Intent is what he got the red for and that was why it was upheld. (Another nail in the coffin of your argument is that Yaya Toure had a successful appeal) FAs process is not 100% perfect but it mostly works.

He suffered the devastating snap of his Achilles tendon in April during a game against the Golden State Warriors.But Kobe Bryant didn't let an injury ruin his evening as he stepped out with wife Vanessa in Beverly Hills on Thursday.The pair donned complementary evening wear to attend An Unforgettable Evening benefiting the Entertainment Industry Foundation's Women's Cancer Research Fund. Staying positive: Just three weeks after suffering a devastating injury to his Achilles tendon, Kobe Bryant appeared buoyant with wife Vanessa at a charity event in Beverly Hills
Kobe, 34, seemed in high spirits as he entered the event aided by a set of crutches and wearing a foot brace. The champion player has remained optimistic following what he called the most disappointing injury of his career 'by far.''I
know I can do this,' he said of his recovery. 'It's fueling me. It's fueling me. I can feel it already.'He further rallied on Facebook: 'Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me...Then again maybe not!' Complementary couple: The pair, married since 2001, donned matching formal wear for the occasion
And his continued positivity was evident as he entered the philanthropic gala on the arm of his beaming wife of 12 years.The basketball star looked debonair in a black tuxedo and patent leather dress shoes.Meanwhile, Vanessa, 30, looked the perfect counterpart to her husband in a black dress with a high-low hemline layered over a white collared shirt and finished with a tie.The mother of two added pointed black stilettos fastened at the ankles and a quilted clutch to complete her ensemble. Undeterred: Kobe has remained optimistic throughout his recovery, and seemed in high spirits as he entered the event with crutches and a foot brace
The pair joined a slew of celebrity couples at the event, including honorary chairs Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson and Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw.Comedienne Chelsea Handler hosted the star-studded evening, while Bruno Mars provided guests with musical entertainment.On Wednesday, Kobe had his stitches removed 17 days after undergoing surgery to repair the damaged tendon.The legendary Laker posted a photograph of the process to Instagram beside the simple caption: 'Stitches out! #progress.' Progress: The star player recently had his stitches removed 17 days after undergoing surgery to repair the snapped tendon Yet the injury is not the only struggle the NBA standout is currently facing.As TMZ reported on Friday, he's embroiled in a legal battle against his mother, Pamela, who is trying to sell a collection of the athlete's basketball memorabilia through Goldin Auctions.The goods in question include several of Kobe's jerseys dating back to his days as a high school player, trophies, varsity letters and uniform pieces.Pamela, who received a $450,000 advance from the auction house, claims her son gave her the loot five years ago, but Kobe disagrees.As a result of the dispute, Goldin Auctions has taken the matter to court to ask a judge to name Pamela the rightful owner of the items. Another hurdle: Kobe currently is embroiled in a legal battle against his mother, Pamela, pictured here with husband Joe Betrayal? Pamela is attempting to sell a collection of her son's basketball memorabilia through Goldin Auctions, but Kobe claims his mother does not own the items in question
