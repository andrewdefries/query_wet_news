Without a league goal since April, can Carroll rediscover his golden touch at high-flying West Ham?

It’s a question that only Chris Hughton knows the answer to and to a slight extent, Alan Pardew too.Kenny Dalglish was left stumped, Brendan Rodgers didn’t try to put much effort into answering it and now Sam Allardyce is doing some long division sums to find a solution.So on to the poser itself: How do you get Andy Carroll scoring goals? Imperfect 10: Carroll has not scored yet this season
West Ham’s 1-1 draw with Stoke on Monday night brought another battling performance out of the striker but also his tenth match this season without a goal.In fact you have to go back to Euro 2012 in June for the last time Carroll found the back of the net, with a brilliant header for England against Sweden.The 23-year-old’s last domestic goal proved to be a consolation strike against Chelsea in the FA Cup final, while his last Premier League goal was a 90th-minute winner at Blackburn in April (another great header).That’s a worrying drought for any marksman, let alone one that cost Liverpool £35million last January when he joined from Newcastle.It’s coming up to two years since Carroll departed St James’ Park on the last day of the 2011 January transfer window and the stats do not make good reading for him.After helping Newcastle return to the Premier League in 2010, the striker scored 11 goals in his first four months back in the top flight under Hughton and Pardew. Since joining Liverpool he has scored six. Revelation: Carroll burst onto the scene with Newcastle in 2010
To put that into context we have Fernando Torres, who left Liverpool and joined Chelsea for £50million on the same day Carroll ventured into Merseyside.With 40 league starts (seven more than Carroll) the much maligned striker has found the net 11 times. But while Blues fans have started to lose patience with the Spaniard, West Ham and some sections of Liverpool fans only have positive things to say about Carroll. So if he isn’t scoring, what is he doing?The simple answer is he is bringing more team-mates into play just by being on the pitch. The striker’s fantastic ability to contest an aerial ball has made him a victim of his own success.As a relative unknown threat at Newcastle he was the focal point of the attack and given as much licence as any striker to contest a cross – and the goals soon followed.At Liverpool he was often in a more unsuited role playing alongside No 1 striker Luis Suarez (or injured). But the Premier League teams have caught up on their homework and now, on loan at West Ham, he is a marked man. Frozen out: Rodgers was not interested in keeping Carroll at Liverpool
Or make that double marked. Watch any long ball played towards Carroll this season and you will see two opposition defenders jump with him. It’s no wonder the goals have dried up when he is given very little chance to win an attacking header these days.This may be starting to read like the England international is a heading machine and nothing more but there is finesse to Carroll’s game too.His left foot can be just as powerful and deadly inside and outside the penalty box. He holds the ball up well and can spot an intelligent pass to make.West Ham boss Sam Allardyce knows this and has been keen to exploit the gaps left by defences’ concentrated efforts on Carroll by bringing Kevin Nolan into an advanced role – the midfielder may as well be masquerading as a centre-forward these days.Carroll and Nolan, good friends off the field, were a lethal combination at Newcastle and have formed a similar understanding at Upton Park. Marked man: Carroll is renowned for his aerial ability
CARROLL BY NUMBERS Newcastle: Games 91, Goals 33, Liverpool: Games 58, Goals 11West Ham: Games 6, Goals 0England: Games 5, Goals 2 Nolan in his ‘secret striker’ role has scored five goals already this season – only Everton’s Marouane Fellaini has more from midfield (Michu has played as a striker on many occasions for Swansea).Everyone benefits from having Carroll in the team, and that includes the defence as the striker is always happy to come back and defend set-pieces inside his own box too.West Ham are a more balanced team with him than without him and he is a big reason why the Hammers are flying as high as seventh in the table.In six games without the striker this season, West Ham have won just two. One was the opening day victory against Aston Villa, the other a Capital One Cup win against Crewe.It’s a similar story for England. The Three Lions have won six of the nine games Carroll has been involved in and despite scoring just two goals in that time remains in Roy Hodgson’s plans.At a time when the national side is struggling for creativity, Carroll’s presence on the pitch potentially builds space for players like Theo Walcott and Wayne Rooney to exploit. But he also has the desired quality to show off his own contribution when needed - a factor that often caught out Emile Heskey when he played his own supporting role for Michael Owen at international level. High hopes: Carroll's last goal was scored for England against Sweden at Euro 2012
Nurtured well he could still be England’s new No 9 but he needs to find a way to adapt an already promising game. His work-rate so far at West Ham has been admirable but there is more to learn and he can’t live off the excuse of being marked out of every game.A potential Plan B for West Ham going forward is the impressive Modibo Maiga being paired up in attack with the striker to try and discourage the double marking.It should free Carroll up slightly and at least give him a few more chances in front of goal. He may have missed a sitter at Newcastle recently but he looks settled at West Ham and the goals will surely come if given more opportunities to feed on.It’s very unlikely he can ever match his £35million fee, but Carroll didn’t choose his price tag and much of the value in that transfer was due to the enormous loss and little time Newcastle had to replace their star man (plus the Torres factor) rather than a fair gauge of his overall ability.It’s a striker’s job to score goals but it’s a team’s duty to win and so far West Ham and Carroll are proving a winning combination despite his non-existent strike rate. Even if Rodgers still doesn’t want him at Anfield by the time next summer comes around – plenty of other Premier League teams will. More...
