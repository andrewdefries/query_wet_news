My boyfriend had pulled out of the IVF sessions we were about to start
Ringing a Harley Street clinic to cancel my IVF treatment was undoubtedly the worst phone call I have ever had to make.I couldn't think of a dignified way to explain to the doctors that my boyfriend of three years had pulled out of the sessions we were about to start.We had been for all the tests and I had psyched myself up to start injecting myself with a cocktail of hormones. I was just about to go to the private pharmacy to pick up the drugs that would kick off our quest for a baby when my boyfriend, a successful broker, phoned me.His voice was emotionless as he told me he didn't want to go through with it. 'It's all too much,' he told me. 'Maybe next year … 'Maybe next year? The sad truth was I didn't have many years left. I was 37 and increasingly desperate to start a family. But despite my ticking clock, I had heard those three words many times before, both from him and from a previous partner to whom I had been engaged several years earlier. Indeed, the truth is that I have experienced nothing but trouble whenever I have attempted to persuade a man to have children with me. That's why I am extremely dubious about the Get Britain Fertile campaign launched this week by Daybreak presenter Kate Garraway, calling on women not to leave motherhood too late.I couldn't agree more with the basic aims of the campaign to prevent disappointment and promote healthy births. But to suggest that somehow the age at which women conceive is within their control is naive and misleading.There are still some stubborn taboos about conception, and one of them involves the myth that deciding to have children is something women and men do together in an open and honest manner.For some lucky couples it may be like that. But that is not my experience, nor the experience of many of my girlfriends.I'm sorry if I offend any male readers by suggesting that they do not always play fair in matters of fertility. But in my experience men increasingly behave with terrible selfishness when it comes to giving up their bachelor lifestyles.In a way, Garraway is right. Women should try to have babies early - but not because that is the best time to have children, but because it might be the only time to have them. More...

No beach fun for insecure Brits: Quarter of UK women will avoid a sunshine holiday because of swimsuit fear
For if, like me, you have spent your 30s being involved with a series of men who enjoy their freedom, you will know it is simply a statement of fact that today's young males really aren't keen to become fathers.I have a friend who has been married for ten years and her husband still disappears into the basement every evening, where he plays computer games for hours. He has banned her from having a second child because he is already freaked out by the responsibilities posed by the beautiful toddler she gave birth to a few years ago.Every time I go round to their house, he disappears into his man-baby playroom to lose himself in Nintendo. How pathetic. 'While initially he seemed keen about IVF, when it came to actually signing up, he took fright'
Men of my father's generation would never have dreamed of telling their wives they could not have another child because they wanted more time to themselves. They just got on with it.To return to my own situation, I called off a wedding in my early 30s amid serious doubts about the direction in which my fiancé and I were heading - doubts made worse when he kept saying 'maybe next year' to the prospect of a baby. Then I met the broker. We had been together for three years, six months of those casually trying for a baby, before I went to see a specialist. I was nearly 38 by then and as there was no sign of a pregnancy, I had my suspicions that it was not going to happen without intervention. 'The real problem with leaving it late is that when your fertility is rapidly fading, you need to get the man to sign up to the battle of trying to have a baby. And that is a whole new ball game' The specialist told me in no uncertain terms that I had to be more proactive. He could run endless tests, which
would take time and money, to find out why exactly I was having trouble
conceiving.But the best thing I could do to maximise my chances was to give up on the idea that I might get pregnant naturally and embark on a course of IVF. The sooner we got started the better.When my boyfriend and I were trying for a baby naturally, I think he found it manageable. He liked the idea that it might not happen. It made him able to cope. While initially he seemed keen about IVF, when it came to actually signing up to a medical process geared to making children happen, he took fright.The most shocking thing was the gulf between his cowardly decision to back out and the caring impression he gave me at the start of our relationship. A few weeks in, he had whisked me away to his godfather's country estate for a weekend with relatives who had brought their young families. As the children played on the lawn, he put his arms around me and said: 'Wonderful, aren't they?' 'Yes,' I said, feeling pangs. 'Although you wonder how people with so many children manage.' 'Oh, you'll manage,' he said.
'His last-minute change of heart was the final straw'
If that isn't a man promising to have children, I don't know what is. But years later, his excuses ranged from not having enough money (despite earning a six-figure salary) to not wanting to make 'the biggest mistake of our lives'. As we descended into bitter rows, he insisted we had counselling. The therapist told him off for wasting my time. 'You can have children any time but your girlfriend can't,' she said. He stormed out. His last-minute change of heart, after promising to go through with IVF, was the final straw and we parted in extreme acrimony. Looking back, it was a bad relationship. I don't know if any other woman convinced him to start a family, but perhaps it's a blessing that we didn't have children. But how many years did I waste with him, on a false promise?'A girlfriend in her 20s told me she was feeling broody but felt it was too early to ask her new husband to have kids. I felt a shameful urge to tell her to secretly stop taking the Pill'
Many women are coming to realise the same thing - that when you are dating men in your late 30s, they pull you in by promising children, knowing it's what you want to hear, then push you away the moment you ask them to deliver. They are practising nothing less than a fraud.Behind the smile of every stoical so-called 'freemale' who says she doesn't mind being childless is probably a woman like me, with a story about a difficult man.For the real problem with leaving it 'late' is that when your fertility is rapidly fading, you need to get the man to sign up to the battle of trying to have a baby. And that is a whole new ball game.
Trying for a baby in your late 30s or early 40s tends to be an all-encompassing project that focuses the minds of both parties on the prospect of impending parenthood. Need to grow up: Many men would rather play computer games than face up to being a parent
There are discussions about what day of the week you will both be free from your hectic schedules for a romantic night in, and when your most fertile time of the month might be. And if just trying for a baby becomes a chore, how must that make even the most supportive man view fatherhood? Once you reach the age where your love life requires plotting things on charts, then I'm afraid to say you are in very choppy waters.LAST CHANCEOne birth in 20 in London hospitals is to a mother over 40, with 25,000 deliveries for the over-40s in 2011-12
I'm not too unhappy to be childless now. I have a wonderful life for a 41-year-old and I have learned to be grateful. But it is an attitude I have had to cultivate, striving to be positive about something I once grieved over.Recently, a girlfriend in her 20s told me she was feeling broody but felt it was too early to ask her new husband to have kids. I wanted to yell: 'Then don't ask him!'Feeling all that resentment surge back, I felt a shameful urge to tell her to secretly stop taking the Pill.But I restrained myself and said: 'Don't assume he's going to want them more as the years go on.'In fact, from my own experience, I would warn girls like her that the older men get, the sad likelihood is that they'll want them less.

No idea why women think they can change men and vice versa, years into a relationship. I asked my now husband, at 21, if he wanted kids 1 week after we started dating. We discussed exactly what we wanted out of our futures. We wanted the same things so we knew from the beginning that years down the track neither of us would be forced to give up our dream of being parents or forced to have kids we didn't want (inevitable leading to divorce). Why do people fear asking their partner the big questions? This is how people end up wasting years on a person they barely knew or assumed had wanted what they wanted when they never even asked.

"Men have no back bone and are totally freaked by the idea of commitment..." twinsatourhouse, London, 22/5/2013 18:36. Generalize much? As a man, I'd like to get married and have children. The problem my buddies and I seem to run into is women who aren't faithful. One after another, it's the same story over and over again. Maybe we're ahead of our time or maybe we just have bad luck. I honestly don't know. You and I live in completely different worlds.

I find this article very sad. I sympathise with both parties. It really sucks that women can run out of time before they meet a man who is genuinely committed. I was married to a commitment phone. Go figure.

Life is too short!!!!!! Ladies, if he does not show an interest in marriage or children with you within the first 3-6 months say bye bye and keep on looking. You will eventually find someone who is just as eager to settle! Another thing is, play the field. Make a lot of guy friends and find out if any of them want children. 55

I think if he doesn't want a child you need to get out and find another. I found another, at 35. It can happen. There are men who want children too, but they will admit that just like you do. Had a stayed with my partner of 7 years I would never have had my darling son. I agree though with you. It wasn't about my glittering career and my selfishness, it was all about finding the right man and not a moment too late.

This generation is a selfish generation. We the baby boomers unfortunately are the cause of them not wanting children. Too many women leave it too late. No one wants to be a mother in their forties if truth be known.
I see too many older women, who look like grandmothers waiting outside schools for their children. I feel terribly sorry for the children as their parents cannot do as much as someone in their early thirties or late twenties.
Children need the energy of young parents not two old fogies at home.

Of course people may not be in a position to try for a child when they are in their 20's/early 30's. Kate Garraway was merely saying don't assume you can easily conceive later on.

The reason you get married is to have children. Sadly, children of single women will grow up more disadvantaged than those of married parents. This woman waited too long... if your desire in life is to have children, start earlier. I get quite tired of all the whining and moaning. 46

Thousands of British children are taken into care each year, isn't it time we invested in prevention rather than cure?

Comment:
Following Baby P the number children taken for physical abuse over the last 4 years actually FELL by 22%, and sexual abuse by 25%(nspcc figures) ! So what increased?Why "emotional abuse" of course(by 70%) ,disproving the theory that Baby P somehow caused extra precautions to be put in place
Parents who have committed NO CRIME are punished by removing their babies at birth for "risk of emotional abuse" and are jailed if they protest publicly .The fostering and adoption agencies have huge financial interest in promoting care; their care !.Politicians say "there is no evidence that children are taken unnecessarily" But every time new cases by the hundred are presented to them they reply "we cannot comment on individual cases",They always avoid discussing the gag put on parents to stop public protest and similarly they forbid any mention of the case to children at contact. Reforms?Well,abolish the gagging and apply the criminal justice system to family courts so that we get justice!

Miranda Kerr in the £1.6¿million Fantasy Treasure Bra, encrusted with yellow diamonds and pearls, in last year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show
Every November in New York, fantasy becomes reality when several of the world’s most beautiful women take to the catwalk in stunning lingerie for the famous Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.The most gloriously over-the-top occasion in the fashion calendar sees ‘Angels’ including Miranda Kerr showcase unique, diamond-studded confections, complete with wings.The £8 million show, which is televised in America and watched later on YouTube by millions of men unlucky enough to live elsewhere, has ensured the brand’s name is synonymous with glamour and sex appeal. Yet it is a phenomenon British women have been unable to participate in – until now. This autumn, the first Victoria’s Secret shops will open here, one in the new Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London, and a large flagship store in the West End’s New Bond Street. But while the brand’s glittering success is well known, far less so is the tragic story behind its creation. It was the brainchild of Californian business graduate Roy Raymond, who was inspired by an embarrassing shopping trip for underwear for his wife. As the label took over America, he lost it all, having sold the business before it reached its peak. For would-be entrepreneurs in the US, Mr Raymond’s tale is a cautionary one. He is referred to in the hit film The Social Network as a symbol of the dangers of failing to understand the potential of an idea. He was unable to recreate his early success with other projects, and according to his former wife, Gaye, he could not cope, developing depression and eventually taking his own life. More...

The Raymonds opened their first shop in Palo Alto in northern California in 1977, naming it after the period of the house they were living in at the time. ‘Our original idea was to have a store where men felt comfortable shopping for lingerie. It all began when Roy went shopping for me, and felt out of place in a lingerie store. Victoria’s Secret tried to change that,’ says Gaye, now 65 and an associate professor of physical therapy at Samuel Merritt University in Oakland, California. Flagship: The first UK Victoria's Secret store on London's Bond Street was meant to open in time for the Olympic but it has now been delayed until the Autumn
‘The Victoria’s Secret we founded was an upscale sophisticated lingerie store that I designed to look like a Victorian drawing room, complete with Oriental rugs and antique armoires displaying the wares. ‘I remember making the velvet curtains for the first changing rooms. We used a lot of silk and natural fibres in our lingerie, and it was very high quality.’ They had five successful shops by 1982, when they sold the operation for £2.6 million to Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of The Limited clothing chain. ‘My husband Roy had spoken to Les Wexner a few times about working together, but ultimately Roy felt he couldn’t share decision-making, and was happier getting out completely,’ says Gaye. Victoria's Secret founder Roy Raymond who tragically took his own life in 1993He began a new business called My Child’s Destiny, a shop selling children’s products, but in 1986 it went
bankrupt. He invested more than £650,000 of his own money into the business and never incorporated it, which meant that when it went under he was personally liable for its debts. The couple lost two homes and their cars Anguished but determined to recapture his initial success, he poured his energy into one idea after another, starting with a children’s book shop. Roy
and Gaye divorced in 1993, by which time Victoria’s Secret had become the biggest US lingerie retailer. Roy tried another venture: a mail-order home-repair hardware business. It failed in a year. He also began working for a company that made wigs for women who had lost their hair due to cancer treatment. ‘He
went through a couple of business failures and I think he suffered depression,’ says Gaye. ‘He borrowed a lot of money from his mother. He was trying to start another company but things didn’t go well, and he saw only one way out.
‘It’s so sad, because he was young, creative, really a brilliant businessman, but he suffered setbacks and couldn’t seem to bounce back from them. He felt he couldn’t go on.’
Mr Raymond threw himself off San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge in August 1993. He was 46 years old.The brand has changed dramatically since it was created by the Raymonds. ‘It’s no longer high-end fashion focused on fit, quality and fibre, but it’s now more popular, with a lower price and aimed at a far younger crowd,’ says Gaye. ‘Roy and I used to have our regrets about how much it had changed from our original vision. Yet they’ve done a great job making it a commercial success.’The launch of the catwalk shows in 1995 made the brand iconic. Originally, the ‘Runway Angels’ were established supermodels, including Helena Christensen and Tyra Banks, but today Angel status is a career-maker. More recent Angels include Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Adriana Lima, Marisa Miller and Alessandra Ambrosio.

The shows are spectacular. Last year,
Miranda Kerr sashayed down the catwalk wearing a £1.6 million Fantasy Treasure Bra, encrusted with yellow diamonds and pearls, to a standing ovation from her husband, actor Orlando Bloom. Rappers Kanye West and Jay-Z performed.Adriana Lima, whose pre-show regime involves consuming only liquid protein for nine days, has said: ‘Becoming an Angel was a dream come true. It opens up so many doors – everyone knows your name.’ The
event has been accused of rampant commercialism. In 2002, women’s groups described it as a ‘soft-core porn infomercial’, and commentators have questioned whether its frequent use of models who have recently given birth – including Kerr and Doutzen Kroes – is a ploy to garner more column inches. Yet as a
brand-building enterprise, Victoria’s Secret has been one of the most successful ever. There are now more than 1,000 stores in the US as well
as branches in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. English Rose: Rosie Huntington Whiteley in a Victoria's Secret lingerie shoot and on the catwalk

Frances
Harder, president of the Fashion Business Institute in Los Angeles, who
previously designed lingerie for the label, says: ‘Victoria’s Secret is
a very good branding story. They bring quality and sex appeal without being tacky.’ The brand’s fame means that when Victoria’s Secret arrives in Britain, where until now it has been available only from a small concession at Heathrow Airport, it will have a ready-made audience. In
the past few years, the British underwear market has grown exponentially. It is now worth £3.4 billion, with women spending an average of £71 a year on lingerie – more than the French. The nation’s current bestselling single line is Elle Macpherson Intimates, which specialises in pretty, flirtatious styles. ‘Victoria’s Secret is a winning combination of sex, fantasy and fashion,’ says Sarah Harris, fashion features editor of Vogue UK. ‘There’s huge potential for it to be a hit here because there’s a strong demand from British women for glamorous lingerie.’ Angels: Alessandra Ambrosio, front left, and Adriana Lima, front right, during last year's show. Lima has revealed that in preparation for each year's show she refuses solid food and lives off protein shakes for nine days
Lima, second left, shown with fellow Angels Selita Ebanks, Alessandra Ambrosio, Heidi Klum, and Izabel Goulart said becoming a Victoria's Secret Angel was a dream come true'
Following the demise of La Senza last year, there is a gap in the British market for a youthful, glamorous label with its own shops, rather than sold in department stores. ‘I can see Victoria’s Secret doing very well in Britain,’ says Honor Westnedge, retail analyst at Verdict. ‘By opening a shop in New Bond Street, they’re aiming towards the premium end of the market, and I imagine they’ll raise their prices accordingly. The success of Calvin Klein and Elle Macpherson Intimates shows women are prepared to pay more for quality.’ The launch of the flagship London store is expected to be attended by several Angels, who will appear in yet another catwalk extravaganza. Judging by the success of the brand so far, British women will soon not be able to remember a time when they didn’t buy their underwear from their local Victoria’s Secret store.

Very overpriced and ill fitting. I don't understand the appeal -other than the girls that I know at work buy the brand because they have no sense of style and think buying something that says "Pink" and costs $80 for a pair of sweat bottoms make you stylish??? This brand has become cheap and made for girls with NO fashion sense. 31

I shopped in one of the original stores in San Francisco on Union St and fell in love with the idea of beautiful lingerie presented on the first floor of a genuine Victorian house. It was a tactile shopping experience that I have never seen duplicated.

VS is now mega-trashy and ultra-cheap, so should be a perfect fit for most British women. The only question is whether any of them are thin enough to fit into the underwear on sale. Perhaps they'll introduce a new plus-size (Small, Medium, Large & Dump Truck) so the average beer-and-chips-guzzling British woman can squeeze her badly tattooed bulk into them. 42
