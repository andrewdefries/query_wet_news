If the polls are right, this will go down in history as a day of inspiration and hope - the day when Americans voted their first black President into power. A victory for Barack Obama will show the world that the American Dream of equal opportunity for all - black or white, rich or poor - is no mere Hollywood fantasy, but a fact of life in the land of the free. Who could have imagined, during the race riots of the 1960s, that our generation would live to see an African-American on the very threshold of the Oval Office? What a hugely exciting prospect this is - and what enormous credit it reflects on American democracy. 'Obama has defeated the formidable Clinton machine and thrown the Republicans into panic' Above all, Mr Obama's election will offer a genuine opportunity to restore Washington's moral authority, so tragically undermined during George Bush's eight trigger-happy years in the White House. It will give the U.S. the chance to rebuild bridges all over the world, from Europe and the Muslim Middle East to the developing nations of Africa and Asia. That can only be good for the West. But not only does Obama's standing in the polls speak well of the American people. It tells us a great deal, too, about the qualities of the candidate himself. In the course of the longest and most gripping election campaign in living memory, Obama has defeated the formidable Clinton machine and thrown the Republicans into panic. Meanwhile, he has injected new life into the democratic process, encouraging millions to vote for the first time (in spite of some nasty tricks by his opponents) in what many predict will be the highest turnout for 100 years. That in itself speaks volumes for the charisma of the man now knocking at history's door. True, the Mail has its reservations. Mesmerising though Obama's speeches may be, they have told us very little about either his policies or his principles. With his gifts for acting and oratory, there may be rather too much of the Tony Blair about him for many people's tastes. There are worries, too, about his lack of experience - particularly in foreign affairs and economics (though he has had the good sense to gather some wise men about him since the world financial crisis erupted). Indeed, veteran America-watchers have detected disturbing echoes of that one-term wonder, Jimmy Carter, in the euphoria surrounding the 2008 Democratic campaign. Remember how the former peanut farmer swept to power in 1976 on a tide of goodwill, only to be booted back to obscurity four years later, unmourned and all but forgotten? But Obama has a great deal more going for him than most presidential candidates before him. All over the world, people are willing him to succeed and to prove himself worthy to be trusted with the most powerful job on the planet. He can also draw comfort from the fact that history has tended to smile on presidents who come to power at times of economic hardship. Look at Franklin Roosevelt, elected four times, or Ronald Reagan, who served two terms. Of course, there is still just a chance that John McCain will surprise the world by snatching victory at this 11th hour. It wouldn't be the first time the polls had got it spectacularly wrong. Nor would this necessarily be bad for America and the West. For McCain is an honourable man, with a distinguished record of defending our freedoms. But the Mail firmly hopes that by tomorrow morning, the U.S. will have its first ever black President-elect, as an example to Britain and the world of the true meaning of democracy, equality of opportunity - and hope.

Rooney or Suarez? It's a no-brainer. Looking good in the most average Liverpool side in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player… people forget how good our Wayne actually is

You’re Carlo Ancelotti. You’re deciding who would be the better signing – Wayne Rooney or Luis Suarez. It’s a no-brainer. Rooney is miles ahead.In fact I wonder how good Luis Suarez actually is. He’s got quality and ability – probably more than most. But looking good in the Dutch league and standing out in one of the most average Liverpool sides I’ve seen in my lifetime does not constitute a top-level player. I watched him closely at the Confederations Cup and he had little impact. An enforced rest bit a huge chunk out of the end of his club season, so I expected a fresh and energized Suarez to take the tournament by storm. Instead it was Forlan who looked the better player, with Cavani finding the net in the latter stages. Little impact: Luis Suarez could not help Uruguay make the Confederations Cup final Get up: Giorgio Chiellini gestures towards Suarez after he had his penalty appeal turned down in the Confederations Cup
Below par: Suarez has performed well in a weak Dutch league and an average Liverpool team
Suarez and Rooney have similar international records, but in comparing the two, the big difference is that Rooney has stood the test of time at a massive club with the very highest expectations. Suarez just has to be 'good' at Liverpool to win over the fans who are desperate for a new hero after years of underachievement. At United, Rooney is obliged to make a massive contribution to a side winning trophies. And he did just that. We don’t have many top-class players from England so you would think we would treasure the rare ones that come along to light up our game. People
seem to have forgotten just how good a footballer Wayne Rooney actually
is. I suspect United won’t know how good he is and how big a contribution he makes until it is too late. If he goes… Top of the class: Wayne Rooney has performed consistently well for United over a number of seasons On the move? Rooney, who enjoyed a weekend at Glastonbury, has his heart set on leaving Manchester United after a talk with David Moyes

Premier League clubs are failing England's young LionsPremier League academies are failing football and the national team. All clubs need to take a long hard look at their youth set-ups and question what they’re doing. For England Under 20s to finish bottom of their World Cup group without winning a game, shows something is seriously wrong with the system. Same goes for the Under 21s and even the national side. Premier League clubs’ academies are an absolute joke, they need to produce better players or they need to be accountable. The analysis of the U20s failure has been lamentable, so-called experts choosing to focus on England finishing so far behind war-torn Iraq, rather than looking at the football reasons for failure. Do they think having a war in England is the answer? I doubt it, but things we can’t affect shouldn’t distract us. Let’s focus on the reasons we’re so bad. Poor summer: Harry Kane and the England U20s finished bottom of their group
Missed opportunity: Larnell Cole did not star for England out in Turkey
The U20s problems were the same ones we’ve had for years. The players stayed in their positions too rigidly, and that meant when we were in possession there were few realistic options on the ball. Players were closed down or too far apart for the kind of passing game we need if we are to move forward as a football nation. That’s down to Peter Taylor’s archaic coaching.But an equally worrying problem was the fact that some of the England U20s couldn’t control the football. On 10 minutes Larnell Cole snatched at a chance when Harry Kane was totally unmarked to his left. On 25 minutes Kane failed to control a simple pass when he was in on goal, the ball ballooning miles off his toe. On 27 minutes Cole made an opening on the right but Kane and Luke Williams were in the middle standing touch tight to defenders - no clever movement, no dynamism from either of them.On 45 minutes Ross Barkley pinged the ball out of play under no pressure with a terrible pass and a promising move broke down. On 53 minutes keeper Sam Johnstone boomed the ball high into the Turkish sky and unsurprisingly Kane didn’t win it so England gave up possession.For the first Egypt goal captain Conor Coady turned his back and bought a dummy, he looked scared of the ball – it seems they don’t make them like they used to in Liverpool.For the second it was a two-on-two and both England defenders (one of them, Eric Dier, came through Sporting Lisbon’s academy) went to the ball, and the unmarked Egyptian scored. Basic stuff. Looking good: James Ward-Prowse was one England player to do well

Even some of England’s better players in the final game against Egypt – Barkley, John Stones, James Ward-Prowse (headsgone from Taylor taking the Southampton kid off) and Cole – showed little signs of having the kind of ability on the ball that will have an impact at the very top level, I mean the highest level.Harry Kane’s first touch was usually his last. He headed a golden chance straight at the keeper, and then missed the target from 3 yards out towards the end. He’s been educated at Tottenham’s academy for several years so how embarrassing for such a big club that Spurs have a player from their system who cannot control a football. I will point out that Spurs have a 21-year-old called Tom Carroll who looks really composed on the ball but even if he becomes a regular, he’s the exception that proves the rule - Tottenham’s record of establishing players from their youth academy in their first team is disgraceful. The last was Ledley King, who made his debut last century. They’re not the only club. In 2009 Arsene Wenger said Academy product Sanchez Watt, who had just scored on his Gunners debut, was 'close to the first team.' He didn’t just say he was 'promising', or 'had talent', or some loose generic comment of positivity so as not to demoralise a player who was never going to make it. He said Watt, a Londoner, was close to the first team. Watt made a permanent move to Colchester this summer, so what went wrong? This is a player capable of dynamic runs, unpredictability, he could make things happen on the pitch, Wenger described him as a “street player”, the Spanish press claimed Barcelona had been watching him. Having represented England at various youth levels, the progress stopped. Why?Southampton have an ambitious, long-term aim of 50 per cent of the first team being Academy products but apart from Saints which other clubs care passionate about producing quality young English players? If some of you are reading this thinking that the clubs don’t have a duty to the England team, well yes they do. The Football Association contributes financially to player development and significantly subsidises the cost of courses for coaches at clubs.The FA are well aware of their role in turning young English players into top class professionals – but it seems the clubs are not.Each Premier League outfit should take a leaf out of Bayern Munich’s book – their target every year is to provide two players good enough for the Bayern first team from their youth system, two good enough for top flight football, and two more good enough to be professionals. If only English clubs cared as much about their academies. Jesus could be the next Waddle or RobertsonThe penchant for narrow midfields and 4-4-2 becoming unfashionable as well as ineffective, have seen the death of the orthodox winger. I loved those players; Forest’s John Robertson used to hug the touchline before pushing the ball past his full back, wrapping his left foot round the ball and slinging over a cross any hungry striker would devour. Chris Waddle would play on the right and come in on his favoured left – defenders didn’t know if they were coming or going. John Barnes teased full backs with tanstalising wingplay; Laurie Cunningham’s quick feet usually bamboozled whoever was in front of him. Exciting prospect: Manchester City's new signing Jesus Navas could play like wingers of old
Wing kings: John Robertson and Chris Waddle were two players who starred on the wing
That’s why I’m excited to see Jesus Navas in the Premier League next season. If he’s told to go out and express himself he could have a major impact. He runs with the ball, he’s fast, he can go either way – down the line or cut inside, and there’s a good chance of an end product. What a shame fellow Spaniard Isco chose not to join him, that’s a big blow for City.Cardiff breaking the bank for Cornelius is hardly like Swansea signing MichuDenmark
sit fifth in their World Cup qualifying group after losing 4-0 at home to
Armenia three weeks ago. It was, by his own admission, the lowest point
in manager Morten Olsen’s career, and Danish icon Peter Schmeichel described the result and performance as the 'worst ever.'Seems strange then that the man who led the line for Denmark that night has just become Cardiff City’s record signing, and at the same time has become the man trusted with firing the goals to keep Bluebirds (Redbirds?) in the Premier League next season. New boy: Andreas Cornelius has joined Cardiff for a club record fee of £8.5m
Star signing: Swansea signed Michu for £2m last summer
The £8.5million capture of striker Andreas Cornelius may turn out to be a good one, but it’s not exactly outshone Swansea’s capture of Michu in the scouting stakes. Good
luck to him, I hope he doesn’t turn out to be Cardiff’s version of Mauro Boselli who left relegated Wigan this week three years and no Premier League goals after a £6m move from Estudiantes.Where are the white stripes?Still on the subject of Cardiff City, there was uproar when they switched from blue to red shirts last year, and yet nobody seems to have said much about Southampton’s change of kit. Last summer Saints celebrated entering the Premier League by losing the thick red and white striped kit that has been synonymous with the club for well over a hundred years. Where are the stripes? Southampton have revealed their all red kit
They introduced an all-red top with a white pin stripe. The criticism wasn’t loud.This season it’s an all red shirt with no stripes. It’s just not Southampton Football Club and while there is a fans’ campaign to ‘Save Our Stripes,’ it seems people like me who like to hold on to some sort of sentimental link to football’s history and traditions are in the minority these days.

I can't believe this article is it meant to be serious? Rooney is playing like some old has been, his performances for club and country are mediocre at best.Suarez on the other hand has been a revelation scoring more goals and getting more assists than Rooney in fact it is a firm belief by many people he would have been player of the year had he not got up to his moments of madness. 6

I thought it said "Adrian Durham, no brain" not that would of been more realistic, or and Adrian please remember Rooney is a Man Utd player who is selected for England, not the other way around.

Good article as usual, especially on England saw some of the games Taylor did not have a clue sticking to the 442 with no movement. They looked basic skills and did not have a clue, the clubs need to take responsibility helping the young players. I remember Watt coming through at Arsenal when young looked a promising player but not looked after and helped to progress.
Excellent comparison of Rooney and Suarez, so many do not understand it judging by the comments.

Adrian, you talk such so much sense most of the time but your weakness is your rampant, myopic Anglophilia.
If you honestly believe that Wayne Rooney is more talented than Suarez then seriously, you need help.

Sebastian Vettel will continue to risk the wrath of Formula One fans after vowing to carry on with his trademark celebration.The German, who stands on the verge of his fourth consecutive title, marks each of his victories with a one-fingered salute.But the routine celebration has angered a number of the sport’s followers and is considered a key element in the German’s diminishing popularity. Pointing the finger: Vettel's performs his trademark celebration in Korea last time out
Sticking to his guns: The German is adamant he will not change his ways
‘We have had a little bit of a chat as some people for some reason seem to get offended,’ said the Red Bull driver when asked about the celebration ahead of Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix. ‘But I think the most important thing is you are who you are and stick to that.’For Vettel to become only the third driver after Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher to clinch a quartet of consecutive drivers’ championships he must win and hope that Fernando Alonso finishes outside the top eight.Alonso has told Ferrari to raise their game if he is to have a chance of denying Vettel the title and his fifth straight victory after wins in Belgium, Italy, Singapore and Korea.After Friday’s practice sessions — topped by Vettel — Alonso was way down in 10th and said: ‘In terms of competitiveness, we are not in the position we wanted. Problems: Alonso is not happy with the performance of his Ferrari
‘We definitely need to improve because we were not at a good level. We need to raise our game.’A disappointed Alonso, 77 points adrift of Vettel and standing in the last-chance saloon when it comes to his championship chances, added: ‘Mercedes, Red Bull, Lotus, they are in front of us, and they should not be.’Alonso did not help his own cause, though, as he was one of many who suffered an incident on a track widely regarded as the best in F1, but also the most unforgiving.Whereas many current circuits have considerable run-off areas to aid a driver when he makes a mistake, Suzuka has many gravel traps and Alonso was fortunate to avoid one as he spun off at one stage. He added: ‘Luckily, when I spun I didn’t ruin the tyres. We must now put together a series of changes we have in mind for the final part of qualifying. It’s important to start from the front.’Lewis Hamilton was only sixth in his Mercedes and with a time three tenths of a second slower than his leading best in first practice.Despite that, Hamilton was relatively satisfied as he said: ‘I’m happy with where our car is after the first practice sessions. We would love to be more competitive, but we’ve some work to do, on the tyre management in particular.’For a driver whose F1 future is in doubt, McLaren’s Sergio Perez did himself no favours by slamming sideways into a tyre barrier at one of Suzuka’s renowned turns, the Spoon Curve.

No pain, no gain! The Rock grimaces as he works on his incredible muscles in between takes of new Hercules movie

When it comes to the biggest stars in Hollywood, few can beat The Rock in terms of literal size.And it seems The Rock has upped his muscle even more for his role in the upcoming Hercules movie, judging by his incredible physique in pictures posted on his Twitter over the past week.The first image shows the 41-year-old actor grimacing in pain while pulling down weighted cables to work on his upper arm muscles. No pain, no gain! The Rock grimaces in pain as he works on his famous muscles in between takes on the set of his new Hercules movie
Going shirtless, The Rock, whose real
name is Dwayne Johnson, flexes his body and displays his large and intricate tattoo across his chest, shoulder and arm. Another frame shared by the actor shows just his bulging bicep, complete with fake scars, as he sits in the hair and make-up trailer. The image also appears to show that bald-headed Dwayne will sport a wig to play the Greek demigod in Hercules: The Thracian Wars, due for release in July 2014. That's just his ARM! Another snap shows the muscle man's bulging bicep and his long-haired wig
Leg day: The Rock, real name Dwayne Johnson, clearly doesn't hold back when it comes to his workouts
Brett Ratner is directing the film, which is also set to star Rufus Sewell as Autolycus, the son of Olympian god Hermes.
Dwayne's career is going from strength to strength, and the actor has recently appeared in movies such as G.I. Joe: Retaliation, in which he appears with Bruce Willis, and Fast & Furious 6, which also features Vin Diesel. And WWE manager Paul Heyman insists that the actor deseres a 'ton of credit' for his career so far. Sneak peek: He also shared a picture of some of the props involved in his role as Hercules
It takes a lot of work to look this good! Dwayne also shared a picture of his seven meals, and one shake, which he eats every day
When asked what he thought of The Rock's movies, Paul cheekily said: 'I think The Rock deserves a ton of credit for carrying all of these movies with guys like Bruce Willis or Vin Diesel.'
Perhaps The Rock's most impressive co-star to date, however, will be Arnold Schwarzenegger, amid reports he
is set to star alongside the former Californian governor in Terminator 5. According to The Examiner, the company which owns the rights to the Terminator series is developing a script with a villainous role specifically for him. Set in the 1940s and 1950s, Terminator 5 is expected to focus on the parents of Sarah Connor – who the titular character attempts to assassinate in the original 1984 movie
- before she was born. Schwarzenegger – who plays the lead character - has already confirmed he will be returning for the next Terminator installment but he is not expected to portray a robot. Instead, he will play a man whose ability to protect the Connor clan inspired the design of the robot in the original movie. Quite the appetite: The Rock shared the details of his high-protein diet plan
