Happy Monday! Why today is the happiest day of the year... apparently

Comment:
Happiest Day - NO! It may be for some but not here. My job of 16 years finished before Xmas & hubby is out of work- no money coming in whatsoever. Have been writing "begging" letters to "possible" employers today. Have lost 5 members of my family since December (including my Mother) with another funeral tomorrow. So no, I'm not happy, feeling downright depressed and personally can't see any happiness ahead at the moment.

Most of that jiggly stuff is extra skin. She was a big girl and lost a lot of weight. All that skin doesn't just disappear. I agree though, a two piece may not have been the most flattering choice.

'Lotto lout' who blew huge �9million win stole sandwich and Strongbow worth �11 from supermarket

It just annoys me why certain lotto winners throw away everything because they're dim. I enter the lottery every week like millions of other people and what I'd give to have just £1million let alone £9million. I mean what did Mr Brainded here actually DO with £9million and still get done for theft? What a Cretin!!

Notre Dame quarterback arrested and pepper sprayed after 'attacking cop at drunken party'
Author of reported comment:

Comment:
This is why it's crazy to have the drinking age 21! It's a total joke and no one thinks that kids are going to go to college and not attend parties and not drink!
It's time to put the age back to 18 and stop making criminals out of our college age children!!!
This is a huge moneymaker for cities!! Sure they all ran---but why were they chased by the cops?
With all the crime in South Bend lately you would think----
The South Bend police should have better things to do than chasing college students at a party! Town vs. gown deal!!

The 34 NHS staff who saved man whose body was held together with a BLANKET after he was hit by a 15 tonne lorry and declared dead TWICE

Comment:
Its not just the staff, heroic though they are. This man must have had the most immense will to live, its just unimaginable that he has survived such a massive trauma. The human body certainly has the most remarkable powers. I am just amazed at this article, he looks so well, I just really hope the animals that did this to him get caught and imprisoned for a very long time. Good luck in the future Lewis

NY Mayor Bloomberg will BAN Styrofoam containers because it's almost impossible to recycle Author of reported comment:

Comment:
take responsibility for our earth, the ONLY earth we have. Suck up your selfish ways and get used to change because it NEEDS to happen. Your children, your grandchildren, your neighbors children, complete strangers...their future is rapidly deteriorating because of us. If you are so terribly upset that you can't eat your leftovers from styrofoam, go reevaluate your life and maybe go take a walk in central, or bryant park . look hard and take in the beauty that we could potentially save. I think he deserves respect--He is working to make our world a little better. What are you doing besides bashing him???
