Oops... Astronaut loses tool bag while carrying out DIY repairs on ISS spacewalkBy

It's a common question voiced by many exasperated DIY enthusiasts... just where did I put my tool bag? For one astronaut, making repairs to the International Space Station, the answer was unfortunately into infinity.Lead spacewalker Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper was working on restoring full power to the orbital outpost when she lost her vital kit, 200 miles above Earth.The astronaut from the Endeavour shuttle had realised one of the grease guns she was using had leaked, soiling her glove. Enlarge
US space shuttle Endeavour Mission Specialist Steve Bowen (C) works at the starboard truss of the International Space Station. He leant tools to his fellow astronaut after her tool bag floated away Lost in space... Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper could only watch in dismay as her tool bag flew into space Then, as she attempted to wipe the grease from her hands, the bag containing her tools floated off into space.'Oh, great,' said Stefanyshyn-Piper, who was making her third spacewalk. 'You see it?' Crewmates monitoring the spacewalk from inside the shuttle spied the bag drifting past the station and off into space. Thankfully experts believe it will eventually spiral down into Earth's atmosphere where it will burn up.Dr Ian Crawford, a space scientist at Birkbeck College, University of London, said: 'There is no danger to people on the ground. But until it burns up it could be a potential hazard to the space station and other space craft in orbit.'The bag contained two grease guns, scrapers and other equipment needed to begin fixing a 10-foot-wide rotary joint that positions the station's solar wing panels toward the sun for power.Astronauts last year discovered the joint was contaminated with metal filings, which NASA determined was because it was not lubricated enough.

Steven Bowen (pictured) and Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper spent nearly seven hours out in space Stefanyshyn-Piper borrowed tools from her fellow astronaut Stephen Bowen to finish the job. They spent nearly seven hours in open space on the first of four planned spacewalks.Earlier, the astronauts packed up an empty nitrogen tank for transport back to Earth and removed a cover from a window on Japan's Kibo laboratory. The shuttle and seven astronauts arrived at the space station Sunday to outfit the space station for an expanded six-member crew. Astronaut Sandra Magnus will replace Greg Chamitoff, who will return home on Endeavour, after five months aboard the space station.

The Space Shuttle Endeavour as it orbits Earth. The Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module is visible in the payload bayInside the shuttle and space station, astronauts scrambled to unpack a cargo canister hauled into orbit by Endeavour.Among the 14,000lbs of equipment taken up was a kitchen fridge, exercise machine, brand new toilet and a recycling system for converting urine into drinking water.With six people expected to be living on the station beginning in May, NASA needs to find a way to reuse water.Currently, the shuttle provides most of the station's water during its visits to the outpost. Water is produced as a byproduct of the shuttle's electrical system and transferred to the station.After eight more shuttle missions, NASA plans to retire the shuttle fleet and develop a new ship called Orion that can return astronauts to the moon. The space station, a $100 billion project of 16 nations, has been under construction for 10 years.Watch the moment Heidemarie loses her toolbag... Share or comment on this article

At the end of Roman Abramovich's nine-year wait for the biggest prize in global club football, Chelsea's billionaire owner went down to the changing rooms in Munich's magnificent Allianz Arena. There, The Mail on Sunday can reveal, he joined his joyous Chelsea players and spoke movingly about the 'journey' that the club have taken under his ownership since 2003. Euro stars: Di Matteo and Newton led Chelsea to Champions League gloryThe Russian oligarch, speaking through a translator, told the players of his 'pride' that the 'dream' of the European Cup had finally been achieved and said this gave him special pleasure 'because earlier this season it looked like this had slipped away'. Change at the top? May 19, 2012 Di Matteo and Newton lead Chelsea to Champions League glory June 30, 2012 Di Matteo and Newton's contracts at Chelsea will come to an endAbramovich then thanked not just his players but all the other staff, including interim manager Roberto Di Matteo and the Italian's old friend and long-time No 2, Eddie Newton. Yet, one week on from those dramatic scenes of joy, neither Di Matteo nor Newton are any the wiser about what they will be doing by July 1. For the two men who guided Chelsea to Champions League glory over Bayern Munich to help Abramovich fulfil his dream could be out of work on June 30. Di Matteo was Andre Villas-Boas's assistant before the Portuguese was sacked in March. Di Matteo stepped up to the No 1 role and immediately recruited Newton. But instead of merely steadying the ship, the two men embarked on one of the most remarkable caretaker stints ever seen. Pen pals: Chelsea players celebrate their Champions League victory over BayernFirst, they led Chelsea to an FA Cup final win over Liverpool, and then - having inspired the 'Miracle of the Nou Camp' as Chelsea eliminated Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final - they coaxed a team of ageing players to seize what might for many of them have been a last shot at major glory. Now, in an exclusive interview revealing what went on behind the scenes during the pair's astonishing stint managing a club they both love, Newton says: 'It really is a bittersweet pill. It's fantastic what we've done, but as for the future, it remains up in the air. There may be a job. 'There quite possibly won't be. The reality is we don't know. Nothing is fixed. Nothing has changed. The situation is we're contracted to the end of the season, June 30. 'Football can be a strange game. Things can go right and wrong. We're still digesting what we've done. But nobody at the club is telling us anything. We all want what's best for Chelsea, that goes without saying. But we have absolutely no idea what the club think that is.' Blue is the colour: Chelsea parade the European CupRewind eight days and the pre-final mood in the Chelsea camp was one of excitement and anticipation, with even those not involved - including suspended captain John Terry - relishing the challenge. Newton says that Di Matteo gave his manager's message at the team meeting before they travelled to the stadium. 'Then three of us - Robbie, myself and JT - were driving that dressing room before kick-off,' said Newton. Terry, the club captain, told his team-mates: 'To get this far has been a collective effort. It has been some journey, a huge amount of work and with sacrifices all round. Not all of us can play tonight but we all want to, and we'll be with you on the bench.' The game remained scoreless until Thomas Muller put Bayern ahead in the 83rd minute but Newton insists he still felt things might turn Chelsea's way. 'Even when Muller scored I wasn't thinking it was over,' he said. Worth the wait: Abramovitch waves to supporters'I'd just had a funny feeling all day. I don't mean it felt predestined or anything silly. I had this calm aura. I didn't say anything to anybody else but I had this inkling something special was happening.' Chelsea won a late corner, taken by Juan Mata, and Didier Drogba headed home for 1-1 with two minutes of normal time remaining. 'Didier took his chance. We were into extra-time and then penalties,' said Newton. Di Matteo and Newton had made a provisional list of who would take Chelsea's spot-kicks. As the last minutes of extra-time were played out, Di Matteo told Newton to write the names on a list, making amendments for players no longer on the field. Everyone who took a kick - Mata, David Luiz, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Drogba - knew they would be asked and were ready. 'We'd been practising for penalties since reaching the FA Cup final, with everyone working on the strategy that you pick your spot and stick to it,' said Newton. 'We'd varied the keepers in training to mix it up psychologically, taking against [Petr] Cech and Hilario and Ross [Turnbull]. But nothing can prepare you for the intensity of the real thing when the world is watching.' Mata's spot-kick was saved by Manuel Neuer but when Ivica Olic and Bastian Schweinsteiger missed theirs, Drogba had one kick to win the cup. 'As Olic stepped up, JT says to me, "He's not looking confident. I think he's going to miss this",' recalled Newton. 'Olic messed up and we all just grabbed each other. Schweinsteiger hit the post and Didier stepped up. 'This was it now. This kick. JT stood on one side of me with [Branislav] Ivanovic on the other. And as Didier walked up they gripped me either side so tight, squeezing hold with tension, that I thought, "My rib cage is going to go here!". There was so, so much pressure. Monumental performance: Didier Drogba struck the winner'Didier scored. Unbelievable. I can't find the words. I don't even think it has sunk in yet. I hugged JT and he didn't want to let go. He buried his head into my neck and he just held on so tight. 'Even as he was doing it, it crossed my mind that there must have been a part of quite a few of these guys who'd harboured doubts whether they were ever going to achieve what had just happened. The floodgates opened and there was just an incredible outpouring of emotion.' Terry had started the match in his suit but at some stage he nipped away and put his Chelsea kit on. 'I don't know when,' Newton says. 'He was wearing his suit then the next minute he was next to me in his kit.'Terry has been ridiculed for that quick switch and for playing a part in lifting the European Cup but Newton insists that was always on the cards, with the blessing of every last person at Chelsea. The goal that crowned Chelsea champions of Europe: Drogba beats Manuel Neuer'When JT went up to help lift the trophy it was no issue whatsoever,' said Newton. 'You don't cherry-pick some incidents and forget all the rest. Everyone within the club knows what he has done for Chelsea. Nobody doubted for a single second he would be there if he won to collect the cup and nobody begrudged it. 'JT has been Chelsea since he was 14 or so. He was never shy of standing up and tackling a big name back then and he has never shirked anything for Chelsea since. Of course, there are people who have their views on him but he has always stepped to the fore for Chelsea.'The celebrations eventually moved from the pitch to the dressing room. Music was pumping, champagne was being quaffed and sprayed. Then the revellers noticed that Abramovich had just entered the room, quietly, with a shy smile on his face. Drogba switched off the music. 'Then Didier started to address the trophy,' said Newton. 'He said, "Oh beautiful cup, we got close to you in a semi-final before but the moment was taken away. We got close in a final and it was taken away. Finally, you're ours".' Not shy: John Terry (second left) has always stepped up for Chelsea Newton says the happy throng urged Abramovich to address them. The billionaire was reticent at first. Then he said: 'Many of the squad have been on a long journey to reach this dream. In the earlier rounds, and in the semi-final and final, it seemed like it would slip away. But together we have reached our goal.' 'It was a moving speech,' said Newton. Newton says that from the moment Di Matteo took over on March 4 and called him, the plan was simple: to use the experience in the dressing room to get the best from what was left of the season. Newton says: 'I don't want to write anyone off because even some of the senior players can still have important roles at Chelsea for seasons ahead. But Lamps is 33, JT is 31, Drogba is 34 and it was always going to be his last season at Chelsea. Ashley Cole is 31, Paulo Ferreira is 33, Meireles is 29.'If you accept that the peak years of a footballer are 27 to 30 and that you're at least in the later stages of your career once you hit 30, then it's not a surprise that some of these players are wondering whether these occasions are their last big shot at something.' The same could be said, of course, for Di Matteo and Newton. They stepped to the fore for Chelsea. And now they wait to see what happens next. More...

Farrah Abraham has checked into rehab in an attempt to deal with her alcohol abuse. The MTV Teen Mom star - who caused controversy when she filmed a porn film this year - told Radar Online that she's checking into an outpatient facility in Florida.'At this time in my life, I need to stay focused on the positive to get through all of the negative that a DUI has caused in my life,' she said. In rehab: Teen Mom star Farrah Abraham has checked into rehab to deal with her alcohol abuse issues The Backdoor Teen
Mom, who is mother to Sophia, four, star will undergo counselling over the next 10 days at the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The reality star was arrested for DUI in March. She was pulled over in Omaha, Nebraska with a blood alcohol level of .147, which is nearly twice the legal limit.Farrah told the website: 'I'm
22 and I want to make better choices and ensure I can recognize when I am putting myself in a bad situation next time.' Plea deal: Farrah pleaded guilty to avoid jail time over her March DUI, and has also been ordered to pay a $500 fine
She was placed on six months probation and ordered to take alcohol awareness classes after the arrest. According to Radar, Abraham's father, Mike, will be taking care of Sophia. According to TMZ, the judge in Farrah's case required Farrah not to have a single drink during her probation period.The
sex tape star also has to pay a $500 fine and have an ignition interlock device installed into her car, which will require her to submit a breath test before her engine will start.Farrah
has to blow into a breathalyzer to start her car until September 29, when all of her driving privileges will be reinstated.The mother-of-one had previously repeatedly said she was not guilty of the offense in April, both on the Dr. Phil show and in court. Drive safely: Farrah has to blow into a breathalyzer to start her car until her driving privileges are reinstatedShe was also charged with disorderly conduct and refusing to take a field sobriety test, though these charges
will apparently now be dropped.In March, Abraham was arrested for DUI
after allegedly blowing a .147, which is nearly twice the legal blood alcohol limit of .08 percent.
'Yes, I was drunk,' the 16 & Pregnant star told Dr. Phil in April. 'I was not driving. I was parked .
. . I drove around the corner and parked.'
Abraham continued: 'If I was still driving and then the cop pulled me over then, yeah, that's really driving drunk.'Earlier in the year, the reality show star also found herself caught in a series of lies about an alleged sex tape with porn star James Deen. Birthday cake with mom: Abraham had some birthday cake with her mom for their 22nd birthday, attempting to repair their fractured relationship
After claiming a sex tape did not exist before suddenly flip-flopping to admit it did, Abraham then claimed the tape was for a personal scrapbook.
However, her co-star Deen soon revealed the entire tape was orchestrated by the Teen Mom much to her frustration, leading the produced amateur adult film to be reportedly sold to Vivid Entertainment for $1.5 million dollars.Abraham recently celebrated her 22nd birthday by eating cake with her mom in an attempt to repair their relationship which had been fractured after the sale of her pornographic film, as well as clubbing in a number of Miami hotspots.
Still having a good time: Abraham also celebrated her 22nd birthday out at Miami nightclubs

Oh God, this poor girl is in such a mess, and I so very much hope she is able to get the help she needs - not least because, with all the trauma little Sophia has been through in her short life, she might well end up following the same path :( Farrah, please sort your life out and prioritise making sure your daughter grows up happy and stable and doesn't make the same mistakes as you. Mike and Debra take note!

Is it compulsory to go into rehab to be famous (or should that be infamous) now? There are plenty of people who manage to live their lives in the public eye without announcing to the world that they need rehab. 0
