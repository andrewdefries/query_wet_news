Working closely with the SPLENDA team, Nadia has also created a range of figure-friendly, simple recipes. Switching from sugar to SPLENDA is an easy swap which can make a big difference - One teaspoon of SPLENDA (0.5g) contains 2 kcal compared to a spoonful of sugar (5g) which contains 20 kcal. This means that switching just one spoonful of sugar to SPLENDA every day could save over 6,500 calories in a year. Seems like a no brainer to us.

'I miss you, I love you': Teenage daughter of tragic nurse who transferred radio prank phone call to Kate's hospital ward reveals her devastation over mother's death

Desperately sad for all concerned. Just wonder why this very expensive hospital, with many wealthy and famous clients, does not employ an experienced switch board operator to take calls during the night. The nurses are not trained to do this. The nurses should not have to leave their patients anyway.

What a fascinating catalogue that must be it's a shame nobody has reprinted it for those of us who can not afford the original. I wonder if it also includes items supplied to resistance groups by the SOE such as exploding cowpats and cycle pumps?

Troubled Olympic swimming legend Ian Thorpe was taken to hospital today after he was discovered 'acting oddly' in the street near his parents' home.Police were called to the street in Panania, south of Sydney, at around 3.15am by a neighbour who had seen a man behaving oddly near a vehicle.According to a report, officers found Thorpe, 31, sitting in his car a short distance away. He was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. Neighbours called police after seeing a man behaving suspiciously in the street: Officers discovered Ian Thorpe and he was taken to hospital
Back to the start: After spending nearly 18 months in Switzerland, Mr Thorpe returned to Australia just before Christmas and has been staying with his parents in Sydney
A police spokesman said: 'Emergency services were called to a home in Panania about 3.15am after concerns were raised about a man seen near a vehicle.'Police spoke to a man (who) was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. No official complaint has been made and no further police action is anticipate.' Thorpe has spoken of his battle with depression and alcohol and last week an Australian newspaper claimed that he was in rehab.However, his management later said that this was not true and he had been treated in hospital for a shoulder injury. ‘Following a fall at home on Tuesday, Ian was admitted to hospital after sustaining an injury to his shoulder,' said a spokesman. 'He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was discharged the following day.'The spokesman went on: 'On Sunday (Australian time) Ian was taken to Bankstown Hospital and then onto a rehabilitation clinic after being found disorientated and trying to get in to what he thought was a friend’s car. 'Ian had been on a series of pain killers and anti-depressants following surgery on his shoulder. No alcohol was involved and Ian was admitted to rehabilitation for his ongoing struggle with depression.' The five-time Olympic gold medallist wrote about his battle with 'crippling depression' in his 2013 biography. He revealed that at some of the worst times he turned to alcohol in a bid to quell the thoughts running about his head. Success: Thorpe, seen with his gold medal after winning the 200-meter freestyle at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian The 31-year-old dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years after winning his first World Championship in 1998, aged 14 The swimmer said he also felt the need to stay silent about his depression, thinking it was a 'character flaw'.'Not even my family is aware that I've spent a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as a crippling depression.’He admits in the book that he is ready to speak to his parents about his depression, but this is the first time he has been reported to have sought treatment.‘Yes, it's serious but there's not a lot I can or want to add,’ broadcaster Alan Jones, a close friend of Ian Thorpe told the Herald Sun.‘Ian is a beautiful person but he has difficulty recognising his problems.’After becoming the world's youngest male World Champion in the 1998 Perth World Championships, he dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years.He still holds the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian (five) and became the first person to win six golds in one championship in 2001.He took a break from swimming in 2004, after the Athens Olympics, but failed to make a comeback two years later due to illness and chose instead to retire.He attempted a comeback ahead of the London 2012 Olympics but only made it to the second day of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, and instead worked as a pundit for the BBC during the games.Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.

Depression is one of the most underrated illnesses in the world. You cannot just "give your self a shake" "cheer up" it cripples peoples every thought process and action. We as a society need a far better understanding on how to support people with real depression , it's not just waking up one day feeling a bit fed up. Just look at how many successful sports people have been treated for it in recent times and sadly how many have taken their lives. It's real it's horrible and it needs more investment in treatment and for the general public and employers to be far more supportive. 3

Amanda Holden showed her fruitier side when she appeared as a guest on The Paul O'Grady show on Thursday to promote her new book, No Holding Back.She was pictured handling some melons and a couple of pears after Paul brought in a greengrocer and challenged her to see who could guess the correct weight of the fruit. And no doubt the melons and pears brought back some memories for the star who said that her first Saturday job was working in a fruit and veg store in Bishops Waltham from the age of 13. Five a day: Amanda Holden was tasked with trying to guess the weight of two melons when she appeared on The Paul O'Grady Show on Thursday
Holden onto beauty: Amanda looked gorgeous in her LBD and snakeskin heels as she walked on set
Amanda, who was joined on the couch by Elkie Brooks and Joe Pasquale, told Paul that the book was 'torture' to write.She added that she put it together over a period of 13 months, writing a bit more every time her daughter, Holly took a two hour nap. And Paul said that he could hear Amanda's voice throughout, saying it was nice that she had written the book herself, unlike some other celebrities. What a pear: Amanda looks at a couple of pieces of fruit with a confused expression Saturday shift: Amanda used to work in a fruit and veg job when she was 13 years old
Both Paul and Amanda are patrons of Battersea Dog's Home and have struck up a friendship through their mutual interest in helping animals. The stylish mother-of-two had dressed to impress for her appearance and even managed a costume change as she visited the Channel 4 studios in London. While on the chat show, she wore an elegant black midi-length dress with a peplum detail and snakeskin Louboutin shoes. Glad that's over: The star told Paul that she had spent 13 months writing her book and described it as torture
Man's best friend: Paul O'Grady and Amanda Holden are both patrons of Battersea Dog's Home
Amanda complimented her elegant black dress with peplum details with a pair of snakeskin Louboutins
Sensitive story: Ms Holden recently released her autobiography No Holding Back where she revealed intimate details of how she recovered from the stillbirth of her son Theo in 2011
Camera ready: Amanda quickly made her way in to the Channel 4 studios to film her appearance on the showBut the 42-year-old TV personality arrived at the studios wearing a tartan skirt and a black blouse, which she accessorised with an on-trend black £595 Hepburn Handbag by Aspinal of London. The mother-of-two stuck to the same heels throughout. She
was also seen carrying a David’s Bridal bag, hinting there may be another quick change to come. Effortless style: Amanda smiled and waved in an elegant black dress during a break from filming the Paul O'Grady show
Time to go: The 42-year-old Britain's Got Talent judge smiled as she left the studios after appearing on the Channel 4 showAmanda
recently spoke of how she is preparing herself for the holidays, saying
that Christmas is always ‘noisy’ and how grateful she is that her family can be together to celebrate.‘I
have always been family orientated to be honest but all these experiences just make me worth my loved ones more,’ she told Daily Star Online.‘I really appreciate the family that we've got, we have our differences but it's a really spacial time.’Although she is a household name, Amanda has revealed that her children have no idea she is famous.‘The
only time when they realise that people know me is when we go out and a
stranger says “hello” to me and Lexi always says, “Oh, do you know them, mummy?",' she told the Daily Star. Quick change: Amanda wore a black blouse and a tartan skirt when she arrived at the studios earlier in the day

If anyone can remember her appearance last year on the Graham Norton Show... dear oh dear she was so annoying and spent the evening trying to steal the limelight from the other guests. Even Graham looked cringe when she kept answering other guests questions for them. 8
