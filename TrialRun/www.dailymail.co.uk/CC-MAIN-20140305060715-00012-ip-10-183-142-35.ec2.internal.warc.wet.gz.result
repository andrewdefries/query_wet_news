The first victim of the avalanche in the Scottish Highlands, which claimed the lives of three climbers, was today named as a RAF squadron leader from the same base as the Duke of Cambridge.Rimon Than, 33, was based at RAF Valley, North Wales, where Prince William is a search and rescue helicopter pilot.Sq Lrd Than was one of two people from the RAF who died in Thursday's tragedy - which happened during a winter skills training course.It is understood that the three climbers involved were buried deep in the snow when rescuers found them at the Chalamain Gap, which is a deep, rocky valley in the Cairngorms on the route from the Cairngorm ski road to the Lairig Ghru.A spokesman for the RAF said it is believed that Sq Ldr Than was not involved in search and rescue. Casualties: Three people died after being airlifted to hospital in Aberdeen following the avalanche in the Scottish Highlands
Prince William is yet to comment on his colleague's death.Tributes were paid to Sqn Ldr Than, who was born in Burma and had initially joined the Royal Air Force as a medical cadet in 2001.Group Captain Adrian Hill, his station commander at Royal Air Force Valley, said: 'Sqn Ldr Rimon Than was the senior medical officer at RAF Valley and was a fine, dedicated officer and doctor.'He was passionate about mountaineering and his death is a tragedy. He was well respected and popular, and will be sorely missed by all personnel at RAF Valley. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.' More...

Wing Commander Ian Richardson, the chairman of the RAF Mountaineering Association, described him as a 'unique and talented individual', adding he was a 'fine doctor and a passionate mountaineer'.FIRST VICTIM NAMED SCALED 'VIRGIN' UNCLIMBED CHINESE PEAK Squadron leader Rimon Than was part of a small British military team that conquered a previously unclimbed 18,504 feet Chinese peak in dangerous conditions in December.They were in the Sichuan Province with Brigadier Duncan Francis from the Army Mountaineering Association, and they had ‘significant mountaineering success’, according to Royal Air Force Mountaineering Association (RAFMA).The report read: ‘The team spent some time establishing a new route on the North West Ridge of Bahaizishan (a virgin peak), where despite passing around a kilometre of knife edge traverses, loose rock and snow; they were stopped before the summit by a difficult rock tower.’ ‘The team refocused attention on a neighbouring peak called Wupingfeng or “Fifth Ice Peak”. They crossed miles of steep vegetated slopes, boulder fields, glaciers and climbed a steep frozen river to reach a very cold bivouac site on a high col. On 4th December, in cold windy conditions, they traversed the north ridge to reach the summit of this previously unclimbed peak, measuring the altitude at 5,640m (18,504 feet).’Squadron Leader Than was a member of RAFMA and its Expeditions and Development Officer.RAFMA was founded in 1948 and is the oldest of the three British Service mountaineering bodies, and is responsible for the RAF Sports Board for the sport of mountaineering within the Royal Air Force. He said Sqn Ldr Than had been a long time member of the RAF Mountaineering Association, and was 'a hugely capable climber with extensive experience of the demands of mountaineering at high altitudes'.
'Seemingly a quiet individual, Rimon had a wry sense of humour and an emphatically pragmatic outlook on all aspects of life. Devoted to his partner Claire, they lived a life of adventure together, as his holiday photos would testify. He will be sorely missed.”
The Ministry of Defence said today that the woman killed by an avalanche, along with another man, was also RAF personnel. The avalanche struck as two groups of six climbers made their way up opposite sides of a gorge.One group was part of a Glenmore Lodge organised winter skills training course and the second was off-duty RAF personnel.The trio was airlifted from the Chalamain Gap to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary shortly after 12.30pm. One of the men was found in a critical condition but died from his injuries in the early hours today, the Northern Constabulary said today.
A police spokesman said: 'It is now known that there were two groups of climbers in the area at the time on opposite sides of the gorge (gap). One group was part of a Glenmore Lodge organised winter skills training course and the second was a separate group comprising off duty RAF personnel who were climbing in the area.'At around 12:30pm an avalanche occurred in the area and three people, two from the RAF and one from the Glenmore team were caught up in the avalanche.'The search got underway very quickly and mountain rescue teams from Cairngorm, Glenmore and Lossiemouth were joined by SARDA Dogs Scotland, Lake District SARDA Dogs training in the area, members of Cairngorm Mountain Ski Patrol and rescue helicopters 137 and 138. The Scottish Ambulance Service's air ambulance was also in attendance.'Once the casualties were located they were all airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where they were sadly pronounced dead.'Area inspector, Murdoch MacLeod, said: 'Clearly this is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are currently with the families of those who have lost their lives.'It is important that we pay tribute to work of the rescuers who responded extremely quickly to the incident and located all three climbers in a short space of time.'All three were airlifted to Aberdeen, but sadly they died as a result of their injuries.'An MoD spokesman said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those who have lost their lives. Next of kin have been informed.'We would ask the media to respect the privacy of the families concerned at this difficult time.'The names of the other two victims are not expected to be released until after their families have been told.Emergency services were scrambled following reports of the snow drift, and a major search operation was
launched to find the missing trio.David Rutledge, the training officer for Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, who controlled the operation from the team’s base said two parties of six were on the mountain when the avalanche struck. Nine people were walked off the hill.The
rescue team, police, search and rescue dogs, RAF Lossiemouth’s rescue team and a helicopter were involved in the operation yesterday. Scene: Emergency services were called out to reports of the snowdrift in the Chalamain Gap area of the Cairngorms
Helicopter: Two helicopters from RAF Lossiemouth, Rescue 137 and 138, were involved in the operation
Mr Rutledge said: 'We started mobilising within 15 minutes of the call coming through.'We had a helicopter here incredibly quickly. We had three doctors available straight away who were able to get to the scene.'This
was a fairly contained scenario. We were able to deal with an incident which was relatively close to the roadside, within 2km (1.2miles) of the
ski road and in a very contained area.'From that perspective, no search was necessary. The key aspect to this was to get people there as quickly as possible.'Mr Rutledge said of the conditions yesterday: 'Conditions today were quite clear, which was ideal for flying. Snow conditions would have been affected massively by the weather we’ve had over the last few days, but significantly temperatures were increasing throughout the day and that will have had an effect on what was going on.'Wind speeds were quite high this morning and all of those things have a contributing factor to the snow conditions.'Mark Diggins, co-ordinator of the Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service, described the rescue effort which took place yesterday. Same base: Than was a RAF squadron leader was based at RAF Valley, North Wales, where Prince William is a search and rescue helicopter pilot
He said: 'With an incident like this, the important thing was to get there as quickly as possible.'People from everywhere were brought in, from Cairngorm mountain rescue, ski patrol, engineers, a whole range
of people went in there as rapidly as they possibly could and worked incredibly hard, digging to try and locate the casualties as quickly as possible.'A lot of people put a fantastic amount of effort in to try and get the people out.'Mr
Diggins heard about the incident when he was on the mountains as part of his work. He made his way across to the location and joined in the rescue effort.He said it has been a 'challenging' winter in the area in terms of the weather conditions.Mr Diggins said: 'There have been violent winds, very changeable conditions and that has an effect on the snow pack.'That's
the situation that we had, and still have, in that there is a weakness deep down that is sort of hidden by the fresh deposits of wind-slab snow
that are above that layer.'Mr Diggins advised people to keep an eye on the daily avalanche report if they are heading to the mountains.He added: 'If you are in a party and you are avalanched then the most important thing is to shout because your companions with you are your best chance of survival.'ENGLISH VISITORS MUST FOLLOW SAFETY WARNINGS' SAYS HEAD OF SCOTTISH MOUNTAINEERING COUNCILDavid Gibson, chief officer of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, yesterday urged English visitors to follow safety warnings after a recent spate of hillwalking accidents.'Looking at some of the recent incidents they seem to involve people from outside of Scotland,' said Mr Gibson. 'We are looking - together with the British Mountaineering Council and the Scottish Mountain Safety Forum - at getting some of the safety information to south of the border prior to people coming up.'Today the risk in the area of the avalanche was 'considerable', which means that walking in an area could trigger an avalanche or it could happen spontaneously.'At the end of the day people must make their own decisions after assessing the risks and being prepared - but use the information provided.'The sport does carry risks - it would not be adventurous if there were not risks.'But the situation has to be viewed in context.'
A police spokesman said: 'There have been several serious incidents in the Scottish mountains over recent days and weeks.'We would urge anyone considering visiting the mountains to carefully consider their actions, ensure they are properly equipped, experienced and aware of what to do in the event of difficulties.'
In the past month, six people have died on Scotland's mountains in three separate incidents including Dr Rachel Majumdar, 29, PhD student Tom Chesters, 28, Christopher Bell, 24, also a PhD student; and 25-year-old junior doctor Una Finnegan who died after they were caught up in an avalanche in Glencoe on January 19.Two weeks ago three men survived being swept 150 metres by snow in the Coire an t-Sneachda area of the Cairngorms.The men, who were wearing helmets, were airlifted to hospital with one man suffering two broken ankles.
While earlier this week, a hillwalker died during an expedition with a mountaineering club in the Cairngorms.'If you shout, they hopefully will watch you go into the debris and, if you get buried, they can track that
and they can go into the place where you were last seen.'
Central Scotland Police have urged anyone planning a climb or hike to 'carefully consider their actions', following another rescue operation in a different mountain region yesterday.A Royal Navy helicopter was dispatched to Ben More, Crianlarich, around 4.20pm when a couple contacted police to say they were stranded.The
helicopter was unable to reach them due to extreme weather in the area but Killin Mountain Rescue Team found them at about 9.15pm.A 25-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman, from Lancashire, were uninjured. Graham Connell, 31, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, was found dead in the Jacob’s Ladder area on Monday, following a large-scale search for him and five other people who were reported overdue on Sunday afternoon.The other members in the party, who were unhurt, were picked up by an RAF rescue helicopter after being located by Braemar Mountain Rescue Team on a hill near Carn Tarsuinn.The search, co-ordinated by Northern Constabulary and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, involved more than 100 people.The walkers were part of a larger group of 35 people visiting the Highlands.Last night Scotland's First Minister expressed his sadness at the latest fatal incident in the Highlands.Alex Salmond said: 'My thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of those who have sadly been killed in this tragic accident.'I'd also like to thank all those involved in the rescue effort and the medical staff who are treating the injured.'This is another stark and tragic reminder of the dangers on our mountains.'They are one of the most beautiful places on earth but they can also be inherently dangerous with treacherous and changeable conditions.'Heavy snowfall brought travel chaos to parts of the country on Wednesday night, with dozens of motorists trapped on high ground and many forced to abandon their vehicles, but forecasters say the wintry weather will melt away to more balmy conditions. Beach time: Ebba Palmer, age three, builds sandcastles at Bournemouth, Dorset, yesterday
Balmy: Dog walkers were out in force in Bournemouth yesterday to enjoy temperatures which reached 10 degrees
Snow ploughs and gritters were called to the A1079 at Market Weighton, East Yorkshire, to clear the road and rescue drivers who had been stuck for hours, reported BBC News. But they also became trapped on the snow-bound road, the main route between Hull and York.Police
told the BBC that at one point up to 40 vehicles were stuck in ‘very bleak’ conditions. One motorist was stuck in his car for three and a half hours trying to get from Leeds to Beverley.But forecasters said that after the recent snowfall, the UK will see much milder weather with tops of 9C in London today.
Tricky conditions: Snow ploughs and gritters were called to the A1079 at Market Weighton, East Yorkshire, on Wednesday to attempt to clear the road and rescue drivers who had been stuck for hours Forecast: The weather will be brighter today but there will be rain in the North by Saturday
Picturesque scene: Snow was coming down heavily at Church Gresley in Derbyshire, near Burton
It is expected to be a mainly fine day across the UK with many areas remaining dry, although there is the chance of a few isolated showers, especially in western Scotland, MeteoGroup said.It is expected to turn cloudy in Northern Ireland and much of Scotland and there is a chance that patchy fog will form in England and Wales. A widespread frost is also expected.But the warmer weather may just be a blip - forecasters suggest it will become cold again at the end of next week. Running water: A stream runs down between snow-dusted hills outside Aberystwyth in Ceredigion, Wales
The Environment Agency has 16 flood warnings in place - five in East Anglia, nine in Midlands and two in the South West, and 129 less serious flood alerts, mainly in the South East.Major disruptions to rail passengers continued again today on busy commuter routes.To add to overhead power cable problems in Hertfordshire, a serious landslip which buckled rails meant disruption to services in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.The Hertfordshire difficulties, at Radlett, caused severe disruption, with First Capital trains between Luton and St Pancras in London delayed by up to 15 minutes. Take a bite: Snow-covered fruit at a greengrocers shop in Auchterarder in Perthshire, Scotland, on Wednesday
A spokesman said yesterday: ‘The damage is extensive - 1km (0.6 miles) of overhead power cables are down.’The huge landslip wrecked the track at Hatfield & Stainforth in South Yorkshire and is expected to affect services for some time.Emergency engineering works were being carried out before of the landslip effecting trains between Doncaster and Goole / Scunthorpe, with buses replacing train services with journey times extended by up to 60 minutes. No ball games: Snow was coming down at Maurice Lea Memorial Park in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, on Wednesday
First TransPennine Express services between Manchester Airport and Cleethorpes were not running between Doncaster and Scunthorpe today.
Northern Rail services between Sheffield and Bridlington/Scarborough were being diverted via Selby, and were not calling at Goole, while Northern Rail services between Doncaster and Scunthorpe were suspended.In south-west London, emergency engineering works led to delays to all services through Wimbledon.

meanwhile his comrade William manages to get more time off work to take his poor little wife on yet another holiday. After all the trauma (their words) over the silly photos they will probably need another to recover.
But back in the real world real trauma and things like this happens. Very sad my thoughts go out to the family.

I am climbing the cairngorms as part of my charity walk from john o groats to lands end, this will not put me off just make me more aware and give the mountains the respect they deserve. More people have died this year slipping on icy pavements! Fact! the people who tragically lost there lives would have done so doing something they loved like most mountain climbing and hiking enthusiasts. I think more couch potatoes should be absorbing the outdoors rather than living infront of a computer screen commenting on issues they know absolutely nothing about, at least have an educated opinon, and before I get called an old foggy im 28. 1

The usual garbage and lack of accuracy from the DM. "Prince William's Airbase" - that's a joke, he's never there and wouldn't know work if he tripped over it!

Her critics have questioned whether she is having a very public meltdown.But Demi Lovato has come out to say Miley Cyrus knows exactly what she is doing as she pushes her raunchy new image.She told Katie Couric her fellow Disney kid was actually being shrewd during her infamous 'twerking' dance, in which she was seen suggestively rubbing up against into Robin Thicke at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Disney kids united: Demi Lovato defended her fellow star Miley Cyrus on Katie Couric's show on Tuesday
She told the chat show host the Wrecking Ball singer 'knows what she's doing,' and even suggested the 20-year-old has proved to be better at handling fame than herself.Speaking on the ABC show, Demi said: 'I think that the world needs to get over the fact that she was Hannah Montana when she was 16. 'I guess my transition was a little easier because I went straight to rehab. I didn't twerk, I just went to rehab.'It's something nobody knows and nobody really knows who I am, and same with Selena [Gomez] and Jonas [Brothers], and everyone that has grown up in front of the public eye,'We're adults now, we're all in the process of doing that so go a little easy on us, America.'Demi ended up seeking treatment in 2010 for 'physical and emotional issues' after leaving the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert tour, which came after she punched a female backing dancer. Terrier: No stone was left unturned as Katie doggedly grilled her guest on the pressures of young fame
Oh I say: Miley Cyrus sprang to national infamy when she 'twerked' Robin Thicke back in August
However, she did sound a note of caution to her friend, pointing out her talent could end up being overshadowed by her notoriety.The popstrel said: 'A lot of artists take that route of shock value, and that's totally fine and that's great.'But I think she has such an incredible voice that's overshadowed by some of the things that she's doing.'It's her journey. She's having fun; she's being who she is. But everyone is on their different journeys right now and she's doing that and she's having fun and power to her." Demi Lovato passionately defends close pal Miley Cyrus

While Miley is revelling in flaunted herself in a chase for album sales, Demi has revealed she is having a great time of her own at the moment, saying life 'is so awesome right now.'For as well as her singing career, she is also an X Factor judge, while she has even been co-hosting on The View this week.And she believes there is an esoteric reason for her success, saying: 'It's like all these things are coming together and it's incredible when you actually put positive energy out there, with the meditation, just five to 10 minutes a day — things come to you, you attract positive energy'And all this came to me when I really started diving in to trying to get in a better place.'While Demi getting ready for an upcoming tour, she has also just released her book Staying Strong, which includes cod philosophy a year's worth of quotes and morning mediations. Family friendly: Former Playboy favourite Jenny McCarthy was also there as one of the show's hosts
Getting into the theme of things: Jenny wore a Mickey Mouse themed sweater for the occasion Back to the future: Kurt Russell aficionados will be excited the star decided to return to his own Disney roots

Once Hannah's carefully orchestrated shock tactics start getting old, there is no talent to fall back on. I hope her money managing skills are a little more sane than her onstage antics.
