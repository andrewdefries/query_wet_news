Furious Flamini rips into 'lazy' Ozil as Arsenal crash against Bayern... and it's not the first time the £42m man has been accused of a lack of effort

Mathieu Flamini tore into Mesut Ozil in the middle of Arsenal's Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, apparently accusing the German of a lack of effort.The flashpoint came in the second half after a Bayern move broke down and the ball is collected from behind the goal by Lukasz Fabianski. Ozil points his finger accusingly in the direction of defender Laurent Koscielny but is given a stern rebuke by Flamini, leading to a little bit of pushing and shoving between the pair. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Flamini describing his pride in his team-mates after the match Flashpoint: Mesut Ozil was sternly rebuked by teammate Mathieu Flamini during the second half of Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night
Bad night: Ozil reacts after seeing his early penalty saved by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer (below)
The exchange of words summed up Arsenal's frustrations on a night when they were once again outclassed by the German champions, who took a firm grip on the last 16 tie with a 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium. And £42.5million man Ozil was especially disappointing - bought to influence matches such as this, he was largely anonymous and drew a heap of criticism from fans on Twitter. His heat map from the first leg match showed up Ozil's lack of perspiration, but accusations of laziness were dispelled by the fact he ran 11.69km during the 90 minutes - the third highest on the pitch.

Ozil's bad night was compounded when he saw a poor penalty saved by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in the opening stages of the game. Arsenal would rue the miss, as goals from Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller gave Bayern a comfortable advantage to take back to Germany after Gunners goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny had been sent off four a foul on Arjen Robben.

It isn't the first time the playmaker has been accused of a lack of effort or respect during a big match. Defender Per Mertesacker yelled at his compatriot after Arsenal's 6-3 defeat at Manchester City in December when he didn't go over to applaud the travelling Arsenal fans. Mertesacker later suggested that friction between members of the team was healthy, telling German newspaper Bild that 'it can't just be all happiness, peace and pancakes.' More...

Robben didn't really become the star that he is today at Chelsea. Point is : some players are not suited for EPL.I love Ozil, but in LaLiga Ozil would rarely play more than 10 full games due to his physique. Maybe he just needs one full season to adjust to EPL or maybe he was better off playing in any league other than EPL. ......... From a Gunner.

Wenger should rest him, Ozil needs to take his mind off football, for a month at least. One needn't be a footballer to understand that. Situations like these arise in life as well when nothing goes your way. In these times just switching off and relaxing can refresh you. It is called damage control. And believe me Ozil is getting damaged, partly due to the absence of Ramsey and Walcott.

The guy needs a rest. I really don't understand why Wenger hasn't rested him before now? Bring him on as a sub at around 60 mins for a few games. He will probably be able to make an impact and gain some confidence. Also, play him as a central number 10 with some pace on the wings! Wenger did it with Arshavin - played him on the wing. Both skillful quality players, both used incorrectly by Wenger. Why on earth he didn't buy a striker in Jan, even if he had to pay over the odds, I really don't know. It would have made the world of difference and given the club a lift. 4

She’s one of Victoria Secret’s ‘angel’ models and Alessandra Ambrosio certainly has wings. The bronzed beauty didn't let a small thing like a 6ft brick wall keep her from the party as she leapt over the top to carry on the festivities.The model was enjoying an after-party at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California Friday night. Giving em the slip: Model Alessandra Ambrosio was spotted jumping over someone's wall Friday evening at a Coachella after-party at a private home
Alessandra looked like a boho princess as wore a fringed white shirt with white crochet shorts and short brown cowboy boots. Her dark tresses were long and silky.The Brazilian mother-of-two had been partying at the festival all day with friends. By nighttime, she was seen going into a private home for a party and hurtling over a brick wall to get in! How to hurtle: Alessandra jumped up, got her balanced, then plopped back down on the other side in order to join the party Deciding what to wear to the three-day annual music festival was a big deal for the model, who celebrated her 32-year-old birthday Thursday at a luncheon with her four-year-old daughter Anja and 11-month-old-son Noah and friends. Alessandra tweeted a photo of many pieces of clothing strewn on her bed: ‘So many amazing options, can't decide what to pack for #coachella and leaving in
30 minutes, thanks @jeniffermazur1 for helping me pick the best #looksforcoachella.’ Safe and sound: The supermodel checked her outfit after she rough-housed it over the wall Good taste was evident in the outfit she wore Friday day and into the night. During the day, she had accessorized the cute look with a brown Stetson hat to shield her face from the sun. By Friday evening, the hat was no where to be found. Instead she carried a nifty brown suede bag with long fringe. Too pooped to party? By the end of the day, the model was beginning to drag Perhaps the party she attended Friday was an extension of her birthday the day before, when she received plenty of congratulations on the big day. She thanked fans via Facebook, writing: ‘Thank you so much for all the lovely birthday wishes! You have made my day even more special! Xx’ Hours earlier.... Alessandra was whooping it up with fellow models Miranda Kerr and Candice Swanepoel Share or comment on this article

She wants a UK visa.=======================She HAD a UK visa Isco, that's why she was able to get married in England. I'll give you a few seconds to mull that one over. She's a successful Hollywood actress whose job dictates she travels all over the world, so I doubt acquiring a visa to the UK would pose any type of problem. I suspect that's your default comment whenever a person with dark skin.......................why do I even bother with you people?

I got married twice in England, and know an Italian, (well quiet a lot actually). Isn't showbusiness exciting?

This interview was hard to watch last night. She seemed zoned. Not an interesting conversation at all. Left me just waiting for her to burst out screaming! These ladies need to be more careful with the company they keep, or even marry! Right Nigella?

I think they look good together. He's an interesting-looking dude and she's quite pretty herself! That said, I was not impressed by Zoe Saldana's performance as Uhura in the recent Star Trek films. I have nothing against her, I just think the character could have been cast better.
