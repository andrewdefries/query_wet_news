I think it is lovely to see exotic animals in UK, as long as they have enough space to roam. Let's face it, with 65m of us racing up and down the country in our cars, it is not exactly ideal for them. The winters must be especially hard. Big cats in cages are horrible to see, especially when they pace up and down with frustration. But if they are only here for a short while to nurse them back to health and release them back into the wild, great! Howletts run an amazing breeding programme for endagered species and I love visiting them. It is good to care about their survival for future generations.

That revelation could be kiss of death for them!
Most women would hate to think they are like their loved ones mum! Even if she is the loveliest person, and the reminders are not personal such as beauty etc, I don't think it's what a woman would want to hear!

'She's my best friend and the one who taught me what love is': Fiona Apple's extraordinary eulogy to dying dog as she postpones South America tour to be with her

I think she is out there, but my dogs are my life too. One recently died last month and I took off time off work and spent a lot of money getting he buried in a pet cemetery. Everyone thought I was ridiculous to grieve the way I did. My dog gave me so much love and pleasure in my life that I wanted her to be placed in a beautiful spot with other animals. The Rainbow Bridge makes me cry everything I think or read about it. As much as it hurts to lose people, it feels worse to lose a pet who gave you love and loyalty no matter what. Your email address:

'She's a liar and extremely deceitful': Scorned mother's letter to justify cutting her only child out of her £468,000 will
By
Daily Mail Reporter
UPDATED:

View comments
A woman who left her £468,000 inheritance to charity did so because her daughter was 'extremely deceitful'.Melita Jackson wrote a letter with her will to explain why the money would be going to animal welfare charities instead of her only child, Heather Ilott.In her 'letter of wishes', Mrs Jackson told how her daughter had ignored her for decades ever since she 'crept out of the house' and eloped in 1978, aged 17.Mrs Jackson, a widow, accused Mrs Ilott of being 'extremely deceitful' and made it clear she should 'expect no inheritance from me when I die'. Payout: Heather Ilott outside the High Court. Judges ruled she is entitled to a legacy despite her mother writing a letter to disinherit her
She recounted how she had only seen her twice in the intervening years and had not had contact with her five grandchildren since she turned 60.Mrs Jackson emphasised the 'distress and worry she has caused me' and told how Heather had warned her not to contact her any more.The letter said: 'My daughter has been extremely deceitful to me and has told me a number of lies.'Because my daughter left me without any explanation and has made no effort to reconcile with me, I feel as though I have no moral or financial obligation to provide for her.'My daughter has not been financially reliant upon me since she left home, although I did make gifts of money to her on her birthday and at Christmas up to and including her 21st birthday, although she refused to acknowledge any of the payments that I made to her.'Mrs Ilott's father died in an industrial accident before she was even born, making her mother the only parent she ever knew.But in the late 1970s, she ran off in the night to be with her boyfriend - of whom her mother disapproved.She was reported missing to the police and traced to the boyfriend's home but refused to go back. This started a lifelong rift which was never healed, even when the couple eventually married and had their own children. Enlarge
Melita Jackson's 'letter of wishes' in which she made clear her daughter should have nothing from her estate
Mrs Ilott apologised to her mother when they met by chance at the dentists in 1999 but the rapprochement failed because Mrs Jackson was upset her daughter had named her youngest child after her mother-in-law, who she did not like.Mrs Jackson then died aged 70 in 2004 and left every penny to the RSPCA, RSPB and the Blue Cross animal welfare charity.Her daughter, from Great Munden in Ware, challenged the will and sought 'reasonable provision' from her mother's estate.Her barrister John Collins claimed the decision to disinherit her was not due to support of the charities but 'simply out of spite'.She was initially awarded £50,000 but this was overturned by High Court judge Mrs Justice Eleanor King who rules she should get nothing.Now Court of Appeal judges have gone back to the original decision, ruling she is entitled to a share of the money after all.Mrs Justice Black emphasised her 'extremely modest' circumstances, noting she is still caring for her youngest child and has not worked for 25 years. The mother relies largely on benefits and lives in a housing association home. Her husband gave up work as a delivery driver because of back problems and only works from time to time as a jobbing actor. Mrs Justice Black, sitting with the President of the Family Division Sir Nicholas Wall and Lady Justice Arden, also said it had been 'unreasonable' to cut her out.The charities - the RSPC, RSPB and the Blue Cross animal welfare organisation - expressed their dismay and warned it could have a major impact on future donations.Their solicitor James Aspden, from Wilsons Solicitors, said: 'This is not a case where the late Mrs Jackson in some way failed to care for and bring her up her child.'On the contrary, she gave her daughter excellent upbringing until Heather opted for independence and left home.'Mrs Jackson left a clear explanation of the reasons why she had chosen not to leave her estate to Heather, with a written request to her executors to defend any claim Heather might bring.'The charities involved are very grateful to Mrs Jackson for choosing to remember the needs of animals and wild birds in her will. On legal advice, they are continuing to support her wishes.'The latest ruling means Mrs Ilott, who says the £50,000 she was awarded in 2007 was not enough, can now return to the High Court and ask for a bigger payout.However, Sir Nicholas urged the parties to 'consider carefully' whether to continue their wrangling because of the huge costs involved.

Mrs Jackson was upset her daughter had named her youngest child after her mother-in-law, who she did not like.
- thats childish, but if i had hardly seen my only kid in 32 yrs she can get stuffed
there is no point in making a will if the relatives are just gonna pick over your bones like vultures

it shouldnt matter, a will is a will no court in the world should have the power or rights to over turn it, its someones last wishes and they should be respected as that.

@My husband was left out of his mother's will as they did not have a good relationship. His mother was a vindictive, manipulating, busybody who meddle with everyone she met. - Roberta, UK, 1/4/2011 2:47
That's not the point. She's still entitled to decide where her money goes after she's dead. And it's not like her daughter had been caring for her in her old age, so I am baffled by the judge's reasoning. 4

if she's on benefits how can she afford a barrister on a £1 k an hour, is he working on commission in lieu of payment, i just hope she awarded the original amount and the barrister has it all. suitable revenge but the barristers always wins what ever the outcome. if her mother was of sound mind she could have a bomb fire with if so wished rather than the daughter getting a penny.

Exactly, what is the point of writing a legally binding and valid will correctly if it can be overturned like this against her express wishes - makes wills worthless, and I think this stupid decision should be challenged.

What a surprise - the daughter is on benefits! Why does she not go out and get a JOB!? Not worked in 25 years?! What a layabout. If her husband cannot work, why does she not go out and work? Sounds like a lazy waste of space - too lazy and vile to keep in contact with her own mother and too lazy to get a job. Yet now she expects even more handouts, in the form of her mother's money. YUCK.

This baffles me. When the subject comes up Im constantly telling my parents that I dont want any inheritance off them, a piece of jewellery, or something, would be nice for sentimental reasons, but I want THEM to spend THEIR money BEFORE they die. THEY worked hard for their money THEY should enjoy it!

There are two sides to every story - one clue is that she ran away to marry the man with whom she is still with - so she obviously made the right choice. Her mother didn't like her choices - well the question I would ask is they did the daughter feel as though she had to leave home at such a young age? You don't normally abandon your home if you haven't been given cause to do so - I had to leave my home when I was 16 to escape my parents! Could it be that the mother wanted to control her daughter's life - I mean this was the 1970s when one had to live in a very stunted way in some circles! It takes a heavy heart and strong will to walk away from your own family!
The other point that shows what her mother was like is that she preferred to leave the money to animals instead of her own grandchildren! They are the innocents here who have been disowned and cast out from their heritage. That speaks volumes!

So I guess the point is: if you want your money to go in a certain direction after your death, get rid of most if it prior to death or anyone can make a claim against it, including blood relatives you haven't seen in 30 years. Actually the pair of them sound like fairly bitter pills, but that just might be the way the story has been told. 0

German physio Klaus Eder has been tending the aches, pains and sprains of the Nationalmannschaft since the 1988 European Championships. But now he's the one needing treatment after tearing a muscle in his left leg and breaking his finger while rushing on to the field during Germany's World Cup qualifying win over Austria on Friday night.The 60-year-old slipped and fell while dashing on to treat left-back Marcel Schmelzer during the match at the Allianz Arena in Munich, landing heavily on his hand. Ouch! Germany national team physio Klaus Eder broke his finger after slipping and falling over during the World Cup qualifier with Austria on Friday
And the tables were turned as Philipp Lahm handed Eder an ice pack and Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose helped him hobble from the field. 'I now have to put into practice what I always tell my patients,' Eder told the German FA website on Sunday. 'Yesterday I had surgery on my left ring finger, which unfortunately I broke in my fall. 'Patience is important and you should not expect a lot of progress too soon. Helping hand: Eder is aided from the field by Austria's Andreas Ivanschitz and Germany's Miroslav Klose after tearing a muscle in his leg during the fall
'The way the players reached was very comforting. Philipp Lahm brought me the ice pack, Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose held me and led me off the field.'Eder is resting at home and will not make the trip to the Faroe Islands for the next qualifier on Tuesday, a match in which Germany should secure their place at Brazil 2014.Goals from Klose, Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller earned Germany a comfortable 3-0 win over Austria. Out of action: Eder, seen here being helped from the field by Miroslav Klose and Philipp Lahm, is resting at home after having surgery on his finger
Eder, who hails from the Bavarian city of Regensburg, has been a qualified sports physiotherapist since the late 1970s and involved also with the German Olympic team since 1981 and the German David Cup tennis team since 1990. He has helped Germany to victory in the 1990 World Cup in Italy and the 1996 European Championships in England. More...
