Re.Simon Hestor-"But he refused to resign or hand back a £1.5million bonus from 2010, despite taking the helm in November 2008."
Well then lets take it back off him by changing the law or else using the law to make sure that these bankers ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS!Time they also held Bob Diamond to account and put him on trail as well.These CEO's must have known what was going on in their own bank.If not why are they paid such disgustingly high wages?
