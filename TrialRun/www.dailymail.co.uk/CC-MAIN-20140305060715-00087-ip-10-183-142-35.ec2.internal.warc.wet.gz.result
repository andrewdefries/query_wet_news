The episode was called Yuppy Love and the clip which everyone remembers is the moment when Del Boy falls through the bar flap. What also sticks in my mind is the build-up to the pratfall.Trigger descends the stairs of the wine bar in an arresting electric blue suit, like Peckham’s answer to Norma Desmond. Del is going through his red-braces-and-Filofax, greed-is-good, Gordon Gekko phase and has his eye on pulling a couple of giggly Sloaney birds drinking ‘spitzers’. Much loved: Actor Roger Lloyd Pack, best known for playing Trigger in Only Fools and Horses has died aged 69
Del and Trigger discuss the best chat-up lines. ‘This place is full of yuppy sorts. We can’t go wrong here. All we’ve got to do is learn their language,’ Del says.‘Why, are they foreign, then?’ asks Trig.No, says Del. ‘They just don’t speak proper English like what we do. What really impresses the women is money. It’s their favourite subject.’Trigger saunters up to the girls and says: ‘I saw one of them old five-pound notes the other day.’ More from Richard Littlejohn...

Pure genius from the pen of the late John Sullivan, brought to life by the actor Roger Lloyd Pack, who died on Wednesday.Legend has it that Trigger wasn’t supposed to be in the scene. It just happened that Lloyd Pack was filming another programme in the studio next door and was drafted in at the last minute.If that story’s true, then the comedy gods were working overtime. Although the star of this particular show was David Jason, Lloyd Pack deserved nomination for best supporting actor. In Yuppy Love, Lloyd Pack’s comic timing and deadpan delivery are exemplary.Sullivan’s great skill was paying as much attention to the whole cast as to the lead characters.Boycie,
Marlene, Denzil and, of course, Trigger, all ensured that Only Fools And Horses was much greater than the sum of its parts.Throughout
the series, Trigger stole every scene he appeared in. The running gag which had him call Rodney ‘Dave’ was inspired. Eventually, Rodders pulls
him up on it.‘My
name’s not Dave, my name’s Rodney. I’ve looked it up on my birth certificate and my passport and everything. It is definitely Rodney.’‘So what’s Dave, a nickname, like?’My favourite line was when Trig was discussing the name of Rodney and Cassandra’s soon-to-be-born baby. ‘If it’s a girl, they’re calling it Sigourney, after an actress. If it’s a boy, they’re calling it Rodney, after Dave.’ These
were just a couple of memorable Trigger quotes, which included his take
on Gandhi: ‘He made one great film and then you never saw him again.’And
there was his roadsweeper’s broom, which had 17 new heads and 14 new handles, but was still ‘original’. It must be original, he maintained, because he had a picture to prove it.Trigger was as much a part of the success of Only Fools as Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, who played Rodney. Yet
he came to resent being associated exclusively with the character, just
as Warren Mitchell hated being mistaken for his definitive alter ego, Alf Garnett. Golden moment: Sir David Jason as Del Boy and Roger Lloyd Pack as Trigger in one of the show's most memorable scenes, when Del Boy fell through the bar
Lloyd
Pack was a RADA-trained, Shakespearean actor, who enjoyed further TV success in The Vicar Of Dibley and starred in the Harry Potter movie, Goblet Of Fire.But
to most people, he was forever Trigger, the slow-witted ingenue from the Nags Head, Peckham. And although this type-casting chafed, it is a tribute to his considerable talent that he was held in such widespread public affection.
Roger Lloyd-Pack as Trigger
Trigger was Sullivan’s creation, but made memorable flesh by Lloyd Pack. I won’t have been the only person who felt a sense of loss when I learned of his death yesterday morning.It falls to a chosen few to touch so many lives, to bring joy and laughter to millions. The public recognition, the ‘Oi, Trigger!’ shouted across the street, comes with the turf.Lloyd Pack found the constant attention ‘annoying’ and it’s not difficult to understand why it becomes tiresome after a while. But it was a mark of respect and fondness, of which he should have been proud.Trigger, like Del and Rodney and the rest of the cast, has been a permanent fixture of so many people’s awareness over the past three decades, preserved forever on the reruns which seem to be played on a loop on satellite TV.Before I sat down to write this appreciation, I reached for the box-set to watch again the Yuppy Love episode. Though
the Eighties themes are dated, the performances are eternal. This was also the episode in which Rodney met Cassandra at night school.I’ve
often wondered what it would be like to be Trigger, a simple man untroubled by the great issues of the day, content in his own little world. Given that I have to read the papers and watch the news for a living, it has its attractions.Appropriately,
as I began to type, Squeeze popped up on my iTunes shuffle, singing about the same South London streets Trigger used to sweep. Much loved show: Lloyd-Pack starred in the show which was loved by all the family And my thoughts turned immediately to the celebrated Christmas episode which featured Del and Rodney running through Peckham dressed as Batman and Robin, on their way to what they thought was a fancy dress party.When they arrive, the party turns out to be a funeral. Trigger answers the door in dark suit, white shirt and black tie. He tells them he didn’t know that the fancy dress had been cancelled, either.So what’s he doing in dark suit, white shirt and black tie? Once again, Trigger steals the scene.‘I’ve come as a chauffeur.’ A brief encounter of the worst kind
Katy Holmes, 33, was caught having sex with a stranger on the bonnet of a car in a quiet residential street in Blackpool
Brief Encounter is the quintessential stiff-upper-lip British film, a tale of temptation starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as married strangers who meet at a railway station and fall in love.This being 1946, their extra-marital passion remains unconsummated. In the modern version, The 7.39, shown recently on the BBC, David Morrissey and Sheridan Smith go all the way to Waterloo.Critics and viewers have complained that this latest incarnation of the Brief Encounter story was unconvincing.I didn’t watch it, but I’m not surprised. These days, art which attempts to imitate real life has trouble keeping up.A far more realistic remake of Brief Encounter was played out in broad daylight in the back-streets of Blackpool recently.Magistrates heard that Katy Holmes, 33, was caught having sex with a complete stranger on the bonnet of a red Peugeot at 9.45am.Passers-by called the police and Holmes was charged with outraging public decency, to which she pleaded guilty and was given an eight-week suspended sentence.Holmes said she had met the man only 15 minutes earlier. He chatted her up in a newsagent’s shop.‘What happened was consensual,’ she explained, ‘but I accept that people who saw what was going on might find it lewd and offensive.’While Holmes was hauled up before the beak, her impromptu paramour made his escape. The court was told that a police officer caught him by the ankles while he was scaling a metal fence but he kicked out and managed to get away.Call me old-fashioned, but somehow I can’t imagine Celia Johnson spread-eagled across the bonnet of an Austin Cambridge while Trevor Howard legs it over a fence, with his trilby in one hand and trousers flapping round his ankles.Makes you proud to be British. It’s that time of year again when everyone is on a diet, whether they like it or not. Call Me Dave has been put on a sugar-free regime and half the country seems to be fasting at least two days a week.Needless to say, the usual fanatics are using healthy eating advice as an excuse to throw their weight around.A school in Dagenham has started confiscating fruit juice from pupils’ lunch boxes on the grounds that it’s packed with killer sugar.I can see that there might be concern over that sickly SunnyD muck the kids all seemed to be drinking a couple of years ago.But if their parents want to give them genuine fruit juice, what business is it of their teachers?Elsewhere, even the monkeys at Paignton Zoo have been put on a diet. Keepers have banned them from eating bananas, claiming that fruit is bad for them.Amy Plowman, head of conservation, said: ‘Giving fruit to animals is the equivalent of humans eating cake and chocolate.’Apparently, the colour and thickness of the fur of the Sulawesi black monkeys has improved. And highly-strung breeds, such as tamarins and marmosets have calmed down as a result of their new meal plans.But has anyone asked the monkeys if they prefer high-fibre vegetables to bananas?At this rate it can only be a matter of time before the sea-lions are put on the South Beach diet and overweight alligators are force-fed the Atkins. There appears to be nothing on earth at which someone, somewhere can’t take offence. Moshi Monsters, the children’s computer game, is under fire from ‘disability campaigners’.That’s because some of the characters have names such as Fishlips and Freakface, which allegedly ‘reinforce negative stereotypes of facially disfigured people’.Freakface can’t stop dribbling, interpreted as an insult to sufferers from something called Bell’s Palsy.Oh, for heaven’s sake. Where do they find these people? None of the Mark Duggan fan club will face criminal charges, even though jurors and witnesses at the inquest were threatened with violence and police were spat at.So no surprise there, then.Turning a blind eye to blatant criminality is what passes for ‘community policing’ these days.

A writer can only write the jokes as he hears them in his mind. It's an actors job to deliver those jokes and that's the hard bit, Roger did that perfectly. It was he who built Triggers personality and I don't think many could have done that as superbly as he did. Watching RLP as he first appeared as Trigger is interesting, it seems like the character had not been thought about. Yes, it's clear that Trig was supposed to be two slates short of a full roof but he appeared as a wide boy at first. Eventually, RLP got Trigger down to a tee. Some actors have to over emphasise a joke with facial movement, Lloyd Pack did it minimally but brilliantly. Reading the story of OFaH it's clear that there was a massive element of luck in its success and one part of that was how the actors all fell into roles perfect for them as not all of them were first choice (inc David Jason as Del). We've lost a good un but RLP will still be making us laugh for years to come, what a legacy to leave.
