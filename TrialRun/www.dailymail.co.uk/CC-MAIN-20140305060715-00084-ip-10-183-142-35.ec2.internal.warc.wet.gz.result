0shares As civil war rages in Syria, it is unlikely that there will be a rapid resolution of this conflict

The International Committee of the Red Cross has officially declared that a civil war is raging in Syria. Although this has been obvious for some time, this declaration means that all parties to the conflict are legally obliged to respect the Geneva Conventions, regarding avoiding civilian casualties, treatment of the wounded and prisoners of war. This lends the opposition the official status of an army. Anyone deemed in violation of these conventions could be prosecuted for war crimes at the international tribunal in the Hague. In reality states tend to fall foul of such declarations since they have clear command structures and hierarchies. Tough luck then for Bashir al-Assad. Unrest: Civil war has officially been declared in Syria by the International Committee of the Red Cross
It seems unlikely that this will greatly inhibit either the government of Syria, which is fighting for its life, or the different opposition groups whose precise objectives remain opaque. Once a spiral of inter-communal hatred starts, it will take more than such declarations to bring them to a halt.

Conflict in Syria now officially a civil war as country denies massacre that claimed more than 150 lives as UN arrives to investigate killings
Both sides are currently disputing exactly what happened at Tremseh last Thursday. The Assad government says it killed a large number of rebel fighters in focused operations; the rebels say that the army and militias murdered large numbers of innocent civilians, using armour, artillery and helicopter gunships. UN monitors confirm that such heavy weapons were used, as photographs of devastated houses seem to confirm. Conflict: Both sides are currently disputing what happened in Tremseh last Thursday
Meanwhile, UN envoy Kofi Annan is off to Russia and China, seeking to bring them behind his ceasefire plans. They are extremely sceptical about what any western humanitarian military intervention might unleash, with the Russians fearing the loss of key Mediterranean bases and the extension of Saudi influence. They have repeatedly accused the Saudis of fomenting unrest in their own backyard too, among the Muslim populations of the northern Caucasus. China has its own militant Islamist problem among the Uighurs in Xinxiang. More from Michael Burleigh...

As for the West, the latest theme is to highlight the obscure movements of Assad's large stocks of chemical munitions such as sarin nerve gas and VX. They may well be being relocated, not for use against civilians, but to put them out of reach of the rebels.
While Mrs Assad continues on a vast shopping binge - recently spending nearly �300,000 on sofas and cushions in London - her husband's more sober advisors are already contemplating a mini Alawite state along the northern coast of Syria, to which end they will need to relocate large numbers of their fellow sect members currently living along religious faultlines. The breakup of Syria does indeed seem a likely outcome, with or without Assad himself. That means we will presumably see some sort of Islamist mini state too since they are a significant component of the armed opposition. Because of the real international interests at play in Syria, there is unlikely to be a rapid resolution of this conflict. The key players are Saudi Arabia and Qatar, backing the rebels, and Russia and Iran supporting Assad. It may be that the West will detach China from the latter, for Beijing does not need the opprobrium its remote support for Assad brings in return for no obvious gain. None of which will end this conflict anytime soon. Share or comment on this article
