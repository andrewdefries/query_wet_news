0shares Britain's most savage art criticOUTSIDER II: ALWAYS ALMOST NEVER QUITE BY BRIAN SEWELL (Quartet �25)

Contemptuous: Brian Sewell has never been afraid of showing his disdain for many lauded artists
There are a few books, only a few, which make one wish to know the author in order to explore his thoughts and personality further. This is such a book - by the outstanding, most outspoken art critic of our time.Brian Sewell’s Outsider, his first volume of autobiography published last year, was a revelation - not only of his life as a repressed, then a released homosexual, but his exposure of the shady life behind the scenes at Christie’s, where he acquired his expertise in art history.He continues the story by painfully resigning from Christie’s because ‘I was damned for being queer’ and thus denied his own department and seat on the Board.Before certain news footage on television, viewers are warned of coming scenes that they may not wish to see. Likewise, I should warn you that there is total candour here about a sex life that some people may not wish to read of. Friend and spy: Art historian Professor Anthony Blunt
Sewell says writing his first volume about being both illegitimate and homosexual in youth ‘felt like self-administered psychoanalysis, deeply painful and disturbing’. He examines his later self just as dispassionately. ‘Casting aside decades of deceit and dissembling,’ he says he hopes to offer reassurance to other Outsiders.But you don’t have to be an outsider to find plenty to intrigue and challenge you besides what seems to have been his reckless and risky promiscuity.After Christie’s, he ‘scratched a living’ by becoming an art dealer on his own account, mainly in old drawings. He leads us into the wonderland of the Bond Street art market, populated with an extraordinary cast of suave and often shady characters with doubtful canvasses and suspect attributions to sell.Among fine art conmen are restorers, improvers and outright fakers of canvasses. Some brilliant fakers became so notorious - like the Hungarian Elmyr de Hory and the jocund Tom Keating - that after their deaths their work was itself faked to satisfy demand.The fascination of fine art faking is that there is scarcely ever such a thing as proof of authenticity. Signatures and aged canvas and paint can all be obtained or faked. Ultimately it comes down to the opinion of certain acknowledged experts. If Mr X says: ‘This is a Poussin,’ then it is a Poussin - or not, if a more highly rated Mr Y says it is not. Sewell’s scholarship and connoisseur’s ‘eye’ is so developed that at the National Gallery’s great Leonardo exhibition last winter, he ended by deciding that at least four of the prized exhibits were not by Leonardo at all.THE LIFE OF BRIANSewell is a classic car fan and likes to dirve a Mercedes Benz 560 SEC coupe barefootSince the age of 13, Sewell has been the proud owner of 16 dogs, all but two of them rescue dogs or straysIn 2008 Sewell played the omniscient controller in Big Brother Celebrity Hijack featuring Russell Brand and Peaches Geldof His master as a scholar and connoisseur was Anthony Blunt, director of the Courtauld Institute, keeper of the Queen’s pictures, the Fourth Man of the Cambridge spy ring and Sewell’s tutor and long-standing friend.Sewell was told of Blunt’s secret several years before his confession and consequent immunity from prosecution were made public by Margaret Thatcher. He was informed at Blunt’s request by an elderly Cambridge don, Andrew Gow, who may himself have been a member of the circle. During the subsequent hounding of Blunt, Sewell was conspicuously loyal to him, hiding and protecting his own mentor and thereby being hounded himself.He now says that Blunt ‘became a Communist spy of sorts’ although he had no politics and never voted at elections. ‘How could so scholarly a man put his career at risk for a political philosophy in which he had virtually no belief? The answer is Guy Burgess, who won from him undying loyalty… had Guy not been a Communist, nor would Anthony.’The picture of Blunt’s later years, expelled from all his posts and compelled to share a small flat with a male partner whom he no longer found tolerable, is a sad one. Worst of all, he had lost his standing as the ranking expert on Poussin.
One can sympathise with Sewell’s loyalty to a friend in public disgrace. But at no point does he reveal his private feelings about Blunt’s treachery, his secret he kept for so long.He clearly despises the once charming Burgess who became ‘a scruffy, drunken slob with the halitosis of a dragon’ - so he must find him an inadequate excuse for Blunt’s betrayal.
Neither does he tell us his personal feelings about Salvador Dali, for whose camera he used to pose naked - as did countless other young men who visited the painter at Cadaques on the Spanish coast. Voyeur: Salvador Dali at home in Cadaques
Voyeurism was Dali’s predilection - was there ever any film in his camera? - for he could not himself bear to be touched and claimed to be impotent.Sewell’s observations of Dali’s perverse tastes are sardonically amusing so that it comes as a surprise to read of his grief at Dali’s death. ‘The last of the great old masters,’ he calls him, a rare tribute from his pen.The overriding emotion that permeates these pages is contempt, the contempt of the historian for cynical trendsetters and gullible fashion-followers. Chief of his targets is the current art establishment, the Serotas and Rosenthals, the gallery directors, exhibition curators, the majority of art critics, the flatterers who inflate overpriced exhibition catalogues with cubic feet of hot air.It was a clique, 35-strong, of such figures who signed a letter demanding his removal as art critic of the Evening Standard in 1994. After ten years of trenchant reviews, they accused him of ‘insult and scurrility, posturing and prejudice’. The readers’ letters thought otherwise and his Editor declared that no editor would be seen to obey such a complaint. His reviews continued and a new sparkling selection of them is published by Quartet under the title Naked Emperors - which clearly sums up what he thinks of the ‘Young’ British Artists whom he discusses within.
There is scarcely a painter who meets with his approval. Not even David Hockney, whom he used to hail, surely with justice, as ‘one of the few great draughtsmen of the century’. But he sees no merit in the enormous Hockney landscapes that filled the walls and crowded the halls of the Royal Academy earlier this year. ‘No one who knows the Yorkshire Wolds has ever seen them clad in the ghastly gaudiness of Hockney’s vision… half of these pictures are fit only for the railings of Green Park.’ He rebukes the revered Lucien Freud for becoming ‘lazy’ in his drawing - ‘a vain man incapable of self-criticism’. Damien Hirst he at first rather admired before he turned his studio into a money-making factory of ‘extravagant goods desirable to footballers’ wives and collectors governed by envy. To own a Hirst is to tell the world that your bathroom taps are gilded and your Rolls-Royce is pink’. Critical: Sewell thought David Hockney's recent exhibits only fit for the railings at Hyde Park
As for Tracey Emin, now the RA’s Professor of Drawing, forsooth: ‘Skill, if she ever had any, has been usurped by celebrity, a celebrity nourished by deliberate outrage.’It must be discouraging to practice his critic’s craft on such unworthy material. He gets to the crux of the revolution of the Eighties when he says: ‘All an artist need do was to proclaim himself an artist and it followed that anything he made or did must necessarily be art - a simple logic merrily agreed by the empty-headed critics of the day.’In short, we have a new form of art-fakery which doesn’t even require the ability to draw or paint.No wonder Sewell looks back on his life as a sequence of failures - his expertise disregarded, his art pilgrimages turned into TV travelogues, his critical standards wasted on non-artists.But he has raised the art of literate vituperation to new enjoyable heights. May he continue to strip pretender emperors naked. Share or comment on this article

The crime of ‘scandalising a court’ may soon be consigned to history.The offence can be committed if someone does or publishes anything that ridicules the judiciary to such an extent that it is likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.This can include being extremely offensive towards a member of the judiciary or suggesting they are corrupt.Yesterday, the Law Commission - a panel of experts which advises the government - opened a consultation asking whether the offence, a form of contempt of court, is still necessary.The offence has not been successfully prosecuted in England and Wales since 1931 and doubts have been raised about whether it should continue to exist.Legal experts suspect the law may not be compatible with the right to free speech, which is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and Labour’s Human Rights Act.In addition, most of the activities covered by the offence could be dealt with in other ways - for example by using the law of libel or, if the activity was particularly serious, bringing criminal charges for other offences, the commission said. History: The offence has not been successfully prosecuted in England and Wales since 1931 and doubts have been raised about whether it should continue to exist
Some people have also questioned why the judiciary should be offered special protection, the Law Commission said.The aim of the consultation is to ask whether the law is necessary in modern society in England and Wales. The commission’s provisional view is that it should be abolished.Ministers will not be bound by the findings of the consultation.

The President's U-turn on attacking Syria: Obama had 11th-hour change of heart and has chosen to take a gamble with Congress that risks devastating his credibilityPresident Obama had originally planned to strike Syria without a vote in Congress, but changed his mind on Friday nightOn Saturday he said it would be good for the country for Congress to debate if action should be takenThat debate pushes any possible action back at least a week as lawmakers aren't due back from summer recess until Sept. 9Should Congress chose not to support his plan it would be a humiliating defeat for the PresidentAdvisers wouldn't say what the President will do if Congress does not approve his plan for military action By

After more than a week of the White House rushing toward imminent military action against Syria, President Obama's abrupt decision on Saturday to instead ask Congress for permission has left him with a high-risk gamble that could devastate his credibility if no action is ultimately taken.In a hastily announced statement by the President in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he argued that he did in fact have the power to act on his own. But faced with the prospect of taking action opposed by many Americans, the commander in chief tried to shift the burden and instead round up partners on Capitol Hill to share in that responsibility.The change of heart occurred on Friday evening after the President had a long walk around
the White House's grounds with his chief of staff. Obama then summoned some of his top aides and told them he now wanted to hold off on launching an
attack until Congress had its say. Change of direction: President Obama meets with senior advisers in the Oval Office on Friday night to discuss a new plan for the situation in Syria

‘While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,’ Obama said on Saturday. ‘We should have this debate.’State Department officials added to the confusion on Saturday night, as they told Fox News that the President would take military action regardless of Congress's decision. The consequences for Obama's turnabout could be sweeping, both at home and abroad. More...
'We are prepared to strike whenever we choose:' Obama says he will hold Assad accountable for ‘worst chemical weapons attack of 21st century’ but will not take military action before a vote in Congress
I'm going to copy Cameron! Drama as Obama vows to bomb Syria - but only after U.S. vote (and suddenly Britain is his 'closest ally' again)
Proof the special relationship is as strong as ever
Putin urges U.S. to hold off on military action against Syria and says it would be 'utter nonsense' for Assad to use chemical weapons
If Congress votes against military action, it would mark a humiliating defeat for a second-term president already fighting to stay relevant and wield influence in Washington.It could also weaken his standing internationally at a time when there are already growing questions about the scope of American influence, particularly in the Arab world. President Obama talks on the phone in the Oval Office with House Speaker John Boehner, while Vice President Joe Biden listens on Saturday
But the White House sees potentially positive political implications in punting the strike decision to Congress. Obama could make good on the promises he made as a senator and presidential candidate, when he called for restraint and congressional consultation by White House's seeking military force. And with the American public weary of war and many opposed to even modest military action against Syria, Obama could share with Congress the burden of launching an attack.An NBC News poll conducted last week suggests the use of chemical weapons has not shifted public opinion in favor of taking military action against Syria. About 50 percent said the U.S. should not take military action against the Syrian government in response to the use of chemical weapons, while 42 percent said the U.S. should. Just 21 percent say military action against Syria is in the U.S. national interest.	Obama to wait for congressional vote on Syria
If he presses on with military action
despite their opposition, he would likely cast Congress as obstructionists allowing an autocrat to kill civilians without consequences.‘Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?’ Obama asked Saturday.It's
unclear how effective that approach would be given that Obama himself has been deeply reluctant to get involved in Syria's lengthy civil war. More
than 100,000 people have died in more than two years of clashes between
the government and rebels seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad. But Obama declared last year that the one thing that would cross his ‘red line’ would be if Assad deployed his stockpiles of chemical weapons.U.S. officials say that has now happened multiple times this year, most recently on Aug. 21 in the Damascus suburbs. According to the Obama administration, more than 1,400 people were killed by the deadly gases, including 426 children. Stunning reversal: The president's u-turn also raises questions about his decisiveness and could embolden leaders in Syria, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere
For Obama, the stakes for responding after the most recent attack were already heightened, not only because of the scope, but also because of the scant
response from the White House when Assad used chemical weapons earlier this year. While Obama approved shipments of light weaponry and ammunition for the rebel forces fighting Assad, the bulk of the arms are
yet to arrive.Throughout much of the last week, it appeared Obama was ready to make good on his promises to act in the face of chemical weapons use. Five Navy destroyers armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles were put on standby in the Mediterranean Sea. Defense Secretary
Chuck Hagel declared that the military was ‘ready to go’ once Obama gave the order. And the president dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry twice last week to make a vigorous and emotional case for a robust
response to a reluctant public.As the week dragged on, Obama's international backing began to erode. Russia again blocked action against Syria at the U.N. Security Council. Where could they strike? This map of Syria highlights the main strategic towns in the strife-torn country
Target Damascus: Locations within the Syrian capital that would likely bear the brunt of any attackNATO declared that the alliance would not launch coordinated military action. And in the strongest blow for the White House, Britain's Parliament voted against military action, a stunning defeat for Prime Minister David Cameron, a key ally who had expected to join Obama in taking military action.Despite
the setbacks, Obama and his team were prepared to move forward without any authorization from the U.N. and Capitol Hill. But on Friday, aides said the president simply changed his mind. In shifting the debate to Capitol
Hill, Obama is ensuring that a military strike will be pushed off for at least another week. Lawmakers aren't due back from their summer recess until Sept. 9. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he expected the House to consider the force resolution that week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he, too, will hold a vote no later than the week of Sept. 9, with public hearings beginning next week.'Our capacity to execute this mission is not time sensitive. It will be effective tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now. And I'm prepared to give that order,' said the President on Saturday.Even before Congress decides, Obama will have to directly confront the international implications of his decision. He's set to travel abroad next week for a visit to Sweden and a meeting of world leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia.The stunning reversal also raises questions about the president's decisiveness and could embolden leaders in Syria, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, leaving them with the impression of a U.S. president unwilling to back up his words with actions. President Barack Obama meets in the Situation Room with his national security advisers to discuss strategy in Syria on Saturday
The Syrian army responded to the looming threat of U.S. strikes on Saturday by saying it will react to foreign aggression with force and that it has its 'finger on the trigger.''The
Syrian army is fully ready, its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or scenario that they want to carry out,' Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi said in a written statement aired on state television.The statement from the Syrian army came after the Obama administration on Friday made its strongest case yet for a 'limited, narrow' punitive military action against Assad. 'History
would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a
dictator’s use of chemical weapons,' Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday, calling Assad a
'thug' and a 'murderer.''Some cite the risk of doing things,' he added. 'But we need to ask, “What is the risk of doing nothing?”' In a pointed jab, Vladimir Putin made a plaintive plea for Obama to take more time to consider the full implications of a strike on Syria, appealing, he said, not to another world leader, but to a Nobel Peace laureate
The White House has released this map detailing its understanding of the areas where chemical weapons have been used
U.S. INTELLIGENCE ON THE SOURCE OF SYRIAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK A U.S. intelligence report on the chemical attack in Syria included these findings: The U.S. intelligence community has 'high confidence,' short of actual confirmation, that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack on August 21Members of the Syrian regime were preparing chemical weapons in the three days prior to the August 21 attack and protected themselves using gas masksAt least 1,429 Syrians were killed in the attacks, including 426 childrenThe weapons were launched from government-controlled areas into opposition-held or contested territoryThe Syrian government has carried out smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks multiple times over the last yearU.S. intelligence officials 'intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence'On the afternoon of August 21, intelligence officials learned that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operationsThe administration also released a four-page intelligence report Friday that said at least 1,429 people, including
more than 400 children, were killed by the chemical weapons attack on August 21. The
report concludes with 'high confidence,' short of actual confirmation, that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack.Russian President Vladimir Putin countered Saturday that it would be 'utter
nonsense' for the Syrian government to use chemical weapons and urged the U.S. to hold off on any military action.'While
the Syrian army is on the offensive, saying that it is the Syrian government that used chemical weapons is utter nonsense,' he said. 'I would like to address Obama as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate: before using force in Syria, it would be good to think about future casualties.'He challenged the U.S. to provide any evidence tying Assad's forces to the attack
and suggested that top leaders discuss the issue next week at the G20 summit.'If they say that the [Syrian] governmental forces used weapons of mass destruction… and that they have
proof of it, let them present it to the UN inspectors and the [UN] Security Council,' Putin said. 'Claims that the proof exists, but is classified and cannot be presented to anybody are below criticism. This is plain disrespect for their partners.' Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.''WE ARE PREPARED TO STRIKE:' OBAMA SEEKS CONGRESSIONAL VOTEBelow are President Obama remarks on Syria that he delivered on Saturday:Ten days ago, the world watched in horror as men, women and children were massacred in Syria in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century. Yesterday the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack on its own people.Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus, and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place. And all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see -- hospitals overflowing with victims; terrible images of the dead. All told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. Several hundred of them were children -- young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government.This attack is an assault on human dignity. It also presents a serious danger to our national security. It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. It endangers our friends and our partners along Syria’s borders, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons, or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm.In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.Now, after careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets. This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. But I'm confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out.Our military has positioned assets in the region. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose. Moreover, the Chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive; it will be effective tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now. And I'm prepared to give that order.But having made my decision as Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I'm also mindful that I'm the President of the world's oldest constitutional democracy. I've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And that’s why I've made a second decision: I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress. Over the last several days, we've heard from members of Congress who want their voices to be heard. I absolutely agree. So this morning, I spoke with all four congressional leaders, and they've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session. In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security. And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote. I'm confident in the case our government has made without waiting for U.N. inspectors. I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that, so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable. As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister supported taking action.Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective. We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. And this morning, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy. A country faces few decisions as grave as using military force, even when that force is limited. I respect the views of those who call for caution, particularly as our country emerges from a time of war that I was elected in part to end. But if we really do want to turn away from taking appropriate action in the face of such an unspeakable outrage, then we must acknowledge the costs of doing nothing.Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price? What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced? Make no mistake -- this has implications beyond chemical warfare. If we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules? To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms? To terrorist who would spread biological weapons? To armies who carry out genocide? We cannot raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say, the accords we sign, the values that define us. So just as I will take this case to Congress, I will also deliver this message to the world. While the U.N. investigation has some time to report on its findings, we will insist that an atrocity committed with chemical weapons is not simply investigated, it must be confronted.I don't expect every nation to agree with the decision we have made. Privately we’ve heard many expressions of support from our friends. But I will ask those who care about the writ of the international community to stand publicly behind our action.And finally, let me say this to the American people: I know well that we are weary of war. We’ve ended one war in Iraq. We’re ending another in Afghanistan. And the American people have the good sense to know we cannot resolve the underlying conflict in Syria with our military. In that part of the world, there are ancient sectarian differences, and the hopes of the Arab Spring have unleashed forces of change that are going to take many years to resolve. And that's why we’re not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else’s war. Instead, we’ll continue to support the Syrian people through our pressure on the Assad regime, our commitment to the opposition, our care for the displaced, and our pursuit of a political resolution that achieves a government that respects the dignity of its people.But we are the United States of America, and we cannot and must not turn a blind eye to what happened in Damascus. Out of the ashes of world war, we built an international order and enforced the rules that gave it meaning. And we did so because we believe that the rights of individuals to live in peace and dignity depends on the responsibilities of nations. We aren’t perfect, but this nation more than any other has been willing to meet those responsibilities.So to all members of Congress of both parties, I ask you to take this vote for our national security. I am looking forward to the debate. And in doing so, I ask you, members of Congress, to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment. Ultimately, this is not about who occupies this office at any given time; it’s about who we are as a country. I believe that the people’s representatives must be invested in what America does abroad, and now is the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments. We do what we say. And we lead with the belief that right makes might -- not the other way around.We all know there are no easy options. But I wasn’t elected to avoid hard decisions. And neither were the members of the House and the Senate. I’ve told you what I believe, that our security and our values demand that we cannot turn away from the massacre of countless civilians with chemical weapons. And our democracy is stronger when the President and the people’s representatives stand together.I’m ready to act in the face of this outrage. Today I’m asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation.
