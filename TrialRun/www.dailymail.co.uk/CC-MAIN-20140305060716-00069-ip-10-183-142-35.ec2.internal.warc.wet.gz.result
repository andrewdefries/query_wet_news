Article:
BBC resists calls to have atheists on Radio 4's Thought for the Day 'God Slot'
Author of reported comment:

Comment:
we're talking about a slot reserved for religious views that's in a prime schedule, embedded in a popular radio breakfast programme. It's a bit unreasonable to expect people to switch off their radios for five minutes then turn them back on again. Personally it doesn't bother me, but if your otherwise-favourite programme had five minutes of its schedule dedicated to views you found disagreeable, I think you might perhaps view the situation differently.
- Keith, Bristol, United Kingdom, 10/9/2012 19:16
My favourite programmes usually have several minutes, usually just after the news, devoted to sport. As I find football, etc, completely pointless, is it unreasonable to expect me to have to turn off my radio for five minutes then back on again? Or should I continue to do what the atheists do and just let it pass me by? If they get a part of the God-slot I want a section of the sports news where someone gets to say what a complete and utter waste of time, effort and money sport is!

Defiant Wenger unconcerned about faltering Arsenal form as fans voice their frustration after bore draw at Villa Author of reported comment:
James, London

Comment ID:

Comment:
@ Brilliant Orange - The Emirates is awesome - best in Britain in my opinion (I may be a bit biased). Season tickets are worth it for the brilliant stadium in London and not to sound like a snob but the price is around half a months wages for a large number Londoners hence why there is such a large waiting list. Then there are people like me who have to option to renew before the waiting list gets them. Wenger is not untouchable but I don't think he has done anything wrong, sure he has got the odd transfer wrong but I still think the team as a whole was strong. He was also right to play a weaker team because of the number of matches there has been in the week (sure we work 5 days a week but I only walk around my office and climb a stair case 3 floors when I can't be bothered waiting for the lift). I also think Wenger might have thought Giroud got injured. I also stand by my fake fan comment - we get these comments every season then a few months later they flip flop.

The multi-millionaire criminals claiming a fortune from legal aid: Loophole gives 50 rich defendants �300,000 EACH

There's got to be a 'sensible' answer to this, its stories like this that make ordinary hard-working citizens of this country want to spit. If the criminals assets are frozen I can't understand once found guilty why it shouldn't be straight forward to recover costs by enforcing asset selling. As per usual once the greedy lawyers spin their legal loophole webs we haven't got a chance. Your email address:

Ancient Egyptians primarily had sex in the summer, new research reveals.The most popular time for love-making was July and August meaning that 20 per cent more babies were born in March and April than in other months.As a consequence, most deaths among women of childbearing age also occurred in these months. A Roman mosaic depicting the flooding of the Nile from the 1st century BC. Researchers say beliefs about the impact of Nile floods on fertility may explain birth patterns in the region
Archaeologists working at a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis in Egypt excavated 765 graves and were able to establish the month of each person’s death because the graves were all pointed towards the rising sun.Live Science reported that they uncovered the graves of 124 babies that had died 18 to 45 weeks after conception – putting these two pieces of information together enabled the researchers to piece together the most popular time for love-making.The findings are particularly surprising because in other ancient Mediterranean cultures fewer babies are thought to have been conceived during the hot summer months because the heat lowered libido and possibly affected sperm count.

It is thought that in ancient Egypt beliefs about fertility and the Nile flood may have been responsible for the baby booms.The residents of the Dakhleh Oasis believed that the river was the key to their land’s fertility and the floods occurred during the summer months meaning that there were widespread celebrations.The researchers believe that the peak in spring births continued until the 1920s or 30s. The medina district in the settlement of Al-Qasr in the Dakhla Oasis of western Egypt, where the researchers studied the skeletons of children to find the time of the year they were born
In contrast, conception rates fell to annual lows in January and this is believed to have been because Christian believes required abstinence during Advent and Lent.Additionally, it is thought that early Egyptian Christians were encouraged to avoid sex on Saturdays, Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays.Finally, it is believed that some form of contraception must have been in use and it is thought that recipes including crocodile dung were so unpleasant that they put people off intercourse altogether.

BBC make a drama of World Cup 2018 bid crisis

England's doomed bid to host the 2018 World Cup will become the centre of controversy again when BBC Radio Four broadcast a drama about the failed campaign around the first anniversary of the vote in December. The Beeb are re-creating the last three days in Zurich, when the hype around the Three Lions of Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham stoked hugely inflated expectation of an England success before the humiliation of a first-round exit and an outcry about FIFA corruption. The Bid, a co-commission between Radio Four and BBC World Service, will also focus on the parts played by the England 2018 high command of Geoff Thompson, Andy Anson and David Dein, as well as FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who will no doubt see the project as another example of England being 'bad losers'.

The first draft of the script was described by one England 2018 insider as 'abysmal' and 'riddled with inaccuracies' - including the portrayal of Manchester City's inclusion project manager Eddie Afekafe, who made such an impressive speech on the day of the vote. Writer Matthew Solon, responsible for the award-winning BBC factual drama about the collapse of banking giants Lehman Brothers, is in talks with 2018 bid participants over their complaints about the authenticity of the script. But a spokesman said: 'Any final edit will be under the control of the BBC.'BBC's Sports Personality cuts The triumphs of Mark Cavendish, Dai Greene, Mo Farah, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy - as well as Alastair Cook and Co from the Ashes triumph - will make 2011 a vintage Sports Personality of the Year contest. More's the pity the cuts-ravaged BBC have reverted to a studio show from their new Manchester headquarters on December 22 rather than continue taking the programme to big arenas where public tickets sold out. The BBC say the retrograde step is to save money and showcase Salford, and that SPOTY might go back on the road in Olympic year. Zara in a spinJuniper Sports, the PR agency brought in by the hapless RFU to represent them at home during the Rugby World Cup, are also having to put a positive spin on the dwarf-related meltdown in New Zealand in their other role as agents for Mike Tindall's wife Zara Phillips. World Cup woe: Phillips will return to New Zealand is she has the opportunity
Zara has now returned from Dunedin after a brief trip across the world to chat to her husband about his late-night antics in a Queenstown bar. Juniper say Zara will return to the Rugby World Cup if she gets another window in her equestrian schedule - assuming England progress. League Cup cash scrapThe impasse between the Football League and the Carling Cup title sponsors is all about money. The FL are searching for new backers having turned down an offer from Molson Coors - Carling's parent company - to renew for three years at around the current £15million. The League, who need to fill a £60m hole left by their reduced TV rights after BBC and ESPN failed to bid, are looking for at least £25m. Cupset: The Football League have rejected the latest offer
But Carling, who have helped rescue an ailing competition during their 14-year support, won't pay that amount, especially without exposure on the BBC. And, as a British brand, they are not attracted by the increased global reach of the Football League. Kop lead TV cash drive Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has opened the next battle front between Premier League clubs over TV rights with his 'Television is God' call for a greater share of the revenue. But it is Liverpool, rather than United, who are understood to be most in favour of the £1.3billion from foreign rights being divided via viewing attraction overseas rather than the collective bargaining agreement that has been in place since the birth of the PL. However there is no way a majority of top-flight clubs will vote against an equal share of TV cash. Kop that! Liverpool would advocate a new system to allocate TV cash
Fergie's surprising in-depth interview with BBC North West Tonight, in which he called for more TV money, was done as a favour to long-time host Gordon Burns. The former Krypton Factor presenter is being forced out before he wanted to retire and told viewers in a newsletter: 'It wasn't my choice.' Such is the ill-feeling that few of his BBC bosses will be invited to Burns' leaving party. More...

Roy Hodgson came out on top in the battle of the England coaches as he led an FA Legends team to a 4-2 victory over Stuart Pearce's British Army XI in a fund-raising match at Reading this afternoon.The likes of Gary Neville, Gareth Southgate and Darren Anderton turned out for Hodgson's Legends team at the Madejski Stadium, where around 4,000 fans turned up to watch the charity game, which was organised by the Football Association and the British Army. Head to head: Roy Hodgson and Stuart Pearce were in opposing dugouts on Saturday at the Madejski Stadium

FA LEGENDS SQUADGraeme Murty, Gary Neville, Danny Mills,
Graeme Le Saux, Ugo Ehiogu, Matt Le Tissier, Gareth Southgate, Dietmar Hamann, Jan Aage Fjortoft, Paul Merson, Chris Kamara, Peter Beardsley, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Kevin Kilbane, Tore Andre Flo, Jimmy Walker, Marlon Beresford, Darren Anderton, Ben Shepherd, Gaizka Mendieta.
The British Army team, coached by England Under 21 manager Pearce, took the lead twice, but goals from Tore Andre Flo, Kevin Kilbane, Jan Age Fjortoft and TV presenter Ben Shepherd gave Hodgson's team a 4-2 win.
The
Legends got off to the worst possible start, going behind in the fourth
minute when Lance Corporal Iain Robinson snuck a ball between Southgate
and Ugo Ehiogu to find Royal Signals Corporal Jay Bates, who beat former Liverpool stopper Tony Warner.
Ex-Chelsea
striker Flo equalised with a deflected shot, but the Army were soon back in front when Sergeant Keith Emmerson drove past Warner after some good work by Stafford Town striker Sam Agar.
Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson instructs his team at the break as Graeme Le Saux looks on
No hairdryer: Stuart Pearce briefs his Army XI side at half-time
Former Wigan man Kilbane levelled the game on the half hour with an impressive solo effort.
England
boss Hodgson rang the changes at half-time, and two of his substitutes -
Fjortoft and Shepherd combined to put the Legends ahead.
The Norwegian fed Shepherd a short pass and he curled his shot around the goalkeeper and in to the net off the far post.
Jimmy
Floyd Hasselbaink then entered the box and his deflected shot fell in to the path of Fjortoft, who slipped the ball under Army goalkeeper Luke
Cairney from 10 yards to seal the win.
Proceeds
from the game, which was organised by the FA to commemorate its 150th anniversary and to celebrate 125 years of Army football, will go to the Team Army Sports Foundation and the Royal British Legion.

Calling the shots: FA Legends boss Roy Hodgson calls out to Gary Neville
The match, at Reading's Madejski Stadium, was in support of the Armed services and will raise money for two service charities, the Team Army Sports Foundation and The Royal British Legion.
In
a statement before the game, the FA said: 'In the past legendary players represented the Army during National Service, such as Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Duncan Edwards (all of Manchester United and England), Jim Baxter (Rangers and Scotland), Dave Mackay (Tottenham Hotspur and England), Cliff Jones (Tottenham and Wales). 'The sacrifices made by those in the service of their country deserves the full support of football, and fans
should turn out to pay tribute to them on Saturday at the Madejski Stadium.'The Team Army
Sports Foundation supports a wide range of Army sports, including Army football ; it also supports charities that offer sporting opportunities for injured soldiers.'Rehabilitation
of soldiers following combat, both physically and psychologically is a huge tool for restoring them into society, and playing against some star
players is the ultimate reward.' Gunning for the old days: Paul Merson (right) attempts to control a pass for the FA Legends
