Published: November 28, 2011CECAFA Tusker Challenge Cup Day 4: Sudan 1 Ethiopia 1, Uganda 4 Somalia 0
By Shafi'i Mohyaddin Abokar As the 2011 CECAFA Tusker challenge cup entered its fourth day on Monday Somalia has been defeated 4-0 by Uganda a powerful football nation in the east and Central Africa region. The match was held at Azam stadium just in the outskirts of the Tanzanian capital
Dar Es Salaam.
During the first half Somalia seemed to wrestling with its Ugandan rivals and they made at least four scoring attempts, but failed in all. Likewise Uganda made the same successive attempts, but were unsuccessful to score in the first half of the match.
However, in the early minutes of the second half apparently in the 48thminute Uganda's Dan Wagaluka scored the first goal against Somalia, while Emanuel Owki scored the 2nd, the 3rd and the 4th goals for his team in the 63rd, 82nd and 90th minute of the second half.
On Friday, the inauguration day of the tournament Somalia was given a 4-1 defeat by Burundi and today's humiliation was meant that Somalia was totally eliminated from the tournament.
The Ocean stars that came from the war-weary horn of African country of Somalia are expected to return to Mogadishu on Friday after they have played their last match against Zanzibar on Thursday.
Mean while, Ethiopia had 1-1 draw with Sudan, as Malawi humiliated Kenya by 2-0. Both matches were held at the National stadium in Dar Es Salaam.
