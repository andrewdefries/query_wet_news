Author Michael Walker says that by the end of the 1960s, you could fairly say there were two generations of baby boomers: those who had experienced that decade's peace-and-love era of music firsthand, and those who learned about it from their older brothers and sisters. "So when the early '70s got there," Walker says, "this half of the baby boom decided to have their own party, and they wanted their own bands. And they brought to prominence bands like Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, The Who — sort of from both generations. The late-born baby boomers, that was their moment."

Culture What 15,000 Years Of Cooking Fish Tells Us About Humanity
by Barbara J. King
April 18, 201311:39 AM
Research published last week in the journal Nature shows that hunter-gatherer people living in Japan 15,000 ago cooked food in ceramic pots. Chemical analysis of the charred remains in the pots demonstrates that the food items were both marine and freshwater in origin, and almost certainly fish rather than mollusks. Until recently the invention of pottery-making was linked to the onset of agriculture, around 12,000 years ago. The thinking was that hunter-gatherers — foragers who typically are nomadic, without domesticated crops or animals — were either too mobile or simply too unsophisticated to have made ceramics. And when pottery finally was dated prior to the onset of farming, the function of pots made by hunter-gatherers was unknown. Until now. So this is big news, because it shifts, yet again, our understanding of the behavior of forager peoples. Archaeologist Oliver E. Craig, of York University in the UK, is the lead author (of 14 total) on the article, which is entitled "Earliest evidence for the use of pottery." In an email message to me on Tuesday, Craig reflected on this new understanding: We often think that hunter-gatherers were so shaped by the environments they lived in, almost passive, subsisting on the foods immediately available to them. I think this pottery study shows how sophisticated they were, even during the late Paleolithic. They had time to produce pots for processing foods selectively — they valued different foods in different ways, just like we do today. To understand what Craig means by "processing foods selectively," it's helpful to look at the details of the study. Charred food rem

The Stump FCC Requires Top Market TV Stations To Post Political Ad Data Online
by Padmananda Rama
April 27, 2012 3:08 PM
The Federal Communications Commission on Friday approved a rule requiring TV stations to post details online about the amount of advertising time political candidates and campaigns buy, as well as how much the stations charge for those ads. TV stations already are required to keep such public records. But in most cases, the information has been accessible only to those who visit a TV station and physically look through paper files, NPR's Brian N

America 'Path To Citizenship' Part Of Senators' Bipartisan Immigration Plan

Saying their proposal would "secure the border, modernize and streamline our current legal immigration system" and create "a tough but fair legalization program for individuals who are currently here," eight senators unveiled a "bipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration reform." The Associated Press writes that "although thorny details remain to be negotiated and success is far from certain, the development heralds the start of what could be the most significant effort in years toward overhauling the nation's inefficient patchwork of immigration laws."

Journalist Max Hastings discusses his new book, Armageddon. The book tells the story of the bloody and violent final months of World War II from the point of view of the people who suffered through those months — and lived to tell about it. Copyright © 2005 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. STEVE INSKEEP, host: The journalist Max Hastings says that even with all the books and movies devoted to World War II, there's something we may overlook. Mr. MAX HASTINGS (Author, "Armageddon"): We know about the Holocaust. We know about the six million Jews who died. What's much less widely known is that in the Second World War, the Germans took about six million Russian soldiers prisoners and about three million of them died in captivity. It was a stupendous struggle of a scale of brutality that even to this day some people in the West still don't fully appreciate. INSKEEP: Vast regions of Eastern Europe were devastated, including some of the countries that President Bush will visit starting at the end of this week to mark the anniversary of the war's end. Germany surrendered 60 years ago this month. Max Hastings' book "Armageddon" describes the war's final months through the eyes of people who survived to tell their stories. Mr. HASTINGS: One man who always stuck in my mind was a fighter pilot who was shot down over the German lines at the beginning of 1945. When he recovered, he was sent as a slave laborer to Pennemunde on the Baltic, where they were testing the V2 rocket. And there he found himself in this camp where Russian slave laborers were dying in hundreds and thousands every week. And after he'd been there a couple of weeks, he concluded that if he stayed there till the end of the war, that either they'd die of starvation or the Germans would shoot the survivors before the Red Army arrived. So he said to his work gang--eight of them--he said, `We're going to escape.' And they said, `How can we? This is an island. Everyone who's tried has been torn to pieces by the dogs.' And he said, `I'm a pilot. I'm going to fly you out.' After a couple of days, early one morning, they clubbed their guard to death and ran 400 yards down the runway to the commandant's personal aircraft. They managed to get into this thing, to get it started and to get it into the air. And they were so weak with hunger that the pilot had to have one of the other prisoners standing behind him, leaning over him, helping him to move the controls. And they lurched across the Baltic before finally they saw snow and the coastline beneath them. They crash-landed in the snow over the Red Army lines, and for the first couple of hours they were treated as heroes. And then the NKVD, Stalin's secret police, arrived and interrogated them. And after two hours, they said, `What you claim to have done is impossible. This is obviously a German plot.' Well, I said to this man, `Where did you spend V-E Day?' He said, `Where I spent the next two years,' he said, `in solitary confinement.' INSKEEP: This is a time in the last months of the war when the German invasion of Russia had turned out
