A new study shows eligible voters who favored whites over blacks- either consciously or unconsciously- also favored Republican candidates relative to Barack Obama. Psychologist Anthony Greenwald discusses the results and why racial attitudes continue to predict voter preference in 2012.

If the polls are a good indicator, the economy, jobs, the deficit, health care and education are likely to be the issues that weigh heavily on voters' minds when they head to the polls in November. But researchers say there may be another factor that influences the presidential vote this election cycle, and that's racial attitudes. Four years after Americans elected their first black president, a new study shows that it is premature to count race out as a factor. Dr. Tony Greenwald was lead investigator for the study and is a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. He joins us from KUOW in Seattle. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ANTHONY GREENWALD: Hi, Ira, thanks. FLATOW: You're welcome. Why do a study on racial attitudes in 2012, after we've had, you know, the election of President Obama in 2008? You wouldn't think this is a big issue anymore. GREENWALD: Well, it was an open question whether there's - race attitudes are still affecting Americans' political attitudes or not. We certainly found that they were in 2008. Obama won, but he actually won despite race biases that were opposing him. Obama lost the white vote by 55 to 45 percent, which is a rather large margin. So we did a similar study, much larger this year, just to see what was happening. FLATOW: And what did you find out? GREENWALD: We found that the level of race bias indicating preference, and this was in the Republican primaries, we were asking about support for the different Republican candidates and comparing them with Obama, we found that this was predicted by race attitudes of several kinds. We measured race attitudes in a few different ways, such as asking people explicitly what they thought of black and white, and a lot of people in our sample thought that black and white are just equal, they have no racial preference. But we also used the implicit association test, which gives us a measure of implicit bias, we sometimes call it automatic white preference, and that's something that many more people have. FLATOW: So you found that even though people thought they were unbiased, when you tested them, they actually showed bias. GREENWALD: Yes, and we looked especially at people who are most likely to think they are lacking in bias, such as the self-described egalitarians, also political liberals. Our sample, being an Internet sample, is not surprising that it was a majority of liberals. And we found that the implicit race attitudes of these liberals and the egalitarians predicted their warmth toward Republican candidates. FLATOW: So in other words, many white and non-white voters will unconsciously vote against President Obama because of his race, but when asked, they'll give a reason other than race. GREENWALD: That's
