'Obamneycare' Revisited: Tax Penalties Most Similar Part, Expert Says by Liz Halloran
July 05, 2012 1:01 PM
When Mitt Romney was still battling last fall to become the GOP candidate for president, we compared the health care plan he implemented as governor of Massachusetts to the one President Obama signed into law in 2010. At the time, Romney's role in signing state legislation that required residents to buy health insurance was being used against him by his Republican primary opponents. They characterized his support as governor of an "individual mandate" as anathema to the party's hard-line opposition to Obama's plan. (Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, now believed to be on Romney's running mate short list, tagged the Massachusetts law "Obamneycare.") Now that the Supreme Court has weighed in, finding Obama's plan constitutional by viewing the mandate as a tax, constitutionally applied by Congress, we thought we'd revisit that comparison. And we're looking at Romney's assertion on CBS News that even though the court found that the mandate in Obama's law is a tax, the finding doesn't apply to the state law because ... well, here's how he explained it to the network: "Actually, the — chief justice, in his opinion, made it very clear that, at the state level — states have the power to put in place mandates. They don't need to require them to be called taxes in order for them to be constitutional. And — and as a result, Massachusetts' mandate was a mandate, was a penalty, was described that way by the Legislature and by me. And so it stays as it was." We looked at what Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, and believe these may be the sections on which Romney was hanging his argument that even though the Massachusetts mandate is essentially the same as the federal mandate (a penalty assessed on those who have an ability to buy health insurance but don't, and collected by the taxing authority), it isn't a tax because the high court has not weighed in. The first reference comes after Roberts goes to some length noting the differences between the powers of the federal government and those conferred on the states. Roberts says the federal government "has expanded dramatically over the past two centuries, but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions." And he follows with this: "The same does not apply to the States, because the Con­stitution is not the source of their power. The Consti­tution may restrict state governments — as it does, for example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal protection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do not apply, state governments do not need constitutional au­thorization to act. The States thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government — punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning property for development, to name but a few — even though the Constitution's text does not authorize any government to do so. Our cases refer to this general power of govern­ing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Gov­ernment, as the 'police power.' " See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618–619 (2000). Several pages later, as part of his dismissal of the argument that the health care law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause, he again references the "police power" vested in states: "Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food, clothing, transportation, shelter or energy; that does not authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular products in those or other markets today. The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions. Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains vested in the States." When we put together our comparison of the Romney and Obama plans, we spoke with John McDonough, director of

< Justin Timberlake On Music, Comedy And Wearing Out His NPR T-Shirt
October 29, 201112:01 AM
Copyright ©2011 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. GUY RAZ, host: Our music segment today: the new Sinatra? Well, Justin Timberlake may very well be his generation's Sinatra or Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ROCK YOUR BODY") JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE: (Singing) Don't be so quick to walk away, dance with me. I wanna rock your body, please stay. RAZ: He sings, he dances, he acts, and in recent years, Justin Timberlake's made a name for himself in comedy bits on "Saturday Night Live." In last year's film, "The Social Network," he played Sean Parker, an early backer of Facebook, and Timberlake's portrayal earned him high praise from the critics. His new movie is a futuristic sci-fi thriller. It's called "In Time." Timberlake plays Will Salas. He's a man who is trapped in a world where no one ages past 25 years old and money can literally save your life. When he sat down with us recently, we asked him about his music, his life, and of course, his new film. TIMBERLAKE: It's a future where time is the currency. You know, time is money and we're able to give that money back and forth. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, "IN TIME") TIMBERLAKE: (as Will Salas) A man named Henry Hamilton gave me over a century. He said he didn't need it anymore. It was a gift. I'm not a thief. But, hey, if you guys are looking for stolen time, maybe you should arrest everyone here. And, you know, our life span's directly linked to a digital ticking clock that's on our left forearm. And when you run out of time, you die. It's about separating class by wealth. RAZ: Justin Timberlake, this is really the first time that you have played the leading character in the film. What was that like for you? Was it difficult for you? TIMBERLAKE: It's funny. When you're making a movie, you're obviously not as conscious of it. And then you screen the whole thing after they finish it and you become incredibly insecure because you're seeing your face the whole film. But I don't know. I think I wanted to play this character because I admired him. I admired his courage and his brass. So it was a lot of fun to play this character. I mean, look, you tack on getting to shoot guns and kick ass and kiss hot girls and you flip cars. And it's like every boyhood fantasy. RAZ: Isn't that your real life though? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) TIMBERLAKE: Yeah, yeah. I shoot guns at people. I try to get in a fight once a day and just randomly kiss as many women as possible. No. You know, I think it's every boyhood fantasy trapped into one film. So - I mean, I had a ball playing this character. RAZ: Justin, the breakthrough role for you was the one you played in the film "Social Network" as Sean Parker. How much did that film open a whole new world for you? TIMBERLAKE: Yeah. That's sort of my running joke with all of my closest friends is that I should have a business card that says David Fincher put me in a movie. No. I obviously saw that c
