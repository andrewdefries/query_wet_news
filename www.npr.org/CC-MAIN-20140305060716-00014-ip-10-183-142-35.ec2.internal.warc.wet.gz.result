For the most part in American culture, intellectual struggle in school children is seen as an indicator of weakness, while in Eastern cultures it is not only tolerated, it is often used to measure emotional strength. (This piece initially aired on Nov. 12, 2012 on Morning Edition.)
Copyright © 2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: On a holiday Monday, it's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
