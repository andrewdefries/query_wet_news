Open in new window
Closed captioning of: US forces hunt down, kill Osama bin Laden Advertise
>>>
welcome to "today" on this monday morning. i'm meredith vieira
. matt lauer
is at ground zero
where nearly 3,000 people lost their lives on september 11
, 2001
. 140 were killed at the pentagon and 40 others died on a plane that crashed in pennsylvania. obviously the headline front page
has to do with osama bin laden
. this one, the new york times, bin laden
killed by forces in pakistan
, obama declaring justice has been done. the new york post, "got him, vengeance at last" and "the daily news," rot in hell. intelligence officials learned of osama bin laden
's possible location in august. the president felt confident enough to give the order to bring him to justice. in the years after 9/11 we heard so much about bin laden
hiding in mountain caves but in the end he was living in a mansion in a small affluent town 35 miles north of the pakistani capitol just is 100 yards away from the military academy
. nbc news learned bin laden
's body was recovered during the raid and buried within 24 hours
. the burial took place at sea. complete coverage beginning with chief white house
correspondent chuck todd
. good morning to you.
>> reporter: good morning, meredith. it was an operation eight months in the planning with the president personally overseeing five meetings in the final six weeks as the u.s. government
zeroed in on public enemy
number one, osama bin laden
. it was shortly before midnight
when the president announced the news.
>>
tonight, i can report to the american people
and to the world that the united states
has conducted an operation that killed osama bin laden
, the leaderlead leader of al qaeda
.
>> reporter: the president made it clear getting bin laden
was always a priority.
>>
shortly after taking office i directed leon panetta
, the director of the cia
, to make the killing or capture of bin laden
the top priority
of our war against al qaeda
.
>> reporter: while intelligence officials suspected bin laden
was hiding in pakistan
, the exact location wasn't known until august.
>>
after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community
i was briefed on a possible lead to bin laden
.
>> reporter: that lead, a bin laden
courier whom intelligence operatives had been tracking for years. he led them to a large compound in an affluent town 35 miles outside of islamabad, pakistan
.
>>
last week i determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get osama bin laden
and bring him to justice.
>> reporter: the president gave that final order friday morning in the situation room, just minutes before leaving washington to tour the tornado devastation in alabama. he called the death of bin laden
the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al qaeda
.
>>
usa! usa!
>> reporter: the news spread quickly and jubilant crowds gathered at the white house
.
>>
i wanted to come out here and show my support for the u.s.
>> reporter: sunday night white house
officials made calls to key leaders all over the country. the president personally briefed george w. bush
and bill clinton
. bush said, the fight against terror goes on, but tonight american has sent a message. no matter how long it takes, justice will be done. with nearly 150,000 troops fighting in afghanistan and iraq, some see this as a big morale boost.
>>
it's a shot main the arm to the u.s. armed forces
. 48,000 have been killed fighting the war on terror
. taking down this iconic figure is a very significant event.
>> reporter: the president called the killing of bin laden
a testament to the greatness of our country. with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks four months away he had a special message for those who lost loved ones in the attack.
>>
justice has been done.
>> reporter: the administration is trying to determine how to release the visual evidence of the dead bin laden
. we'll hear from the president around lunchtime as he has a scheduled medal of honor
ceremony for two korean war
vet vetera veterans.
>>
the administration made a decision that they will release evidence of the body?
>> reporter: they haven't made the decision yet. they realize it is necessary in some form. so they are still wrangling with how, when and where to do that.
