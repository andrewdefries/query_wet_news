Dwight Howard is known as one of the most fun and goofy players in the NBA, even though he does not hesitate to criticize the league's referees. After the Orlando Magic defeated the Atlanta Hawks and took a 2-0 lead in the series Thursday night, it was difficult to tell if the 24-year-old center was being serious or not. At the beginning of Howard's postgame press conference, Orlando radio personality Jerry O'Neill commented on the Magic center's outfit, saying, "That's a good color on you." The 6-11 giant was shocked and almost speechless. All Howard could say is "wow," as O'Neill immediately began to apologize and tried to move on to the actual question. Scroll down to watch the exchange. Quick Poll
How do you think Dwight Howard really felt?

CHICAGO — Alone on his 49th birthday, President Barack Obama fled the empty White House mansion and headed for a more intimate celebration with longtime friends in his Chicago hometown.
Obama has been living a bachelor's life for the past several days with first lady Michelle Obama and daughter Sasha visiting Spain and daughter Malia spending the month away at an undisclosed camp.
Before leaving Washington on Wednesday afternoon with the family dog, Bo, Obama got a couple of presents he didn't have to unwrap and which the White House described as being the highlight of his day: telephone calls from the women in his life.
Mrs. Obama and Sasha phoned in their happy birthday wishes, followed by a lunchtime call from Malia.
"Needless to say ... both those calls were the highlights of his day," White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters who traveled with Obama aboard Air Force One.
Obama's Secret Service detail got him a present, though Gibbs would describe it only as "heartfelt."
As the presidential motorcade pulled closer to his house in Hyde Park, neighbors lined the street to welcome him home with waves and signs, including "Happy 49th Birthday President Barack Obama" and "Happy Birthday Mr. President."
Obama continued his birthday celebration over a leisurely, two-hour dinner with friends at graham elliot in Chicago's River North neighborhood. His dinner companions included longtime friends Eric Whitaker, Marty Nesbitt and Valerie Jarrett, also a senior White House adviser and fellow Chicagoan.
Obama's birthday – though a year short of the milestone 5-0 – also was viewed in this election year as a prime fundraising opportunity for Democrats, who fear losing their hold on both houses of Congress come November. E-mails, house parties and other forms of outreach sought to capitalize on Obama's big day.
Mrs. Obama even joined the act, asking supporters to sign an e-mail birthday card being distributed by Organizing for America, Obama's political organization. More than 1.2 million people had signed it as of Wednesday morning.
The Republican Party marked the occasion with a new website offering 11 different e-cards people can send Obama, including ones mocking the ethics problems of Democratic Reps. Charles Rangel of New York and Maxine Waters of California, and noting key Democratic election losses in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
Obama planned to help out with the money-raising on Thursday by headlining separate events in Chicago for the Democratic Party and Alexi Giannoulias, the Democrat eyeing the Senate seat Obama gave up to become president.
The president spoke earlier Wednesday at an AFL-CIO meeting in Washington and joked about not getting a birthday cake from his "good friends" in the labor movement. A cake apparently had been planned, according to union president Richard Trumka, but he said the Secret Service had nixed the idea.
Obama said he'd have a talk with the agents then joked, "They're probably eating it right now."

(RNS) Houses of worship and other charities often aren't in competition for dollars but instead tend to reap donations from similar donors, a new study shows.
Slightly more than 50 percent of people who financially supported congregations also gave to at least one charitable organization in the last year, according to a study conducted by Phoenix-based Grey Matter Research Consulting.
Researchers also found that the more Americans give to a house of worship, the more they donate to other groups. And the trend continues with the generosity of the donor.
For example, donors who gave less than $100 to a house of worship also donated an average of $208 to other charities. Those who gave between $100 and $499 to a congregation gave an average of $376 to others. Donors of between $500 and $999 to places of worship gave an
average of $916 to others.
"Americans who give to their church or place of worship are more likely to give, period -- including to charitable organizations," said Ron Sellers, president of the Phoenix-based research firm, formerly known as Ellison Research "Rather than be in competition for the donor dollar, it seems that giving fosters giving."
The study, which was commissioned by the nonprofit fundraising firm Russ Reid Co. of Pasadena, Calif., was conducted last May by telephone and online among a nationally representative sample of 2,005 American adults. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

What do the prophet Muhammad and Queen’s guitarist Brian May have in common? Look to the sky for the next two weeks for the answer: the zodiacal light. The zodiacal light is a very rare astronomical phenomenon. It is important in Islam because Muhammad used it to describe the times of prayer. Rock guitarist Brian May of Queen, meanwhile, has a doctorate in astronomy for research into (you guessed it) the zodiacal light. For the next couple of weeks, night sky observers will have an excellent opportunity to observe the zodiacal light. We all know about the large bodies that make up the solar system: the sun, the planets and their moons, the asteroids and comets. But there is a lot of interplanetary matter which has never coalesced into large solid bodies. This is mostly dust left over from the original nebula out of which the solar system formed, and it’s concentrated in the plane of the solar system, which is known as the ecliptic or zodiac. At certain times of the year under certain conditions, this thin interplanetary dust can be seen with the naked eye, and the next two weeks present such an opportunity. The first requirement for seeing the zodiacal light is an extremely dark sky. Its glow is much fainter than that of the Milky Way, so that, if you can’t see the Milky Way from your location, you can forget about seeing the zodiacal light. The second requirement is that there be no moon in the night sky. That’s why the next two weeks are so important: the moon will be close to the sun or in the evening sky, leaving the morning sky moonless. The third requirement is that the ecliptic, the line in the sky where the sun, moon, and planets move, be at a high angle to the horizon. This happens in February and March in the western sky after dusk, and in September and October in the eastern sky before dawn. The sky map guide associated with this story shows the eastern sky at 5 a.m. local time this week. The Milky Way appears as a ghostly glow of distant stars rising vertically from the east-southeast horizon, marked by the bright stars Sirius and Procyon. To the Milky Way's left, rising from the eastern horizon at an angle, will be the fainter glow of the sun reflecting off countless particles of interplanetary dust — the zodiacal light. It will follow the path of the ecliptic, marked by Venus and Regulus. You can tell the difference between the zodiacal light and the Milky Way by its position in the sky, by its shape (conical or triangular, rather than a strip of equal width), and by its faintness. To improve your chances of seeing the zodiacal light, be sure to give your eyes at least 20 minutes to adapt to the darkness. For observers in the Southern Hemisphere, the months for best observation are reversed: Dawn in February and March, dusk in September and October.

Entire Sun ImagedIn February, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html" target="_hplink">NASA's STEREO probes</a>, two observatories that were launched in 2006 to survey the sun, reached opposite ends of the sun and thus, were able to give scientists (and the rest of us!) a never-before-seen view of the far side of the star at the center of our solar system.
The composite image above was captured on June 1, 2011, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/news/farside-060111.html" target="_hplink">and according to NASA</a>, "is the first complete image of the solar far side, the half of the sun invisible from Earth."

Messenger Reaches MercuryWhile it's not a "discovery," <em>per se</em>, it's a milestone that will no doubt lead to many new findings about the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system.
In March, after a 6 1/2-year, 4.9 billion mile journey, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/18/nasa-messenger-mercury_n_837503.html" target="_hplink">NASA's Messenger spacecraft reached Mercury's orbit</a>.
Messenger, the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/mer_orbit.html" target="_hplink">orbits the planet</a> every 12 hours. In November, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/media/MissionExtends.html" target="_hplink">NASA announced that the spacecraft's mission</a>, which was supposed to end on March 17, 2012, would be extended for an additional year. Pluto's Tiny MoonIn July, NASA said that its Hubble Space Telescope <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/new-pluto-moon-hubble-space-telescope_n_904578.html" target="_hplink">discovered an eight to 21-mile-wide moon</a> circling the dwarf planet. Black Hole Eats A StarIn March, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/07/nasa-cosmic-blast_n_846333.html" target="_hplink">NASA's Swift satellite saw an unusually long explosion of gamma-rays</a>. After studying the X-rays, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/25/black-hole-eats-star-video_n_937150.html" target="_hplink">scientists found that they came from</a> a black hole that had become reenergized when it devoured a star.
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/aug/HQ_11-271_Swift_Black_Hole.html" target="_hplink">From NASA</a>:
<blockquote>Astronomers soon realized the source, known as Swift J1644+57, was the result of a truly extraordinary event -- the awakening of a distant galaxy's dormant black hole as it shredded and consumed a star. The galaxy is so far away, it took the light from the event approximately 3.9 billion years to reach Earth. </blockquote>Huge Mountain Discovered On Asteroid<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/dawn/main/index.html" target="_hplink">NASA's Dawn</a>, an ion-propelled spacecraft that traveled 1.7 billion miles before reaching the asteroid Vesta in July, sent back images in October revealing that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/05/vesta-mountain-dawn-nasa_n_996282.html" target="_hplink">Vesta is home to a mountain larger than any mountain</a> on Earth.
In December, NASA released new images that Dawn took when it was orbiting only 130 miles above the asteroid, the closest it will get to Vesta. Dawn will continue to image Vesta until next summer, when it will make its way to Ceres, a bigger asteroid. 'Star Wars'-Like Planet<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/kepler-16b-planet-two-suns_n_964799.html" target="_hplink">NASA's Kepler spacecraft found a planet</a> that orbits two suns, driving fans of the "Star Wars" franchise <a href="http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/09/16/astronomers-discover-real-life-tatooine-star-wars/" target="_hplink">to call it a real-life Tatooine</a>.
Astronomers announced Kepler-16b, which is the first circumbinary planet -- meaning it orbits two stars -- in September.

While the temperature of the 600-light-year away planet could sustain water, it has a radius of 2.4 times that of Earth's, so <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20111206/us-sci-alien-planet/" target="_hplink">it's probably too big</a> to harbor life.Biggest Black Holes Ever DiscoveredAstronomers announced in early December that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/05/black-hole-scientists-discover-huge_n_1129727.html" target="_hplink">they had found the biggest black holes to date</a>.
The massive black holes, which are 10 billion times the size of the sun, are located over 300 million light years away.Europa's 'Great Lakes'Scientists had long-thought that a large body of water existed under the surface of Europa, Jupiter's moon, but it was thought to be tens of miles below an icy crust. In November, though, astronomers analyzing data from <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/" target="_hplink">NASA's Galileo spacecraft</a> found evidence that suggests blocks of ice interact with water below the surface, which could mean that nutrients and energy are moving between the underground ocean and icy shell.
<a href="http://www.ig.utexas.edu/people/staff/britneys/" target="_hplink">Britney Schmidt</a>, the lead author of the study, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/full/nature10608.html" target="_hplink">which appeared in the journal Nature</a>, said that the interaction "could make Europa and its ocean more habitable for life."
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/17/europa-water-jupiter-moon-photo-video_n_1099463.html#s480278&title=Europa" target="_hplink">Click here to read more</a> about water on Europa.
'Bubbles' At The Edge Of Solar SystemNASA's Voyager probes -- launched over 30 years ago -- found huge magnetic "bubbles" at the edge of the solar system.
"The sun's magnetic field extends all the way to the edge of the solar system," astronomer Merav Opher of Boston University <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/heliosphere-surprise.html" target="_hplink">said in a NASA statement</a>. "Because the sun spins, its magnetic field becomes twisted and wrinkled, a bit like a ballerina's skirt. Far, far away from the sun, where the Voyagers are, the folds of the skirt bunch up."
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched in 1977. Voyager 1 is currently 11 billion miles away and may exit our solar system within the next few years.Gypsum On MarsIn December, scientists announced that NASA's <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/mars-water-opportunity-rover-gypsum_n_1136483.html" target="_hplink">Mars Rover Opportunity may have found gypsum </a>that had been deposited by water.
"This tells a slam-dunk story that water flowed through underground fractures in the rock," <a href="http://astro.cornell.edu/people/facstaff-detail.php?pers_id=112" target="_hplink">Steve Squyres</a>, a planetary scientist at Cornell University and the principal investigator for Opportunity <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20111207.html" target="_hplink">said in a NASA statement</a>.
