We know the date and the location for the royal wedding, but who will be providing the entertainment on Prince William and Kate Middleton's big night? Sir Elton John, if he has any say in the matter. The musician spoke to Steve Wright on Britain's Radio 2 last week and, according to the Daily Mail, John told the host, "I probably am" performing at the royal wedding, before adding, "I'll probably be busking outside."
John famously performed at Princess DIana's funeral in 1997.
John is slated to guest-edit Britain's Independent newspaper on Wednesday for World AIDS Day, but he told Wright his issue might be low on royal engagement content, People reports. John remarked, "I think we've had enough of that for the time being."
What do you think?
Quick Poll
Will Elton John perform at the royal wedding?
YES! He's a shoo-in.
No. Maybe they'll get Gaga to do it.
Unsure.

Pet Care Poll: Most Owners Took Animals To The Vet In Past Year

LOS ANGELES -- Vet visits cost pet owners an average of $505 dollars last year, according to a new AP-Petside.com poll, with those whose pets faced serious illness spending more than $1,000 on average.
Eight in 10 pet owners took their animal companion to a veterinarian in the past 12 months. And cost was an obstacle for a third of those who did not visit the vet.
But most pet owners trust that vets are not suggesting unnecessary treatments, and the bulk of pet owners faced costs below the average. Sixty percent of those who did take a pet to the vet spent $300 or less on their animal's care, the average expenditure was boosted higher by the one in eight (13 percent) who spent $1,000 or more.
About one in six pet owners say their pet faced a serious illness during the year, and those pet owners spent an average of $1,092 on vet care. One percent say they took their pets to the vet and spent no money.
Thomas Klamm, 76, of Boone, Iowa, says he and his wife Beverly spent $3,000 on their two Chihuahuas, sisters Kati and Keli, and he would have spent more if necessary, even though his annual income is under $50,000.
The biggest bills resulted from a spinal condition Kati had, but Klamm says he has a lot of confidence in the vets and senior students at Iowa State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in nearby Ames, where the little dogs have been going since they were pups.
According to the poll, most pet owners have faith in the treatment vets recommend. Overall, 52 percent say vets do not often recommend excessive treatment, 26 percent say that happens moderately often, 17 percent extremely or very often.
Those whose pets had been seriously ill in the past year were no more likely than others to say that vets suggest treatments that go beyond what is reasonable and necessary.
Among those who did not take their pets to the vet last year, 52 percent say they only take their pets to the vet "when they're really sick" and a third say they can't afford it at all.
Luis Calderon, 56, of El Monte, Calif., couldn't afford to take Buddy, his 3-year-old German shepherd, to the vet last year. Buddy was given to Calderon when the dog was 6 months old. "We have become best friends," he says.
Calderon, a self-employed handyman, has a wife and two kids and says work is scarce. If Buddy needed a vet, Calderon says he would have to go through public services or use credit. "We would have to get him help."
How much would be too much? It would depend on what was wrong and what the vet said, Calderon says. "At that point I would have to consider whether to keep him or let him go, put him to sleep," he says.
He hates the idea of putting limits on Buddy's health. "But we have to survive. At this point, my mortgage is No. 1. This month is really close to the edge," Calderon adds.
Fifty-eight percent of those who did not take their pets to a vet in the past year said they "have a type of pet that doesn't need much veterinary care." Among them, 52 percent have dogs, 52 percent cats, 10 percent fish, and 5 percent birds.
Not surprisingly, higher-income pet owners (household incomes over $50,000) were more apt to take their pets to the vet than those with incomes below $50,000 – 90 percent versus 74 percent. Forty percent of those with household incomes below $50,000 who didn't take their pets to the vet say they can't really afford to do so.
Art Jones, 62, of Alameda, Calif., says two of his family's cats died in the last year. He estimates he spent $600 on vet bills – half of that to euthanize one of the cats. The other cat died at home.
"But we are not so wealthy we can spend thousands on a house pet. That's unfortunate, but that's the truth," Jones says.
He says he has family friends whose dog is getting cancer treatment and the cost is nearing $10,000. "To me, that's insane," Jones says.
Over the past few years, Jim Salsman, 51, of Las Vegas, paid for several $500 trips to the vet for his neighbors' cat, Mau, after the declawed feline got in fights with other animals. Last year, the neighbors left and gave the cat to Salsman. He ended up paying another $400 in vet bills, but says he didn't mind because his neighbors were in foreclosure and struggling, and the cat became an important member of the family.
"He means everything to us," Salsman said.
According to the poll, dog owners were a bit more likely to take their pets to the vet than cat owners – 85 percent of dog owners compared with 79 percent of cat owners. But dog owners spent a bit less – an average of $537 – than cat owners, who spent an average of $558.
The AP-Petside.com Poll was conducted Oct. 13-17, 2011, by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Corporate Communications. It involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,118 pet owners. Results among pet owners have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

Environmentalist, artist and author, Michael DeJong, was born in Chicago Heights, IL, in 1962, earning his MFA from the University of Illinois in 1987 before moving to NYC. Once settled, to support himself as a working artist, DeJong ran a housekeeping business for 7 years. In response to his own health challenges caused by multiple daily exposures to toxic commercial household cleaners, he began researching healthier, natural alternatives, using his clients’ homes as his “laboratory,” formulating and testing his eco-friendly, human-friendly and pet-friendly cleaning recipes on his clients and his partner of 20 years, Richard Haymes. Since 2002 they have been living in an historic rowhouse from 1833 in Jersey City, creatively making a 180 year old house into a green living space. After launching a successful career as a commercial photo-stylist, he put aside his hundreds of cleaning recipes and notes, only to return to them in 2005 when he was asked to write a book on environmental cleaning , “Clean: The Humble Art of Zen-Cleansing” (Sterling Publishing, 2007). Upon its release, “Clean” quickly found a large following and was Sterling’s best seller for 2007. DeJong donated thousands of "Clean" books to Al Gore that were included in the “Trainee Tool Kit” for the international attendees of his “Climate Project” trainings. The book was also touted by Teresa Heinz Kerry in her lecture series, “Women, Health & the Environment,” and was auctioned by Bette Midler to raise funds for her “Restoration Project” in NYC. “Clean” has been quoted, reviewed and/or recommended by the Sierra Club, Womens Voices for the Earth, Town & Country Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Martha Stewart’s Blueprint Magazine, This Old House Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, The Denver Post, The Seattle Times, USA Weekend Magazine, Lifetime Television, the CBS Early Show with Harry Smith, and several other media outlets. Since the success of "Clean," DeJong has written 2 more volumes for his "My Kind of Clean" series of “green” cleaning, beauty, and lifestyle books. “Clean Body” and “Clean Cures” were released by Sterling Publishing in spring and fall of 2009 respectively. In keeping with the spirit of the content of the books, Sterling agreed to print and reprint all 3 books in a sustainable fashion using vegetable-dye inks and pre- and post-consumer recycled papers--their first ever sustainable series. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Michael%20DeJong Michael has been the eco-cleaning adviser and weekly contributor to Hearst Publishing’s first online magazine, “The Daily Green," and was the eco-expert “Mr. Green” for the "Ask Mr. Green" column for “Ask Mr. Green” NBC-Universal-Bravo’s environmental website www.GreenIsUniversal.com. He and his partner Richard have founded the OneCleanWorld Foundation in the US. The OneCleanWorld Foundation supports, raises awareness of, and encourages eco- and sustainability projects in the US and abroad through grants, technical assistance and/or micro-financing in the areas of education and outreach, advocacy and public health, and building or enhancing green economies and infrastructures. The foundation accepts donations of any amount, and is also funded with the royalties from DeJong's "My Kind of Clean" series of books. To make a donation, please visit http://www.stonewallfoundation.org/contribute_form.php?Section=ContributionForm&lid=10 and type "OCW Foundation" in the box that asks "My gift is made in honor/memory of..."
DeJong's website, www.MyKindofClean.com contains archives of his blogs, cleaning tips from the books, videos, and other eco-information. The OneCleanWorld Foundation is also developing an open-source, interactive, social-networking, eco-wiki, “We-Think” style, web portal for environmentalists, eco-activists, sustainability entrepreneurs and bloggers interested in improving the planet one-household-at-a-time. The website will be one source for selecting grantees. The first OneCleanWorld Foundation grant was awarded in June 2010 to Greensburg/Greentown, Inc., the not-for-profit spearheading the green LEED Platinum rebuilding of Greensburg, a small Kansas town destroyed by the strongest tornado to ever touch ground.

The Human Stain on "Sustainism"
Posted January 11, 2011	| 12:25:40 (EST)
Left to itself -- over time -- nature has had the wherewithal to have created its very own self-sustaining, nurturing, biosphere. And you don't have to be Thoreau to readily recognize a self-contained ecosystem that supports the living organisms that exist within it. The eat-or-be-eaten "food chain" was the original...

In any theater or movie production, costume design goes hand-in-hand with good direction and help actors "get into their roles." In dramas, tragedies, comedies or musicals, the costumes communicate subliminally who the actors are supposed to be.
