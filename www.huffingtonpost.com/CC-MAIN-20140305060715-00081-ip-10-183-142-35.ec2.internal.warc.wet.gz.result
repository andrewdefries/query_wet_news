CHICAGO — In her police mug shot, the doe-eyed cartoon heroine with the bowl haircut has a black eye, battered lip and bloody nose.
Dora the Explorer's alleged crime? "Illegal Border Crossing Resisting Arrest."
The doctored picture, one of several circulating widely in the aftermath of Arizona's controversial new immigration law, may seem harmless, ridiculous or even tasteless.
But experts say the pictures and the rhetoric surrounding them online, in newspapers and at public rallies, reveal some Americans' attitudes about race, immigrants and where some of immigration reform debate may be headed.
"Dora is kind of like a blank screen onto which people can project their thoughts and feelings about Latinos," said Erynn Masi de Casanova, a sociology professor at the University of Cincinnati. "They feel like they can say negative things because she's only a cartoon character."
The depictions, whether through irony or protest, are being used by those who oppose and support Arizona's law. On one hand she's a likable symbol who many can relate to, and at the same time, perceived as an outsider who doesn't belong anywhere.
It's not the first time a children's character has been dragged into a serious debate.
In the late 1990s, Tinky Winky the Teletubby, a purple children's TV character with a triangle antenna – was called out by Christian leaders for being gay. Sesame Street roommates Bert and Ernie are often involved in statements on same-sex marriage.
Both shows' producers say the characters aren't gay.
In Dora's case, especially because her image is so widely available, she's an easy target as discussion ramps up on how lawmakers should address the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.
For about a decade, the pint-sized Latina character has taught millions of children the English alphabet, colors and Spanish phrases on a Nickelodeon TV show and through a global empire. Her smiling cherub face is plastered on everything from backpacks to T-shirts to fruit snacks.
But since the passage of the Arizona law – which requires authorities to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally – Dora's life and immigration status have been scrutinized and mocked.
Several websites, including The Huffington Post, have narrated Dora's mock capture by immigration authorities. One picture circulating on Facebook shows an ad for a TV show called "Dora the Illegal Immigrant." On the Facebook page "Dora the Explorer is soo an Illegal Immigrant," there are several images showing her sailing through the air over the U.S.-Mexican border.
Many of the Dora images assume the Latina character is an illegal immigrant from Mexico.
But that's where it gets complicated.
Representatives from Nickelodeon declined to comment on Dora's background, and her place of birth or citizenship have never been clear." She has brown skin, dark hair and some experts who have studied the show say she speaks Spanish with an American accent.
"She's always been ambiguously constructed," said Angharad Valdivia, who teaches media studies at the University of Illinois and has explored the issue. "In the U.S. the way we understand race is about putting people in categories and we're uncomfortable with people we can't put into categories."
Dora lives in an unidentified location with pyramids that suggest Mexico, but also tropical elements such as palm trees and her friends, Isa the iguana and Boots the monkey. Does that mean she's from South America or Florida?
Then there's oak trees and her fox nemesis Swiper, which are more common to the American Midwest.
The show often plays Salsa-like music, which has some roots in Cuba and is popular across Latin America.
Even the voice actresses behind Dora don't provide insight.
The original Dora voice belonged to Kathleen Herles, whose parents are from Peru. Dora is currently voiced by actress Caitlin Sanchez, a New Jersey-born teen who calls herself Cuban American; her grandparents are Cuban.
The images have been used on all sides of the immigration reform debate.
Many immigrant families, particularly Latinos, see Dora as a symbol of freedom, someone to relate to. She's a young girl with brown skin who lives in a borderless world and can travel anywhere she wants without consequence.
"It's symbolic of the way many Latinos live ambiguously in the United States," said Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez who teaches gender studies at the University of Arizona. "It's a shorthand for claiming our lives in the United States, especially for children."
At the same time, Guidotti-Hernandez says the ambiguity and negative imagery makes Dora susceptible to being used by those who support the Arizona law.
As for the mug shot, it's been around since late last year, when Debbie Groben of Sarasota, Fla. created it and entered it in a contest for the fake news site FreakingNews.com.
Since debate over the Arizona law heated up the nation's immigration debate, it's been e-mailed and texted widely and used on signs at rallies.
"My intentions were to do something funny, something and irreverent," said Groben, who said she opposes Arizona's law. "I actually like the little kid."
The issue appears to have resonated little with Dora's biggest fans, the millions of parents and their children who seem mostly unaware of the discussion encircling their beloved cartoon.
Altamise Leach, who has three children, said Dora's ethnicity and citizenship are irrelevant.
The stay-at-home mom credits the cartoon with helping teach her children team work. She even threw her 3-year-old daughter a Dora birthday party, complete with a Dora-like adventure, Dora cake and a woman who dressed up as Dora.
"We have so many diverse cultures, let's try to embrace everybody," Leach said. "She puts a smile on my daughter's face, that's all I want."
Erick Wyatt said he never thought about Dora's origins and his three children never asked.
"I just thought she was a cartoon character that spoke Spanish," the Flint, Mich., man said.

This customer simply wouldn't take "no" for an answer.
After a man was denied a refund from a T-Mobile store in Manchester, England, he took his anger out on the shop by pulling down displays and spraying the fire extinguisher. "The customer’s dispute was in relation to a refund that we were not able to give -- as it was clearly outside of the stated terms and conditions," a representative for T-Mobile told the Mirror. A witness captured video of the incident through the store's window and posted it to YouTube on July 1.
In the video, a store employee can be seen standing against the glass as the customer continues to pace through the store, dismantling everything in his path. Police eventually arrested the man and no one was injured in the incident. Gizmodo's Jesus Diaz notes mobile carriers can often be difficult to deal with, and that he's surprised more customers haven't acted this way in the past. Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, there have been a number of anger mis-management cases at phone companies. Earlier this year, an Ohio man fired shots at a Sprint store after workers told him he could not return his phone, ABC's News Channel 5 reported. Jeremy South, 25, allegedly threw a phone at an employee and threatened to fight others before and shooting at the shop as he drove away. However, at one Metro PCS store near Detroit, it was a store employee who lost his cool with a customer. The shop's owner, Nashwan Samona, allegedly pulled a gun on a guest after the customer asked for help removing his phone's battery, according to the Detroit Free Press. According to the paper, the pair had started arguing after the customer told Samona he was being rude. Police said the store's owner did have a permit to legally carry the concealed weapon. What do you think about the man's reaction? Leave your thoughts in the comments section below. [h/t Mashable]
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the owner of the Metro PCS store did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

Dick Cheney certainly isn't spending the first year of his retirement from the vice presidency growing a beard. Instead, he's playing a very clever game, exemplified by his latest "exclusive" screed released in written form to the apparently compliant folks at Politico.com.
In it, as is well known by now, he uses the case of the failed Detroit underpants bomb attempt to accuse President Obama of "pretending that the United States is not at war," thereby making us less safe. He can engage in this kind of rhetoric safe in two comforting assumptions: that the Republican base, and a certain percentage of independents, will eat this stuff up, and that the Democrats, in and out of power, will continue to not know how to respond.
The latter is because they, willingly or not, allowed themselves to be co-opted into the "war on terror" model in the first place, out of fear of being depicted as "soft" if they so much as emitted a peep of opposition. What should they be saying?
How's this: Dick Cheney, and George W. Bush, made the country less safe for eight years by pretending that this country was at war, thereby wasting vast amounts of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, while failing to achieve the basic aims of the enterprise. The problem with pretending we're at war, rather than understanding we're dealing with a criminal syndicate -- like the Mafia -- is that it gets our resources overextended and tied down in geographical areas, like Afghanistan, while the opponent is free to move and relocate (hello, Yemen!, hi, Somalia!). In fact, the war model weakens us, makes us less able to respond nimbly and quietly -- check the recent stories on the logistical challenges facing the Afghanistan surge here, here, here and here. In short, we lumber, they scamper.
But Obama can't say any of this, having just signed on to the AfPak surge. Nor can he bring himself to John Wayne it up, GWB-style. Therefore, he's always open to Cheney's attacks, and his response is always a stoic silence. What, then, would discourage Cheney from keeping it up, straight through next November?

It is not widely known that the European quest to appropriate the highly prized library of Sanskrit's ancient spiritual texts motivated the construction of the "Aryan" race identity, one of the ideological roots of Nazism. The Sanskrit word "arya" is an adjective that means noble or pure. For example, the famous Buddhist Four Noble Truths are described as the Four Arya Truths or catvāri āryasatyāni in Sanskrit. Arya does not refer to a race, but a cultural quality venerated in Sanskrit texts. German nationalism turned this word into a noun, "Aryan," and capitalized it to refer to an imagined race of people that were the original Sanskrit speakers who had composed its great texts. Early romantic claims that Indians were the ancestors of the Europeans were gradually replaced by the new myth that a race called "Indo-Aryans" was the common ancestors to both. Their origin was thought to be in the Caucasus Mountains, hence the term "Caucasian." Later, the "Indo" was dropped and the white Aryan Race Theory emerged. Thus, from the European desire to be seen as the inheritors of the Sanskrit civilization, the notion of a European super-race was born, with Germany as its highest manifestation.
How did this come about? In the late 1700s, European identity was shaken when scholars discovered that Sanskrit was closely related to the European languages, though much older and more sophisticated. At first, this discovery fed European Romantic imagination, in which India was glorified as the perfect past. Herder, a German Romanticist, saw Europe's "discovery" of India as a "re-discovery" of its own foundation. India was viewed as Europe's mother civilization by Frederick Schlegel in Germany and by Voltaire in France. William Jones, a British colonial administrator, considered Sanskrit the most marvelous product of the human mind. Sanskrit and Indology entered most major European universities between 1800 and 1850, challenging if not replacing Latin and Greek texts as a source for "new" ideas. Many new disciplines were shaped by the ensuing intellectual activity, including linguistics, comparative religion, modern philosophy and sociology. With European nations competing among themselves for civilizational legacy, many rival theories emerged regarding the origins of the original Sanskrit speakers and their civilization. German nationalists found in the affinity between Sanskrit and German the possibility of a newly respectable pedigree vis-à-vis the French, and claimed the heritage of the treasure trove of Sanskrit literature to bolster their cause. The British interpreted India and Sanskrit in a manner that would strengthen their own role as empire-builders, with India as the jewel in the crown. Because Indians were not participants in European forums, there was widespread plagiarism of Indian texts, as well as much distorted interpretation.
By "becoming" the Aryans, Europeans felt that they were the rightful custodians of the massive corpus of Sanskrit texts that were generating new breakthroughs in the humanities and liberal arts. Germans took their newly adopted Aryan identity to extremes, and most of the influential European thinkers of the time colluded. Their racist theories often had an anti-Semitic dimension, seeking to reconstruct the Bible in Aryan terms. Ernest Renan, a philologist and Hebrew scholar, drew sharp distinctions between Semitic and Aryan languages and peoples. He proposed that though Aryans began as polytheists they were later transformed into Christian monotheists, and that Semitic peoples comprised an entirely different (and inferior) civilization. Adolphe Pictet, a Swiss linguist and ethnographer, was fully committed to the notion of European Aryans who were destined to conquer the world being blessed with "innate beauty" and "gifts of intelligence." He separated Jesus from Judaism, and turned him into the Aryan Christ.
The nascent discipline called "race science" was reinforced by such ideas. Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau, a French diplomat, philosopher and historian argued in his hugely influential Essay on the Inequality of Human Races that Adam from the Bible was the "originator of our white species." He wrote of the "superiority of the white type and within that type of the Aryan family." His thesis on India claimed that white Aryans had invaded India and subsequently began to intermarry with the local population. Realizing the danger of intermarriage, the Aryan lawgivers invented the caste system as a means of self-preservation. India was held up as an example of how interbreeding with an inferior race could bring about the decline of a superior one. Hitler's idea of "purifying" the Aryans was born out of this, and it culminated in the Holocaust.
Houston Chamberlain was a British historian whose magnum opus, Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (written in German), also projected Aryan-Germans as the most evolved among Aryan races. He introduced Christian, scientific and philosophical arguments to lend credibility and explained the benefits that Christianity would derive by supporting German racism. Anthropologist Kenneth Kennedy concludes of Gobineau and Chamberlain, that they "transformed the Aryan concept, which had its humble origins in philological research conducted by Jones in Calcutta at the end of the eighteenth century, into the politics and racial doctrines of Adolph Hitler's Third Reich."
In 2007, I played a role in a historic milestone when I was invited to address the first Hindu-Jewish Summit. I spoke on the Aryan myth and the suffering that it had inflicted on both religious communities. Contrary to earlier apprehensions of some Hindus that this was a "risky" topic to bring up, the head of the Jewish delegation, Rabbi Rosen, member of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel's Commission for Inter-religious Dialogue, was very impressed. The Jewish delegation decided to appoint a team of scholars to study the issue and the references I had supplied. As a result, at the following year's Summit, a joint declaration was signed, which included the following language from my draft:
"Since there is no conclusive evidence to support the theory of an Aryan invasion/migration into India, and on the contrary, there is compelling evidence to refute it; and since the theory seriously damages the integrity of the Hindu tradition and its connection to India; we call for a serious reconsideration of this theory, and a revision of all educational material on this issue that includes the most recent and reliable scholarship."
Today, the Western mainstream has made special efforts to remove the notion of an Aryan race from the vocabulary and the public psyche. However, as my recently released book, Breaking India, explains, the damage in India has worsened. The Dravidian Race Theory was formulated by British missionaries in the 1800s in parallel with the Aryan theory, and it divides the peoples of India into racial categories of "Aryans" and "Dravidians." Western scholars and institutions continue to support Dravidian racism, which is dependent upon acceptance of the Aryan race construct. In a future blog I will explain how Christian missionaries are now exploiting these dangerous constructs. This Blogger's Books from

San Francisco, a city that honors free speech, would be the place to safely air strong feelings about what the torch and the games mean. Or so the thinking went.	Katherine Marshall: Revolutionary Religion: A Conversation with Swami Agnivesh
Indian social activist Swami Agnivesh renounced worldly possessions and launched a political movement forty years ago, based on the principle of "social spirituality".	Max Blumenthal: The Great Islamophobic Crusade
Erupting so many years after 9/11, this spasm of anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly timed and unexpectedly spontaneous. But little of recent American Islamophobia is sheer happenstance.
Suhag A. Shukla, Esq.: Caste, Hinduism and Human Rights
Contrary to the wide academic conflation of caste and Hinduism, the practice of caste-based discrimination is in contradiction to the Hindu teaching that each individual is equally divine and has the potential to realize God based on his effort. David A. Love: Fox News Must Fire Glenn Beck for Mocking a Holocaust Survivor
All of us should be concerned about Glenn Beck's verbal assault on George Soros and his mocking of the Holocaust. Yet, this is more than a Jewish issue.	Robert Koehler: The Nazi Virus
Even as we were prosecuting Nazis at Nuremberg for their barbaric behavior, including their notorious medical experiments on death camp inmates, we were, it turns out, conducting our own medical experiments on a vulnerable and unsuspecting population.	Perry Garfinkel: A Hind-Jew in India
I arrived in Hinduism's holiest city on Judaism's holiest day. But how was I to spend Yom Kippur, a solemn day of atonement and fasting at the 5-star Nadesar Palace?	Mark Olmsted: The Evolution of Fascism -- Then and Now
I understand that our President prefers consensus to confrontation, but his fear of being cast as the "angry black man" is leaving a vacuum. Olbermann does a mean Edward R. Murrow, but his ratings don't compete with Limbaugh or Beck.	Around the Web:

In our generation, "trending" is a persistent verb. There is always something, anything, catching on and making us waste more time than we ever thought possible. Right now, of course, Internet memes are trending. Memes are units of cultural ideas that are propagated: a blog, a hashtag, an animated picture accompanied by text; as exemplified in the popular #whatshouldwwecallme tumblr. Popular especially among college students; Internet memes latch onto common experiences and shape popular ideas of what we consider funny and relevant. Of course, memes aren't essential truths and usually end up being used for marketing schemes or fizzling out altogether into the inevitable "that-was-so-last-month" cosmos. But, like most other college students, I follow meme blogs and laugh and share them with other people. They're clever! They're relevant! And they make me feel like I am experiencing something communal. How fantastic; a giant inside joke between me and everyone else on the Internet!
Comparing memes to poetry is enough to make any poetry teacher cringe -- a few of mine probably will, after reading this. Poetry is inherently deep and memes are inherently shallow! Right? But I think the reason we gravitate toward poetry and gravitate toward Internet memes is analogous.
Like poetry, memes have the power to make us feel like we are engaging in a collective cultural experience. The comparison abruptly stops there -- memes aren't beautiful and don't require much discipline or insight. But -- but! -- Internet memes do capitalize on our desire for common experiences.
Like poetry, memes are expanded metaphors of daily life. They are not quite as self-serving as other Internet mediums like Facebook, because the idea of a meme is to reinforce a thought about life, rather than reinforce our own image. Of course, yes. I am afraid that my generation is in danger -- that I am in danger -- of losing out on the ability to communicate, to look at people in the eye with unbroken attention. I am afraid that I will never fully be present because there is constantly a screen barrier; a way to present to the world the inaccurate premise that I have better people to see, places to go, things to do. But the popularity of memes gives me an odd kind of trust that things will turn out okay. Despite the doomsday predictions, preaching that my generation is totally isolated from connection, we are all still drawn to making and sharing meaning. Every generation has had ways of "wasting" time and being shallow; that my generation does find ways to waste time is not a new phenomenon.
And as afraid as I am that we are in danger of losing out on the ability to genuinely communicate; I also think it is important to recognize when technology does give us positive and imaginative ways of communicating. Technology allows us to talk to people across the ocean; to further social change. It helped bring about the Occupy Movement and the Arab Spring. It can make us laugh. And like it or not, it's here to stay. Without acknowledging the Internet as having the potential to make us less fractioned people; we actually are a lost cause; lacking gratitude for the good it brings but not knowing how to create boundaries. Nothing has meaning if we do not look for it. Maybe the Internet doesn't allow us to fully arrive at points of authentic connection. Maybe the Internet keeps relationships at bay, drifting just out of reach. But also, perhaps we can get closer and perhaps things like memes are portals for moving us in more genuine directions of understanding one another. When we see a meme with a caption that begins with "that moment when" we're seizing onto something that can be shared. And that's one basic understanding of poetry: that it provides bridges between ordinary moments which makes us feel more or less human. Yes, those moments might be a picture of a girl tripping in a bar or someone trying to parallel park a car or "that moment when I'm flirting with a guy and his girlfriend walks over." We think memes are funny because those moments have happened to all of us. They've certainly happened to me. Memes are ways of realizing "Oh, someone else has felt this." And I think that's something good; something to celebrate. We are not as far from understanding each other as we think we are. We are not as alone as we think we are.
