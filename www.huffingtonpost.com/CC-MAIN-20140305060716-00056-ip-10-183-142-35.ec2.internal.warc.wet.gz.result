Coin Toss Decides Election In DeWitt County, Illinois; Winner Disapproves Of Gambling (VIDEO)

Weird News
Democracy is supposed to be of the people, by the people and for the people. When that doesn't work, it's time for an old standard -- like a coin toss.
That was the method used to settle an election for a board seat in DeWitt County, Ill., after the vote counts showed a complete tie between candidates George Wissmiller and Terry Ferguson: 827 votes apiece, according to the Associated Press.
Ironically, Wissmiller doesn't approve of gambling and has made some concessions in order to make the chancy win palatable to him.
But hey, he won (and he chose heads).
“I don’t gamble. This process here today is very clearly gambling," Wissmiller told Pantragraph.com. "If I refuse to accept pay for this office, it ceases to be gambling. The office itself is a responsibility and not a thing of value.”
Ferguson, the incumbent, said he will consider seeking a recount.
The state of Illinois doesn't have rules set in place for election ties -- just a rule requiring a declared winner within 21 days of the election, so DeWitt County clerk Dana Smith got creative.
"Well, we just needed something to break a tie. We have to have a winner," she said, according to CentralIllinoisProud.com
At first, she suggested rolling some dice, but Wissmiller objected to that method of decision making.
Elections decided by coin tosses are unusual, but not uncommon. Back in May, a city council election in Woolfforth, Tex., was decided by coin toss after both candidates each received 118 votes. They chose to accept the coin toss result because a run-off election would have cost the city $10,000.

Romney And Obama Punching PuppetsThis election season has been pretty brutal and what better way to fight out your red state-blue state issues than with <a href="http://www.punchingpoliticians.com/bozocart/pc/home.asp">punching puppets of Obama and Romney</a>? You and friend can do what you know the two candidates are dying to do: Settle it like men.Presidential BallsMitt Romney and Barack Obama have made some ballsy statements this campaign and regardless of who bounces into the White House, <a href="http://www.makeaball.com/electaball">these customized balls</a> are a way to say "game on."Presidential PillowsPresidents don't sleep very well, but the <a href="http://www.thebenjamin.com/">Benjamin Hotel</a> in New York is trying to help the candidates with two pillows that are designed to fit their different sleep styles. The Pillo1T (left), for President Barack Obama, has precisely engineered contours, shoulder cut-outs and angulated side panels for reducing stress on the head, neck and shoulders. The Boomerang Pillow, for Mitt Romney, is perfectly constructed for maximum support in any sleep position.Presidential Hot SauceAs things get heated during the final weeks of the campaign, so should the hot sauce, right? These <a href="http://www.davesgourmet.com/campaign2012/">presidential-themed hot sauces</a> allow the user to, in the case of the Obama sauce, adjust his presidential origin, or with the Romney version, his political opinions.Obama Action FigureIf your daughter's Barbie wants to host a fundraising dinner for Obama, this <a href="http://www.jailbreaktoys.com/The_Obama_Action_Figure_p/ob000.htm">action figure</a> will allow him to accept the cash personally from Ken, Teddy Bear and Raggedy Ann (although, rumor has it, Raggedy Andy is more of a tea party type).Political Party PantsIt's election day and what are you going to wear to the voting booth?<a href="http://www.bonobos.com/party-animals-political-theme-pants-democrat-donkey">These chinos</a> featuring the Republican elephant or Democratic donkey can tell people what side you're on without you saying a word.Presidential Poop PollJim Coniglione, owner of Scoopy Doo, a dog poop collection service in Long Island, N.Y., predicts Mitt Romney will win the presidential election because more dog poop is shaped like his head than President Barack Obama's.Presidential StewThe losing party of the election has four years to stew. That's a perfect time to enjoy <a href="http://canofcommentary.com/about">vegetable stew (with beef flavoring) that features Obama or Romney-themed package. </a>It's important to note that the stew is the same regardless of which party you support, much like the problems in the U.S. will stay the same no matter who's in charge.Political PoopersThese plastic wind-up toys of grinning Republican Candidate Mitt Romney and Presidential Incumbent Barack Obama come with red, white and blue candy treats. Pop open a secret hatch on the back of their head, fill with candy, wind them up and watch them leave a trail of candy poop wherever they waddle.Mitt Romney, Barack Obama CondomsA New York-based customized condom company has created a line of presidential campaign condoms based on Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. So far, the Obama condom is selling 6 to 7 percent better than the Romney rubber.Mitt Romney Oven MittMitt Romney managed to handle himself in some heated presidential debates without getting burned too badly. Hopefully, that will be the case iwith the <a href="http://ovenmittromney.com/index.html" target="_hplink">Oven Mitt Romney,</a> which for $12.99 will helps customers deal with hot potatoes (not the political variety).Barack Obama BeltAnyone can show their support to a candidate by wearing a T-shirt, but this <a href="http://www.overstock.com/Clothing-Shoes/Iced-Out-Gear-Mens-President-Barack-Obama-Belt/3705718/product.html" target="_hplink">Barack Obama belt </a>will show that even if Americans have to tighten their belts, they can still look stylish doing it. It has a buckle that's as big as the ones given to rodeo champions, wrestling stars or bodybuilders. Mitt Romney Whoopie CushionMitt Romney's detractors would like to give him a big raspberry, but it may be more effective if the Bronx cheer comes from Mitt himself, in the form of this <a href="http://go-out-laughing.com/gasbags.html" target="_hplink">whoopie cushion</a> with his face on it. Political BattlebotsIn this <a href="http://www.herobuilders.com/political/politicalactionfigures2012.htm" target="_hplink">political version</a> of the old "of the old "Rock'em Sock'em Robots" game featuring the heads of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, players mechanically manipulate the robotic candidates by pressing buttons that make them punch each other.Hold Your Nose And Vote Clothespin For many Americans, doing their patriotic duty to vote is compromised by the fact they think all the candidates stink. The Hold Your Nose And Vote Clothes Pin is supposed to provide some relief for what many people consider to be a malodorous prospect.Political Party Branding IronsThe reality is, we live in a country divided into red states and blue states. When it comes to grilling, though, most people would rather have a red steak than a blue steak. <a href="http://www.greatgiftsformen.com/Political-Party-Steak-Branding-Irons-p-648.html" target="_hplink">These political branding irons</a> allow politicos to force their partisan politics on to steaks, chicken and fish.
Presidential Themed CocktailsThe election is driving a lot of people to drink, especially at the Topaz Bar in Washington, D.C., where mixologist Rico Wisner has created cocktails inspired by Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Obama's Home Sweet Home is a homage to the District's official cocktail, the Rickey, with bourbon, lime juice, club soda and a hint of pineapple juice.
The Romney Float is a non-alcoholic beverage featuring root beer, whipped cream and caramel drizzle. And for those who can't resist the hard stuff, a shot of Root Organic Liquor can be added.
The bar will keep a running tally of who's in the lead until the general election in November 2012.
Democratease UndiesRepublicans refer to Democrats as "asses" all the time, but probably not in the way meant by <a href="http://www.onefinepieceofass.com/new-stuff/" target="_hplink">Democratease. </a>The online retailer sells undies and shirts connecting the donkey, the party's animal mascot, and asses (get it?) The company hasn't come out with a line of "trunks" related to the GOP despite the just-as-obvious connection to the party's elephant symbol.Presidential Candidate Flip FlopsPoliticians are known for flip-flopping and walking all over their constituents. These campaign-themed flip flops reverse that trend.
They won't be available until after Labor Day, but <a href="http://www.flipflopshops.com/" target="_hplink">the company that makes them</a> will tally which pair gets the most sales.Political Party TrufflesDuring an election year, Democrats and Republican chew each other out. <a href="http://www.moonstruckchocolate.com/c-24-election.aspx" target="_hplink">But these campaign-themed truffles</a> make it literal by being shaped like donkeys and elephants. Partisans looking for red meat won't find it here, just chocolate.Barack Obama Throw BlanketThe economy has slowly warmed up under Barack Obama, but this <a href="http://www.keepsakes-etc.com/obama-merchandise.html">blanket that uses his presidential seal </a>might warm up your body a little quicker.

It's a good time to be gay, unless you really love eating at Chick-fil-A, in which case it sucks to be gay, because, thanks to how they've chosen to spend their money, if you bite into one of their delicious sandwiches, you are supporting people who don't support you. As much as I love a good chicken nugget, I wouldn't dare go against my people. Ever heard of the gay mafia? Oh, it's real! Sure, gay people still don't have the right to get married in most of the country, our rights are constantly being voted on, and discrimination is as rampant as ever, but we are making strides! For one, we are more visible than ever. More and more people are coming out of the closet, living openly gay lives and in turn showing friends, family and neighbors that who they are is really not that different from everybody else. Even Anderson Cooper started openly waving his rainbow flag! Well, not literally waving it, but you know what I mean! The point is, he's gay, and the world now officially knows it! Does it make a difference? Shoot yeah it does! Not only does it encourage other gay people to be proud of who they are, but it also helps my mom get past her unrealistic expectation that she and Anderson would one day end up together. Sorry, Mom.
In general, the entertainment world has been much gay-friendlier than before. With Will & Grace having paved the way, we now have two new network sitcoms that focus on gay couples: The New Normal and Partners. Glee, Grey's Anatomy, and a number of other shows have all featured prominent gay characters. Chaz Bono, who recently transitioned, danced with a woman on Dancing with the Stars. Ellen DeGeneres remains the most popular daytime talk show host in the world. And Adam Lambert is, well, as gay as ever, and even if you don't like how much makeup he wears, it's hard to deny that he sure can sing! This past year has also brought some rather big historical moments for the gay community. We had the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." In case you didn't know, that's huge! President Obama became the first U.S. president to announce his support of same-sex marriage. And one of the biggest rappers in the world, Jay-Z, said he's got 99 problems and the gays ain't one! Well, that wasn't his official statement. I'm merely paraphrasing. These may not sound like big changes to some, but considering the uphill battle we've been fighting, any progress is surely welcomed. As a stand-up comedian, I certainly appreciate the more tolerant attitudes. When I first started comedy eight years ago, nothing was scarier than going into comedy clubs across the country not knowing if people were going to jump me after my show because I'd told a joke about having feelings for my best friend in college. Now I walk in the clubs, sweater vest and all, and don't think twice about how my sexuality will be perceived. Part of that has to do with people being more open-minded, but it certainly doesn't hurt that my boss, Chelsea Handler, is one of the biggest gay advocates there is, and if she deems it OK, then most of her fans follow suit. Although I couldn't be more thrilled with these changes, there is still a lot that needs to be accomplished, of course. People need to keep feeling safe enough to come out of the closet. Laws need to continue to be changed. Minds need to continue to be opened. Rights need to increase. Homophobia needs to decrease. And no one should feel complacent with the way things are. Our work isn't finished until being gay is considered as natural as the color of people's skin. Well, unless your skin looks like Snooki's! That's not exactly natural. As for myself, I'm going to stick to what I know best: comedy. I may not be saving lives or changing the world, but if I can get one person to think differently about gay people because I made them laugh, then I will have succeeded. I'll also hopefully have one more follower on Twitter, because in the end, that's what really matters!
