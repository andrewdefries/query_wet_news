Museums are home to so many impressive and famous works of art around the globe, it's hard to remember sometimes that the buildings themselves are quite stunning.
While the Guggenheim in Bilbao caused quite a stir, the world is home to so many other museums who have a quieter beauty.
Though some of these museums aren't free of charge (except for on Free Museum Day!), it costs nothing to sit and stare at their beautiful facades.

Howard Fineman's Political Read
Paul Ryan's 'Brown Bag' Anecdote Seems To Have Been Purloined	Jason Linkins	| March 6, 2014 6:05 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
paul ryan poverty, Eat The Press, cpac, an-invisible-thread, Conservative Political Action Conference, free school lunches, School Lunches, Laura Schroff, paul ryan, conservative political action conference 2014, cpac 2014	[Laura Schroff, the author of "An Invisible Thread" -- the book from which Paul Ryan's anecdote described below was extracted -- contacted The Huffington Post earlier tonight. This piece has been updated with her remarks, below.]
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has recently undertaken a great rebranding of his public image, adopting a new persona as "The Serious Wonk Who's Now Way, Way Into Empathizing With The Poors." It hasn't all gone according to plan. In recent days, Ryan has attempted to demonstrate a new facility with scholarly materials on poverty programs and to pad out his budget with a sheen of concern. The results were rather misbegotten: as Jonathan Chait noted earlier this week, many of the social scientists cited by Ryan have been giving Ryan the ol' "you know nothing of my work" routine from "Annie Hall."
Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Ryan reached for another story, claiming it as insight into poverty. He may have bungled this attempt, too.
As Talking Points Memo's Catherine Thompson reported, Ryan railed against programs that are designed to ensure that poor schoolchildren receive a free lunch at school, characterizing the people who support such programs as offering these children "a full stomach and an empty soul." Ryan then launched into what he called an anecdote "relayed to him by Eloise Anderson," who serves as the Department of Children and Families secretary in the administration of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker:
"She once met a young boy from a very poor family, and every day at school, he would get a free lunch from a government program," Ryan said.
"He told Eloise he didn’t want a free lunch. He wanted his own lunch, one in a brown-paper bag just like the other kids," he continued. "He wanted one, he said, because he knew a kid with a brown-paper bag had someone who cared for him. This is what the left does not understand."
But as an eagle-eyed TPM commenter noted, it was extremely unlikely that this child told Eloise Anderson anything of the kind. That's because this anecdote is actually from a book titled "An Invisible Thread," by Laura Schroff:
The paper-bag lunch story is from a 2011 book about a hungry, panhandling kid in New York City.
And the kid in the book wasn't turning down gov't subsidized lunches at school, he was reacting to a private benefactor's offer to pay for his cafeteria lunches at school. "Look, Maurice, I don't want you out there hungry on the nights I don't see you, so this is what we can do. I can either give you some money for the week--and you'll have to be really careful about how you spend it--or when you come over on Monday night we can go to the supermarket and I can buy all the things you like to eat and make you lunch for the week. I'll leave it with the doormen, and you can pick it up on the way to school."
Maurice looked at me and asked me a question.
"If you make me lunch," he said, "will you put it in a brown paper bag?"
I didn't really understand the question. "Do you want it in a brown paper bag?" I asked. "Or how would you prefer it?"
"Miss Laura," he said, "I don't want your money. I want my lunch in a brown paper bag."
"Okay, sure. But why do you want it in a bag?"
"Because when I see kids come to school with their lunch in a paper bag, that means someone cares about them. Miss Laura, can I please have my lunch in a paper bag?"
Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler told Chait that it seems as if Anderson essentially fibbed to Ryan about the source of this story. Kessler cites the transcript of a July 31, 2013 congressional hearing, in which Anderson recounted the "anecdote" in front of Ryan:
My thought has always been around the SNAP program even when it was called "food stamps" is, why do you have this program, school program, school breakfast, school lunch, school dinner, when do we start asking parents to be responsible for their children?
You know, a little boy told me once that what was important to him is that he didn't want school lunch, he wanted a brown bag because the brown bag that he brought with his lunch in it meant that his mom cared about him. Just think what we have done. If this kid tells me a brown bag was more important than a free lunch, we've missed the whole notion of parents being there for their children because we've taken over that responsibility, and I think we need to be very careful about how we provide programs to families that don't undermine families' responsibilities.
Again, it would seem that either Eloise Anderson and Laura Schroff have led eerily parallel lives, or that Anderson simply appropriated Schroff's story as her own. Chait writes, "It's also interesting that Anderson's conclusion from the...story is that the school lunch program makes parents into lazy slackers, while Ryan's conclusion is that it robs children of their soul." Of course, there's one party whose conclusions haven't been fully explicated within the context of Ryan's appropriation yet -- Laura Schroff. Schroff was, at the time of publication, temporarily unavailable for comment. We will update this piece when we are able to connect.
Suffice it to say that Paul Ryan might be better at understanding the plights of poor people if he actually went out and attempted to meet some, instead of roughly trading second-hand accounts.
UPDATE, 9:30pm: Earlier this evening, I spoke to Laura Schroff, the author of "An Invisible Thread," about Ryan's remarks at CPAC and the provenance of the anecdote that Anderson has apparently been sharing as her own. If there's one ambition Schroff doesn't have, it's getting her work caught up in the Beltway hurlyburly. "The one thing I'll say about 'An Invisible Thread' is that it's not a political book in any way." Schroff says her intention is to cross across boundaries like race and class. "When I go to public schools to talk about the book, it helps the kids have hope. When I talk to kids at private school, they feel grateful."
In responding to today's news, she was exceedingly charitable to those involved.
"It's hard for me to know how to respond to this, because I've never heard Eloise Anderson talk about this story. In some ways, her account is very similar, but really, it's drastically different."
Schroff says that it was absolutely correct to view the brown paper bag as a totem of love, a sign that a child like Maurice -- the young, homeless panhandler she befriended -- had someone in his life that cared for him. "I say this to all the schools that I've visited that Maurice has told me the meaning of of the brown paper bag -- the bag is merely paper, but it is really about love…its a reminder that someone loves you. This is the one story that always comes up whenever we have talked about it."
"But Maurice describes being hungry as being punched in the stomach," she countered, "And given the choice between a free lunch and not eating at all, he would choose the free lunch."
Schroff very politely rejected Ryan's "full stomachs, empty souls," construction, explaining that her life's work is about showing other people, especially children, that kindness makes a huge difference in the lives of both the giver and the recipient. "When you give a small act of kindness, expecting nothing in return, the rewards are great."
"I want people to think about what they can do to make the world a kinder world," she said. "I don't care about Republicans and Democrats. But we are talking about children that need to be fed. Cutting school lunch programs doesn't accomplish that."
She continued: "When you are in the position to help someone out, why wouldn't you? As citizens of the United States of America, it's our responsibility to help our neighbors. You don't have to save the world, but there are many ways to reach out and help people in need."
If there is a silver lining to getting knit up in a CPAC presentation, Schroff says that its the opportunity to maybe share her work with others. To that end, I'll point out that a portion of the proceeds garnered from sales of her book go to Share Our Strength's "No Kid Hungry" campaign. On her website, she lists numerous other "organizations making a difference for children and families in need."
Ultimately, she prefers to think the best about the person who's been trading a story similar to hers in the halls of power. "If Eloise Anderson knows about another kid with a brown paper bag story," she says, "that's great."
Speaking only for myself, I hope that one day we'll find out whether or not meeting that "young boy from a very poor family" motivated Anderson to do something more profound than craft political talking points.

Georgia's Common Core Paranoia May Be Coming For The SAT	Jason Linkins	| March 6, 2014 3:43 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, common core state standards, conspiracy theories, Common Core, paranoia, common core paranoia, standardized testing, georgia legislature, sat	If you've spent any time at all reading up on recent trends in education policy, you probably know: Common Core State Standards Initiative -- the most recent offering from the "standards and accountability" set, which would establish consistent curriculum parameters in English and math and dictate expectations for students nationwide -- so hot right now! I don't claim to be an expert on this policy, but based upon what I've read and conversations I've had with educators, I'm convinced that Common Core is worthy of a rational debate.
Unfortunately for everyone, this is America, and we don't exactly do rational debates anymore. And so the bleeding-edge Common Core criticism is mostly emanating from the same paranoid fringe that shows up at your local county board meeting to denounce the plan to build a bike path or expand a recycling program as a one-world government "Agenda 21" conspiracy. Many state governments also include lawmakers who treat the Common Core as some sort of stealthy socialist takeover, so when it comes time to craft policies on the matter, things can get pretty entertainingly dicey.
One such state government is the laboratory of democracy known as Georgia. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Maureen Downey reports, "In capitulating to extremists who consider Common Core the work of the devil and/or Barack Obama, the state Senate passed a bill last week that isolates Georgia from the rest of our nation." And one other thing it isolates Georgia from, potentially, are those standardized tests that are critical to getting into college.
At issue here is Georgia Senate Bill 167, which has passed that chamber and will be voted on by the state House this week, before landing on Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal's desk. As Downey relates, the bill has strayed from its original intention, i.e., an outright ban on the Common Core. Instead, it sets up a "review of the standards." At first blush, this seems pretty anodyne. However, Downey goes on to note that "senators should have read the 18-page bill a little more closely as it still contains plenty of bad stuff, including a prohibition on embracing any new content or tests that even smack of national standards." The relevant language reads like so:
On and after the effective date of this Code section, the state shall not adopt any federally prescribed content standards or any national content standards established by a consortium of states or a third party, including, but not limited to, the Next Generation Science Standards, the National Curriculum for Social Studies, the National Health Education Standards, or the National Sexuality Standards.
Lord only knows what National Sexuality Standards are, or how well we as a nation are meeting them (I suspect not well). The more salient concern is: What about those Scholastic Aptitude Tests that everyone has to take to get into college? Downey continues:
Another unintended consequences of SB 167 could be a ban on critical national tests. The bill mandates all testing be controlled by the state. Some education experts worry that the broad language could prohibit the administration of International Baccalaureate exams, Advanced Placement tests, the SAT and the ACT -- tests students in Duluth and Johns Creek need to get into college.
"In my reading of the bill, it bans assessments that are not created within or by Georgia," says Dr. Dana Rickman, policy and research director for the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education and former director of research and policy at the Annie E. Casey Foundation. "What about AP, SAT and ACT? Are we not going to use them anymore? The bill doesn't allow for assessments or standards based on any multi-state consortiums," says Rickman. "That means we are not allowed to use the SAT or the ACT because they are based on Common Core."
Soooo, this is something that the Georgia legislature is probably going to want to rethink, especially considering recent reports that "more employers are making applicants provide SAT or ACT scores years or even decades after taking the test," for reasons well beyond my understanding.
Of course, if you refrain from leaping headfirst into the closest paranoid fever-swamp in the first place, maybe this law-making business is the sort of thing one tries to think all the way through.

Nate Silver Hates All The Right Things About The Political Media	Jason Linkins	| March 6, 2014 1:46 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, Media criticism, Nate Silver, fivethirtyeight.com, fivethirtyeight	In the upcoming issue of Time magazine, Jack Dickey will offer a feature on Nate Silver, whose FiveThirtyEight enterprise will soon become a semi-independent entity under ESPN's banner. At ESPN, Silver plans to re-up his breakdown of electoral polling data -- already made popular by FiveThirtyEight's perch at The New York Times during the 2012 election cycle -- while expanding into new territories. As such, FiveThirtyEight is bringing on board a new cadre of data-driven thinkers. In a preview of the longer feature, Dickey offers a taste of what will be expected of new hires -- they're gonna get graphed.
Think of it as, "Are You Sucking At Your Job In One Chart":
The x-axis runs from “quantitative” to “qualitative,” the
y-axis (top to bottom) from “rigorous and empirical” to “anecdotal and ad hoc.” All FiveThirtyEight employees, he says, need to land in the upper-left quadrant of the coordinate plane, where they are quantitatively inclined, rigorous and empirical. The adjacent quadrant above the x-axis, Silver says, belongs to journalists like some of his former colleagues at the New York Times and Ezra Klein, most recently of the Washington Post. “People call them numbers whizzes, but they’re not that—just very good journalists.” The bottom two quadrants belong to the dregs of American journalism: on the left, sportswriters who cherry-pick statistics without thinking through them, and on the right, op-ed columnists. “That’s the crap quadrant. Two-thirds of the op-ed columnists at America’s major newspapers are worthless,” Silver says. He hates punditry, he hates narratives, he hates bold proclamations — and so too does he hate the media’s most willing vessels for all three.
Those are, indeed, the right things to hate. That said, I generally agree with Matt Yglesias that Silver's suggestion that one-third of America's op-ed columnists are producing something of value to be a naively optimistic assessment. Based upon my own statistical models, I'd put it at 80 percent worthless, and if anything, I'm being too generous.
At any rate, this is bad news for anyone who's gone to work for FiveThirtyEight and thinks they can just skate by on an endless array of pieces titled "[NAME OF CANDIDATE] Is The New Frontrunner, But Is That Secretly A Huge Disadvantage?" based on funny impressions they had whilst popping a squat, like most of the rest of the political media.

Marco Rubio Is On The 'Comeback' Trail Because Of That Time He Totally Criticized A Retiring Liberal Senator	Jason Linkins	| March 5, 2014 6:36 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, 2016 frontrunners, marco rubio 2016, Marco Rubio, rubio comeback, gop 2016 rubio, 2016 election, rubio 2016, elections 2016, Media criticism, media narratives	Earlier this week, in an attempt to get everyone to calm down about the far-off 2016 presidential campaign and stop proclaiming non-candidates to be "frontrunners" in a non-existent race, one of the people I wrote up for jumping prematurely into the "presuming a frontrunner" game was Townhall's Conn Carroll, who tweeted "Rubio is the 2016 GOP frontrunner again." I did not use that occasion to explain Carroll's reasoning for saying so, but a new piece from McKay Coppins, which rather insistently alleges that a full-on Rubio "comeback" is underway, has forced my hand. So, what was the moment that done changed the game for Rubio? It was a speech he gave, in which he totally laid the wood to a retiring liberal senator for being soft on Cuba. See, Rubio was just going to deliver a "straightforward foreign policy speech" on the ongoing crisis in Venezuela, but then he "saw Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin standing behind a podium, reciting a cheery travelogue of his recent trip to Cuba, where he toured a local block party and marveled at the country’s health care system." And what happened next will apparently restore your faith in Rubio 2016:
With that, Rubio made his way into the Senate chamber, stepped up to the podium, and proceeded to deliver a scathing senatorial takedown. Alternating between biting sarcasm and righteous indignation, Rubio spent 14 minutes excoriating his colleague for heaping praise on a country that has aligned itself with corrupt regimes across the globe.
In other words, it was basically an old-school "Florida Republican paint-by-numbers anti-Castro rant." But hey, it got Drudge-linked and "went viral" on the right. It's enough to make you wonder, "Hey, so if this is a 'comeback,' what is it that Rubio is coming back from, exactly?" A memory stirs:
It is painful to watch Marco Rubio’s maneuverings on immigration. He is refusing to say whether he will vote “yes” on his own Gang of Eight bill after spending months drafting, defending, and helping shepherd it to the floor. He has supposedly discovered that the enforcement provisions are inadequate, although he has done countless interviews touting that the bill contains the “toughest immigration-enforcement measures in the history of United States” (which is what his website still says). At the same time, Rubio declares the bill 95–96 percent perfect.
That's from the editors of the National Review, circa June of 2013, at a time when they'd gone to great lengths to utterly bury Rubio's ambitions under the bulk weight of accusations that he was an "amnesty" appeaser and chronically wrong on comprehensive immigration reform. (Carroll, in his recent re-assessment of Rubio, says that he had been "very critical" of the Florida senator on that issue, but that it was "a long time ago." Maybe so, but as I follow Carroll's link to his "very critical" criticism, it reveals that his criticism was actually fairly muted and reasonable, compared to the anti-Rubio oeuvre of the National Review, and many others.)
Of course, when it comes to passing the first few low bars you face when you want to be the GOP's nominee for president, a little bit of Castro-punching and Harkin-lambasting is probably sufficient for the task. But let's look down the line at what Rubio's likely to face -- a slew of other GOP contenders who didn't author a comprehensive immigration reform bill with Senator Chuck Schumer. Will a little bit of standard-issue harshing-on-the-Cuban-regime hot talk from Rubio be sufficient to get his competitors to stand down? Not if the past is any guide: In the 2012 GOP primary, Texas Governor Rick Perry's cogent defenses of his own humane immigration policies only inspired his colleagues to kick in his teeth.
The larger, official "GOP establishment" has historically been behind the effort to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, but they've not sold the plan to their restless base. As such, the other presumed GOP contenders have taken pains to remain aloof from the immigration bill Rubio backed -- which is something Carroll, for one, is in the position to understand. As he wrote, while "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have all voiced support for a path to citizenship at some time in the past," the fact of the matter is that "Christie has not endorsed the actual bill Rubio produced," "Jindal and Perry have both recently come out against it," and Walker took pains to retract reports that he supported it. Heck, even Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a one-time Rubio fan who's been closely associated with the GOP establishment's position on immigration reform -- has been doing the triangulation two-step in preparation for a potential 2016 run.
Let's not have any misunderstanding: I do not take the position that one should "count out" Rubio as a potential top-tier contender for 2016. Far from it -- as a member of a largely do-nothing caucus, Rubio's put in the sweat equity on this issue, and he's volunteered to step in front of every cannon-shot of criticism fired at the effort to pass an immigration reform bill. And in addition to his documentable work-ethic and political courage, he's got a pretty good sense of humor as well. It can be fairly said that his speech in response to Tom Harkin is one of the least interesting things about him.
It is fairly typical for these sorts of hype-pieces to include a part that negates the original premise. In the case of this Coppins piece, we get this:
Meanwhile, as Rubio once again enjoys 2016 hype, his senior staff remains clear-eyed about how media narratives can work. One aide said he expected the backlash to the Rubio comeback story to materialize within weeks. Still, his allies contend that the senator’s ability to recapture the imagination of the movement with a single impromptu performance illustrates why he’s too talented to be written off for good.
I guess it's not altogether surprising that Rubio's senior staff is "clear-eyed about how media narratives can work," given that they are busy crafting this "comeback narrative" in the first place.
But look, you don't get extra points in a GOP primary for briefly being a viral sensation on the Internet. And while the sentiments Rubio expressed on Cuba and Venezuela will play just fine with the primary voters he's trying to win over, it's not going to earn Rubio a pass from his fellow competitors in a hypothetical primary, all of whom will likely be eyeing the ripe target on his back. When Marco Rubio survives those shots, then we can call it a comeback.

Relax Everybody, Nobody Is A '2016 Frontrunner' Yet	Jason Linkins	| March 3, 2014 2:51 PM ET	Tweet

Did you know that we already have "frontrunners" for 2016? As in more than one? Ninnyhammers, away!
The current frontrunner for the GOP nod in 2016? Boy named Rand. http://t.co/2yZ5s6Qnfj— The Fix (@TheFix) March 2, 2014
Rubio is the 2016 GOP frontrunner again http://t.co/hJmFTJTmMs— Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) March 3, 2014
Hey, I just double-checked, but it's apparently only March in the year 2014, so everyone can feel free to just chill, for God's sake.
Look, y'all. I ain't even trying to put the kibosh on discussing the relative strengths and weaknesses of potential 2016 candidates. I'm even OK with making comparisons. But we have to stop abusing this poor word, "frontrunner," before the English-language's version of Sarah MacLachlan starts making sad teevee commercials about it. There is no "frontrunner" at this point. There isn't even a race.
But once the race is enjoined, we'll still really need some new rules governing the use of this word. As things are, we deploy the word "frontrunner" way too readily, using it to describe everybody from candidates who are clearly dominating a race, to candidates who have snagged a slight lead over a pack of contenders, to -- as in the above cases -- candidates who aren't even candidates. It's important to remember that when Chris Cillizza or Conn Carroll declare a frontrunner, they've not taken the pulse of America or done anything quantitative to make that determination. They approach it with this kind of thinking: "Which prospective candidate, if I named them the 'frontrunner,' would give my personal #brandz #moar #klout and #zazz."
But look, I'm trimming my own excesses and taking responsibility for my own abuses, as well. Back in the 2012 GOP primary, as the fortunes of the various candidates waxed and waned over the months, I passed around the term "frontrunner" a little too promiscuously. So, now, I'm taking up the cause of HuffPost Pollster's own Mark Blumenthal, who wants this term to be used more realistically, so we stop hurting this poor word "frontrunner" so much! Here are some rules, from Mark Blumenthal:
1. "First, to be a frontrunner you need to at least have a real lead, which means statistical significance in some form. But again that’s the easy part."
2. "Second, we really need a different term to distinguish the true, dominant, likely-to-win frontrunner from a candidate that enjoys an early lead that’s quite possibly temporary."
My advice is to consider using terms like "ahead of the pack" or "so hot right now" or "I get sprung when I think of [NAME OF CANDIDATE]," and let the truly dominant candidates take "frontrunner." Because, honey, you do not want to have headlines like, "Newt Gingrich, frontrunner" on your permanent record. Oof.

Conservatives Have Some Pretty Confused Thoughts About Vladimir Putin	Jason Linkins	| March 3, 2014 2:12 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
polls, Eat The Press, conservatives obama, vladimir putin poll, barack obama vladimir putin, conservatives putin, Barack Obama Polls, Barack Obama, how did that happen, video, polling, Vladimir Putin, republicans obama	Spend enough time down in the dodgier neighborhoods of our political discourse, and you'll come away with the funny feeling that the most flamboyant critics of the White House and its current occupant maybe don't have a real appreciation for what true "tyranny" and "autocracy" look like. People have some funny emotions sometimes, and it leads them to just toss around words, willy-nilly.
But the findings of a recent YouGov poll lead me to wonder if a teensy little mental twitch has not become a more permanent state of intellectual turmoil. The YouGov folks have undertaken a personality profile exercise that compares U.S. President Barack Obama with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (The poll was conducted "before it became clear that Russia had moved troops into Ukraine.")
Fans of either man can cherry-pick some fun results to troll the other side with on Twitter. Americans think that Obama is both more sincere and more hypocritical. They also think that Putin is stronger but also more arrogant.
And, naturally, when divided by party affiliation, liberals obviously <3 <3 <3 Obama more than conservatives do, but that doesn't mean anything crazy, right? As YouGov's William Jordan writes: On the one hand, conservatives are much less likely to view Obama in positive terms and more likely to view Putin as effective, experienced, bold and strong. However, Putin does not even get as much credit as Obama when it comes to other positive values -- like sincerity, honesty and religiosity -- suggesting only a begrudging respect for Putin.
It is striking Putin and Obama are not far from each other on any of these positive features. But the overall picture does not suggest conservatives are fond of Putin.
Maybe so, but these crosstabs are pretty strange!
(All respondents) Which President has values more similar to yours?
45% Obama
10% Putin
45% Not sure
Among Republicans: 23% Obama
18% Putin
59% Not sure
Among conservatives:
18% Obama
18% Putin
65% Not sure
The extent to which you can so completely lose the thread of what constitutes basic political and societal norms in the United States and Russia that you cannot be sure who holds values more similar to yours is a serious disorder.
The YouGov poll questioned 1,000 U.S. adults on two separate occasions: Feb. 22-24 for Obama and Feb. 26-27 for Putin.
The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.	Comments	(405)
A Brief History Of The Republican Alternative To Obamacare: Your Sunday Morning Conversation	Jason Linkins	| March 2, 2014 9:30 AM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, Karl Rove, republican-alternative-obamacare, John Boehner, gop alternative obamacare, Eric Cantor, Barack Obama, video, Tom Coburn, sunday morning conversation, obamacare, obamacare alternative, Affordable Care Act, Media criticism	How to explain the history of the "Republican alternative to Obamacare?" It seems to reside in a realm where time elongates and reality warps. I cannot remember a time in which Republicans weren't fervently offering an "Obamacare alternative." Simultaneously, I cannot remember a time in which Republicans weren't fervently urging the creation of new "Obamacare alternatives." To borrow a line from Christopher Durang, I don't know if this is the trick of memory, or the memory of some trick.
At times, the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" seems to be forever on its way, but never arriving -- as if it were the public policy embodiment of Zeno's dichotomy paradox. New York magazine's Jonathan Chait, who's spent many a day navigating this Beckettian wilderness, suggests that the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" exists in a quantum reality, where they "reside in a state of quasi-existence, and any attempt to summon them into political reality will cause them to disappear."
More often than not, the history of the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" reveals itself as a cyclical set of traditions, repeating themselves over the years in political press conferences and pundit sparring. It goes something like this:
1. Republicans propose "alternatives" to Obamacare that don't go anywhere.
2. Allied partisans urge them to finally get serious and come up with a replacement.
3. They make new promises to keep at it.
4. Their return to the drawing board prompts columns from liberals about how the GOP lacks an alternative.
5. Allied partisans then criticize liberal pundits for saying there is "no alternative plan," citing the many plans that have been proposed, that went nowhere.
6. New alternatives are proposed and/or promised nonetheless, and the cycle repeats.
This cycle resembles Rust Cohle's "membrane theory" from the HBO show "True Detective." Time is a flat circle, in which Republicans have always been proposing alternatives to Obamacare, their proposals just cycling through their lives like carts on a track. The "Republican alternative to Obamacare" exists in an eternity where there is no time, nothing can grow, nothing can become, nothing changes, and everyone is reborn, but into the same effort to replace Obamacare that they've always been born into.
How many times have we had this conversation? I went back to the beginning to find out. By the end, I was ready to crush some Lone Star tallboys.
__________________________
March 2009:
As Democrats begin to coalesce around a plan of their own, the GOP alternative is still nonspecific. Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) offers that Medicare's prescription drug benefit is "a good pattern of how a competitive marketplace works."
"Health care is a privilege." -- Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.)
April 2009: Igor Volsky of ThinkProgress reports that the GOP's alternative plan still basically resembles the McCain plan: "The recent trickle of so-called consumer-driven health care 'principles and recommendations' are a preview of the likely Republican alternative to comprehensive health care reform. Earlier this month, the Health Policy Consensus Group, headed by the conservative Galen Institute, published 'a vision for consumer-driven health care reform' and today Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review pens a New York Times editorial in which he explains that ... 'universal coverage' is 'misguided." Policy makers should focus on giving Americans 'more control' of their coverage instead."
May 2009: Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), along with Reps. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) introduce their Patient's Choice Act. Ezra Klein notes: "It's clear that many traditionally Democratic concepts have been embraced. To put it simply, the plan wants to encourage a version of the Massachusetts reforms ... in every state. There are some differences, of course. The plan doesn't have an individual mandate. It doesn't have an obvious tax on employers. But it strongly endorses State Health Insurance Exchanges." The bill was referred to committee, but nothing ever came of it.
June 2009: "I guarantee you we will provide you with a bill." -- Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) Karl Rove: "In politics you can't beat something with nothing, so it is critical that the GOP offers an alternative to President Barack Obama's government-run monstrosity."
So here they come! The next semi-official GOP alternative to Obamacare is presented by Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Dave Camp (R-Mich.). Time's Jay Newton-Small terms it "a four-page exercise in public relations that left out how many of the 47 million uninsured Americans would be covered, how it would be paid for or even how much it would cost." It rolls out alongside nine other "alternative plans." "I started reading a couple, three of the Republican plans, but frankly, there's only so much time in the day." -- Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.)
July 2009: In late July, the GOP-alternative effort briefly falls into contradictions. In a July 23 conference with GOP House leadership, Blunt declared, "As the president has gotten less specific, we have been more specific." Cantor proclaimed that the GOP had a "third way" to do health care reform. A day before, however, Blunt had said that the GOP would not bother introducing a bill: "Our bill is never going to get to the floor, so why bother? We clearly have principles; we could have language, but why start diverting attention from this really bad piece of work they've got to whatever we're offering right now?" The next week, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) would give it another shot, introducing the "Empower Patients First Act." Igor Volsky remarked that it was "almost identical" to four other GOP proposals that had been previously floated, and wondered, "What was wrong with the other four bills?"
August 2009:
GOP partisans begin to get testy. Morton Kondracke, writing for Real Clear Politics, says, "There's no question that Republican criticism has helped undermine support for President Barack Obama's health plan. But it hasn't done much to help Republicans. That's because while Republicans actually do have alternative ideas on health care reform, they have spent most of their time accentuating Obama's negatives." American Thinker's Paul Shlichta suggests that the GOP's failure to coalesce around a "counterproposal" is "political suicide." Easier said than done, and the partisans aren't any better at coming to consensus. Justin Quinn urges the GOP to unite behind the "Improving Health Care For All Americans Act." Herman Cain begs the GOP to unite behind the "Empowering Patients First Act."
September 2009:
"The Republican health care plan for America: don't get sick ... if you do get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this: die quickly." -- Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.)
October 2009:
The Hill reports that the GOP is still at square one, debating what to do:
Some House Republicans are growing frustrated that their leaders have not yet introduced a health care reform alternative.
For months, the message from House GOP leaders on a health care bill has been similar to ads for yet-to-be-released movies: Coming soon. According to several GOP lawmakers, the leadership is split over how to proceed in terms of unveiling an alternative to the final Democratic bill that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) intends to unveil as soon as this week.
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Philip Klein in the American Spectator: "Taken together, these criticisms have helped to weaken support for and build opposition to Democratic initiatives, but they have done nothing to advance an alternative vision for the health care system."
November 2009:
The GOP introduces its alternative in the form of an "Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute Offered by Mr. Boehner of Ohio" to what was then the Democrats' bill, the "Affordable Health Care for America Act."
The Congressional Budget Office promptly torches it. Ezra Klein surveyed the damage: "The Democratic bill, in other words, covers 12 times as many people and saves $36 billion more than the Republican plan. And amazingly, the Democratic bill has already been through three committees and a merger process. It's already been shown to interest groups and advocacy organizations and industry stakeholders. It's already made its compromises with reality. It's already been through the legislative sausage grinder. And yet it saves more money and covers more people than the blank-slate alternative proposed by John Boehner and the House Republicans."
December 2009:
Jonathan Chait: "The Republicans eschewed a halfway compromise and put all their chips on an all or nothing campaign to defeat health care and Obama's presidency. It was an audacious gamble. They lost. In the end, they'll walk away with nothing."
February 2010:
The Weekly Standard offers a "one-page" alternative to Obamacare called "the Small Bill." Its praises are sung by people ranging from "people who work at the Weekly Standard" to "people who work at the National Review."
The White House offers to meet with legislators to hash out a health care reform bill. GOP lawmakers are optimistic that they can convince the White House to "scrap" the bill that's emerging. Their counterproposal? "A blank piece of paper." Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is shaping up to resemble a 1993 health care reform proposal floated by the GOP.
March 2010:
"And, once we defeat Barack Obama, we need to proceed to repeal this disastrous plan before it can ruin our health care system. Then we must replace it with a Republican alternative that relies on the marketplace, tax incentives and individual responsibility to provide health care to all Americans." -- Dick Morris May 2010:
Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah) is defeated in the second round of balloting at the 2010 Utah State Republican Convention. Among Republicans, Bennett was the most earnest in working on an Obamacare alternative. His sin, however, was partnering with a Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in the effort. As the Deseret News reported, "His seven opponents had claimed he was not conservative enough for Utah, and had attacked him for voting for a banking bailout and for pushing a bipartisan health care reform proposal."
June 2010:
Once again, the GOP managed a pileup of competing alternatives. Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) offers RedState readers "four commonsense alternatives to Obamacare," detailing H.R. 5421, "To repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010." The bill was referred to committee, and nothing came of it.
Meanwhile, House leadership microwaved an old alternative plan, repackaging it as H.R. 5424, "To repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and enact the Common Sense Health Care Reform and Affordability Act." The bill was referred to committee, and nothing came of it.
July 2010:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Fred Barnes in the American Spectator: "Republicans have two great issues: health care and reform. They ought to go beyond advocating repeal of ObamaCare, tell voters what they'd replace it with, and explain the benefits."
August 2010:
Writing for Fox News, Christian Wilton suggests that a GOP-controlled Congress needs to "refuse to appropriate money required for federal agencies to implement Obamacare, buying time to offer a Republican alternative." Buy time? They've been at this for over a year and a half!
September 2010:
The GOP releases its "Pledge To America," which includes a promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with ... a bunch of stuff that's already in Obamacare. October 2010:
"We could come up with a health care system that the American people would not only be proud of, but would actually love. ... We've never had a real conservative majority." -- Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
The Los Angeles Times' Noam Levey reports: "Conservatives are campaigning on promises to repeal Obama's overhaul, but a few admit their proposals haven't changed much in the last few years."
Some conservatives acknowledge that the healthcare program offered by party leaders is largely unchanged from the proposals the GOP pushed when it held majorities from 2000 to 2006. During that period, insurance premiums skyrocketed, businesses reduced benefits and the number of Americans without health insurance rose.
November 2010:
With a new House majority, Cantor reboots the effort to come up with an alternative. In a letter to incoming members, he writes: "Our new Republican majority will move to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with commonsense alternatives that lower costs while protecting those with pre-existing conditions." Newly minted House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) echoed the sentiments: "We must do everything we can to try to repeal this bill and replace it with common-sense reforms to bring down the cost of health care." Rep. Camp tries to interest people in one of his old proposals. December 2010:
The GOP struggles, once again, to unify its approach. Cantor's call to protect patients with pre-existing conditions -- ground he ceded to Obamacare -- wasn't embraced by the incoming freshmen. As Andrea Stone reported:
North Carolina's Renee Ellmers, a Palin protege, opposes requiring insurers to accept patients with pre-existing conditions -- including pregnancy. Austin Scott of Georgia, another House freshman, was asked if there was any part of the law he supported. He replied, "No, ma'am, there are not." Meanwhile, right-wing pundit infighting commences over Charles Krauthammer's suggestion to not attempt to defund Obamacare, on the grounds that a defunding effort would naturally be blamed for the law's failings. Krauthammer supported allowing the bill to be implemented, so it would fail on its own. This was met with disagreement.
January 2011:
House Republicans check off one of the entries on their bucket list by passing the "Repeal And Replace The Job Destroying Health Care Law." While the symbolic bill is long on "repeal," it doesn't offer much in the way of "replace." In fact, Cantor characterized the effort to construct an alternative to Obamacare as something that Republicans were, once again, embarking on for the first time, telling reporters that the vote for the bill meant they were ready "to begin work to construct an alternative health-care vision" that would be their "so-called replacement bill."
Bloomberg reported that "Republican leaders didn't offer specific alternatives" or a "timeline for moving forward with their proposals." The bill would die in the Senate.
February 2011:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Jeffrey Anderson in the Weekly Standard: "But while Americans want repeal, they don't just want repeal. And thus the House Republicans are now confronted with their greatest challenge -- and opportunity -- in the whole span of the health care debate. They need to show the American people that the choice is not between Obamacare and nothing. They need to provide a meaningful, sensible alternative to Obamacare's comprehensive failings."
Days later, the American Thinker's Jim Guirard had a brainwave: "We must focus on an alternative plan which can and should result in a simultaneous repeal and replacement of ObamaCare." "As soon as the time is right," he specified.
March 2011:
WNYC reports that the GOP was hard at work "mull[ing]" an "Obamacare alternative": "Because now, Republicans (and their presidential hopefuls) must face the task of figuring out just what kind of health care law they'd like to see." Meanwhile, Ezra Klein opines:
It's put-up-or-shut-up time for Republicans. They managed to make it through the health-care debate without offering serious solutions of their own, and -- perhaps more impressive -- through the election by promising to tell us their solutions after they'd won. But the jig is up. They need a health-care plan -- and quickly.
Jennifer Rubin -- missing Klein's point by a country mile -- responded by citing numerous past examples of Republicans coming up with plans and insisting that Klein was "pretending there is no alternative to the deeply flawed ObamaCare." April 2011:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Ramesh Ponnuru and Yuval Levin in The New York Times: "Republicans have an effective slogan for their health care agenda: 'repeal and replace.' The problem is, they can agree only on the first half; agreeing on what to put in place of last year's health care law is the hard part."
May 2011:
2012 hopefuls Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich wade into the health care reform waters, with mixed success. The Wall Street Journal offers the optimistic assessment that the "Republican primary contest ... could feature a robust debate on health care, with GOP candidates challenging the Democratic law while defending their own variations."
July 2011:
"When they took control of the House, Republicans could barely stop talking about their plans to 'repeal and replace' the health care reform law. Six months later, they hardly talk publicly about those plans at all. And they're nowhere close to 'replacing' the law." --Politico
September 2011:
Ryan gives the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" another shot, proposing an expanded variation on his voucher system for Medicare.
October 2011:
Another dispatch from LA Times reporter Noam Levey indicates that, once again, the effort to come up with the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" is just getting underway: "Other conservative healthcare experts are developing an alternative to the law, an effort that could protect Republicans from past critiques that their healthcare plans left tens of millions of Americans without medical coverage."
Later in the same article, Levey reports, "A Republican replacement plan could build off a 2009 House GOP plan, said James Capretta, a former George W. Bush administration official who is developing a replacement strategy." (So much for dodging those "past critiques.") November 2011:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Deroy Murdock in the National Review: "Washington Republicans nevertheless have been unwilling or unable to lock themselves in a hotel ballroom for a long weekend and devise a single plan as the official GOP alternative to Obamacare. Lacking a proposal around which Republicans and their limited-government allies could coalesce, the Right rightfully hammered Obamacare but never offered its own coherent package. Lesson: Never try to defeat something with nothing."
January 2012:
The Hill reports that "House Republicans will be ready with a plan to replace President Obama's healthcare law once the Supreme Court determines the law's fate this summer," thus giving them six more months to come up with something. Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) -- who told The Hill that the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" would be ready regardless of the court's decision, "listed a number of policy ideas Republicans would consider in a replacement bill"...that were already part of Obamacare. Meanwhile, it is reported that Romney's alternative plan is "light on details."
February 2012:
Months after she castigated Ezra Klein for "pretending there is no alternative to ... ObamaCare," Jennifer Rubin says that the Republicans need to come up with the "Republican alternative to Obamacare." She writes, "Conservatives need to let the public know what the alternative to ObamaCare may be. If, unlike Obama, Republicans care about getting a mandate for their agenda, they would be wise to start laying out what a market-oriented alternative to ObamaCare would look like."
March 2012:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: James Capretta and Robert Moffit in National Affairs: "Now that Obamacare is with us, the law cannot be reversed without a credible proposal for what should take its place."
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is reportedly scaling back expectations, telling Ramesh Ponnuru, "We would want to more modestly approach this with more incremental fixes ... Not a massive Republican alternative."
April 2012:
The mystery of the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" deepens. "Do Republicans have an alternative to ObamaCare?" asks The Week. "Is There a Republican Alternative to Obamacare?" wonders Uwe Reinhardt. Fox News insists, "There is a Republican health plan. The only problem: Just as Democrats don't want to talk about ObamaCare, Republicans are just as afraid to talk about their plan as well."
May 2012:
The Hill reports:
Republicans might not offer a comprehensive plan to replace President Obama's healthcare law if the Supreme Court strikes it down this summer.
House Republicans had said they would have a healthcare bill ready to go by the time of the ruling to present a clear alternative to the Democrats' Affordable Care Act.
But now, with the high court's ruling just weeks away, some conservatives are urging the party to abandon that strategy, fearing voters will recoil from another sweeping revamp of the healthcare system.
"The political dynamics are such that you can loudly promise to craft an alternative a million times, and then quietly take back that promise in a small article published in The Hill." -- Jonathan Chait
July 2012:
A year and a half after Eric Cantor said the GOP was ready "to begin work to construct an alternative health-care vision" that would serve as his party's "so-called replacement bill," Cantor tells Tom Brokaw: "Tom, you knew back in 2009 when the Obamacare bill was being considered on the House floor, we put forward our alternative. So to sit here and say we don't have a replacement is not correct." Meanwhile, other Republicans were proceeding under the assumption that alternative plans were still needed -- and they continually offered "alternatives" that resembled the Affordable Care Act.
By mid-month, however, the L.A. Times reports that the GOP had "all but given up pushing alternatives to the sweeping legislation the president signed in 2010."
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Gail Wilensky, who headed the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush and advised Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2008 presidential campaign, says: "One of the big questions that the public needs to ask Republicans who are so focused on repeal is what will come in its place."
November 2012:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Ex-Romney adviser Avik Roy in Forbes: "Republicans have, rightly, spent the last three years campaigning against Obamacare. ... But conservatives are sorely mistaken if they believe that they can continue to campaign against Obamacare, without offering their own strategy for making health care more affordable for American families and the federal treasury."
December 2012:
Politico reports that Rep. Price becomes the latest GOP figure to suggest that the process of developing a "Republican alternative to Obamacare" needed to be rebooted: "It's incumbent upon us to put forward positive, alternative solutions," Price said at a Politico Pro breakfast panel discussion.
January 2013:
Jennifer Rubin offers a post-election lamentation: The problem in the 2012 election was not that Mitt Romney didn't seek to repeal Obamacare or that he had a state plan with one element (an individual mandate with an exchange); it was that he refused to spell out in particular detail an alternative. James Capretta and Jeffrey Anderson make a compelling case in the Weekly Standard that Republicans must do this ... without an alternative, the duo correctly point out, there will be no groundswell of support to dump Obamacare and no effective scene setting for the 2014 and 2016 elections."
Once again, I'll remind you that at one point Rubin got awfully snippy at Ezra Klein for "pretending there is no alternative to the deeply flawed ObamaCare." Now the lack of an alternative is the backbone of her urgings.
March 2013:
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Mona Charen in Washington Examiner: "As Obamacare's rising costs and constricted choices alienate the American people, Republicans should be ready with an alternative that is market-oriented, assembled and on the launchpad."
April 2013:
The "Republican alternative to Obamacare" returns to its conceptual stages, where it becomes part of a pundit pileup in Cloudcuckooland. Yuval Levin and Ramesh Ponnuru write in National Review that Republicans "need to realize that without ... an alternative their objections to Obamacare will ring increasingly hollow," adding, "Even though they cannot become law for at least four years, such ideas must become Republican orthodoxy if the party is plausibly to call for repeal."
Levin and Ponnuru propose an alternative. Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein are not impressed. Ben Domenech is not impressed with their non-impressediveness. Jonathan Chait notes that the GOP has had ample opportunity to come up with an alternative, but hasn't put many to a vote:
Republicans haven't done so for pretty clear reasons. These alternative proposals are much less technocratically simple than they pretend. (You can't just throw terms like "well-designed" at the Congressional Budget Office.) They cost money Republicans don't want to spend. They upset voters and interest groups Republicans don't want to upset.
May 2013:
"Together, we could provide more cost-effective care and do something more about spiraling healthcare costs. But really, the only true Republican alternative to Obamacare is Nothingcare." -- Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas)
Ryan becomes the latest Republican to reboot the effort to create the "Republican alternative to Obamacare," telling those gathered at the Wisconsin state party convention: "The nation is watching. The broken promises are being realized in front of their eyes and in their daily lives. ... This is the moment that we have to offer them real hope and give them real alternatives."
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Ross Douthat writes in The New York Times: "The fact that the G.O.P. isn't really offering such an alternative at the moment clearly makes the case for repeal weaker than it otherwise might be, and it makes the case for resistance weaker as well."
June 2013:
Rep. Price of Georgia decides to give the "Republican alternative to Obamacare" another try, with H.R. 2300, the "Empowering Patients First Act of 2013," which repeals the Affordable Care Act and, among other things, replaces it with "refundable tax credits of up to $5,000 for low-income individuals and families to purchase health insurance on the private market." In June, the bill is referred to committee, and nothing further comes of it.
Meanwhile, the Weekly Standard's Jeffrey Anderson laments that his party's candidates for the 2012 presidential nomination didn't succeed in their efforts to develop a "Republican alternative to Obamacare," writing, "if a credible Republican candidate had entered the presidential race with the goal of making Obamacare -- and a compelling GOP alternative -- the focus of the campaign, Obama would likely now be living in Hyde Park rather than across from Lafayette Square (albeit still at public expense)."
July 2013:
Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) tells Newsmax that "House Republicans plan to have an alternative to Obamacare ready by this fall." Really. They totally mean it this time.
Meanwhile, Jennifer Rubin is increasingly sounding like the people she once haughtily criticized: "Without a GOP alternative to Obamacare, their complaints are empty and their votes unlikely to be taken seriously by voters. It is long, long past the point at which Republicans should have begun crafting and selling their alternative. ... Where is the market-based health-care plan?"
August 2013:
August brings another spin of the "Republicans need an alternative!" to "Not fair, we have lots of alternatives!" cycle. Obama, in a news conference, criticized Republicans for not proposing a replacement bill: "They used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I've been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years." It's understandable: let's recall that mere weeks ago, Rep. Brady was saying the alternative would not arrive until the fall.
Obamacare opponents did not take this well. John C. Goodman insists that "there is a serious GOP proposal," citing the "Patients Choice Act" proposed by Ryan and Coburn. ("This is essentially the health reform plan that John McCain proposed when he ran for president in 2008," he writes.) He'd later tell Fox News' Jim Angle, "I think the president has an incredibly short memory." Forbes contributor Chris Conover was similarly incensed: "It's arguably the favorite myth of progressives, the oft-repeated claim that Republicans have no health plan."
Meanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tells "a gathering of GOP operatives that lawmakers who criticize Obamacare but offer no alternatives will be left with 'zero answer' for constituents who ask for a policy solution to the president's health care reform law."
"I would bet for most of you, you go home in the next two weeks while your members of Congress are home and you look at them in the eye and you say, 'What is your positive replacement for Obamacare?' and they will have zero answer," said Gingrich. Short memory, I guess.
September 2013:
Having missed all of August's harangues about how unfair it was to suggest that there were no "Republican alternatives to Obamacare," because so many already existed, the Republican Study Committee goes ahead an unveils a new one anyway, called the "American Health Care Reform Act of 2013":
"First of all, we start by repealing Obamacare," RSC Chairman Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican, said of the new bill.
Among other reforms, the GOP-sponsored bill would allow consumers to shop for insurance across state lines, let individuals and families deduct health care costs for tax purposes the way employers do and inject billions of dollars into state high-risk pools so people with preexisting medical conditions can gain coverage.
ThinkProgress' Sy Mukherjee remarks: "If that all of this sounds familiar, it's because Republicans have been proposing some combination of these ideas since at least 2007." The bill is referred to committee on Sept. 18, and nothing ever comes of it.
October 2013:
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) jumps into the "create a Republican alternative to Obamacare" game on Twitter, proposing that every American should receive the same benefits that lawmakers receive through the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. Business Insider's Josh Barro terms this replacing "Obamacare with Obamacare."
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Rob McKenna in Smarter Government Washington: "It's time for Congressional Republicans to unite under solid, practical alternatives to Obamacare and give the public a positive vision."
November 2013:
The Republican Study Group's alternative plan, the "American Health Care Reform Act of 2013," is said to be gaining "support" and "momentum," but I've already spoiled the ending for everybody, so I guess you'll have to appreciate the dramatic irony. Meanwhile, the Onion gets into the game of making fun of the "Republican alternatives to Obamacare," with a list of their own that includes such proposals as "Repeating the phrase 'you can keep your current doctor' over and over until something happens," and "A true market-based solution -- perhaps a convenient website -- where uninsured people would pay for their own health insurance from private providers," and "Whatever the opposite of tyranny is."
A GAME-CHANGING IDEA EMERGES: Ramesh Ponnuru and Yuval Levin offer a breakout idea in The Wall Street Journal: "What Republicans can and should do is offer the public something better. Now is the time to advance a conservative reform that can solve the serious, discrete problems of the health-care system in place before ObamaCare, but without needlessly upending people's arrangements or threatening what works in American medicine."
December 2013:
Despite the fact that the calls for a "Republican alternative to Obamacare" are coming from inside the house, conservative partisans ignore the urgings of Ponnuru and Levin and lapse into another round of being aggrieved at the way Democrats keep saying that they've not come up with an alternative.
Meanwhile, Rep. Price tells Fox News that the GOP will really, totally, seriously "bring forth a bill" that will "unite Republicans around health care issues" sometime after the first of the year, and that's a promise, for real, this time.
"You can't beat something with nothing," Price added, sagely.
January 2014:
A new year dawns and with it comes yet another unveiling of a "Republican alternative to Obamacare." And the GOP had been at it for such a long time that it was second-bite-at-the-apple time for Sens. Coburn and Burr, who joined Sen. Hatch in creating the "Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment Act." "Mirabile dictu," sang out Ross Douthat, "an actual health care reform proposal!"
The glad tidings did not last long. "Within hours of the new plan coming into contact with political reality, things began to fall apart," wrote Jonathan Chait:
The first blow to its coherence came when the authors faced questions about their proposal to cap the tax deduction for employer-sponsored health insurance, a politically risky but economist-approved change that provided most of its money for covering the uninsured. Asked about this piece of their plan, the authors changed the language within hours to ratchet back its scope, insulating them from political attacks, but also neutering its value.
After that came the Congressional Budget Office report that described the way Obamacare would cause labor supply to shrink from the labor markets, as recipients escaped "job lock," or took advantage of the Obamacare subsidies to reduce their hours or retire. The GOP opted to describe this as "job killing," but what they didn't take into consideration was that this new plan from Coburn, Burr, and Hatch "would likely have approximately the same "job-killing" impact as Obamacare."
February 2014:
"Republicans can easily pick [Obamacare] apart, but they won't win over voters without their own ideas." -- Karl Rove, once again
Chait returns to this theme a month later, gathering string from numerous pieces of reporting, all suggesting that the process of crafting a "Republican alternative to Obamacare" is beginning anew. Daniel Newhauser, giving Roll Call readers the inside scoop in a piece titled "GOP Leaders to Huddle on Obamacare Alternative," describes the process with sentences like: "House Republican leaders will meet Friday to begin crafting an alternative to Democrats' health care law." An interview with Eric Cantor by The Wall Street Journal's Gerald Seib (in a piece titled "Cantor Pushes the GOP to Spell Out Its Agenda"), yields these quotes from the House majority leader:
"Our members are going to get very excited if we can provide alternatives, not just be a party that's against whatever the president is for."
And:
"We may have an opportunity for an alternative to be put in place."
Emphasis mine throughout. As Chait notes, all of this has a purpose:
Carping from the sidelines is a great strategy for Republicans because status quo bias is extremely powerful. It lets them highlight the downside of every trade-off without owning any downside of their own. They can vaguely promise to solve any problem with the status quo ante without exposing themselves to the risk any real reform entails. Republicans can exploit the disruption of the transition to Obamacare unencumbered by the reality that their own plans are even more disruptive.
"The amazing thing," says Chait, "is that House Republicans have managed to sustain this any-day-now stance since the outset of a health-care debate that began five years ago." Welcome to Year Six.

Lobbyist Trying To Ban Gay Players From The NFL Faces Backlash From Clients	Jason Linkins	| February 26, 2014 4:59 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, jack burkman nfl, nfl gay ban, Michael Sam, Jack Burkman gay bill, Michael Sam NFL, jack burkman, Michael Sam gay, Politics News, video, jack burkman michael sam, nfl gay players, Gop Lobbyist Ban Gays NFL	A few days ago, lobbyist Jack Burkman, the CEO of Burkman LLC, came out of the closet and proclaimed himself to be openly idiotic, announcing a plan to push a bill banning gay people from playing in the National Football League. Given the fact that the supposed bill had no language, no supporters, and is likely unconstitutional in a strict legal sense, it was never particularly clear how this effort was going to proceed, let alone succeed. Burkman said he was motivated by openly gay Missouri football star Michael Sam's decision to enter the NFL draft, and his concern that "society" was "sliding in the wrong direction."
However, publicly proclaiming himself to be an out member of the idiot community is proving to have some consequences. According to Time Magazine's Jay Newton-Small, several of Burkman's clients have privately expressed "concerns" about working with him, and one in particular has determined that remaining connected to him would not be conducive to boardroom chemistry:
DC Solar Solution, a California company that paid him $30,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013, told TIME Tuesday it was severing ties. “DC solar does not condone or support Mr. Burkman’s homophobic views, and since learning about his misguided efforts to write legislation banning gay athletes from the NFL, we have ended our relationship with him,” wrote DC Solar executives Jeffery Carpoff and Paulette Carpoff in a statement. “DC Solar values diversity within our company and within out communities, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any sort. As a company working to address issues about our country’s future, we have no intention of working with those stuck in the past.”
Newton-Small managed to find two clients who said that Burkman's decision to out himself won't affect their decision to continue working with him. But in an all-too-common story, members of Burkman's immediate family are still having difficulty coming to terms with his recent forays into the idiot lifestyle.
Burkman, for his part, says that he will "not back down from his quest to keep gay men out of professional football." He tells Newton-Small, "It is about re-enforcing and protecting American values of decency and civility. Should NFL players shower with NFL cheerleaders? Certainly not. Given this, why should straight NFL players shower with gay NFL players?”
Given the fact that straight NFL players have been showering with their gay colleagues since at least 1964, based upon what we know about the seven athletes who have come out as gay after playing in the NFL, I cannot understand what Burkman thinks is going to happen to the league or to America if this continues to happen.
Perhaps I should chalk this up to ignorance, or a lack of sensitivity on my part about the struggles of the idiot community.

Ronan Farrow Denies It Was His Idea To Ban Woody Allen Questions	Jason Linkins	| February 26, 2014 2:15 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
good advice, Eat The Press, ronan farrow family, ronan farrow daily, woody allen dylan farrow, ronan farrow woody allen, woody allen ronan farrow, Woody Allen, Media criticism, ronan farrow	Earlier Wednesday, the New York Post's Page Six reported that MSNBC host Ronan Farrow, who is set to receive the "Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism" from an organization called Reach the World, had imposed some rather stringent conditions on journalists covering the event. Specifically, journalists were cautioned to ask no questions about Farrow's family's ongoing Woody Allen psychodrama. Obvious ironies were noted. However, Farrow's camp is denying the story.
Page Six, which naturally labored to present the story in the most cynical and humorless way possible, reported that it had obtained a "tip sheet" from Reach the World detailing Farrow's pre-conditions, which were purportedly confirmed by the organization:
“The theme of the evening is global education and service,” it says. “All press are required to stay strictly on message. Any press who ask guests or Mr. Farrow about off-message topics will be immediately escorted out of the event.”
A rep for the event further explained, “We would like you to sign the form or indicate by return e-mail that you understand our goals to stay completely on message given the surrounding circumstances. We will not tolerate press questions about personal or family affairs related to Mr. Farrow in any circumstance at this event. Farrow is not doing interviews and the rules come from his team direct to you.”
Well, not so fast. A spokesperson for Farrow is denying all of this. In a statement given to Gawker's J.K. Trotter, a rep for Farrow said, "Ronan and his team did not request any restrictions on reporters’ questions.” Trotter further reports that a "source at MSNBC added that the 'tip sheet' was created and distributed, without Farrow’s knowledge, by a 3rd-party public relations firm hired by the ceremony’s organizers." Furthermore, Heather Halstead, executive director of Reach the World, confirmed that statement, telling HuffPost’s Michael Calderone that the nonprofit -- and not Farrow or his staff -- came up with the stipulations for press coverage.
Obviously, it's not in the best interests of Reach the World for the event to be laden down with the ongoing Allen-Farrow mishegas. But Farrow has, as they say, "opened the door" to this line of inquiry through his own public comments on the matter: Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?— Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) January 13, 2014
What's more is that during his Feb. 20 appearance on "The Daily Show" with Jon Stewart, Farrow specifically cited his "crazy family" as something that informed and inspired the work for which Reach the World will be honoring him. "My siblings were adopted from really tough backgrounds from all over the world," he told Stewart, adding that he felt the need "to give back in a lesser way because I may be less awesome, but I want to be of some use."
With that in mind, it would have been an odd choice for the host of a news show to try to place some sort of prior restraint on journalists on a topic he's willingly discussed in the past.
You may at this point be wondering if it's also odd for someone who has only been at his teevee news gig for about three days to be receiving something called the "Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism." Well, sure! But in fairness, Farrow's eligibility for the award appears to hang more firmly on his pre-MSNBC career as a UNICEF spokesperson for youth and as the director of the State Department's Office of Global Youth Issues -- jobs that place him firmly in the wheelhouse of Reach the World, an organization dedicated to global mentorship and education programs. Still, it's a pretty remarkable achievement. On my third day on the job, I only managed to receive my own key to the men's washroom. For which I'm grateful! (And besides, it was a beautiful ceremony.)

Anyone Who Fact Checks This Obamacare Attack Ad Hates Cancer Patients, Apparently	Jason Linkins	| February 25, 2014 3:03 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, video, obamacare ad julie boonstra, obamacare, glenn kessler, Americans for Prosperity, campaign ads, Affordable Care Act, Media criticism, julie boonstra, campaign adwatch, attack ads, fact checking	Big news from the war on fact checking today, folks. About a week ago, Americans for Prosperity (AFP) launched an attack ad against Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who has declared himself a candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Carl Levin (D-Mich.). In that ad, Peters is assailed by Julie Boonstra, whose insurance plan was canceled because of Obamacare. Boonstra, a cancer patient, says in the ad that as a result of her plan's cancellation, her "out-of-pocket costs are so high, it’s unaffordable." She continues, like so:
I believed the president. I believed I could keep my health insurance plan. I feel lied to. It’s heartbreaking for me. Congressman Peters, your decision to vote for Obamacare jeopardized my health.
Scoop, if true. Enter The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler (and HuffPost's Ashley Woods), who did the fact-checking spadework and discovered that the ad's claims didn't add up. Peters, as you might expect, cried foul and complained to the television stations airing the ad. Further documentation was provided by AFP, but, as it turns out, that documentation "doesn’t actually back up the ad’s key claim."
And that's all in a day's work on the fact-checking beat, with the good news for AFP being that the information conveyed by the fact-checkers will inevitably fail to be as widely broadcast as the original ad itself. But the Washington Examiner, for some reason, believes that fact-checking the ad was out of bounds: "Their first priority should be fact-checking politicians, not private citizens exercising their First Amendment rights."
By the Examiner's reckoning, it took way too long for fact-checkers to lambaste President Barack Obama for his "If you like your plan, you can keep it." As the Examiner editorial notes, "The Washington Post's 'Fact Checker' blog, for example, didn't award four Pinocchios to Obama's claim until Oct. 30[, 2013] -- more than three years after the law was signed, and only after people were getting cancellation letters." That's a fair point -- though it should be added that the veracity of Obama's claim was impugned well before 2013. Here, for example, is a September 2010 article by The Hill's Julian Pecquet, reporting that by the Department of Health and Human Services' own estimates, many plans were going to lose their "grandfathered" status between 2010 and 2013.
But what's the solution here? Wait three months to fact-check a political ad, for the sake of consistency? The Examiner notes that fact-checkers went to work on the "if you like your plan" claim "after people were getting cancellation letters." That's a clue as to how this fact-checking industry is going to work -- a precipitating event is going to drive their activity. In the case of the president's claims, it was cancellation letters, which laid bare the reality behind the White House's glib spin job. In the case of Boonstra's claims, it was when she showed up in an attack ad. And I'm afraid to say, the First Amendment doesn't protect people from having their speech scrutinized -- whether it comes in a campaign ad or not.
Not that the Examiner is anti-scrutiny! "No one is arguing in favor of misleading political ads," they write. "But what's important here are the facts no one disputes: Boonstra's health insurance was canceled due to federal regulations, she was forced to restructure her care while suffering from a deadly disease and Peters did vote for Obamacare."
It reminds one of an ad that ran in the 2012 campaign cycle, from Obama-supporting super PAC Priorities USA Action:
Here are some facts that no one disputes: Joe Soptic worked at a steel plant, Bain Capital invested in the company that ran this plant, the plant was closed, Soptic lost his job, his wife died of cancer. But the claim that Mitt Romney was somehow culpable in Soptic's wife's death was a grotesque lie. Glenn Kessler said of this ad, "On just every level, this ad stretches the bounds of common sense and decency." That is 100 percent correct. And at the time, the Washington Examiner could not agree more, never mind Soptic's First Amendment rights.
But there are new standards, according to AFP's director of public affairs and the group's ideological allies:
@ThePlumLineGS So emotionally invested in cheerleading for O-care, you're blind to the pain it's causing a cancer victim. #standwithjulie— Levi Russell (@AskLevi) February 25, 2014
@ThePlumLineGS Hit 'em harder! Don't let those cancer patients get away with it!— Byron York (@ByronYork) February 25, 2014
So, officially, AFP and the Washington Examiner now tacitly approve of Priorities USA Action's ad with Joe Soptic. That's not what I'd recommend! Rather, my advice to Americans for Prosperity is that if they want to create an attack ad around an Obamacare victim, they should go out and find one whose claims actually authentically fit the bill. Look for people whose premiums have increased or the ones who actually had to break the continuity of their care by shopping around for a new doctor. Then they'll get themselves a "true" rating from the fact-checkers to celebrate.
By the way, if you're interested in what the American Cancer Society thinks about Obamacare, well, they are for it. And if you find the implications of the new law "confusing" or "overwhelming," they have "a staff of trained experts available to answer questions, free of charge," through a 24-hour hotline. They promise to keep it politics-free, which, for cancer patients, is probably a pretty good prescription.

Obamacare Encourages Some Risky Behavior -- And That's A Good Thing	Jason Linkins	| February 24, 2014 2:36 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, job lock, video, entrepreneurship, obamacare, obamacare-entrepreneur	Last September, Josh Barro wrote a piece about the ways in which the Affordable Care Act would "change the way [people] work and retire," for the good and bad. Here's one thing that Barro slotted for the "win" column:
Freed from the search for health insurance, people might do better and more productive work. Economists call the current phenomenon "job lock": People decline to take more appropriate job opportunities or start their own businesses because they do not wish to lose their current health coverage.
"Job lock" used to be a thing that Republicans fairly explicitly opposed, but times have changed and the party that once decried it now decries the efforts to ameliorate it. This is a phenomenon noted by The New York Times Magazine's Shaila Dewan:
But in reality, many Republicans have long talked about the need to liberate workers from job lock, and conservative arguments against the Affordable Care Act willfully ignore the fact that giving workers more freedom benefits a favorite constituency: Would-be entrepreneurs. These future innovators might just be chained to their corporate gigs, unable to boost the economy with small-business hiring. Access to health insurance outside of work should enable them to take the leap.
Dewan continues:
James Bailey, a graduate student in economics at Temple University, came up with a clever way to test that theory: he looked at what happened to 19- to 25-year-olds when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for them to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans, beginning in 2010. Those who got the coverage, he found, were two to three times more likely to go into business for themselves. And that increase was largely driven by women, who are generally more risk-averse than men.
I am reminded of a line from one of the big speeches of the 2012 election cycle: "Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It's about dreams. Usually it doesn't work out
exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple, and then he came back and changed the world."
That quote was from Mitt Romney at the 2012 Republican National Convention. What can I say? When it comes to loosing America's entrepreneurial spirit from the shackles of job lock, Obamacare was one of Mitt Romney's better ideas.

WaPo Editors Express Dismay With The Monster They Created	Jason Linkins	| February 24, 2014 1:19 PM ET	Tweet

Eat The Press, washington post deficit, virginia republicans, Media criticism, Washington Post, virginia deficit, virginia house of delegates, deficit hysteria	The editors of The Washington Post are shocked -- shocked! -- to find that deficit panic is happening in their backyard:
Virginia Republicans, having been swept from power at the hands of an electorate alienated by their tilt toward extremism, retain just one bastion in Richmond: the state House of Delegates. From that redoubt, they have resorted to political stunts and budgetary gimmicks as a means of derailing Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s proposal to extend health coverage to hundreds of thousands of Virginians by expanding Medicaid. They seem content that the impasse may end in a state government shutdown, from which they evidently hope to gain political advantage by blaming it on Democrats. We doubt it’s a winning strategy for Republicans. It’s certainly a losing strategy for Virginia.
At issue is a budget proposal passed by Democrats and "a few moderate Republicans" in the state Senate. The proposal evidently calls for much more spending than the GOP-controlled Virginia House of Delegates is willing to countenance. And so here come "stunts" and "gimmicks" and a possible government shutdown. All of which the Post "doubts" is a winning strategy. But the only "new" thing here is the Post's deficit-schmeficit attitude. In the years leading up to this moment, the Post seemed pretty certain that the deficit hysteria now guiding the Republicans in the House of Delegates was, on a national level, all too real. And the paper fed the beast on a regular basis. In December 2012, economist and media commentator Dean Baker noted the WaPo's unnecessary alarmism in its article about "time running out" to "tame" the national deficit. A year later, Mother Jones' Kevin Drum pointed out another case of the Post's hysterics in an article where the paper expressed sadness that both parties were "laying down arms" and "abandoning their deficit reduction goals."
Drum highlighted the obvious:
This is done with no mention of the fact that Congress has already slashed the 10-year deficit by nearly $4 trillion over the past couple of years. No mention that we've been engaged in this frenzy of deficit cutting despite the fact that the economy is still fragile, which means that reducing the deficit is almost certainly a terrible idea. No mention that deficit cutting of any size in the wake of recession is unprecedented in recent history. No mention of the fact that the deficit has been falling for years and will continue to decline in 2014 and 2015.
Wait. That's not true. There is a mention that the deficit will continue to fall over the next two years. It gets one sentence at the very tail end of the story.
The Post's message over the years has been pretty clear: When it comes to deficit battles, please, please, please don't lay down your arms! The Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates have simply honored this request, so they've a right to wonder why this editorial calls them out for doing nothing more than following instructions.
"How did this happen?" lament the Post's hapless editors. This is like driving a drunk to the bar and then complaining about his unseemly behavior. But that's what you get when you mainstream hysterics.

Let's Do It! Let's Raise The Minimum Wage! Your Sunday Morning Conversation	Jason Linkins	| February 23, 2014 9:20 AM ET	Tweet
Read More:
Eat The Press, sunday morning coversation, minimum wage, cbo, unemployment, sunday-morning-liveblog, Income Inequality, Media criticism, congressional budget office, cbo minimum wage, Sunday Morning Talk Shows	This week, the Congressional Budget Office has once again proven itself an able newsmaker, issuing a report scoring the economic impact of a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour. And once again, the CBO has produced a reality-based mixed bag. As HuffPost's Dave Jamieson reported, on the plus side, the increase would "raise the country's collective wages by $31 billion and lift perhaps 900,000 people out of poverty." The downside? The effort would also "likely eliminate an unknown number of jobs, ranging from a "very slight decrease" to as many as 1 million fewer positions. (Most reports split the difference and call it a loss of 500,000 jobs, a figure that many economists still reckon is a bit on the high side.)
The essential spoiler alert for what happened next is best summed up by The Associated Press kicker in its report on the matter: "Democrats say the wage boost would help workers. Republicans have warned it would cost jobs."
The AP's line reverberates with the disaffected tone of one who has seen how these things typically go in Washington, suggesting that here is where the debate goes to die. It doesn't have to be that way! The CBO's study of the minimum wage should catalyze the debate, not end it. At worst, this boils down to a trade-off -- can we afford to sacrifice jobs at this moment in order to give working families an income boost? More realistically, that 500,000-job shortfall may simply be a hurdle, not a wall -- surmountable by combining other policy options.
Unlike the last time we watched a CBO report get tossed into the political fray, conservatives don't have to rely on rhetorical prestidigitation to obscure the difference between a decline in labor supply and a decline in labor demand: The CBO's report on the minimum wage proposal definitely fits with anyone who's looking to get the "#jobkiller" meme trending. This time around, it was Democratic partisans furiously pushing back on the report, proving once again that the good people of the Congressional Budget Office are forever condemned to be the fair-weather BFFs of Beltway policymakers.
If we get beyond the tribal politics, however, this week's CBO report offers a pretty fertile terrain for a debate. Democrats see tremendous virtue in using a federal minimum wage hike to offer a jolt to the working class -- it's essentially a stimulus program that doesn't stem from some new round of purely government spending. Some conservatives argue, however, that minimum wage mechanisms are best left to state governments to manage. It's a reasonable position: State governments have a more intimate awareness of local economic factors, the nature of the workforce, emerging sectors of job growth, and cost-of-living issues. That sort of granular knowledge can potentially enable states to swap out the federal government's hammer with a scalpel, fine-tuning their minimum wage policies with a surgical precision, to better suit their constituents. (Of course, the same logic applies to allowing states to determine the specifics of welfare work-requirement standards, which is why it was mystifying to me to watch the GOP stage a whine-time cabaret when the Obama administration proposed to grant the states this flexibility.)
The CBO report also allows us to revisit a richer, wonkier debate over what should, at this point in our post-crash lives, be prioritized: A push toward full-employment, or an effort to reduce income inequality. It can be argued, of course, that efforts to ameliorate one are served by an effort to ameliorate the other. (Here is Derek Thompson, making that argument.) But the question of whether we should lift 900,000 people out of poverty at the expense of 500,000 jobs is akin to a question that Ezra Klein asked when he embarked on the "unemployment vs. inequality" debate: "Imagine you were given a choice between reducing income inequality by 50 percent and reducing unemployment by 50 percent. Which would you choose?"
Given the chance to choose, I say: Let's raise the minimum wage!
It's not, by any means, a glib decision. We remain in the throes of a severe unemployment crisis. And my thinking is colored by own experiences with long-term unemployment and how harrowing it was to endure. As one of the few people who live within the Beltway who doesn't treat unemployment as if it's a problem that solely bedevils the electoral prospects of wealthy political celebrities, the thought of casting a vote for a policy that could cost a half-million jobs feels a little like I'm distancing myself from my values.
But as Kevin Drum notes, as far as the CBO's ruling on the minimum wage proposal goes, it's "not bad":
In the real world, there's no such thing as a policy that has benefits with zero costs. There are always compromises. In this case, in return for the small job losses, 16 million workers would get a direct wage increase; another 8 million would get an indirect wage increase; and nearly a million workers would be lifted out of poverty. That's about as good as it gets.
And it's also maybe too good to pass up. But what can be done about the political problem posed by that not-insubstantial decrease in labor demand? Is it completely unresolveable? I wonder if, perhaps, the CBO has analyzed any other policy options that could provide the means of offsetting the losses incurred by raising wages? Oh, hey, what's that, Jonathan Chait?
Republicans weeping for the half-million or so jobs that would be destroyed by a higher minimum wage would be shocked to learn that, according to the CBO, they have destroyed 200,000 jobs by blocking the extension of emergency unemployment benefits (which lift the incomes of destitute workers, creating higher demand). Likewise, the budget sequestration they have embraced as their cherished second-term Obama trophy has destroyed 900,000 jobs.
Oh, hey, lookee there! Suddenly there's a path toward getting us back in the black, employment-wise. Extending unemployment benefits claws back a tidy amount of the losses on its own, and provides the added benefit of fewer people starving to death or dying from exposure. And the sequestration should be repealed with all deliberate haste. If you recall, the sequestration was specifically designed to be the stupidest, most America-destroying way possible of cutting the federal budget, the reasoning being that it was so insane and psychotic that the so-called supercommittee would be driven to do anything possible to avoid its enactment. Sadly, that ended up being a historic whoopsie-daisy from the whoopsie-daisiest Congress in living memory. As bad as that is, however, those that now see sequestration as the logical baseline of future budget proposals -- lookin' at you, House Republicans! -- have done the country dirtier. When it comes to job-murderers, they are the most bloodthirsty killers.
Obviously, getting any one of these policy fixes -- let alone all three -- over the goal line is a tough hang. But the possibilities, nevertheless, exist. And so everyone who looks at the CBO's minimum wage report and sees the job losses as a debate-ender needs to calm down. As it turns out, there's more than one way to skin the unemployment-alleviating cat. And as long as you can couple a minimum wage increase with other policies that make eminent sense, and scratch out the downside of the wage increase, I say, keep pressing for the wage increase.
And hey, it looks to me like you can combine policies in such a way that you end up with a net gain of jobs. But you know what? I'm willing to forsake that. As both Josh Barro and Matt Yglesias argue, any raise to the minimum wage that does not feature some adverse effects on the unemployment level is probably not an adequate raise to the minimum wage. So I'm willing to split the baby here: If a combination of policies end up with a net gain in jobs, let's keep on pushing the minimum wage up until we zero it out. Let's make this "employment neutral," and lift even more people out of poverty.
Naturally, there's not a hope in hell that any of this is going to pass Congress anytime soon. President Barack Obama, in pushing for a minimum wage increase that likely won't wend its way to his desk, is of course opening himself up to criticism from the cognitively shortchanged Beltway media. But they miss the point. Right now, there is momentum building for these sorts of wage increases. More than a dozen states have already shifted wages in the right direction. Others may follow. Obama is adding creatine to this scene, facilitating change in a favorable environment.
The White House's allies have, in the immediate wake of the CBO's findings, challenged the downsides to the report. It's perhaps understandable -- that does seem to be the default setting whenever a CBO report doesn't offer everyone modest increases in both peaches and cream. But remember, the CBO reports economic projections, not economic destinies. So, rather than pretend that this wage-for-jobs trade-off can be reasoned out of existence, they should embrace the trade-off and set themselves to the challenge of offering the means by which those job losses are pared down. Doing so would set this minimum wage discussion, already brimming with momentum, on a reasonable, sensible, and responsible path. Ordinary Americans worry about wages, but they're just as worried about joblessness. So if you believe they deserve an income boost, then they deserve concern and consideration as well.
And hey, why not be nice to the CBO for a change? Jeez, that Douglas Elmendorf guy looks like he could use a hug.

"I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER DRINK THE WATER...I AM TOO SCARED": CNN's Brian Stelter calls the Elk River chemical spill an "outrageous example" of the media grotesquely under-covering a story. True, true! So here's The Guardian's Suzanne Goldberg with an object lesson in how to do it. Goldberg traveled to West Virginia and offers several first-person accounts of what it's like to have your water supply poisoned by unaccountable chemical companies. WANT SOME JOE STIGLITZ TALKING ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY?: Here's some Joe Stiglitz talking about income inequality: "The basic point that I raised a half-decade ago was that, in a fundamental sense, the U.S. economy was sick even before the crisis: it was only an asset-price bubble, created through lax regulation and low interest rates, that had made the economy seem robust. Beneath the surface, numerous problems were festering: growing inequality; an unmet need for structural reform (moving from a manufacturing-based economy to services and adapting to changing global comparative advantages); persistent global imbalances; and a financial system more attuned to speculating than to making investments that would create jobs, increase productivity, and redeploy surpluses to maximize social returns."
If you've got a story you want to share on Sunday, feel free to drop me a line!
"SHE'S LIKE NUCLEAR ENERGY": Protestors in Kiev won a surprise concession Friday -- the freedom of opposition figure Yulia Tymoshenko, who's been in prison for more than two years. "So," you may be asking yourself, "what's her whole deal?" Here's a 2010 profile of Tymoshenko from Julia Ioffe to answer that question.
LOOKING AT YOU, JAMIE DIMON: Does it ever seem to you like the world's elites get to screw up and screw up and break rules and ruin lives and back insane wars forever and ever without consequence, while those who critique these failures have to somehow manage to be perfect in every way to avoid being completely delegitimized? Conor Friedersdorf is feeling you: For some reason, the press is complicit in a system by which groups challenging elites are deemed unserious due to the presence of any incompetent or radical fringe ... whereas, say, presiding over 9/11, and then responding with a radical program of torture and a catastrophic war gets a president reelected and celebrated; and a Wall Street meltdown is followed by a bailout and record bonuses. To be taken seriously, those who critique elites must be without flaws, whereas the elites themselves are forgiven their most egregious errors in judgment.
This would be a pretty good time to send people to this Felix Salmon piece: "The JP Morgan apologists of CNBC."
THIS WEEK IN RACE-BASED SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS THAT WILL NOT RESTORE YOUR FAITH IN HUMANITY: Fun fact: "Whites committed 64 percent of motor vehicle theft in 2011." So when the Simple Misfits gang took to the streets, and simulated a car being broken into -- first by a white guy and then by a black guy -- how long do you think it took for the cops to be called in each case? SPOILER HINT: Those of you hoping for some sort of early-M. Night Shyamalan twist ending are going to be super-disappointed.
TRUTH BOMBING THE 1990s: While I think you should fear the people who tell you that they "like, TOTALLY identify with Holden Caulfield" more, the people who admit to being able to relate to the characters of 1994 indie film "Reality Bites," have always seemed almost as worrisome. Well, Jezebel's Lindy West rewatched the movie recently and can confirm these suspicions, concluding that the movie is a "Manual For Shitheads." So I guess the '90s weren't perfect after all. (I've always been a little bit "meh" on Bret Easton Ellis, too, if you want to know the God's honest truth.)

A Journey Inside Wall Street's Most Secret Society	Jason Linkins	| February 19, 2014 4:36 PM ET	Tweet
Read More:
HuffPost live, Eat The Press, wall street culture, books, hpl, kevin roose, young money, video, The One Percent, Wall Street, finance, financial crisis, Kappa Beta Phi	When Kevin Roose of New York magazine snuck into the 80th annual dinner of Wall Street secret society Kappa Beta Phi, he wasn't simply trying to see if he could become the first reporter ever to infiltrate one of Wall Street's most tightly guarded gatherings. (Though let's face it, that's pretty baller.) Roose had other motivations -- namely, concern for the eight young finance industry workers he had come to know while writing his new book, Young Money: Inside the Hidden World Of Wall Street's Post-Crash Recruits.
Young Money follows these eight bright minds as they navigate the often perilous world of high finance, and documents the extent to which the industry inculcates its own bespoke culture in entry-level employees. As Roose admits, "one question that proved stubbornly elusive was what happened to Wall Streeters as they climbed the ladder to adulthood." Crashing the Kappa party, by his reckoning, was a good way to "see these barons in their natural environment" and "understand the world my young subjects were stepping into."
While the Kappas will do little to disabuse you of the notion that Wall Street is a realm of superficiality and excess, Roose's "young subjects" might convince you otherwise. In Young Money, they struggle against the day-to-day grind and with their own consciences, nagged by the sense that they could be doing something productive with their lives, were they not caught up in what Roose calls Wall Street's "cultural contagion."
Roose joined HuffPost Live to talk about his book. Check out the interview in the video above, or click here to watch the full clip.
