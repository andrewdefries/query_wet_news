Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday blamed banks for slowing the recovery and keeping unemployment high.
Despite hundreds of billions in dollars in taxpayer bailouts, the nation's banks have dramatically reduced their lending this year.
"Banks' reluctance to lend will limit the ability of some businesses to expand and hire," Bernanke said. "Because smaller businesses account for a significant portion of net employment gains during recoveries, limited credit could hinder job growth."
Bernanke predicted that the unemployment rate will get worse before it gets better. "The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly," Bernanke told several hundred people in suits crowded into a midtown Manhattan hotel ballroom.
"Access to credit remains strained for borrowers who are particularly dependent on banks," Bernanke said. "Bank lending has contracted sharply this year...[and] banks continue to tighten the terms on which they extend credit for most kinds of loans."
Bernanke also touched on "too big to fail." While some, like Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Penn.) and Bank of England Governor Mervyn King, have said that big banks should be broken up, Bernanke said in response to a question, that "making banks smaller isn't going to do it." Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker and former Citigroup chairman and co-CEO John Reed, among others, have advocated for some sort of restoration of the Glass-Steagall act -- the Depression-era law that kept commercial banks and investment banks separate. That, too, would result in the breakup of the biggest banks. But Bernanke said that such a move "would not be constructive."
The assortment of Wall Street bankers and titans who make up the Economic Club of New York listened to Bernanke deliver his speech as they dined on herb-roasted grilled chicken breast in a mushroom cabernet reduction with goat cheese and mesclun greens.

The president still seems curiously hamstrung by his Herbert Hoover-like devotion to fiscal rectitude: he wants to spend but not add "one dime to the deficit."	Les Leopold: Goldman Sachs does God's Will while 49 Million go Hungry

NEW YORK — Citigroup said Friday its second-quarter net income dropped 10 percent to $2.7 billion even as its losses from failed loans fell. The drop in income reflects the bank's sale a year ago of the Smith Barney brokerage, which inflated its earnings at the time.
Citigroup Inc. joined JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. in reporting earnings that rose in the April-June period as loan losses fell. That's a positive sign for the economy, because it indicates that consumers are having an easier time paying their debts. But Citigroup, like the other banks, also had a decline in trading revenue because of the stock market's plunge this spring.
All three companies surpassed analysts' earnings forecasts, but investors were uneasy about the future, especially since Congress has just passed the banking industry overhaul bill. The bill is raising questions for investors about how banks will make money if their ability to trade is hampered by new regulations. Banking stocks helped lead the overall stock market sharply lower.
Citigroup was among the hardest hit banks by the financial crisis of 2008, and it was further hurt as many customers fell behind in loan payments during the recession. The bank's second-quarter losses from failed loans fell 31 percent to $7.96 billion from $11.47 billion a year ago.
Despite the improving trend, CEO Vikram Pandit remained cautious about future growth, saying in a statement that "economic conditions remain challenging."
Like JPMorgan, Citigroup also removed some money from its reserves for future loan losses, which helps boost earnings. It's also an indication that the bank is becoming more confident that the worst of the defaults is over and that delinquency and default levels are likely to shrink in the coming quarters.
Citigroup removed $1.51 billion from its loss reserves during the quarter. A year earlier, the bank added $4 billion to those reserves.
John Gerspach, Citi's chief financial officer, said during a conference call with reporters that reserves could be released in future quarters as well if credit trends continue to improve.
Loan losses have dropped four straight quarters, and Gerspach said he was particularly encouraged by a slowdown in new delinquencies in the credit card business.
"It's a business I'd expect to get back on its feet through 2011," Gerspach said of Citi's big credit card lending division. He wasn't as optimistic that delinquencies from mortgages would drop as fast as those from credit cards.
Jeff LaFrance, a banking analyst at Gradient Analytics, said the trend of shrinking losses should continue, which puts Citigroup in a good position to continue to release reserves. That in turn, will be a keep to profitability going forward, particularly if investment banking and trading revenues continue to falter.
"The trend is there for continued improvement in loan quality," LaFrance said.
The stock market's second-quarter slump sent Citigroup's revenue from its securities and banking division down 11 percent from a year earlier to $6 billion. That was down 26 percent from the first quarter.
The weak market raises doubts about whether trading revenues will return in the third quarter, said Alois Pirker, research director at Aite Group. Still, Pirker said the second quarter was a strong one for Citigroup and noted the improving credit quality is a big boost for the bank.
"It's very positive overall," Pirker said.
Investors, though, didn't agree. The drop in trading profits at Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase raised questions about banks' ability to make big profits if trading is curtailed by new government regulations in the coming years. Citigroup dropped 16 cents, or 4 percent, to $4 in afternoon trading as the broader market fell.
Citigroup said it earned $2.7 billion, or 9 cents per share, during the April-June period. That compares with $3 billion, or 49 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. The year-ago period's profit was inflated because Citigroup recorded an after-tax gain of $6.7 billion during the quarter from the sale of a majority stake in Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley.
Analysts forecast the bank would earn 5 cents per share.
Total revenue fell 33 percent to $22.07 billion from $33.1 billion during the year-ago period. Citigroup's revenue fell just short of the $22.16 billion analysts had forecast.
Citigroup received $45 billion in government bailout money during the 2008 financial crisis. The company repaid $20 billion of the money late last year and the rest was converted into common stock. At the time Citigroup repaid the $20 billion, the government said it would sell the $25 billion in stock by the end of 2010.
Earlier this month, the government said it has now sold a total of 2.6 billion shares at a profit. It still owns 5.1 billion shares.
During the credit crisis, Citigroup split its operations into two divisions as part of its plan to return to profitability.
Citigroup Holdings, which holds assets the company decided to sell including its worst-performing loans, lost $1.21 billion during the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $1.22 billion last year. The year-ago figures includes the gain from the sale of Smith Barney.
Profit in the Citicorp division, the unit that operates its primary businesses which are considered fundamental to future growth, rose 17 percent to $3.78 billion during the second quarter.

By GENARO ARMAS, Associated Press
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- An emergency meeting of the Penn State Board of Trustees was held late Sunday in the wake of an announcement that criminal charges had been filed against former defense coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who's accused of sexually assaulting eight boys over 15 years, and two top university officials.
Board members, including university Vice President Damon Sims, declined to comment to reporters after the meeting. About half the board members were present, while others joined in by phone.
Sandusky, once considered football coach Joe Paterno's heir apparent, retired in 1999 but continued to use the school's facilities for his work with The Second Mile, a foundation he established to help at-risk kids. The grand jury investigation also resulted in perjury charges against Tim Curley, Penn State's athletic director, and Gary Schultz, vice president for finance and business. They were accused of failing to alert police - as required by state law - of their investigation of the allegations.
"This is a case about a sexual predator who used his position within the university and community to repeatedly prey on young boys," state Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday.
Paterno, who last week became the coach with the most wins in Division I football history, wasn't charged, and the grand jury report didn't appear to implicate him in wrongdoing.
In a statement issued Sunday night, Paterno said he was shocked, saddened and surprised as everyone else to hear of the charges.
"If this is true we were all fooled, along with scores of professionals trained in such things, and we grieve for the victims and their families. They are in our prayers," Paterno said in a statement issued by his son, Scott.
Under Paterno's four-decades-and-counting stewardship, the Nittany Lions became a bedrock in the college game, and fans packed the stadium in State College, a campus town routinely ranked among America's best places to live and nicknamed Happy Valley. Paterno's teams were revered both for winning games - including two national championships - and largely steering clear of trouble. Sandusky, whose defenses were usually anchored by tough-guy linebackers - hence the moniker "Linebacker U" - spent three decades at the school. The charges against him cover the period from 1994 to 2009.
Sandusky, 67, was arrested Saturday and released on $100,000 bail after being arraigned on 40 criminal counts. Curley, 57, and Schultz, 62, were expected to turn themselves in on Monday in Harrisburg.
The allegations against Sandusky, who started The Second Mile in 1977, range from sexual advances to touching to oral and anal sex. The young men testified before a state grand jury that they were in their early teens when some of the abuse occurred; there is evidence even younger children may have been victimized. Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola said his client has been aware of the accusations for about three years and has maintained his innocence.
"He's shaky, as you can expect," Amendola told WJAC-TV after Sandusky was arraigned. "Being 67 years old, never having faced criminal charges in his life and having the distinguished career that he's had, these are very serious allegations."
A preliminary hearing scheduled for Wednesday would likely be delayed, Amendola said. Sandusky is charged with multiple counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, corruption of minors, endangering the welfare of a child, indecent assault and unlawful contact with a minor, as well as single counts of aggravated indecent assault and attempted indecent assault.
The first case to come to light was a boy who met Sandusky when he was 11 or 12, the grand jury said. The boy received expensive gifts and trips to sports events from Sandusky, and physical contact began during his overnight stays at Sandusky's home, jurors said. Eventually, the boy's mother reported the allegations of sexual assault to his high school, and Sandusky was banned from the child's school district in Clinton County in 2009. That triggered the state investigation that culminated in charges Saturday.
But the report also alleges much earlier instances of abuse and details failed efforts to stop it by some who became aware of what was happening.
Another child, known only as a boy about 11 to 13, was seen by a janitor pinned against a wall while Sandusky performed oral sex on him in fall 2000, the grand jury said.
And in 2002, Kelly said, a graduate assistant saw Sandusky sexually assault a naked boy, estimated to be about 10 years old, in a team locker room shower. The grad student and his father reported what he saw to Paterno, who immediately told Curley, prosecutors said.
Curley and Schultz met with the graduate assistant about a week and a half later, Kelly said.
"Despite a powerful eyewitness statement about the sexual assault of a child, this incident was not reported to any law enforcement or child protective agency, as required by Pennsylvania law," Kelly said.
There's no indication that anyone at school attempted to find the boy or follow up with the witness, she said.
Curley denied that the assistant had reported anything of a sexual nature, calling it "merely `horsing around,'" the 23-page grand jury report said. But he also testified that he barred Sandusky from bringing children onto campus and that he advised Penn State President Graham Spanier of the matter.
The grand jury said Curley was lying, Kelly said, adding that it also deemed portions of Schultz's testimony not to be credible.
Schultz told the jurors he also knew of a 1998 investigation involving sexually inappropriate behavior by Sandusky with a boy in the showers the football team used.
But despite his job overseeing campus police, he never reported the 2002 allegations to any authorities, "never sought or received a police report on the 1998 incident and never attempted to learn the identity of the child in the shower in 2002," the jurors wrote. "No one from the university did so."
Lawyers for both Curley and Schultz issued statements saying they are innocent of all charges.
In response to a request for comment from Paterno, a spokesman for the athletic department said Saturday that all such questions would be referred to university representatives, who released a statement from Spanier calling the allegations against Sandusky "troubling" and adding that Curley and Schultz had his unconditional support.
He predicted they will be exonerated.
"I have known and worked daily with Tim and Gary for more than 16 years," Spanier said. "I have complete confidence in how they handled the allegations about a former university employee."
Sandusky, once considered a potential successor to Paterno, drew up the defenses for the Nittany Lions' national-title teams in 1982 and 1986. The team is enjoying another successful run this season; at 8-1, Penn State is ranked No. 16 in the AP Top 25 and is the last undefeated squad in Big Ten play. The Nittany Lions were off Saturday.
As the head football coach, Paterno has spent years cultivating a reputation for putting integrity ahead of modern college-sports economics. It's a notion that has benefited Penn State's marketing and recruiting efforts over the decades and one that the Big Ten school's alumni proudly tout years after they leave.

WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida endorsed Mitt Romney as the party's presidential nominee Wednesday night, saying it's increasingly clear that Romney will win the nomination and that continuing the primary fight will only damage the effort to defeat President Barack Obama.
Rubio, a freshman senator and tea party favorite, said he's convinced that Romney will govern as a conservative and will be superior to Obama as a president.
"The quicker we can get this campaign on that focus – focused on the president's record, on the alternative that we offer – the better off we're going to be as a movement but also the better off the country's going to be," Rubio said during an interview with Fox News Channel.
Rubio had pledged to stay neutral in the race. But on Wednesday he said a floor fight over the nomination at the party convention in August would be "a recipe to deliver four more years to Barack Obama."
Rubio's endorsement followed that of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and came a day before former President George H.W. Bush was to back Romney – additional signs that more and more party leaders are falling in line behind Romney rather than Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich or Ron Paul. Gingrich has scaled back his campaign, saying he wants to focus on winning the nomination at the convention if Romney fails to win enough delegates during the primary race.
Rubio has been mentioned as a potential running mate on the GOP ticket. He told Fox News that his heart, mind and focus remain on the Senate and said he doubts he would be asked to join a Romney ticket.

Black Voices News
It's difficult to imagine cooler parents than Jay-Z and Beyonce, who welcomed baby Blue Ivy Carter into the world in January. Even the most jaded teen would presumably be a little excited to see dad hosting star-studded club openings or mom gracing the cover of People magazine's "Most Beautiful" issue.
But in a clip from Oprah's "Master Class: Special Edition," airing Sunday on OWN, the dapper dad modestly suggests his darling daughter will one day cringe as every other kid does at their parents' behavior.
"Everyone imagines they'll be a great dad until their [kids are] teenagers, saying 'Get away from me, Dad. You're embarrassing me,'" he said. Jay added that he plans to draw on parenting wisdom gleaned from experiences with his own family. "I imagine I'll take things I learned from my mom and things I've learned from raising my nephews and apply that," he said. "Then at the end of the day, I just know I'll probably have the worst, spoiled little kid ever." Hopefully, that won't be the case for Blue -- though the 4-month-old has already been showered with some lavish gifts, including a $1,029 stroller from Gwyneth Paltrow, a Bob Marley onesie from Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland and an iPod filled with tunes specially curated by Roots drummer Questlove.
Take a look back at Beyonce's pregnancy:

Style News
Drama reigned supreme at the amfAR Cinema Against AIDS Gala 2012 at the Cannes film festival on Wednesday night. Co-chaired by Alec Baldwin, the annual gala sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS Research includes a live auction and runway show to benefit the charity.
Fashion-wise, the theme of Cannes' biggest night was drama, drama, drama as glammed-up celebs sashayed several bold dresses down the red carpet, including Jessie J's cutout red leopard Louis Heal dress, Kate Upton's navy peplum that seemed to be reproducing its way down her body in real time, and Kirsten Dunst's multi-layered Louis Vuitton confection. Diane Kruger and Joshua Jackson continued their Cannes takeover, with Kruger in beautiful white Chanel. Heidi Klum popped up in fringed silver Marchesa, and Milla Jovovich looked fittingly space-age in her structured gold Atelier Versace gown.
amfAR's event has raised more than $70 million for AIDS research since launching in Cannes in 1993. This year's gala included an all-black fashion show staged by Carine Roitfeld.
Check out the pics below -- we'll keep updating with more slides and fashion credits!

Crime News
Jeffrey Cutlip is a registered sex offender. On July 23, he also confessed to the murders of two victims dating back over 30 years.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Police in Oregon say a 63-year-old man called authorities in Texas and confessed to two Portland homicides in the 1970s.
Portland detectives arrested Jeffrey Paul Cutlip over the weekend in Brownsville, Texas. Police said he admitted his involvement in two slayings – one in 1975, the other in 1977. Authorities haven't released the names of the victims or other information about the crimes.
Cutlip is being held in the Cameron County Jail awaiting extradition to Portland.
Oregon Department of Corrections records show Cutlip has spent most of the past three decades behind bars, in and out of prison for crimes including sodomy, burglary and robbery. He was required to register as a sex offender following a 1982 sodomy conviction. Records say he targets female strangers using threats and weapons.

Politics News
WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he thinks that 10,000 U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan after 2014, when President Barack Obama wants to withdraw most combat troops. McConnell has just finished a visit to Afghanistan with a small group of his fellow Republican senators, his seventh trip there in the past decade. "I think we're going to need a minimum of about 10,000 troops here to provide adequate training and counterterrorism in the post-2014 period. And we anticipate there'll be forces from other countries who will remain here beyond 2014 as well," McConnell told reporters on a conference call during a stop in Italy after leaving Afghanistan. McConnell said he met with military officials including General John Allen, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, during his trip and that the officials felt the Afghans would be able to handle their own security after 2014 if there was a "residual" force that could be involved in training and counterterrorism. "This is the first time I've come back from Afghanistan with a feeling of genuine optimism," McConnell said. Obama and visiting Afghan President Hamid Karzai agreed on Friday to speed up the handover of combat operations in Afghanistan to Afghan forces, raising the prospect of an accelerated U.S. withdrawal from the country and underscoring Obama's determination to wind down a long, unpopular war. The Obama administration has been considering a residual force of between 3,000 and 9,000 troops - far fewer than some U.S. commanders propose. Republicans had cautioned the administration against allowing anything other than conditions on the ground and security concerns to dictate the pace of the U.S. withdrawal. On Monday, McConnell repeated what he said was strong praise for the Afghan forces from military officials he had met with. "There's a widely held view that the Afghan National Army is definitely coming up to speed, that these are tough fighters who'll be able to deal with the Taliban or any other internal threats in the future and also rising optimism that the Afghan local police will be an effective force as well," he said.

Entertainment News
Back in November, Kanye West made the statement "Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people," during a radio interview, drawing a number of anti-semitic accusations. A few days ago (Dec. 18), West stopped by Chicago's B96 station and addressed his comment, calling it an "ignorant compliment."
"I don’t know how being told that you have money is like an insult," Kanye continued. "That would be like if somebody complimented black guys and said, ‘All black guys have big penises.’ You don’t want to be the black guy who raises his hand and says like, ‘That’s not true. I have proof!’"
To hear more about the artists Kanye wants to collaborate with and details on Kanye's upcoming Adidas line, you can listen to the full interview here.

'People Look At Me ... Like I'm Hitler'Kanye's latest gone-too-far remark? "I walk through the hotel and I walk down the street, and people look at me like I'm (expletive) insane, like I'm Hitler," he said while performing at The Big Chill concert in the UK on August 6. "One day the light will shine through and one day people will understand everything I ever did."
We're not positive, but we're pretty sure referencing Adolf Hitler isn't the way to get <em>more</em> people to understand you.'Yo Taylor, I'm Really Happy For You, And I'mma Let You Finish...''It was the VMA acceptance speech heard 'round the world -- and it wasn't even by the intended recipient. When Taylor Swift won the 2009 VMA for Best Female Video, it was only a matter of seconds before Kanye West jumped up on stage to declare Beyonce the real winner in his eyes.'But Beyonce Had One Of The Best Videos Of All Time!'The defeated look on Swift's face and Beyonce's embarrassed/confused reaction was all caught on live TV during the MTV telecast.Going RogueWhen producers booked Kanye as a celebrity guest for a Hurricane Katrina Relief telethon, they had no idea he would use the opportunity to diss President Bush. But he did, going so far as to say, "George Bush hates black people." In November 2010, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/02/george-bush-kanye-racist_n_777967.html" target="_hplink">Bush revealed in an NBC interview</a> that West's remark was the worst moment of his presidency.Dissing The PresidentIt's a cringe-worthy moment, for sure, but Mike Myer's on-camera uncomfortableness during West's tirade tops it all. Kanye vs. Matt LauerIn November 2010, West sat down with Matt Lauer on "The Today Show" to discuss <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/02/george-bush-kanye-racist_n_777967.html" target="_hplink">Bush's reaction to his remarks during the Hurricane Katrina telethon</a>. While West carefully chose his words, he turned an ordinary interview into a quasi-feud with Lauer when he brought up his VMA outburst.
"Yo I really wonder if Matt Lauer thought that s*** was cool to play the "MTV" clip when I was speaking about Bush?" <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KanyeWest" target="_hplink">West tweeted</a>.
West cancelled his "Today Show" performance after the fallout from the interview.Sore LoserKanye West was all smiles before the 2007 VMAs and appeared onstage with fellow rapper 50 Cent (above). But after being nominated for five Moon Men and walking away with empty-handed, West was quite vocal about his disappointment, reportedly yelling backstage that he would "<a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1569313/kanye-west-hell-never-return-mtv-report.jhtml" target="_hplink">never return to MTV.</a>"Caught On Tape...And that backstage outburst was caught on tape. Yikes.Not Helping The CauseWhile performing at a 2005 Live 8 concert in Philadelphia, Kanye <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1922188_1922187_1923051,00.html" target="_hplink">reportedly referenced AIDS as a "man-made disease"</a> that was "placed in Africa just like crack was placed in the black community to break up the Black Panthers." Blame It On The AlcoholWhen Kanye lost the Best Video award to Justice at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards, he decided to voice his opinion on the matter. Instead of taking the news of his loss quietly, West jumped up on stage to spew a profanity-filled tirade about how his video for "Touch The Sky" should have won instead.
West later blamed his outburst on booze. "I had a little sippy sippy," <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1544794/kanye-had-sippy-sippy-before-emas.jhtml" target="_hplink">he told MTV UK</a>, adding he planned to continue drinking after the show.

There are only a few more days left at New York Fashion Week and we were beginning to think our favorite style star, Solange Knowles, would never show up on the scene. But low and behold, the singer/model/BFF-in-our-head stepped out on Day 5 of NYFW looking fabulous per usual. And in true fashionista style, Solange switched up her outfit for each show she attended. From a bold, color-blocked ensemble to her signature halo of hair, there was plenty for our style-loving hearts to adore. Here's a look at the star in all her New York Fashion Week glory!Solange at Noon By Noor

It's pretty clear the most disgruntled man in Washington 15 days ago was Paul Volcker. He had been pounding the table to bring back Glass Steagall since Thanksgiving, and had been consistently ignored by the Obama administration. He clearly stated the only invention worth a damn to come from the banking system in the last 20 years was the ATM machine.
Mr. Voclker, the man who was Chairman of the Federal Reserve under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, is an old fashioned banker, one of the few men who could bring our system back into line. But he had become a Cabinet outcast, the 12th man on the deal team, and I even heard rumors he threatened to walk. Until last week, when he suddenly leap-frogged the teacher's pets Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Larry Summers, Head of the White House Economic Team. This stalwart supporter of Obama during the election, with more experience than Geithner and Summers combined, was suddenly heard like a Confederate artillery shell at the Battle of Antietem.
Obama's proposal is expected to restrict the size of large financial institutions, stopping them from becoming so large they put the broader economy at risk, and distort normal competitive forces -- kind of why Glass-Steagall existed in the first place. These banks are not too big to fail. They're too big to succeed. They're too big to be managed. And they're too big to compete with.
For the first time publicly, the President started to endorse the Princeton-educated Paul Volcker, who wants to place restrictions on proprietary trading by commercial banks, essentially limiting the way banks can gamble with their own capital. Administration officials say they want to place "firewalls" between different divisions of financial companies, to ensure banks don't indirectly subsidize "speculative" trading through other subsidiaries that hold federally insured deposits.
Mr. Volcker also stands against banks owning hedge funds and private equity shops. The proposals are intended to go even further, separating all customer-focused investment banking activities, such as advisory services, securities underwriting and brokerage, from proprietary trading.
The clowns running Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) risked depositor money by investing over $250 billion in mortgage backed securities, much of it in off balance sheet SIVs, rolling the dice and leaving Uncle Sam to hold the bag. These two behemoth institutions crippled the banking system more than most people know; but Volcker knows. He joined the Treasury Department nearly fifty years ago in 1962. There is nothing he doesn't know.
But the most vexing action by the administration in the last 10 days concerning the "Crisis Responsibility Fee" and the "Volcker Rule" is the perception that GM, Fannie Mae (FNM), Freddie Mac (FNM), and AIG all seem to get a free pass relative to the big changes coming to Wall Street. They didn't own any hedge funds or private equity firms and they still managed to lose billions.
We have never seen results from the infamous Spring Stress Test, even though, as taxpayers, we're footing the bill on the bailout. Citigroup and Bank of America were both insolvent in November 2008 and during the March 2009 lows. If you look at their recent earnings, you'll see they're bleeding out the truth, because they and our government think the markets, like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, can't handle the truth.
This could be the genesis of the Volcker Rule. This administration will do anything to stop us revisiting the financial abyss of 2008, and now, the man who ended the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, has finally been heard.

We all try to do the right thing. Time and again, I will ask people, "which is healthier, an apple or a Snickers bar?" There isn't much confusion. As tempting as the Snickers bar might be, we all know that the apple is the healthier choice. The problem is that we are offered so many choices throughout the day that, if we're not careful, we can be making bad choices without even knowing it.
Take, for example, heading off into a restaurant. There are certain words that we recognize as healthy: salad, smoothie, grilled etc. We hear those words and immediately think, "ah, that's a healthy choice." And we try to teach our kids to recognize the same words as being preferable food choices.
So what happens when it turns out that one of those "healthy" buzz words is actually packing more sugar than you know what to do with? All of the sudden, a healthy snack could turn into two or three days worth of dessert.
Diets that are high in sugar can lead to weight gain and various weigh-related diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. The American Heart Association suggests women should probably keep their sugar intake to 25 grams per day; men to 37.5 grams per day; and children to roughly 6 grams per day.
So Michael and Elle decided to have a look at a very popular smoothie to see how much sugar is in each serving. As Elle mentions, smoothies are drinks with fruit and vegetables -- sounds healthy, right? But have a look and see just how much sugar can be found in these smoothies... and before you watch, take a little guess, knowing what you now know about recommended daily intake.
For more healthy ideas, join the Fitness Guru community on Facebook. And if you have any questions about family health and fitness, shoot me an email at Michael@fitnessgurunyc.com and Elle and I will try to answer it in an upcoming video.
Rock on!!
