Arizona Man Requests For His Execution To Be Delayed Until Jan Brewer Leaves Office

Politics News
PHOENIX -- Attorneys for a death-row inmate set to be put to death in Arizona next week want the execution delayed until the state has a new governor, arguing in a Tuesday filing that Gov. Jan Brewer appointed "political cronies" to a clemency board in an unconstitutional, closed-door process.
In their filing in the Arizona Supreme Court, defense attorneys for death-row inmate Samuel Villegas Lopez argue that he can't receive a fair hearing with the state's clemency board, often an inmate's last chance for mercy before an execution.
Brewer overhauled the board in April, a move that her spokesman Matt Benson said at the time was designed to "bring fresh insight and fresh blood" to the board.
"The Arizona Supreme Court has already found these allegations to be without merit. The latest filing is more of the same," Benson said in statement Tuesday evening. "Governor Brewer appropriately nominated qualified individuals to the Board of Executive Clemency, including a Democrat, and they were properly confirmed by the Arizona Senate. The governor and the Board of Executive Clemency have the right to defend themselves when named in a lawsuit in which spurious and sanctionable allegations are asserted."
In their filing, Lopez's attorneys argued that the new board members are "political cronies" appointed to ensure that they never vote for executions to be delayed or overturned.
The attorneys also argue that the selection committee for the new board members questioned potential members about how they would vote on controversial or high-profile cases in interviews that were closed to the public in violation of open-meetings laws.
"While the Governor may be free to appoint her political cronies to Arizona boards and commissions, and while political patronage may be an accepted part of Arizona government, the law at least requires that those actions be known to the public," the filing said.
"Offensive to any reasonable notion of fairness, this denial of access to the clemency process would not have occurred in the sunlight of public scrutiny," they wrote. "Mr. Lopez must now plead for mercy before a board constituted of a majority of members selected by that process."
Lopez's clemency hearing is set for Friday.
His attorneys also argue that statements made by Benson and newly appointed board Chairman Jesse Hernandez to reporters display clear bias against Lopez and a prejudgment of his request for mercy.
For instance, Benson told The Associated Press last month that defense attorneys were "attempting to further delay justice for the heinous crimes committed by their client 25 years ago."
"Throwing together a host of trumped-up charges against a citizen board does not change that fact," he said.
Hernandez has told the AP that the attorneys were "grandstanding" in filing a lawsuit against Brewer and the board in Maricopa County Superior Court over the new board members.
Hernandez did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
The Arizona Supreme Court already delayed Lopez's execution once, on May 15, to give the new clemency board members time to undergo four weeks of training before they held a hearing about Lopez's fate.
The court granted the delay on the grounds that Lopez was denied a fair chance for clemency because a majority of the board members had not undergone the training. The court rescheduled the May 16 execution for June 27.
Lopez faces a lethal injection at a state prison in Florence for the 1986 murder of Estefana Holmes. The Phoenix woman was raped, robbed and stabbed in what authorities described as a "terrible and prolonged struggle."

This Is Why I Don't like 'Girls'
Lena Kay
Writer and actress
I don't like "Girls." I don't like when it's compared to "Sex And The City," and I don't like hearing that it's the voice of my -- well, not generation, but demographic. And yet, I continue to watch it, mostly due to a prevailing sense that Lena Dunham has put in all those little things I find so irritating to force me to figure out why they irritate me.
Comments (0) Binge vs. Buzz: The Release Model of House of Cards vs. True Detective
Jeremy Wilson
Writer + Creative Strategist
There is no doubt Netflix's strategy of enabling users to binge watch old TV episodes has been successful, but is it the optimal strategy for releasing high profile new content?
Comments (1) Parenthood Season 5, Episode 15 Recap: 'Just Like At Home'
Ashley Spencer
Entertainment editor & reporter
The separation that no one thought would actually happen but is somehow still a thing is at the heart of Parenthood's post-Olympics return.
Comments (1) Mixology Season 1, Episode 2: The Bathing Proposal
Hulu.com
Watchers of Good TV
The hangover could be settling in earlier than expected for ABC's Mixology, the show about what happens to 10 singles over the course of a single night out in New York City.
Comments (0) A 'True Detective'-Inspired Map of America's Most Macabre Murder Cases
Roadtrippers
Discover Your America
There's no denying that human beings have always been predisposed to fascination with the unusual, ugly, and frightening things that hide in the dark corners of the world around us. Unfortunately, not all monsters live in our imagination. This map is an exploration of America's real-life monsters and the detectives who caught them.
Comments (0) 'Grey's Anatomy' 'You Got to Hide Your Love Away' Recap: Yang and Owen Back in the Sack
Karen Fratti
television connoisseur
It all unfolds as the whole crew tries to figure out a rare, tricky tumor in a teenage girl and tend to the nasty leg wounds on another woman who dove into a trash chute to avoid her married boyfriend. Theme of the evening? Love is blind and makes you stupid.
Comments (0) Bach Juan Pablo Recap 10: The Women Tell All (Through Super White Teeth)
Selena Coppock
Standup comedian, storyteller, author
Catherine decided to cut bangs! Their vows said 'till death do us part, but did Sean sign on for BANGS?
Comments (0) 'Grey's' Recap: They're Married
Karen Fratti
television connoisseur
For the record, I thought the cold open montage was delightful. April running off with Jackson, Bailey and Ben fighting, Meredith and Derek and Christina all in room going at it, Shane disappearing after almost killing Karev's dad. Shall I go on?
Comments (3) Sam Witwer on Being Human Cancellation and Tonight's 'Rewind, Rewind'
Aaron Sagers
TV personality, journalist, pundit, geek expert
Over the course of four seasons, the cast has crafted a series with an active social media fan base within the supernatural genre. Under the auspices of showrunner Anna Fricke, they've battled expiration, resurrection, transformation, mutation, and zombification. But now, the show has face its greatest challenge: cancellation.
Comments (5) Evil -- Marvelously Portrayed -- Why Do You Watch House of Cards?
Lloyd I. Sederer, MD
Medical director, New York State Office of Mental Health
While virtue may evoke admiration, evil excites. The Underwoods are like power porn. They flesh out our fantasies. They are a trip into the forbidden in us all.
Comments (1) Dancing With the Stars
Diana Nyad
Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcaster
Some behind-the-scenes snapshots from this morning's Good Morning America announcement of this season's cast of Dancing With The Stars.
Comments (1) The Zoscars (Zombie Oscars)
Stephanie Giese
Stephanie Giese is a mom of three and a former elementary school teacher living in Pennsylvania. She is the blogger behind Binkies and Briefcases and the founder of the BlogU Conference.
I did not watch the majority of the Oscar broadcast because I had better things to do. There were zombies to be killed over on The Walking Dead. It was an entire episode about Daryl! Who cares about the Oscars?
Comments (1) Reality Stars Perpetuate Negative Italian Stereotypes
Dr. Frank Spinelli
Board-certified internist; author, 'Pee-Shy' and 'Advocate Guide to Gay Men's Health and Wellness'
In reality, The Real Housewives of New Jersey and Mob Wives perpetuate the stereotype that Italians are overly tanned, spaghetti-eating people who use an exorbitant amount of hair care products while lying, cheating and stealing in order to achieve the American dream.

It's been one year since we bid adieu to HBO's wonderful "Enlightened." Now is a better time than ever for Netflix to revive the short-lived dramedy.
Comments (10) Anna Hosain: The Women of the Oscars
Anna Hosain
Chief Editor, Illiterat Magazine
The nominated actresses did not receive Oscar nods or the movie role for which they are nominated by wearing designer dresses. They received their accolades because of their talent, their hard work and their tenacity to keep fighting for their space.

Comments (0) ReThink Review: Son of God -- What Would Jesus Watch?
Jonathan Kim
Gentleman farmer, film critic for ReThink Reviews and the Uprising Show
With The Passion of the Christ being the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, are audiences interested in a less bloody take on Jesus' life? And does Son of God attempt to tell us anything about Jesus' life that Christians and non-Christians don't already know?
