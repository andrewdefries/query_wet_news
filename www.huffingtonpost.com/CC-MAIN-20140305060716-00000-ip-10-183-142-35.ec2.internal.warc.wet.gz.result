Grand Junction Sentinel:
Thousands of people have signed off on an online petition seeking a harsh punishment for a Fruita man accused of dragging a dog to death last week on Colorado National Monument.
The petition, "Demand Justice For Buddy," appears on the social networking site Facebook and claimed 2,788 signatures as of noon Sunday. The goal, organizers wrote, was to ensure 37-year-old Steven Clay Romero, the suspect in the Dec. 30 torture and death of a German shepherd mix, "spends every single minute" in federal prison allowed under law and be subject to a maximum fine.

Black Voices News
SANFORD, Fla. — While George Zimmerman is free on bail, the police chief criticized for not charging him after Trayvon Martin's slaying remains under scrutiny, as city commissioners want to wait for the results of a federal investigation to decide if they will accept Chief Bill Lee's resignation.
It could take months before Sanford city commissioners have the information they say they need.
That's because the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to make a thorough analysis of how the city's police department handled the investigation into the Feb. 26 killing of the 17-year-old Martin, including studying when officers arrived to the scene of the shooting to the actions that Lee and other officials took in their ultimate decision not to arrest Zimmerman. Lee remains on paid leave.
"The city commission spoke," city manager Norton Bonaparte said. "They were not ready to have the resignation. So we'll move forward."
Meanwhile, the city needs someone to lead its police department. Mayor Jeff Triplett – one of the three city officials who voted 3-2 Monday not to accept Lee's resignation – said he'd like to see an interim police chief serve before the commission makes a final decision on Lee's proposed resignation.
An interim chief could be hired as early as next week, Bonaparte said. He hedged, however, when he was asked if he thought an interim chief could be effective.
"That'll be up to the community," he said. "It's a challenge. ... We'll move forward to see if we can get a speedy investigation from the United States Department of Justice or some other entities. That's what I heard from the city commission."
Bonaparte presented commissioners with a signed resignation agreement that he prepared with Lee prior to Monday's meeting. Lee stepped down temporarily in March because he said he wanted to let emotions cool in the aftermath of Martin's slaying.
It seemed likely commissioners would sign off on Lee's resignation – after all, they previously gave him a "no confidence vote." Yet the panel decided not to accept the resignation agreement, which would have included four months of severance for Lee. The majority of commissioners said they wanted to wait for the outside investigation to conclude.
The lack of an arrest in the Martin case led to protests across the nation and spurred a debate about race and the laws of self-defense. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is from Peru. Martin was black. The shooting also led to the local prosecutor recusing himself from the case, prompting the governor to appoint special prosecutor Angela Corey, who eventually charged Zimmerman.
The majority of commissioners Monday blamed the polarization over the Martin case and its handling by the police department on outside groups. Lee's supporters wore "Bring Back Billy" T-shirts to the meeting, though there were detractors as well.
"I'm disappointed but not surprised," said Velma Williams, the lone black representative on the commission who voted to accept the resignation.
Earlier Monday, Zimmerman, who slipped out of jail on $150,000 bail in the early morning darkness, went back into hiding and likely fled to another state to avoid threats as he awaits his second-degree murder trial. He has entered a written plea of not guilty.
Martin was unarmed and was walking back to the home of his father's fiancee's home when Zimmerman saw him, called police and began following him. A fight broke out – investigators say it is unknown who started it.
Zimmerman says Martin, who was visiting from Miami, attacked him. Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense, citing Florida's "stand your ground" law, which gives broad legal protection to anyone who says they used deadly force because they feared death or great bodily harm.
Zimmerman was not charged for more than six weeks, sparking nationwide protests.
Even though authorities can pinpoint Zimmerman's location with a GPS ankle bracelet that he must wear round the clock, the public may not see him again for some time. Zimmerman has waived his appearance at his upcoming arraignment next month, so he can stay underground if he wants.
"He's doing well, he's very glad to be out, trying to get settled in, still worried about his safety, but, you know, talking to his family and feeling much better than being in" jail, Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said Monday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360.
O'Mara declined to say if Zimmerman was in Florida, only saying his client will travel to several locations for his safety. O'Mara did not immediately return phone calls Monday by The Associated Press.
The attorney also said on the CNN program that he didn't realize that Martin's family did not want to have Zimmerman apologize at Friday's bail hearing. He denied that the apology was done just to have bail granted for his client.
"Had I known – had George known – the family would not have accepted or didn't want it, we never would have done it," O'Mara said.

MILWAUKEE -- Much of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's (R) time in the final days before Tuesday's recall election has been spent visiting his campaign offices around the state. His final stop on Saturday was at the Wauwatosa Victory Center in Milwaukee, not far from the governor's home. All over the office were signs, stickers, leaflets and other items emblazoned with slogans showing support for Walker. Central to this operation were the volunteers phone banking, giving voters an extra nudge to turn out to the polls for the election. The Huffington Post snapped a photo of the call script, which outlines exactly what volunteers are supposed to say on the phone: Also on HuffPost:	Contribute to this Story: Send us a tip

WorldPost News
ISTANBUL, Sept 14 (Reuters) - The head of the opposition Syrian Supreme Military Council said on Saturday a U.S.-Russian agreement to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons was a blow to the two-and-a-half-year uprising to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. General Selim Idris said the deal would allow Assad to escape being held accountable for killing hundreds of civilians in a poison gas attack on Damascus on Aug. 21. Assad has denied responsibility for the attack. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced the agreement on removing Syria's chemical weapons on Saturday after nearly three days of talks in Geneva. Idris said Assad's forces had started moving some of their chemical weapons to Lebanon and Iraq in the last few days to evade a possible U.N. inspection. The assertion could not be immediately verified. "We have told our friends that the regime has begun moving a part of its chemical weapons arsenal to Lebanon and Iraq. We told them do not be fooled," Idris told reporters in Istanbul. "All of this initiative does not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people. A crime against humanity has been committed and there is not any mention of accountability." Asked if rebel brigades would facilitate the work of any United Nations weapons inspectors, Idris said: "This is very complicated ... If investigators come, we will facilitate the mission. In the regions under our control there are no chemical weapons. I don't know if this will just mean that investigators will pass through the regions that are under rebel control. We are ready." But another military council official, Qassim Saadeddine, said: "Let the Kerry-Lavrov plan go to hell. We reject it and we will not protect the inspectors or let them enter Syria."

Miami, Dec 26 (EFE).- Hispanic children under age 9 whose families own mobile devices or computers use them more than their cohorts in other ethnic groups, according to a study published by the National Institute for Latino Policy Inc.
The report entitled "Media, Technology and Reading in Hispanic Families" was prepared by Northwestern University and the National Center for Families Learning.

18 GeniusesThe MacArthur Fellows Program, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-17/news/mn-4187_1_genius-grants" target="_hplink">nicknamed the "Genius Grant,"</a> is given to U.S. citizens and residents that<a href="http://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/" target="_hplink"> "show exceptional merit and promise of continued creative work."</a> In other words, these individuals are awarded funds not based on their past merits but because they are likely to contribute to the world in a positive way in the future. Currently, 18 Hispanics have received the coveted grant including writer Sandra Cisneros (pictured), cuban-born anthropologist Ruth Behar, and playwright Luis Alfaro. <a href="http://www.sandracisneros.com/macarturos_bios.php" target="_hplink">Check out the full list of these 'MacArturos' and their impressive resumes.</a>Salsa MusicOf course Salsa originates from Cuban rhythms like son and rumba (among others) fused with Puerto Rican, Colombian beats. But the truth is that <a href="http://www.thelatinworld.nl/salsahistory-english.html" target="_hplink">the term "salsa" was born in New York during the 1970's,</a> where Latin American immigrants and musicians came together and brewed this new collective sound that has evolved through the decades. From "nuyorican" Willie Colon to cuban legend Celia Cruz up to present day salsa stars like Marc Anthony -- the genre continues to <em>play</em> an important role in the American music industry. Pun intended. Photo shows: Some of the greatest salsa musicians ever, members of the <a href="http://www.fania.com/content/fania-all-stars">Fania All-Stars</a>, including Yomo Toro, Roberto Roena, Papo Lucca, Adalberto Santiago, Johnny Pacheco, Reynaldo Jorge, Ismael Miranda, Puchi Boulong, Luigi Texidor, Leopoldo Pineda, Hector Lavoe, Ruben Blades, Celia Cruz, Cheo Feliciano and Pete 'El Conde' Rodriguez.Helped Prevent World War IIIThe tension of the Cold War came to a climax during the October 1962 "Cuban Missile Crisis" -- an event that could have very well led to nuclear war. That's when Puerto Rico-born Vice Admiral Horacio Rivero came (or navigated) into the scene. On October 15, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/28/us/adm-horacio-rivero-jr-90-vice-chief-of-naval-operations.html" target="_hplink">Rivero was given command of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's amphibious force</a>, which helped set up the naval blockade in the Caribbean.
Rivero's long career with the U.S. Navy included rising to be the first-Hispanic four-Star Admiral, and serving as the NATO Commander In Chief of Southern Europe and as U.S. Ambassador to Spain during the Nixon administration. What happened to the Dinosaurs?That's right, Hispanics are behind the extinction of dinosaurs -- well, the theory actually. <strong>The Alvarez Hypothesis</strong>
In 1980, physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, (both of Spanish descent) teamed up on an expedition to Italy, where they found a layers of sedimentary rock with high levels of iridium. Long story short, the father-son duo came up with the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/do80di.html" target="_hplink">theory that 65 million years ago an asteroid hit earth and brought about the end of the "terrible lizards"</a>!
Now just think how different your sixth-grade science class would have been if the Alvarez family hadn't answered the giant question on everyone's mind: What happened to the Dinosaurs?
<em><strong>CORRECTION: A previous version of this slide referred to Dinosaurs as "giant lizards" when in fact the <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dinosaur" target="_hplink">term's etymology depicts them as "terrible lizards."</a> </strong></em>
Greatest Hitter Of All TimeYes, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/25-celebrities-you-didnt-know-were-latino_n_1739113.html" target="_hplink">Ted Williams was Hispanic</a>. Williams' mother was Mexican, but truth be told he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/26/sports/baseball/26latino.html?_r=1" target="_hplink">wasn't very vocal about his heritage.</a> <a href="http://tedwilliams.com/index.php?page=hfame&level=1" target="_hplink">As the Baseball Hall Of Fame best put it: </a>
"[Williams'] 521 Home Runs place him 4th on the all time list. There are many who insist that Ted Williams ranks with Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb as the greatest hitters who ever lived. While Ted's life-time figures are taught by only a few, there is no telling to what heights those figures would have reached had he not given nearly 5 full years of his baseball career to the US Marines."
A legendary baseball player and a U.S. Marine... need we say more?Latin American CuisineThe brand that brings you all your Latin American guilty pleasures--otherwise nearly impossible to find in the United States--Goya Foods is the largest hispanic owned food company in the United States.
What started as a small Lower Manhattan business set up by Spanish-Puerto Rican Immigrant Prudencio Unanue Ortiz now <a href="http://www.goya.com/english/about.html" target="_hplink">distributes over 1,500 products originating from every corner of Latin American.</a> If you grew up watching Spanish-language TV, you never forgot their slogan, '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxPj-wsbUU&feature=share&list=PL2C02C6C0985BAE82">Si es Goya, tiene que ser bueno</a>.'
In 2012, Goya Food partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture and First Lady Michelle Obama in promoting healthy eating and wellness with the "My Plate" or "Mi Plato" program. Coolest Iconic Christmas Song<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=xMtuVP8Mj4o" target="_hplink">Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad, Prospero Año Y Felicidad</a>
These are iconic lyrics to Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano's Christmas songs, a tune that has warmed the hearts of U.S. Hispanics and non-Hispanics alike during the season of giving season. But perhaps these first verses sound a little mumbled when sung by non-Spanish speakers, who clearly and loudly belt out the song's second part in English. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=xMtuVP8Mj4o" target="_hplink">I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart.</a>

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said now's not the time to fight against Obamacare.In an interview with the St. Cloud Times, Bachmann elaborated on comments she made earlier this month to the Washington Post, when she said "most of us don't think it's the time to fight."“Obamacare is in effect now," Bachmann told the St. Cloud Times. "Sometimes a political fight is ripe, and sometimes it isn’t. And the Obamacare political fight isn't ripe right now on the debt ceiling.”Bachmann said 2013's debt limit showdown "was our last chance" to fight against Obamcare before it went into effect.“We needed to keep fighting until the last possible opportunity, and that’s what that vote was about," Bachmann said.Bachmann has been one of the most vocal critics of Obamacare. In November 2013, she said she and other Republicans considered suing Obama for asking health insurance companies to allow individuals whose plans had been canceled due to the Affordable Care Act to renew them for a year.Read more at the St. Cloud Times.

'I Haven't Had A Gaffe'Bachmann raised some eyebrows in November 2011 when she claimed she'd never "had a gaffe."
"As people are looking at the candidate that is the most conservative and the most consistent candidate, I've been that candidate. I haven't had a gaffe or something that I've done that has caused me to fall in the polls," Bachmann told Greta van Susteren in a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/2011/11/18/bachmann-solyndral-scandal-criminal-and-gangster-government" target="_hplink">Fox News interview</a>.
The claim was interesting considering her <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/27/michele-bachmann-john-wayne_n_885368.html" target="_hplink">knack</a> for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/16/michele-bachmanns-elvis-birthday_n_928454.html" target="_hplink">making</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/15/michele-bachmann-revolutionary-war-gaffe_n_836025.html" target="_hplink">misstatements</a>.President Of Iran A 'Hater'During a campaign stop in Iowa, Bachmann responded to accusations from Ron Paul that she "hates Muslims."
"I don't hate Muslims," Bachman said. "I love the American people. And as president of United States, my goal would be to keep the American people safe, free and sovereign."
"The haters are the president of Iran," she said, referring to Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. "He stated unequivocally that given a nuclear weapons he will use that weapon to wipe Israel off the map, and he's willing to use it against the United States of America."HPV ClaimsEarly in the Republican presidential race, Bachmann attacked rival Rick Perry for his 2007 executive order mandating that young girls receive the vaccine against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease that is the leading cause of cervical cancer.
She even made the claim that the vaccine could cause mental retardation. However, she <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/22/michele-bachmann-rick-perry-hpv-vaccine_n_977139.html" target="_hplink">distanced herself</a> from the statement after receiving criticism from medical professionals who believe the vaccine is very safe.
"I didn't make that claim, nor did I make that statement," Bachmann said. "Immediately after a debate a mother came up to me, and she was visibly shaken and heartbroken because of what her daughter had gone through. I only related what her story was."Many Scientists Believe In Intelligent DesignIn October of 2006, before Bachmann emerged as a superstar of the conservative movement, the Minnesota congresswoman raised eyebrows when she <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Damah0KH-Co&feature=player_embedded" target="_hplink">suggested</a> that a sizable portion of the scientific community discredits the theory of evolution. Bachmann <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/102109/Top_ten_Michele_Bachmann_moments" target="_hplink">said</a>, "There are hundreds and hundreds of scientists, many of them holding Nobel Prizes, who believe in intelligent design."
More recently, Bachmann <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/17/michele-bachmann-intelligent-design-evolution_n_879618.html" target="_hplink">discussed</a> her views on the matter at this year's Republican Leadership Conference. "I support intelligent design," she told reporters at the conservative gathering, <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/17/bachmann-schools-should-teach-intelligent-design/" target="_hplink">according</a> to CNN. "What I support is putting all science on the table and then letting students decide. I don't think it's a good idea for government to come down on one side of scientific issue or another, when there is reasonable doubt on both sides."Warning Of 'Sex Clinics'During the long road to health care reform in the fall of 2009, Bachmann took to the House floor to warn members of congress that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/01/bachmann-sex-clinics-will_n_306292.html" target="_hplink">"sex clinics"</a> could result from passing legislation that was under debate at the time. The Tea Party favorite suggested that if reform were to pass, schools might begin offering abortions to students given her interpretation that the measure was designed to bring Planned Parenthood into educational facilities:
<blockquote>The bill goes on to say what's going to go on -- comprehensive primary health services, physicals, treatment of minor acute medical conditions, referrals to follow-up for specialty care -- is that abortion? Does that mean that someone's 13 year-old daughter could walk into a sex clinic, have a pregnancy test done, be taken away to the local Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, have their abortion, be back and go home on the school bus that night? Mom and dad are never the wiser.</blockquote>
Section 2511 of the health care bill referred to by Bachmann, makes no mention of abortion and stipulates:
<blockquote>(i) "SBHC services will be provides in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws governing-- (I) obtaining parental or guardian consent; and (II) patient privacy and student records, including section 264 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and section 444 of the General Education Provision Act;</blockquote>
The nonpartisan PolitiFact rated Bachmann's statement <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/liberty-counsel/school-health-clinics-would-not-provide-abortions/" target="_hplink">a "Pants On Fire" falsehood.</a>
<blockquote>We see no language in the three main versions of the bill that would allow school-based clinics, which have a long history of providing basic health services to underprivileged students, to provide abortions. Nor would the clinics even be new they have been around for three decades. So we rate the claim Pants on Fire!</blockquote>
Nevertheless, Bachmann within weeks <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/08/bachmann-warns-once-again_n_314490.html" target="_hplink">went on to issue the same warning </a>once again. 'A Weapon Of Mass Destruction'Bachmann <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/20/michele-bachmann-tax-code_n_825694.html" target="_hplink">criticized</a> the country's current tax code as "a weapon of mass destruction" in a speech she delivered to local Republican activists in South Carolina back in February, the <em>Spartanburg Herald-Journal</em> <a href="http://www.goupstate.com/article/20110220/ARTICLES/102201031/1083/ARTICLES?p=1&tc=pg" target="_hplink">reported</a> at the time. According to the local outlet, the Tea Party favorite called for the system to be abolished. "We need a radically different system," she stressed to a crowd of nearly 200 guests.The 'LensCrafters Of Big Abortion'After Bachmann derided Planned Parenthood as "the LensCrafters of big abortion" earlier this year, it became <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/13/michele-bachmann-lenscrafters_n_848896.html" target="_hplink">clear</a> that the Tea Party darling's comparison <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_110/-204886-1.html" target="_hplink">left</a> the prescription eyewear company less than pleased.
Roll Call <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_110/-204886-1.html" target="_hplink">reported</a> in April of this year:
<blockquote>But LensCrafters didn't like the comparison. A company spokeswoman tells HOH that it contacted Bachmann's office Tuesday asking that she stop using its name. "She's using our name without our knowledge or permission," says Julie Maslov, communications director for Luxottica Retail, LensCrafters' parent company.
She didn't cite any legalese but rather says that the request was made "in the spirit of the fact that we have nothing to do with these parties or the debate."</blockquote>
According to <em>Roll Call</em>, a spokesman for Bachmann said the congresswoman would avoid referencing LensCrafters going forward, calling the request "perfectly understandable."Beware Of 'Gangster Government'During an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" back in March, Bachmann <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/06/michele-bachmann-obama-ne_n_831986.html" target="_hplink">addressed</a> an eyebrow-raising allegation she had previously made against the Obama administration. "I don't take back my statements on gangster government," she said, referring to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/02/bachmann-health-care-refo_n_446576.html" target="_hplink">charge</a> she made during the debate over health care reform. "I think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt."

<blockquote>Minnesota Republican Michele Bachmann made the acquaintance of some hula dancing Teabaggers from Hawaii, and they brought her a lei, which Bachmann herself could obtain at the airport in Hawaii, were it not for the fact that she believes planes cannot fly over water without the use of witchcraft. Anyway, <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/49288/bachmann-lei-health-care-steve-israel-holocaust" target="_hplink">she told Congress</a>, "I'm reminded that the one who created this lei also created our freedom. Are we so insensible to the high cost our forebearers paid to purchase our freedom?" So, the Hawaiian Bureau of Tourism created our freedom? I guess this is not supposed to make much sense.</blockquote>Her Own State Of The Union ResponseBachmann <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/michele-bachmann-state-of-union-response_n_813972.html" target="_hplink">delivered her own rebuttal</a> to President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/state-of-the-union-2011-s_n_813477.html" target="_hplink">State of the Union address</a> back in January despite <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/paul-ryan-state-of-the-un_n_813985.html" target="_hplink">Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.)</a> being tapped to give the official Republican response. Republican party leaders <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/24/michele-bachmann-state-of-the-union_n_813362.html" target="_hplink">downplayed</a> the move from Bachmann at the time. CNN was the only cable network to carry the Tea Party favorite's speech, but that didn't stop Bachmann from landing in the headlines with her remarks. One video capturing Bachmann's response showed her appearing to look off to the side of the camera while speaking. The <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/114802314.html" target="_hplink">reported</a> at the time:
<blockquote>The reason, it appears, is that Bachmann delivered her speech to TeaPartyHD's camera, which had the teleprompter she used. But most of the world -- well, nation -- saw the footage shot by network cameras that were allowed to video the speech.
</blockquote>
Luckily for Bachmann, TeaPartyHD, which produced the video, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/28/michele-bachmann-response-video_n_815622.html" target="_hplink">made moves to straighten out the footage</a> after it began to stir buzz. Financial Reform = Mussolini-Style Fascism?During an online town hall forum in May of last year, Bachmann suggested that proposed financial regulatory reform legislation was reminiscent of Italy under the rule of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The Minnesota Independent <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/58887/bachmann-financial-reform-is-like-mussolinis-italy" target="_hplink">relays</a> what Bachmann had to say at the time:
<blockquote>"Let's remember really what this is. This has a lot in common with Italy in the 1930s and they way Italy dealt with economics," she said. "It still continues private ownership of business but government is in control."
She continued, "So government control of the private business, while it's private ownership, that's still at the end of the day the federal government virtually having a say over private business. We lose freedoms; we lose economic competitiveness."
"And don't forget," she added, "Italy is in tough shape financially, and that's not what we want for the United States."</blockquote>'I Took Karate, I'm Dangerous'Bachmann <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/11/michele-bachmann-taunts-o_n_609133.html" target="_hplink">said</a> that she could take out President Obama if she were ever caught in the mind-boggling and improbable scenario of engaging the nation's leader in a physical fight in an <a href="http://biggovernment.com/bshapiro/2010/06/10/bachmann-obama-worst-president-in-united-states-history/" target="_hplink">interview</a> with BigGovernment.com last year. <blockquote><strong>SHAPIRO</strong>: I want to ask you, speaking of his violent language, and he's been brutal on BP, talking about putting his boot on the throat of BP, talking about how he wants to go down there and kick someone's ass -- frankly, Michele, I think you could take President Obama, off the record.
<strong>BACHMANN:</strong> Hey, I took karate when I was 17 years old, I am dangerous.</blockquote>Mangling Revolutionary HistoryBack in March, Bachmann told a group of local New Hampshire Republicans, "You're the state where the shot was heard around the world in Lexington and Concord." However, the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired in Massachusetts, not the Granite State.
The AP <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110313/ap_on_re_us/us_bachmann_nh_8" target="_hplink">reported</a> at the time Bachmann made the comments in question:
<blockquote>Though Bachmann probably wasn't the first to confuse Concord, N.H., with Concord, Mass., her mistake was striking given her roots in the tea party movement, which takes its name from the dumping of tea into Boston Harbor by angry American colonists in December 1773, 16 months before the Battle of Lexington Green.
</blockquote>
"I made a mistake; I should've said Massachusetts rather than New Hampshire," Bachmann <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/03/12/bachmann_mangles_revolutionary_history_in_nh_109213.html" target="_hplink">said</a> amid scrutiny on the heels of <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/03/12/bachmann_mangles_revolutionary_history_in_nh_109213.html" target="_hplink">making the remarks</a>. "We all know that there's a double standard in the media."
The Great Census Conspiracy TheoryHuffPost's Jason Linkins <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/26/michele-bachmanns-census_n_221427.html" target="_hplink">reported</a> in the summer of 2009:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/25/bachmann-compares-census_n_221081.html" target="_hplink">Michele Bachmann has drawn a line in the sand</a>, and will not fill out the Census, and no one really cares because who in America really wants to see government resources allocated to the Bachmann demographic, anyway? Nevertheless, Bachmann is the Neda Agha Soltan of fighting ACORN and the Census. "Why does the government need our phone numbers?" complains Bachmann, making me wonder if she plans on robo-calling her constituents come re-election time. You know I'll be watching for that!
Anyway, last summer, Michele Bachmann went on the Glenn Beck Common Sense Comedy Hour to talk about all of this. Understandably, Bachmann is concerned with whether the government should know about its citizens' "mental stability." And here is one of Bachmann's amazing insights:
<blockquote>BACHMANN: You know the question that's not on this survey, Glenn? "Are you a U.S. citizen?" This would be your perfect opportunity to find out how many illegal aliens are in the United States.</blockquote>
Of course! That is precisely the way this mystery should be penetrated! I can see it now!
<blockquote>CENSUS TAKER: Okay, next question...are you a U.S. Citizen?
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: RATS! You caught me!
CENSUS TAKER: I shall now deport you, with my ACORN magicks!
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: And to think I almost got away with it!</blockquote>
And that's the incredibly true story of how Mitt Romney had to start paying his gardeners actual money!
But here's the revelatory part of Bachmann's conversation: It appears that there actually is a point at which you can even out-bonkers Glenn Beck! Watch as the video gets to about the two-minute mark. That's when Bachmann starts up her "OMGZ! THE INTERNMENT CAMPZ" spiel. Beck starts shaking his head in disbelief, and then just shuts her down, mid-thought! Is that a bridge too far for Glenn Beck, who runs the most realistic Doom Room in Cable news? Maybe! Of course, I can't help but notice that Beck set Bachmann up perfectly to proffer that answer.</blockquote>Obama 'Very Anti-American'HuffPost's Sam Stein <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/17/gop-rep-channels-mccarthy_n_135735.html" target="_hplink">reported</a> back in 2008:
<blockquote>In a television appearance that outraged Democrats are already describing as Joseph McCarthy politics, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann claimed in October of 2008 that Barack Obama and his wife Michelle held anti-American views and couldn't be trusted in the White House. She even called for the major newspapers of the country to investigate other members of Congress to "find out if they are pro-America or anti-America."
Appearing on MSNBC's Hardball, Bachmann went well off the reservation when it comes to leveling political charges against the Democratic nominee.
"If we look at the collection of friends that Barack Obama has had in his life," she said, "it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs and values and thoughts are. His attitudes, values, and beliefs with Jeremiah Wright on his view of the United States...is negative; Bill Ayers, his negative view of the United States. We have seen one friend after another call into question his judgment -- but also, what it is that Barack Obama really believes?"
Goaded by a Chris Matthews to explain exactly what she was talking about (at one point Bachmann seemed to imply that liberalism was anti-Americanism), the congresswoman waded deeper into the mud.
"Remember it was Michele Obama who said she is only recently proud of her country and so these are very anti-American views," she said. "That's not the way that most Americans feel about our country. Most Americans are wild about America and they are very concerned to have a president who doesn't share those values."
Matthews later pressed her to name a single member of Congress other than Obama who she thought was anti-American. Bachmann, who initially wouldn't budge, called for a major "expose" into the matter.
"What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I wish they would. I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out if they are pro-America or anti-America," she said.</blockquote>Obama Turning U.S. Into 'Nation Of Slaves'In July of last year, Bachmann accused the Obama administration of "turning our country into a nation of slaves."
The Colorado Independent <a href="http://coloradoindependent.com/57145/bachmann-calls-for-constitutional-conservative-takeover-to-free-nation-of-slaves" target="_hplink">relays</a> what Bachmann had to say while speaking at an event in Denver:
<blockquote>"'We are determined to live free or not at all. And we are resolved that posterity shall never reproach us with having brought slaves into the world,'" Bachmann read from founding father John Jay , ending her reading with the statement, "We will talk a little bit about what has transpired in the last 18 months and would we count what has transpired into turning our country into a nation of slaves."
She reiterated her concern more forcefully toward the end of the program.</blockquote>'Re-Education Camps For Young People'HuffPost's Sam Stein <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/06/bachmann-obama-wants-re-e_n_183552.html" target="_hplink">reported</a> in April of 2009:
<blockquote>Appearing on Minnesota radio station KTLK-AM, (h/t <a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/31237/bachmann-reedcuation-camps" target="_hplink">Minnesota Independent</a>) the Republican Bachmann expressed her concern that White House was trying to put in place "re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward." Furthering the Obama-as-autocrat theme, Bachmann said the youngsters would "then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums."
The launching point of Bachmann's remarks was the widely popular and bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which would expand national community service programs from 75,000 positions to 250,000.
"It's under the guise of -- quote -- volunteerism. But it's not volunteers at all. It's paying people to do work on behalf of government," said the Minnesota Republican. "I believe that there is a very strong chance that we will see that young people will be put into mandatory service. And the real concerns is that there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums."</blockquote>The 'Global Currency' ThreatBachmann issued a warning in March of 2009 on her fear that the United States might wind up <a href="http://bachmann.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=116036" target="_hplink">abandoning</a> "the dollar for a multinational currency."
A <a href="http://bachmann.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=116036" target="_hplink">press release</a> put out by the Tea Party darling read:
<blockquote>"Yesterday, during a Financial Services Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would," Bachmann said in the March 25, 2009 news release . "And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances. But just a day later, Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table. I want to know which it is."</blockquote>
The Republican congresswoman also <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/102109/Top_ten_Michele_Bachmann_moments" target="_hplink">expressed</a> her concerns during an appearance on Fox News: "I'm very concerned about the international moves they're making, particularly ... moving the United States off the dollar and onto a global currency, like Russia and China are calling for." Politifact rated Bachmann's statement <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/michele-bachmann/defending-dollar-bachmann-distorts-geithners-comme/" target="_hplink">"false."</a>Flubbing Basic GeographyDuring the CNN Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Michele Bachmann flubbed some basic geography while criticizing the Obama administration's foreign policy, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/18/michele-bachmann-libya-africa_n_1018814.html" target="_hplink">HuffPost's Amanda Terkel reported</a>.
"Now with the president, he put us in Libya. He is now putting us in Africa," Bahmann said during the debate in October. Libya is, of course, in Africa.

These days, children seem to be given every opportunity by their parents to achieve success in school, sports, and the performing arts. Children receive private tutoring, coaching, and instruction. They attend summer camps devoted to their achievement activity. They seem to be assured of having every possible skill necessary to achieve success. Except one: emotional skill. Sadly, this final piece of the achievement puzzle is rarely among the other pieces (and has often been lost under the sofa). Children are left to their own devices to find that elusive piece and many don't. The result? Lacking the skills to "geek out" (my phrase for gaining emotional mastery) and put all of those other skills to great use, many children "freak out" (remember the 1978 Chic song?) and fail to achieve their goals. Given the inevitable challenges of achievement, the ability to geek out is essential for children's success, regardless of the particular path they choose. The ability of your children to have a positive emotional reaction begins with a firm grounding in their feeling loved, secure, and competent, in other words, their self-esteem. A positive emotional reaction also comes from ownership of their achievement activity, so that they are driven to succeed by their own passion, motivation, and determination. Finally, your children will develop a positive emotional response when they have internalized the emotional tools they need to react constructively to the inevitable obstacles and setbacks that they will experience as they pursue their goals.
Value of Success and Failure
There are many misconceptions about both success and failure that can interfere with your children's efforts to become successful. One of the most damaging is the idea that successes never fail and failures always fail. Freak out! Yet the reality is that "successes" fail much more often than "failures." People who are failures fail a few times and quit. But successes fail many times, learn from the failures, and begin to succeed because of what they learned. In time, the many failures and the lessons learned allow successes to succeed regularly. Learning to fail and learning from failure are essential contributors to success and a perspective that will foster children's achievement. Geek out!
Failure provides benefits such as information about your children's progress. Failure is the best means for your children to clearly and unambiguously see the areas they need to improve. Failure also indicates to your children what not to do in their efforts, which narrows down the possibilities of what they need to do to be successful. Failure also teaches the essential lessons of perseverance and the ability to overcome adversity. Geek out! Most fundamentally, as Dr. Wayne Dyer suggests, "Take the fear out of failure, and help children to understand the difference between failing at a task and being a failure as a person."
Experiencing failure alone, though, will not help your children achieve success. Too much failure and your children will become discouraged, lose confidence and motivation, and come to view achievement as an unpleasant experience to be avoided. Your children also need to experience success because, if combined with a healthy perspective, success can provide invaluable lessons for your children's pursuit of achievement in school, sports and beyond. Success builds confidence and trust in your children, which helps them to overcome adversity, obstacles, and setbacks on the road of achievement. It validates the dedication, hard work, patience, and perseverance that your children devote to their goals. Success acts to motivate them to higher levels of achievement. Success also generates positive emotions, such as excitement, joy, pride, and happiness, that further reinforce their confidence, motivation, and passion for our sport.
With this perspective, success is not such an intoxicant that it inhibits further growth, and failure is not a such monumental loss that it diminishes the desire to pursue success. Rather they are both inevitable and necessary parts of the process leading toward success and fulfillment in their achievement activity. Risk Taking
As we all know, achievement requires that children take risks to realize their fullest abilities and attain their goals. And taking risks is an essential part of your children's developing a positive emotional response to their achievement activities. Only if your children are unthreatened by failure will they be willing to take risks because, by their very nature, risks increase the likelihood of failure. If your children see achievement as a challenge to pursue, they will understand that risks also provide the opportunity to achieve even greater success. Geek out! Risk-taking will enable your children to move out of their comfort zones, test their capabilities, gain confidence in themselves, and achieve new levels of success. When you look at great successes in all walks of life, you also see great risk takers. These "superstars" knew that only by taking risks were great rewards possible. As the best-selling author Leo Buscaglia, observed, "To try is to risk failure. But risks need to be taken, because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing and is nothing. They may avoid suffering and sorrow, but they cannot learn, feel change, grow, love and live. Only a person who risks is free." Perspective on Mistakes
How your children come to understand the meaning of mistakes will have a dramatic effect on their ability to improve and achieve. As the poet Nikki Giovanni states, "Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the mistakes that counts." Unfortunately, many parents often communicate a very different message. What happens if you convey to your children that mistakes are bad and reflect poorly on them? You are placing them in the vise of being expected to pursue success -- which inevitably involves making mistakes -- but knowing that they will be criticized for their mistakes. Your children may then become fearful of making even the smallest mistakes and eventually come to believe that if they makes a mistake, they will be viewed with disappointment. Freak out! Says Dr. John Gray: "To expect children not to make mistakes gives them a cruel and inaccurate message about life. It sets a standard that can never be lived up to." Many parents and their children hold a negative perception about mistakes in spite of being able to see the world's most successful people make mistakes routinely. Freak out! Because they do, it would seem not only expected but also acceptable that your children would too. You need to communicate to your children that mistakes are a natural and necessary part of life). Your children must accept and learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are guides to what your children needs to work on to improve. Geek out! Without them, betterment will be a random and undirected process. Mistakes can tell your children that they is taking risks and moving out of their comfort zone. If your children never makes mistakes, they are probably not pushing themselves hard enough, they will not improve, and they will never become truly successful. Respond Positively to Adversity
The road to success is a bumpy one. It's filled with many barriers, setbacks, and struggles. Freak out! Some of this adversity is external to your children -- demanding teachers, challenging assignments, tough competition. Internal obstacles exist too, including loss of motivation, decline in confidence, distractions, negative emotions, impatience, and the desire to give up. How your children respond to these demands will dictate the success that they ultimately attain. "How can we grow without struggle and doubt and a misstep or two? If we spare our children that -- or try to -- we'll not be successful anyway; we'll end up prodding them toward other kinds of troubles, the kind we may not have anticipated," writes Robert Coles. How your children learn to respond to adversity depends largely on how you respond to adversity, and the perspective you teach them about the inevitable setbacks they will experience in their lives. You should be keenly aware of your reactions to setbacks, whether in a relatively unimportant situation, such as having difficulty balancing your checkbook, or in a critical situation, such as losing out on a job promotion. If you show frustration, anger, or despair when you face obstacles, you will be modeling this behavior for your children. Freak out! If you remain calm, positive, and motivated, they will learn this reaction from you. Geek out!
Dr. Peter Goldenthal suggests the following ways to help your children respond positively to adversity: Put the situation in perspective. Show your children that a setback is not the end of the world. Don't rush to the rescue. Let your children try to solve the problem themselves. Play up the positive. Point out to your children all the good things that happened besides the obstacle. Suggest step-by-step success. Help your children set goals using the setback as useful information. Admit your own mistakes. Share with your children difficulties that you had when you were young and how you overcame them.
The Choice is Yours
So what will it be? Neglect such a fundamental component of your children's development and pursuit of achievement and prepare them to freak out? Or give your children the perspectives and skills necessary to master the challenges of achievement and prepare them to geek out? The answer is obvious: Geek out!

Rosslyn McNair: Are Britain's Children 'Culture Starved'?
Although being "culture starved" might seem a triviality when there are children in the world actually being starved, I believe that having a general knowledge of the world about you is so important, not only for the box ticking of one's education, but for one's general existence. Most Popular

Paul Ryan Is a Charlatan, Not a Serious 'Policy Wonk'
Peter Dreier
E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College	For too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he's just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.

An Un-American Wolf in Religious Liberty's Clothing
Roger Fisk
Writer and Communications Consultant	What's funny, in a macabre way, is the effort to re-impose religion's will is dressed up as the next chapter in the same civil rights struggle that cleansed the public square of the zealot's self-proclaimed authority to begin with.
Comments (13) Federal Court: If You Buy a Girl, You're a Sex Trafficker
Kevin M. Ryan
President and CEO, Covenant House	A U.S. Federal Circuit Court has ruled that customers who arrange for or have sex with children under age 18 are to be considered human traffickers. Wow. That's a big and heavy stick we can use to protect kids who are forced into having sex for someone else's profit.
Comments The Pentagon's Phony Budget War
Mattea Kramer
Research director, National Priorities Project	Despite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.
Comments It Turns Out, Obamacare Actually Does Care
Robert J. Elisberg
Screenwriter and columnist	Even if a person doesn't qualify for an ACA health plan, you -- and by "you" I mean everyone -- still get the benefits of the new law. And much of this has very real, and very substantive financial savings -- just not the financial savings you read about in the news about monthly bills.
Comments Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist	There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (25) There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont	The Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.
Comments (122) Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress	As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
Comments Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts	As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) The Afghan Ballet: Why Washington Doesn't Want to Leave Afghanistan
Tom Engelhardt
Editor, TomDispatch.com	Washington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.
Comments On a Random Day in the U.S. There Are More Than 66,000 Requests for Help Escaping Domestic Violence
Soraya Chemaly
Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that order	The dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.
Comments Outing the Deep State
Robert Koehler
Syndicated writer	Can we actually build a world that isn't run by its shadow interests? And what is this going to take? Can good will and big principles stand up to Wall Street and the Washington consensus?
Comments Not a Big Fan of My Brother's Keeper
César Vargas
Producer, activist, and social media strategist	Poor people are under a great deal of stress. Their spirits are under a lot of stress. To tell them that they have no excuse is not just irresponsible. It's dangerous.
Comments President Obama, Say 'No' to Keystone XL Pipeline
Alan Robock
Distinguished Professor of Climatology, Rutgers University; director, Rutgers Undergraduate Meteorology Program	Wouldn't it make much more sense to hire people to construct wind turbines, install solar panels, and build the new electric grid we need? Wouldn't it make more sense to invest in battery technology and the other developments we will need for a fossil-free future?
Comments Why Retirement Security for Women Is Not an Option
Dedrick Muhammad
Senior Director of Economic Programs, NAACP	March marks Women's History Month -- a time for celebrating women's historic gains and achievements. But, equally important, especially in this sluggish economic recovery, is amplifying the contemporary economic challenges women continue to face, including the uphill climb to retirement security.
Comments Michele Bachmann Didn't Care for Religious Tolerance Until AZ Law
Cathy Reisenwitz
DC-based writer and political commentator	What seems to upset Bachmann is that America is waking up to the fact that a culture which used to dominate, the one where it's cool to discriminate against gays and pretend the Jim Crow south was fun and make racist jokes is losing ground.
Comments Momentum Builds in Puerto Rico for Major Marijuana Reforms
Adrian Brito
Law Student, Writer	If this happens, Puerto Rico will become the first American territory to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize marijuana possession.
Comments Why All LGBT People Should Care About Places Like Russia, Uganda and Gambia
Kevin Jennings
Executive Director, Arcus Foundation	As barriers to legal equality seem to be falling like dominoes in the United States, it's easy for LGBT Americans and their allies to feel a sense of giddiness. But even as the momentum in the U.S. seems to be accelerating in the right direction, a disturbing countertrend has emerged.
Comments Crimea: The End Game
Joe Peyronnin
Hofstra Journalism Professor	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Benghazi, nor is it the result of a weak American president. Now the question is will Putin really want to take the off ramp or deescalate tensions? Or might he be inclined to play this chess match out in a different way?

On Monday night, Chelsie and Johnny Pabs hit us over the head with a dating metaphor by jumping off a bridge while tied together, Sharleen gave us the worst kiss in Bachelor history, and Kelly kept on running her mouth despite her looks and "job." We're down to 15 girls and the claws came out this week. On the table were two one-on-one dates (AKA "dates") and a group date (AKA "what dating must be like when you're in a harem for Kublai Khan circa the roaring 1270s"). Cassandra (21 year old former NBA dancer AKA "unemployed") scored the first one on one and suited up in a red romper (why are these things popular?) for her date that promised to be a "wild ride." Wild ride it was, as she and Johnny Pabs hopped in an open top Jeep and cruised around Long Beach. Out of nowhere, JP pulled a sharp left across the beach and drove the Jeep straight into the water! Turns out this Jeep is a water car -- Johnny Pabs was NOT trying to kill Cassandra, Susan Smith-style (tasteless joke? Maybe). They drove the Jeep to a yacht where the couple stripped down to swimsuits, frolicked, and made out. That evening, they had a low key dinner date at Juan Pablo's house, during which they cooked, danced, and looked at photos of their kids. In case you missed one of the FOUR times Cassandra told us, she hasn't been on a date in three years. We get it, girl, you're SO DARN unlucky in love despite your beautiful face and good hair! Isn't life crazy? Cassandra also dropped this gem, "The last time a guy cooked for me was... never." Not to get all editor on you, girl, but you could rephrase that as, "A guy has never cooked for me." Just an idea. Two things happened during this date that blew my mind: (1) they didn't chug multiple bottles of wine despite being on a first date; (2) Cassandra scored a rose. The next day was group date time, and the lucky 10 ladies were Kelly (dog woman smack talker), Renee (pledge mom), Sharleen (old soul), Danielle (lil bland), Alli (brunette Andi look-alike), Lauren (TX musician), Andi (ombre DA), Christy (who is a friggin' shape shifter and never looks the same from one day to the next), Lucy (free spirit nightmare), and Nikki the nurse. As their limos pull onto the field (that can't be good for the grass -- sorry, LA Galaxy!), Johnny Pabs is kicking around a ball with some fellow soccer boys and the ladies are loving it. They gather and do some drills, during which JP quietly judges them so that he can separate them into two teams by skill (quiet judgment under the pretense of socializing? What is this, sorority rush? Alpha Theta Chi 'till I die!). They play a game of five on five and Sharleen takes a ball to the face and arm, Kelly shows us that she's awful to socialize with AND play sports with (multi-talented!), and Alli shows us how it's done. The 10 ladies and Johnny Pabs clean up for the cocktail party (this crew goes to 11) and each woman gets some alone time with the Bach. Nikki rocks another great hairstyle (so much volume), Danielle reveals that she's adopted, and Alli says she wants to birth a soccer team (not figuratively). Andi rocks a fierce outfit and Johnny Pabs takes her to the fryer/kitchen area of the concession stand where they make out in front of a walk-in fridge. Oh, the romance of it all. Old soul Sharleen is in a hot, white dress with some maroon lips (bold look!) when she and JP head to centerfield to live out the worst kiss in Bachelor history. Nikki scores a rose, probably for having great hair and talking about her fears. I was happy for Nurse Nikki until she did the Cabbage Patch, at which point I commenced hating her. The next day is Chelsie's one on one, much to Elise and her late mother's chagrin. I broke out in a wicked case of dumb chills as I watched Johnny Pabs and Chelsie car dance on their way to a Venezuelan restaurant. Post-chow down, they walk to a bridge where a Guy Fieri look-alike informs them that today's activity is a tandem ankle bungee jump (without donkey sauce). They get suited up (nice leg shackles!) and are about to jump, when Chelsie starts crying because she is terrified (I would be, too). Johnny Pabs calms her down because paternalism is SO sexy, but once Chelsie is assured that she doesn't need to do it, she wants to do it and they take the jump while rockin' jams play! The couple shares their first kiss while hanging upside down and Chelsie says that jumping off a bridge together while faux Guy Fieri looks on is the "epitome of building a relationship." Chelsie decides that if they can get through that experience, they can get through anything (which is a phrase I said to my lovely ex-BF about getting through my book release while he was switching from his truck driving job to a new union electrician job and turns out, YA CAN'T make it through that as a couple, but what do I know. Also, I'M FINE!). That evening they have a candlelit dinner in front of the Pasadena City Hall (where they talk about fears) then a private concert with Billy Currington singing his hit, "Hey Girl" which probably sounds like an idiotic song to you, sweet reader, but it actually rules. Chelsie scores a rose. The next day, Johnny Pabs shows up at the mansion to cook breakfast. Everybody chows JP's Venezuelan breakfast then heads outside for a pool party (I just hope they waited 30 minutes) instead of a cocktail party that evening. At the pool party Kat rides JP's shoulders for a whole lot of chicken fighting, Kelly stands poolside being miserable, and Clare cries in the bathroom. Finally, it's rose ceremony time and Cassandra, Nikki, and Chelsie already have roses. Who else joins the rose club?-Andi (ombre DA is rocking a killer necklace and rad one-shoulder dress.) -Renee (this house would spiral out of control if it weren't for her kindness.) -Kelly (she was smart to bring along a cute dog to distract from her personality.)
-Sharleen (I guess they don't teach kissing in opera school -- which makes sense -- but girl needs to learn how to kiss.) -Elise (showed her catty side this week and pulled out yet another sparkly dress -- it's like the miracle of Hannukah, but with sexy dresses instead of oil.) -Kat (JP loves a girl who initiates chicken fights!) -Alli (the Andi look alike who is good at soccer -- seems like a cool gal.) -Clare (Andi called her a "ticking time bomb" and I think she might be right.) -Lauren (Austin musician has been flying under the radar) -Danielle (also a slow burn who is rocking a gorgeous flower in her hair.) So who's hopping on the G train toward Court Square, but they'll be kicked off at Rejection Station? Christy and Lucy. Christy didn't make much of an impression, perhaps because Johnny Pabs couldn't keep track of who she was with her different looks and shape shifting. Lucy is America's nightmare "free spirit" and my, my, my how the mighty have fallen! The girl who arrived in a flowing bed sheet and flowered headpiece leaves the Bachelor mansion crying, carrying her shoes, and rocking a cheesy, gold bandage dress. Free spirit? More like walking cliché. I'll admit that her parting words (everyone deserves love) were sweet, but I'm glad to see her go. What did you guys think of the eliminations? Does anyone else find Kelly hard to take? And are we ready to visit South Korea next week?

St. Paul Mayor and Media Mum on Journalism Crackdown	Read More:

Comments
In St. Paul this week, a new generation of media makers is under assault by the city's mayor and law enforcement officers. These local officials think freedom of the press extends only to their allies in mainstream media. For the rest of us, practicing journalism is a crime. While reports of brutal police arrests and home invasions are still coming in, by Tuesday night the picture became clear. Dozens of journalists, photographers, bloggers and videomakers had been arrested in an orchestrated round up of independents covering the Republican National Convention. Targeting the New Press
The list of those detained ranges from the well-known (Democracy Now's Amy Goodman) and well-established (Associated Press photographer Matt Rourke) -- to the bootstrapping bloggers and video makers who are covering local protests for TheUptake.org, Twin Cities Indymedia, I-Witness and other outlets. Police -- with firearms drawn -- raided a meeting of the video journalists and arrested independent media, bloggers and videomakers. Journalists covering protests have been pointed out by authorities, blasted with tear gas and pepper spray, and brutalized while in custody. Democracy Now's Goodman reports that a U.S. Secret Service agent ripped her press credentials from her neck the moment she identified herself to him as a member of the media. Her producers emerged yesterday from their jail cells bloodied and scarred, reporting unusually harsh treatment at the hands of local and federal authorities.
Mayor Coleman's Silence
St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman hasn't responded to repeated phone and e-mail requests for comments on the targeting of journalists. Instead he praised the work of Police Chief John Harrington and painted those arrested as a small band of outsiders and vandals intent upon committing felonies against the good people of his city.
In less than a day, more than 35,000 people have signed a letter from Free Press (my employer) to Mayor Coleman condemning the arrests and demanding that he and local prosecutors immediately "free all detained journalists and drop all charges against them." But when Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald pressed Harrington and Coleman to respond to widespread reports of journalist arrests, Harrington claimed ignorance while Coleman stood silent at his side. Police spokesman Don Walsh intervened only to say that "arrest have been made" and that all those arrested were involved in criminal activities and not "simply non-participants."
Strib Forgets About Free Speech
In a bizarre editorial on Tuesday, the Minneapolis St. Paul Star Tribune hailed the police crackdown as "appropriate," blaming unrest on outsiders from beyond the Twin Cities. "Many of those arrested in St. Paul weren't carrying IDs or wouldn't give their names. Those who were identified came from Lexington, Ky.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Portland, Ore., and dozens of other U.S. cities," they wrote. "These weren't the sons and daughters of Highland Park and south Minneapolis." The Star Tribune itself is owned by out-of-towners from Avista Capital Partners, a New York City private equity firm specializing in energy, healthcare and media investments.
Other than a brief story about Goodman's arrest, the paper has failed to report on the apparent targeting of independent reporters, even though groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists have sounded the alarm.
Sweeping Real Journalism Under the Carpet
Here we have every indication of an orchestrated assault by federal and local law enforcement agencies to stifle independent sources of information. As shocking as this conduct is, more disturbing is the fact that the mayor's office and the local daily seem so unconcerned. It's not difficult to understand why. With local leaders making every effort to roll out the welcome mat for mainstream media and the GOP, they'd rather sweep beneath the carpet those pesky independents who are showing us a side of the spectacle that is less scripted for prime time. As an elected representative, Mayor Coleman should take a stand on behalf of a free press, rein in aggressive and violent tactics by local law enforcement, stop the targeting of journalists and immediately drop all charges against them. As a powerful news organization, the Star Tribune should know better, and should be sticking up for a free press, regardless of the form it takes.
For now, the democratic spirit of journalism is alive not in the Star Tribune newsroom, but among the video-blogs and cellphone reports that are bubbling up from outside the convention.
