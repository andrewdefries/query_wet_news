MINNEAPOLIS — Eleanor Mondale, the vivacious daughter of former Vice President Walter Mondale who carved out her own reputation as an entertainment reporter, radio show host and gossip magnet, has died at her home in Minnesota. She was 51.
Mondale, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer years earlier, died early Saturday, said family spokeswoman Lynda Pedersen said.
In a statement emailed to friends, the former vice president said he and his wife "must report that our wonderful daughter, Eleanor Mondale Poling, after her long and gutsy battle against cancer, went up to heaven last night to be with her angel."
Eleanor Mondale had been off the air at WCCO-AM in Minneapolis since March 19, 2009, when she announced that her brain cancer had returned a second time. She had surgery to remove the tumor Aug. 12, 2009, at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a posting on her CaringBridge website declared the surgery a success.
Mondale, the middle of three children born to Walter and Joan Mondale, stumped for her father in his failed campaign to unseat President Ronald Reagan in 1984. She also made calls in her father's last campaign in 2002, when the former vice president took the ballot slot of Minnesota's U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash just days before the election.
A striking blonde known on the party circuit when she was younger, Eleanor Mondale also attracted gossip. Her dalliance with the late rock musician Warren Zevon was detailed in "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon," a posthumous biography published by Zevon's ex-wife in 2007.
Mondale started as an aspiring actress, with bit parts in television's "Three's Company" and "Dynasty."
She got her start in broadcasting as an entertainment reporter at WCCO-TV in Minneapolis in 1989. She left the station after eight months, when a Twin Cities magazine was about to publish an article called, "Walter and Joan's Wild Child," that quoted her as saying "I like to get wild. But it's not murder, and I don't do drugs." Mondale denied she was forced out of the job, The Star Tribune reported.
After stints at Minneapolis radio station WLOL-FM, on cable television at E! Entertainment and ESPN and network TV on CBS' "This Morning," she returned to Minnesota in 2006 to co-host a weekday morning show on WCCO-AM with Susie Jones.
"I was terrified of her at first," Jones said Saturday. "She was so big, but you talked to her for a minute and you realized she was just as regular as you could expect ... She was uncanny, she was unpredictable. She sparkled. She was gorgeous inside and out."
She added later: "I'm going to miss her so much."
In 2005, Mondale was diagnosed with brain cancer after suffering two seizures during a camping trip. The tumor nearly disappeared after Mondale had chemotherapy and radiation, but her cancer returned in 2008. She underwent surgery and was able to return to WCCO but eventually had to take disability leave to treat the recurrence.
"She would send me texts about how her (cancer) scan was. She had it every six weeks, and she would report how it was and how big it was. She hated that part," said Jones, who visited Mondale on Thursday to say goodbye.
"She fought very hard. She did not want to die. She had a lot of dignity in the end, and died quietly and beautifully."
Mondale was married three times: to Chicago Bears offensive lineman Keith Van Horne, to fellow DJ Greg Thunder and to Twin Cities rock musician Chan Poling of The Suburbs.
Mondale and Poling married in 2005, shortly after her cancer was diagnosed, and lived on a farm near Prior Lake in the southern Twin Cities with miniature horses, cats, chickens, dogs and a cockatoo.
Along with her parents and husband, Mondale is survived by two brothers, Ted and William. Funeral arrangements are pending.

While it likely wasn't a reason for their eventual separation considering how long they were married, it must have been difficult for Courteney Cox to live with David Arquette's pack rat tendencies. Apparently, it's not a stretch that on both "Friends" and "Cougar Town," Cox has played roles where she was controlling and a bit of a neat freak. Knowing about her tendencies, Craig Ferguson threw bits of paper all over the floor just to get under her skin on "The Late Late Show" (Weeknights, 12:37 a.m. EST on CBS).
She resisted the urge to pick them up, saying that being married to David Arquette is what helped her build up some resistance to a bit of a mess.
"You know I love David, but he's crazier than a bag of snakes," Ferguson said.
"He's crazy, but he's also a pack rat," Cox added.
It certainly sounded like Ferguson was heading somewhere dirty when he said that Arquette was a hoarder in his pants, but Cox understood completely. She described it like the never-ending scarves that clowns pull out of their pockets. "He has that and a thousand things from like a five and dime store," she said.
Courteney Cox can be seen on "Cougar Town" every Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. EST on ABC, while Craig Ferguson and "The Late Late Show" are on every night at 12:37 a.m. EST on CBS.

Maureen Ryan: 'Cougar Town' Returns With Its Wine-Drinking Wit Intact
One of the most impressive things about "Cougar Town" is how many jokes and silly moments it can fit into a scene, while keeping the characters consistent and the enclosed world of the Cul De Sac Crew rooted in its own loopy reality. Anna Hart: Lipgoss: Courtney Cox Hasn't Had Sex in a Year, FYI
There is a lot of announcing going on at the moment. For the reader, it's exhausting stuff, but Courtney Cox figured this was clearly a good week for announcements. Mr. Skin: When Women Kiss: From TV Stunts to Mainstream Reality
Unlike other shopworn TV tropes, "chicks making out" always works. Even more intriguingly, this tele-trend has penetrated beyond the screen to become a standard rite of passage among females in the real world. Diana Mercer: Cox and Arquette: Still Modern Divorce Role Models

Celebrity News
Hayden Panettiere is no stranger to showbusiness, and her time in the industry has made her more aware of what it really means to be beautiful, both inside and out. Panettiere, who stars in the new ABC drama, "Nashville," covers the latest issue of Women's Health, and talks about being comfortable in her own skin, and realizing the pressure L.A. can put on aspiring performers.
“People can tell when you’re happy with being you and when you’re not," she told the magazine. "It’s only cheesy because it’s true. As I’ve gotten older and grown into my body, I’ve started realizing that the way you carry yourself and that light coming out of your eyes are the most attractive things about you.”
Panettiere, who plays a young country singer opposite Connie Britton's more experienced performer on "Nashville," has done her research when it comes to perfecting her part, and commented on the dichotomy of the music industry when it comes to making it big in Los Angeles compared to Nashville's country music scene.
“L.A. is more cutthroat, but in Nashville they want you to do well," she said. "You see it with the stars. When they’re performing, they’re all cheering for each other.” Check out Panettiere's Women's Health cover below, and don't miss the issue, on sale Sept. 11.

I write from Bukavu, Congo.
Paul Newman -- here's what he and Joanne gave me and I suspect many in the world -- the gift of confidence.
They were the perfect parents. I was 23. I was depressed and fragile and hardly here in this world. I was writing and writing as a way of survival. They took me under their wing. They pushed me and fed me and criticized my script with red pencils, they nurtured me and encouraged me to be funny. To always be funny. But mainly, they believed in me.
They seriously believed in me and because of this I came to believe in myself. They never asked for credit. They did not hold on after I had found myself. They did not curtail my independence. They have reappeared at all the crucial moments in my life in the many years that followed. They have always been in my corner.
Here's what they taught me. Generosity. They taught me that if you have or make money, you are not special, just lucky. They taught me to never make people beg or jump through hoops because that implies you have a hoop and you do not have a hoop, you have money.
They taught me that the only real happiness comes from giving. And because they lived everything they spoke, they taught me about integrity.
I can't imagine this world without Paul Newman. But I know his generosity, his gift of confidence lives surely in many of us and if there is a way to appreciate him, it is in giving deeper and deeper.
Eve Ensler is a Playwright (The Vagina Monologues) and Founder of V-Day, the global movement to end violence against women and girls.

LOS ANGELES -- Shades of '99-'00, it feels like the Tech Boom Act II. Otherwise known as the Solar Power International show, held Oct. 12-14 at the L.A. Convention Center. A feeling of seemingly limitless optimism filled the hallways and auditorium, as 1000s of senior executives from top renewable energy and solar companies participated in SPI. For those who think the solar business is a fringe industry, think again. Many of the world's top venture capitalists have plowed hundreds of millions if not billions into solar power, much less the governments of China and Germany to name a few. If any naysayers don't believe in the power of green jobs and the positive impact the solar industry can have on the U.S. economy, I sincerely wish they could have been in attendance to see and feel the continued momentum of the solar industry.
The lack of a federal energy policy has hurt the U.S. solar business to be sure, but federal, state and local subsidies have been what's needed to overcome this problem in the interim. Did you know that about 80 percent of the world's solar panel production goes to supply Europe, as the Continent is way ahead of us in creating consumer acceptance for home solar and subsidies to match. Germany has the world's best incentives, which has fueled the growth of the European solar market. This was reflected in attendance at the SPI show, as a hefty percentage of the exhibitors were European.
After exploring booth after booth of traditional, clunky solar panels, one thing caught my eye -- the prominence of CPV development. CPV stands for Concentrated Photovoltaics, and it represents a new technology that generates significantly more power and efficiency per square inch of solar panel. The benefits of this are obvious: fewer and smaller panels can make and store even more power than their conventional photovoltaic panel counterparts. According to SolFocus VP of Sales and Marketing Nancy Hartsoch, CPV is a nascent technology that will work best in desert-like conditions, as in very hot, sunny, dry climates like Nevada, Arizona, or inland Southern California. Product has been deployed commercially as we speak. I was particularly impressed with examples being developed by SolFocus of Mountain View, CA. SolFocus has raised over $200 million, and is being hotly pursued by Aminox, another CPV startup with backing from Kleiner Perkins. Another promising CPV cell developer is EPIR of Naperville, IL, outside of Chicago. (I should mention in the spirit of journalistic integrity that I have done some consulting for EPIR.) By 2011 we will hopefully see 150 MW of CPV deployed and by 2012, up to 515 MW. If these figures are correct, CPV could be a huge step forward in finding a tipping point for both the consumer and utility markets. Continued improvements in technology and price cuts are essential for solar to go en masse. Speaking of which, one of the most interesting characters I met at SPI was Lyndon Rive, the South African-born CEO of consumer and commercial solar provider SolarCity. Foster City, CA-based Solar City is essentially a full-service provider of home and commercial solar panels and installation, providing the key additional services of leasing packages and assistance filing all the necessary forms to obtain federal, state and local incentives and rebates. SolarCity uses panels made by leading solar companies such as Yingli Green Energy, First Solar, Kyocera and Sharp, among others. Currently operating only in California, Oregon, Colorado, Arizona and Texas, Solar City has aggressive expansion plans and employment is scheduled to grow from around 1,000 to over 2,000 by the end of 2011. Like many green businesses, profitablility is not happening quite yet because of the sizable investment required for a startup of this magnitude. However, Rive says that SolarCity is cash flow positive, they just have to recognize revenue according to GAAP accounting procedures so this occurs over a 20 year period on each lease. As the company expands into other states, profitability should dramatically increase.
I hope you can feel the excitement that continues to build around home (and commercial) solar electricity that permeated the L.A. Convention Center's Solar Power International. Next time, I'll tell you more about this compelling conference and the companies that participated. Amidst the uncertainty of our economy and rampant unemployment, this is a bright spot -- one that you should be thinking about when you cast your votes for various candidates and state propositions on November 2nd.

Each month, my contemporary poetry review series at The Huffington Post selects between five and ten collections published since 2000 to recommend to its readership. These collections are selected from a pool of more than a thousand contemporary poetry collections available for review. Publishers interested in submitting review copies to the series should contact the above-listed reviewer. All submitted books remain eligible for inclusion in the series for a 10-year period.
1. Song of a Living Room, Brigitte Byrd (Ahsahta Press, 2009). Byrd's cerebral prose poems are couched in an air of hyper-rationality that belies their visceral energy. As those progenitors of the contemporary avant-garde, The Futurists, so famously encouraged in the years leading up to WWI, Byrd casts her analogic net so widely it convincingly illuminates the interrelationship between mind and body, subject and object, ego and environment. The sum of these efforts is no less than a new way of knowing--and of knowing the self. Also, some of the most accomplished prose poems of the last decade, work which demands an active readership--one prepared to be challenged by verse so rewarding it bears not only careful reading but re-reading and re-re-reading. Very, very highly recommended. [Excerpt: "(a brittle day passed by)"].
2. A Fast Life: The Collected Poems of Tim Dlugos, Tim Dlugos [ed. David Trinidad] (Nightboat Books, 2011). In the past decade, there have been a number of critical additions to, and clarifications of, the twentieth-century avant-garde canon. Consider, for instance, the recent emergence (or rather reemergence and resurgence) of Ted Berrigan, John Wieners, and Ed Dorn. It's time to add the name of Tim Dlugos (1950-1990) to this roster of archival resurrections. Dlugos' Collected charts the artistic output of a singular talent most commonly associated with New York City--in whose literary scene he was ubiquitous from 1978 to 1990--who in fact wrote his best poems as a recently-out college student in Philadelphia in the early 1970s. This early work is that of a young man still coming to terms with his sexuality and politics; there is a gentle, tentative longing here that would border on the saccharine were the poet not so evidently and deeply invested in every line. Indeed, Dlugos offers us some of the most touching and earnest work ever associated with any wave of the New York School. The poet may have self-identified as "part of the nostalgia craze," and certainly there's more than a hint of the sentimental in many of these poems, but it's also true that no understanding of American poetry in the seventies or eighties would be complete without some exposure to, and appreciation of, these highly personal--and yet also highly political--lyric poems. [Excerpt: "The Truth"].
3. The Louisiana Purchase, Jim Goar (Rose Metal Press, 2011). From a resolutely historical, "mappable" origin-point, The Louisiana Purchase evolves into an exquisite article of hypertextuality. Goar uses the titular land-grab as a springboard for imaginative--and instructive--investigations into what it means to be an American, and, too, what it means to be steeped in a national narrative with which it becomes increasingly difficult to establish any personal relationship. Goar reifies the interconnectivity of our highly-plastic American iconography--seamlessly integrating cultural touchstones from Ozzie Smith to Richard Nixon to the Immaculate Conception--and in so doing succeeds at an even greater task: Penning a collection of poems brilliantly of and for its time. The Louisiana Purchase is a sterling exemplar of what post-postmodern verse can do in the twenty-first century. [Excerpt: from "The Louisiana Purchase"].
4. Holy Land, Rauan Klassnik (Black Ocean, 2010). These poems may well be among the most vulgar and violent published in the English language in the past quarter-century. Many will be offended by what's in this book; Klassnik doesn't just gore sacred cows, he disembowels them and devours their entrails. A superficial reading of the text might even produce a damning accusation of homicidal misogyny. Yet such a careful study of violences--which is what, in toto, Holy Land is--permits a notable accumulation of gravitas, and Klassnik earns his strong language and deeply distressing imagery. In both its tender and horrifying moments, Holy Land aptly maps how we are chained to time, place, ourselves, and one another by a million minor assaults--only some of which are physical. As a wide-ranging, metaphoric look at death, power, gendered bodies, sublimity, despair, and anguish, Holy Land succeeds even as it terrifies and, yes, turns the stomach. A remarkable achievement, and one which deserves to be (and must be) read in its entirety. [Excerpt: from "Wounded Soldier"].
5. The Bigger World, Noelle Kocot (Wave Books, 2011). The series of third-person narrative vignettes of which The Bigger World is comprised is compulsively readable and not infrequently brilliant. Kocot's characters boast their own distinctive symbology; the landscape upon which these breezily-recounted stories unfold is one in which nothing whatsoever is as might be expected, and what often seem preposterous plots and personalities soon enough take a turn toward the sublime. Kocot's language is more often prosaic than cleverly subtle, but the whole is without question more than the sum of the parts: The Bigger World is one of the most pleasurable reads this reviewer has encountered in some time. Every page in this collection offers a new delight. [Excerpt: "The Circle of Life"].
6. Enola Gay, Mark Levine (University of California Press, 2000). Reading Mark Levine's Enola Gay is a near-religious experience. These poems occupy a landscape at the very brink of its Apocalypse; lovers of Cormac McCarthy's prose will find much to admire in the dark urgencies of Levine's enigmatic yet eloquently stern verse. There can be no doubt that Levine offers readers of American poetry a singular vision, one whose temperate, almost holy prosaicism paradoxically offers a stunningly expansive view of what's possible in the English language. There is real terror beneath the surface of these poems, but also an ethereal dignity that somehow, impossibly, retains a distinctly human cast. You could read contemporary American poetry for many years and not come across a work as distinctive as this; these poems wrench the gaze forward toward a time that has not yet been, one which we hope (for our own sake) and yet do not hope (for the sake of its terrible, pressing beauty) will never be. [Excerpts: "Then for the Seventh Night" and "Eclipse, Eclipse"; click on "Read Chapter 1" at link].
