WASHINGTON -- Rep. Jackie Speier listened to debate on the House floor on Thursday evening as a Republican Rep. Chris Smith read a long, detailed description of an abortion and a "mangled image of a dead, tiny baby." Finally, Speier stood up and told her colleagues she had undergone an abortion in the early 1990s following a complication nearly four months into her pregnancy.
"As the night wore on, the vitriol and grotesque commentary got worse and worse," Speier, a second-term Democrat from California, told HuffPost. "I sat there thinking, none of these men on the other side have even come close to experiencing this, and yet they can pontificate about what it's like. It just overwhelmed me."
Speier underwent an abortion in her early 40s, while she was serving in the California State Assembly. The procedure used to terminate the pregnancy was the same type that Smith's book described. As she listened, Speier said she became more emotional and made the decision to speak out. "This was a wanted pregnancy, it was the second miscarriage I had had," she told HuffPost. "What they express doesn't come close to the experience that a woman goes through when she is losing a baby or when a pregnancy is terminated. It's a painful, gut-wrenching loss." She said she had spoken publicly about her experience with abortion only once before, while debating late-term abortion in the California state legislature. After she told her story, Speier said many colleagues -- both male and female -- offered their support, some saying she put tears in their eyes. One Republican told her the amendment was inappropriate, she said, while Smith, whose remarks caused her to speak up, said nothing. As a longtime supporter of abortion rights, Speier said she was frustrated to see a debate over funding descend into a moral debate over a woman's right to choose. The amendment under debate, proposed by Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.), was to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funds -- even though they are already barred from being used for abortion. The amendment passed on Friday in a 240-185 vote but will likely be blocked in the Senate, where Democrats hold a majority. "A continuing resolution is a mechanism to allow the government to continue to operate," Speier told HuffPost. "It should not be a vehicle for political rhetoric and high drama that was exhibited last night on an issue that was unrelated to the federal budget. It didn't create one job, it didn't reduce the deficit, so what was the point?"
(Note: The account of the fetus moving from the vagina to cervix appears to be anatomically impossible. Speier is likely referring to movement from the uterus to the cervix)

Despite having my initial viewing of Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds ruined by incompetent projectionists at my local Carmike Cinemas, I felt even then that it was a masterpiece. Overlong in places, to be sure, but a masterpiece. Watching the film in Blu-ray for its release this week is quite a breathtaking thing to see and I would highly recommend it for anyone hemming or hawing on the decision to buy a Blu-ray player.
The film itself is a mixture of a number of things like all of Tarantino's film. Part spaghetti-western, part World War II mission film and part Looney Tunes during their propaganda years. Basterds is equal parts Dirty Dozen, Guns of Navarone and, perhaps The Young Lions as well as some French masterpiece about the love of cinema that I've never seen but am confident of its existence. It's divided up into chapters that at times can seem disparate from each other, but all tie together nicely within the last couple of chapters of the movie.
The film is gory and fun, well-written and well-acted. All in all this was a very, very solid entry into Tarantino's filmography.
One particular aspect of the film that I loved more than most was how Tarantino seemed to pay homage to film projectionists, people who care about film, cinephiles and passionate people willing to battle the Nazi's for what's right. There's also a bit of a love-letter/history lesson about nitrate film and the film itself is even used in the plot to kill Hitler and his lieutenants. It felt particularly empowering to someone like myself who spent so long working as a film projectionist getting to where I am now and knowing that I'm part of the last of that dying breed.
In a lot of ways, the film itself feels as though it's the last of a dying breed, and that breed, more than the others, is the World War II mission-film. I want to see more films like this. Like A Bridge Too Far, like The Dirty Dozen, The Guns of Navarone, Kelly's Heroes and on and on and on.
They don't make movies like that anymore and they really ought to. So, I want to thank Quentin Tarantino for making a great movie in a tradition I thought was long dead.
For those of you interested in the Blu-ray, you'll be happy to note that there are quite a few interesting special features. Aside from a digital copy of the film, you're getting enough behind the scenes content and bonus features to choke a horse. There is the entire version of Nation's Pride, which was the film within a film, an extensive roundtable with Tarantino, extended scenes, trailers and anything else you could care to shake a fist at. This is the kind of thing they made movies for, and it's certainly the kind of thing they made Blu-ray for.
