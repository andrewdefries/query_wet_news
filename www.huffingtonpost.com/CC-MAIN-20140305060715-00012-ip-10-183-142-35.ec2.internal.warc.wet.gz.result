While Wall Street Gets More Diverse, White Men Still Take Home Much More Money

Though the Wall Street workforce is getting more diverse, white men are still taking home most of the bacon. White men made up more than 60 percent of Wall Street workers aged 45 and over between 2005 and 2009, but just 46 percent of those 30 and younger, according to a recent City University of New York's Center for Urban Research analysis of Census data. But in almost all categories, the earnings of white males came out on top, with white men aged 31 to 44 earning at least double that of their non-white and female counterparts. Critics have long bemoaned the lack of diversity on Wall Street. A provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act aimed at pushing Wall Street firms to hire more women and minorities, according to Politico -- a measure that drew criticism from Republicans. Most of the diversity gains on Wall Street came from an uptick in the share of Asian workers, the study found, while the percentage of black Wall Street employees hasn't increased. And though the share of women working on Wall Street gets larger as workers get younger, the overall percentage of women working in financial firms declined between 2000 and 2005-2009. "The most surprising findings regard women because as we know women now outperform men in the educational system," Richard Alba, one of the authors of the report, told the Wall Street Journal. "They have higher rates of getting [bachelor's of arts degrees] and post-graduate degrees and that they still lag so much behind in terms of their position on Wall Street I found really remarkable." In 2008, women accounted for 18.8 percent of executives, managers and senior-level officers at companies that fall into the "Securities, Commodity Contracts & Other Financial Investments" category, according to a Catalyst analysis cited by fins.com. Nineteen percent of the managing directors Goldman Sachs named last month were women, compared to 24 percent last year. At Morgan Stanley, 16 percent of new managing directors were women.

"Paranormal Activity 4" brings together two terrifying things: The suburbs of Las Vegas and Xbox Kinect. Also, creepy demon children.
With five years having passed since the events of "Paranormal Activity 2" ("Paranormal Activity 3" was more of an origin story), "Paranormal Activity 4" catches up with Katie and Hunter, whose last appearance together took place after a grisly double murder. Fun? They're back in "Paranormal Activity 4" (though Katie isn't seen and Hunter may simply be possessing a poor boy named Robbie) and ready to haunt an innocent Nevada family with falling chandeliers and video games. Expect mass casualties, but also major coin: The first three "Paranormal Activity" films have totaled just under $600 million in ticket sales around the world to date.
"Paranormal Activity 4" arrives in theaters on Oct. 19, just in time for Halloween. Head over to Apple to check out the trailer in HD.
MORE For horror movie buffs below:
Loading Slideshow
'The Stuff' (1985)It's not quite ice cream, it's not quite yogurt -- but it comes from beneath the earth's core, controls your mind and makes you explode in a vomitous fury. (<em>At least it's better than Miracle Whip.</em>) 'Donkey Punch' (2008)Debaucherous partygoers smoke, drink and film anything they can look up on UrbanDictionary.com -- and to the surprise of everyone, it does not end well. 'It's Alive' (1974)A mutant killer baby claws its way home to mommy and daddy; if you think that's scary, just wait 'til it turns 18 and you get a look at its college tuition rates! <em>Agh!</em>'Jack Frost' (1996)A serial killer gets reincarnated as a snowman and goes on a murderous spree. Man, they really need to control these frenzied crowds during the Christmas shopping season!'One-Eyed Monster' (2008)A porn crew, stranded in a snowstorm, is slaughtered by the disembodied privates of adult film star Ron Jeremy. (<em>sighs</em>) Yes, really. 'Death Bed: The Bed That Eats' (1977)We don't ask for much in our trippy, low-budget '70s movies about beds that eat people, we just ask for them to be a little more coherent than this "film." 'Night of the Lepus' (1972)Townsfolk are terrorized by giant, man-eating rabbits. There has to be subtler ways to sell us on buying more canned rabbit meat. 'Black Sheep' (2006)This time, the townsfolk are terrorized by genetically engineered, man-eating sheep. So, basically, don't bother going outside ever again. 'Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead' (2006)A fast food chain is attacked by zombiefied customers possessed with the vengeful spirits of slaughtered chickens (we knew all this and still weren't prepared for how stupid it was). 'Frankenhooker' (1990)Nothing we can say about this movie can top Bill Murray's (real) endorsement: "If you see one movie this year, it should be 'Frankenhooker.'"'Uncle Sam' (1996)A Desert Storm soldier, killed by friendly fire, returns from the grave to dispense cruel justice on anyone who is "unpatriotic"; Dick Cheney called it "the feel good movie of the year."* <br />
* <em>Joke supplied by guest writer Billy Crystal. </em>'Killer Condom' (1996)(<em>shakes head</em>) No, just no. 'Evil Bong' (2006)... Honestly, this is getting kind of exhausting. 'The Gingerdead Man' (2005)They made two sequels to this -- "Passion of the Crust" and "Saturday Night Cleaver" -- but Gary Busey didn't return for either. The quality of the scripts must have <em>really </em>dropped off. 'Monsturd' (2003)...<br />

Miley Cyrus, Miranda Kerr, Kendall Jenner and More Strip Down for a Sexy Photoshoot

@MertAlas & @MacPiggott gather a few (insta) celebrity friends and their legions of followers for some serious social networking.
Comments Why We Should All Listen to Miley
Hayley Grunebaum
Student, University of Michigan
Despite a reputation for uncontrollable twerk-age and a tongue that flaps outside of her mouth, Miley has things to say and is not afraid to say them. It is appalling how much we criticize each other.
Comments Shirley Temple: A Lesson for Miley Cyrus
Gene Del Vecchio
Adjunct Professor of Marketing, USC Marshall School of Business; Author, 'Creating Blockbusters!'
Although much can be said of Shirley's stardom, much can also be said of the graceful way she transitioned from that stardom. When audiences became less interested in Shirley the teenager, she found other paths where she could shine. And she did it without twerking.
Comments Move Over Celebutantes and Twerkers, It's Time for a Ladylike Revolution

Comments 24/7 Glamour: Beauty in the Age of Instagram
Napoleon Perdis
Makeup artist
Love them or hate them, it doesn't seem like the "selfie" is going anywhere anytime soon. So for the foreseeable future, we must prepare ourselves (and our faces!) for the impromptu iPhone shoot.
Comments Like a Wrecking Ball: In Defense of Miley
Scott Ellman
Editor-at-Large, Wesleyan University
I don't condone Miley's antics. Nor do I think her behavior sets a positive example for anyone. But the world has to realize something: Miley Cyrus doesn't want to be a role model. And we have to learn to be okay with that.
Comments 45 Days Until 45: Super SoulCycle Sunday, Day 42
Wendy Burch

This Sunday I decided to do something for my soul.
I turned to my spiritual side... by tuning into Oprah. If you haven't watched Super Soul Sunday,...
Comments Either Robin Thicke Is Unworthy of an NAACP Image Award or the Awards Are Unworthy of Our Support
Morris W. O'Kelly
Host of "The Mo'Kelly Show" on KFI AM640/XM Satellite Radio and "Mo'Kelly in the Morning" on KTLK AM1150
How should I or anyone else familiar with the stated mandate of the NAACP Image Awards look upon these 4 nominations for Robin Thicke, all directly connected to the song, Blurred Lines?

Comments Who'll Release the Next Surprise Album? 10 Artists Who Can 'Beyoncé' the Music Industry
Oscar Raymundo
Author, 'Confessions of a Boy Toy'
Although the old way of marketing an album is still valid for emerging artists slowly building up an audience, the dragged-out promotional rollout for any pop star with millions of followers on social media seems silly, even counterintuitive.
Comments The Past Wasn't Awesome, the Future's Not Bleak and 50 Is Not the New 40
Valerie Alexander
Author, 'Happiness as a Second Language'
These are buoyant, happy times, and as much as I loved spending my teens in the 80s, I am just as thrilled to be living out my 40s in the 'teens. And at the end of this decade, when I do turn 50, I will know that it's going to be even better than I could have imagined.
