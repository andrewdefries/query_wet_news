WASHINGTON - The total of U.S. state debt, including pension liabilities, could surpass $4 trillion, with California owing the most and Vermont owing the least, according to an analysis released on Monday.
The nonprofit State Budget Solutions combined states' major debt and future liabilities, primarily for pensions and employee healthcare, unemployment insurance loans, outstanding bonds and projected fiscal 2011 budget gaps. It found that in total, states are in debt for $4.2 trillion.
The group, which follows state fiscal conditions and advocates for limited spending and taxes, said the deficit calculations that states make "do not offer a full picture of the states' liabilities and can rely on budget gimmicks and accounting games to hide the extent of the deficit."
The housing bust, financial crisis and economic recession caused states' tax revenue to plunge, and huge holes have emerged in their budgets over the last few years. Because all states except Vermont must end their fiscal years with balanced budgets, states have scrambled to cut spending, hike taxes, borrow and turn to the federal government for help.
Taxpayers are worried the states' poor fiscal health will persist for a long time and some Republicans in Congress have questioned whether the situation is worse than the states say.
State Budget Solutions relied on financial reports and income tax rates provided by the Federation of Tax Administrators in determining its rankings.
The true debt totals may be lower, though, because the group also used the highest estimates of pension gaps. The conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute says public pensions are short $2.8 trillion.
Others, including the nonpartisan research group Pew Center on the States, put total unfunded pension liabilities at around $700 billion.
The wide range is based on different assumptions of the returns of pension fund investments, which provide the bulk of money for benefit payments. Conservative economists say the investments will have annual returns of around 4 percent, while many funds expect returns in line with the average of the last 20 years -- closer to 8 percent.
Using the higher pension gap number, State Budget Solutions said California is in the biggest financial hole -- with total debt of more than $612 billion. New York follows with $305 billion of debt, and then Texas, with total debt of $283 billion. Vermont has the lowest amount of total debt at just over $6 billion.
The group also looked at the financial shape of states using the Pew pension projections. It came up with a total debt of $2 trillion for all states.
California still owes the most under the alternative computation, but the state's total debt drops significantly, to $307 billion. With the Pew numbers, New Jersey follows with $183 billion of debt and Illinois is next at $150 billion.
According to the analysis, California has also borrowed the most from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits, $8.6 billion. Michigan was next, taking out $3.1 billion, and then New York, borrowing $2.9 billion.
As unemployment shot up, some states could not pay for the surge in demand for jobless benefits. The federal government loosened its lending rules to keep states from having to cut other areas of their budgets. But last month the U.S. government again began charging interest on the outstanding loans and may levy extra taxes on businesses in states with outstanding loans.
Looking at just state annual financial statements, the group found Connecticut has the highest debt per capita, at $5,402, and nine states have debt of more than $3,000 per capita.

It's that time of year when critics get all nostalgic -- or up on their high horses, depending -- about the year that is rapidly drawing to a close.
I've been writing 10-best lists for longer than I care to think about. But this year it seems less important than it has in a long time.
Maybe it's that there are so many of us now posting these things -- how many hundred will wind up in that graph on the Movie City News website? And so many of them will be significantly the same, featuring the titles you expect to see: The King's Speech, The Social Network, 127 Hours, Inception, Inside Job, Toy Story 3, True Grit, The Black Swan, Carlos and a couple of others. Not all of the ones I've just mentioned would be on my list, but many of them would.
Last year I posted a 10-best list, along with a 10-worst list, a list of 10 terrific-but-unseen films and another 10 that I thought were fun but wouldn't make the top 10. I could probably have also made a 10-best list of documentaries. I certainly could this year.
But, frankly, I'm tired of thinking about the movies of 2010. There were some terrific ones. There were some godawful ones. Let's leave it at that and focus on the fact that 2011 is almost upon us.
What follows is NOT a 10-best list. Rather, it's my list of the best movies of 2010 that you probably didn't see, didn't want to see or didn't know about. But they were all movies that challenged the viewer in one way or another. Which is why, for the most part, they went (or will go) unseen.
Yes, I know: To the average person, movies are about escapism. People buy tickets to movies to take themselves out of their everyday lives and plunge them into someone else's. It doesn't matter whether it's the gross-out hilarity of The Hangover or the sci-fi trippiness of Inception and Avatar or the superhero antics of Iron Man and all the other comic-book movies (a genre that threatens to run away with the movie industry).
The point is that, generally speaking, the mass audience of people doesn't want movies that force them to think. People want movies that make thinking superfluous, that do the thinking for them, that tell them what to think and feel.
Don't get me wrong: I'm not averse to escapism. I was a fan of all those movies I just mentioned (notice that I said Iron Man, not Iron Man 2). It's just that there are so many bad versions of the popcorn flick that, when a movie stops me in my tracks, makes me pay really close attention, doesn't answer all of its own questions, doesn't even tell me what the questions are - well, then I take notice.
Not that all of them do it for me. As I said when I reviewed Sofia Coppola's Somewhere, it's the kind of film that usually drives me crazy -- a movie in which nothing happens. I hated Rahmin Bahrani's Goodbye, Solo, one of the best reviewed films of 2008, for exactly that reason. Indeed, most of what passes for "world cinema" leaves me cold.
But this year seemed to be a particularly strong one for movies that managed to be fulfilling without attempting to be audience-friendly. By which I mean: They don't tell a linear story or even have much of a plot; they focus on characters who are often unlikable or vague; they force the viewer to figure out what is going on.
And so here you go, my year's 10-best unseen or unacknowledged films -- think of it as the downer-dozen-minus-two. Not all of them fit that description completely, but most could easily be considered either under-appreciated, under-attended or both.
Click here: For the list, this commentary continues on my website.

"You're going to hate me for saying this," says my good friend, a married mom of three, as we stand on the beach and look toward the ocean. "But you're never going to find a man. They're just not out there. No single woman I know can find a guy." She takes a breath and adds: "So you should have a baby. Do whatever it takes and have a baby. You should at least become a mother." I don't hate her for saying it. She is saying what so many others are thinking.
"I just don't want to see you alone the rest of your life," she adds softly to mitigate the harshness of her advice. The rest of my life, I think to myself as I look toward the horizon. It's too endless to imagine.
"But this is the rest of my life. Right here and right now, this is my life. I am alone. And I'm OK. It's not what I want. It's not what I expected. It's not where I want to be. But it's my reality," I say, more defiantly than usual. I'm running out of ways to show I'm not a victim to friends who wonder if I am.
When you're at the end of your fertility, at the end of the summer, at the other end of an argument you can't win, all you want to do is wait it out.
But your good friends want to know you're OK. And I feel the need to defend why I'm not a mother even though being a mother is all I ever wanted to be. "I don't want have to have a baby on my own," I argue. "I can't imagine how lonely being a single mother can potentially be. It's hard enough to meet a man, and it's even harder to meet a man who wants to be with a pregnant woman, or a new mother, or a harried single mother. Besides, I don't have any support. I don't have parents nearby or siblings who can help me. And honestly," I add tepidly, "I don't want to have a baby from the sperm of a man I don't know. I want to know where my son's clef chin came from. I want to know where my newborn daughter's long fingers came from. I want to look into my baby's eyes and see the love of my life."
I'm a hopeless romantic. When I fall in love, which happens very rarely, I fall deeply, madly, spiritually-on-a-whole-other-level in love. It's not a naïve love. I know there are problems -- most often it's that he has no desire to be in a long-term committed relationship -- but it's love. At least, that's how I remember it.
I look at the families on the beach. Little boys chasing little girls in the sand. A couple sharing a glance. A father and son running into the waves.... My friend sees it too and softens her tone even more: "I'm just saying you'd make an amazing mom, and it's just a shame that you'll never be a mother. It's sad that you'll never have a family."
I'm sad too, but I know I'm not the only one dealing with this. Just last week, a business colleague, a single woman in her mid-thirties, confessed that an article I wrote made her cry on the treadmill in the middle of her morning workout. "I saw myself in your writing," she said. Later that night, an acquaintance stole me away at a party, where the ratio was at best 80/20 women to men: "I never thought it would end up this way," the very pretty brunette told me. "I can't believe I'm turning 40 next month and this is my life."
"All the single women I know are fabulous," a 50-something divorced mom and business colleague said over the phone. "I was in a meeting yesterday and looked around the room. Each woman was in your shoes. It's a different time now than in my day. Maybe you have more financial freedom and social acceptance to wait for the right guy, but the right guys don't seem to be coming along."
"I have a friend who is 45, and she's involved with this guy, madly in love," said another business colleague, a married mom of two, later in the week. "But he doesn't want more children. And all she's talked about since I've known her is how badly she wants to be a mother. And we all know she'd make an extraordinary mom. How can she stay with him if he doesn't want kids? How can she give that up?" "She's in love," I said. "She chose love. She knows what she's potentially giving up. But she's found love, let her have it." I realize I've stepped over the line, but those who have found love and have had children tend to be laissez-faire about their good fortune. "We just never thought she'd choose not to have children," she added. "She didn't choose not to have children, she chose to have children with a man she loves and when that didn't happen, she kept the love," I explained.
I'm burying my feet in the sand. "If you don't do something soon, you'll never be a mother," my friend warns. "I know," I reply with a sigh. "I am aware of my age and fertility. But I have grieved that I won't ever be a young mom. I've gotten over that I probably won't be an older first-time mom, either. I have made a choice not to have a baby on my own. Having a baby on my own is not something I ever imagined, dreamed of, desired, nor is it something I believe I am capable of. It doesn't mean it's not heartbreaking. It doesn't mean I don't still have hope I'll have a baby. It means I am holding out to have a baby with a man I love."
"But what if love never comes?" she adds. "What if Mr. Perfect never arrives?" "I'm not waiting for Mr. Perfect. I'm not even waiting for Mr. Perfect-For-Me," I argue, digging my heels even deeper into the sand. "I am waiting for love. I am waiting for love with all its bumps and bruises and imperfections and hard times and good times and over-the-moon-times and laughter and intimacy and.... and I simply haven't found that love yet. Or I haven't found it when he was ready for it. But I know without a doubt that I deserve love. I deserve to have my heart skip a beat when I merely think of him. I deserve to be held like the world is standing still around us. I believe in love. I believe when I meet him he will make every lonely day I waited worth it.
"It hasn't happened on the timeline that I expected. And it's possible it will come too late for motherhood. And you're right, it may never come at all," I say, hoping it isn't true.
"However, I can say this," I add. "I've never been happier with who I am. I feel more 'me' than I've ever known me to be. I've never been more proud of my strengths or more self-aware of my weaknesses. I have made mistakes. Big mistakes. I have taken risks. Big risks. I have done things I never imagined I could do. I have met people I never imagined I'd ever meet. I have put everything on the line to live my life to its potential and I am living an extraordinary life. This is me. And I am the very best version of me I have ever been. "I am ready for him. And when he meets me, he will know he's met the best of me. And together we will be the best of us. In the meantime, I am waiting. I am waiting. I am waiting for love."
The tide comes in and washes the sand off my feet and I'm reminded that it's only a matter of time. I know many single moms by choice and I have the utmost respect for them. My choice not to try to have a baby on my own is not a reflection or judgment of any sort on their extraordinary choice to be mothers. I admire them to the utmost, truly. I only wish I had the courage they posses.

Debt Ceiling & Budget Deficit Debate -- The Secret Root of the 'Problems'
Asher Edelman
Founder, ArtAssure LLC
Though the handouts to the larger banks have exceeded a trillion dollars over the five years of the QE programs most, if not all, of these institutions remain underwater if their assets were to be marked to the market.
Comments Republicans Want Smaller Government? Opt-Out of Those Dirty Socialist Programs - What Is Stopping You?
Leslie K. Stein
Advocate for Education, Equal Rights and the Environment. Engineer; Project Manager, and proud mom!
We know the shutdown is not about fiscal responsibility. If it was, Republicans would not have run up the deficit under W by trillions of dollars with two unpaid wars, unpaid Medicare prescription plan, and the Bush tax cuts.

Why a Trillion Dollar Coin May Not Be a Crazy Idea After All
Sanjay Sanghoee
Banker, political and business commentator; author of 'Killing Wall Street' (www.sanghoee.com)
Let's not forget that even if the debt ceiling debate does eventually end positively, the 2011 fiasco resulted in a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, and given how crazy Washington is right now we may be better off protecting our present than betting on our future.

Comments What Reid, Pelosi, and Obama Should Say Now
Chris Weigant
Political writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com
If there was some underlying "cut deficits" strategy to the Republican shutdown, then why would the House have passed a budget bill on the brink of the shutdown which increased the debt by $29 billion?

The Age of Oversupply: Good Argument Tough Sell
Dean Baker
Co-director, CEPR; author, 'The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive'
Daniel Alpert makes a compelling case that the U.S. and the world are stuck in a serious crisis of insufficient demand. Alpert is focused on the government spending route to restoring full employment, which is great, but this is not the only possible route.

The $4 Billion Question: Do We Value JPMorgan More Than Consumer Protection?
Francisco Enriquez
Federal Tax and Budget Associate, U.S. PIRG
Is $4 billion in taxpayer money better spent subsidizing JPMorgan's alleged criminal activity or funding the federal agency charged with defending consumers from dangerous financial products?

Tea Party: They Don't Believe in Science, They Don't Know History, They Don't Do Math -- But They Are Obsessed With Extremism
Leslie K. Stein
Advocate for Education, Equal Rights and the Environment. Engineer; Project Manager, and proud mom!
This conservative, austere budget has been rejected for months. Their goal is not really about defunding ObamaCare. Their goal was to force their extreme agenda onto the American people.
Comments Debt Default: The Only Way to Get to Full Employment?
Dean Baker
Co-director, CEPR; author, 'The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive'
We have been repeatedly warned that the dollar could lose its status as the world's reserve currency in the event of default. While this is a dubious claim (will countries rush to the euro?), it would actually be good news if it were true.
