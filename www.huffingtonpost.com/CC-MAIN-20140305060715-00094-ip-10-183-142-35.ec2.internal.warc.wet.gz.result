North Dakota may be the next state where voters will be asked to slap down their local legislature. The bone of contention is nothing less than the future of the University of North Dakota nickname, the Fighting Sioux.
Efforts are under way to seek a statewide referendum, as well as a state constitutional amendment, to overturn a brand-new law that itself overturned a somewhat less recent law requiring the university to keep the Fighting Sioux nickname. The Grand Forks Herald reported that a Minot, N.D., lawyer who supports the nickname is trying to overturn the latest decision by the state legislature and Gov. Jack Dalrymple. Dalrymple signed a bill passed by the legislature last week to finalize efforts to repeal the nickname by shifting decision-making authority back to the state Board of Higher Education. The earlier law had stripped the board of its power over the nickname. The whole kerfuffle was set off by NCAA regulations regarding the use of Native American names for college sports teams and potential fines that the university faced if it kept the nickname in place. The latest law was driven by the threat that North Dakota would not be admitted to the Big Sky Conference and not be allowed to participate in playoff games. According to the Grand Forks Herald:
Reed Soderstrom, a Minot attorney representing nickname supporters in the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe, said the group plans a ballot measure putting the question of UND retaining or dropping the name and logo to a statewide vote next year.
"It's the right thing to do, and I'm very confident we can get the signatures we need," he said Thursday. "We really need to show the NCAA a united front, and we need to give Standing Rock citizens of North Dakota the right to vote."
A constitutional amendment would need 27,000 signatures to get on the ballot. A referendum to repeal the law would require fewer signatures, but they would need to be collected within 90 days, according to the Herald. The Spirit Lake tribe in North Dakota has also filed a federal lawsuit to block the changing of the nickname, which the tribe supports. The nickname debate became a centerpiece of North Dakota politics this year, dominating the state's regular legislative session at the beginning of 2011. A special legislative session in November saw the nickname debate placed on the agenda next to such issues as housing, flood protection, health care and redistricting. Nationwide, the use of referendums to overturn state laws, a century-old product of the Progressive movement, has been on the rise in the last year. Earlier this month, Ohio voters overturned the state's controversial redistricting law, and Maine voters rejected a new law eliminating the state's same-day voter registration. Ohio Democrats are currently collecting signatures for referendums to repeal the state's new voting law and its new congressional district map. If the Fighting Sioux constitutional amendment qualifies for the 2012 ballot in North Dakota -- where it will join the expected governor's race between Dalrymple and state Senate Minority Leader Rick Taylor (D-Towner) as well as open-seat races for the U.S. House and Senate -- it will be just one of a number of high-profile referendum fights around the country. In addition to the Ohio issues, the 2012 ballot is likely to include other referendums on voting rights, along with potential votes on privatizing liquor sales in either Oregon or Idaho. The liquor measures would be similar to a law passed this month in Washington. FOLLOW HUFFPOST POLITICS

In this March 1, 2012 photo provided by Smith College, Debra Shaver, dean of admission, sits next to stacks of applications to the Smith College Class of 2016 from prospective students in Northhampton, Mass. Smith is among just a few colleges that invite parents to submit letters on behalf of their children (either as part of the application itself, or in a follow-up invitation after the application is received).

-- The letter recommending Christianne Beasley for admission to Smith College didn't come from the most unbiased of sources. But there was no disputing the writer knew this applicant as well as anyone.
"Christianne and Smith seem to be a perfect match," wrote Nancy Beasley, four years ago, on behalf of her only daughter, now a Smith senior. She described Christianne's "grace and dignity," and explained why she thought the prestigious and diverse Northampton, Mass., women's college was the perfect fit for the girl she'd raised.
Smith is among just a few colleges – among them nearby Mt. Holyoke and Holy Cross in Massachusetts, St. Anselm in New Hampshire, and the University of Richmond – that invite parents to submit letters on behalf of their children (either as part of the application itself, or in a follow-up invitation after the application is received). At Smith, finalizing this month the 640 or so members of the Class of 2016 from more than 4,300 applications, a little less than half include a parental letter. The college takes pains to emphasize such letters are optional and won't make or break a decision.
What do parents tell colleges about their flesh and blood? Rarely anything bad, to be sure (though sadly, it does happen). A fair share burst with predictably over-the-top pride in their children's virtues, which are dated back to infancy, and in some cases, utero (a few years ago, Smith decided to impose a single-page limit).
But there's a reason Smith has stuck with the process for about 20 years now, despite the extra work, says Smith's director of admission, Deb Shaver. Sometimes parents offer just the kind of color that can bring to life a candidate whose full personality is hidden in a portrait painted only with grades, test scores and traditional recommendations letters from teachers and guidance counselors.
"You might think they do nothing but brag," Shaver said. "But parents really nail their kids. They really get to the essence of what their daughter is about in a way we can't get anywhere else."
It's also an acknowledgment that in the backlash in admissions against (admittedly epidemic) helicopter parenting, the pendulum might have swung a little too far.
After all, it's parents who may have the best view of what's really great about their children.
"We get to this point and say, `You can't be driving the bus, you need to be in the backseat,'" Shaver said. "It's all true, and yet I think parents can provide texture to those applications that can't be found anywhere else.
"Who knows a kid better than their mother and father?" she asked.
For Christianne Beasley, a letter from Mom was the perfect closing argument to her case that Smith was the place for her.
"Sometimes there's that bad connotation of the overbearing parents who feel the need to control their kids' decision," she said. "In my case, it was the opposite. It was to make sure I had the best application possible and Smith saw the best part of me."
For her mom, it was a chance to participate, but also share something she knew nobody else would have seen: the way her daughter lit up when she first visited Smith's campus.
"You know how they say when you see your wedding dress or your house, you just knew it's the one? She just knew it was the one," said Nancy Beasley, of Westbrook, Maine. "Nobody else would have known."
David Hawkins, director of public policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said there are reasons why very few colleges solicit parental letters. One is sheer logistical burden; most colleges don't have the staff to do more than execute a fairly straightforward admissions formula of grades and test scores. It's no accident that the practice is found only at small liberal arts colleges which take special pride in getting to know their students.
And colleges are mainly concerned with evaluating candidates academically. For that, a parental letter offers little credible guidance.
But perhaps the biggest worry, which Hawkins shares, is "advantaging the advantaged," to use the catch phrase in admissions. The question is whether the practice discourages lower-income applicants from applying, particularly those from non-English speaking families, or places such students at a disadvantage if they disproportionately decline to do so.
"Asking the parents to contribute an essay to their children's application may be a barrier for some populations," he said.
Shaver doesn't have data, but says she's confident Smith's parental letters span a broad range (Smith, in fact, has a strong record attracting low-income students; 22 percent receive Pell Grants, meaning they come from low-income families. That's a higher proportion than at virtually any other highly selective college).
Often, it's lower-income families who make the most meaningful efforts to participate in the process. One mother submitted a video; her daughter translated. One father drove several hours to campus and walked into the admissions office without an appointment, demanding to see Shaver.
"He said, `I don't know English very well and you asked for this recommendation, so I'm going to talk it to you,'" she recalled.
Nanci Tessier, who worked in Smith's admissions office in the mid-1990s just after it started the practice, has been a kind of missionary for parental letters, taking the practice with her first to St. Anselm and later to the University of Richmond, a school of about 3,000 undergraduates where she's vice president of enrollment management.
Parental letters are often the best window into a student's soul, she said. She recalled one letter recounting an applicant's response to the death of her father in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Nowhere else in the application had that come up.
Most stories and letters are less dramatic. But sometimes even mundane ones can offer something to help a sympathetic admissions officer make a case before the committee.
"She is honest to a fault (and I mean to a fault), the least pretentious vegetarian and recycler I've ever encountered," reads one of several letters Richmond provided as examples, with names redacted. The letter went on to recall the girl as a precocious 3-year-old who proclaimed, "Dad, I dance to the beat of a different drum."
Who exactly are such letters for? It's hard to say.
Applicants, of course, get one more way to make an impression in a crowded field.
Colleges like Richmond and Smith can get a fuller picture of a prospective student. By inviting such letters, they also signal to applicants that they're the kinds of schools that care about students in all their dimensions. Their admissions officers, glassy-eyed after a winter spent slogging through thousands of applications, get often-moving essays that can remind them why they're in the field (Shaver keeps a box of tissues by her desk for particular tear-jerkers. The most memorable for her was a father's poem).
But parents also seem to feel grateful for the opportunity. Often they feel shut out of the admissions process, either through lack of familiarity or – at the other extreme – warnings to give their kids space. Yet many crave acknowledgment that, yes, it's may be their children who are applying, but by gosh they had something to do with making those kids who they are.
"When she basically said, `I'm going to be doing this college stuff and if I need your help I'll ask you,' I figured she'd be doing it on her own," Nancy Beasley said. "But I did like the fact that we at least had the opportunity with one of the colleges, Smith, to actually say something to them."
And sometimes, the assignment can force a moment – and create a memento – that will only be fully appreciated later.
In the spring of 2000, overwhelmed with applications to nearly a dozen colleges, Stephanie Soscia didn't think much about the simple, hand-written letter her mother Nancy wrote on behalf of her Smith application. But she kept it.
"Ever since she was very young, Stephanie has understood responsibility," the letter reads. "At the age of 8 she proposed that in order to receive an allowance she would get up earlier in the morning to help with the pre-school children I cared for."
It probably made little difference in Smith's decision to admit Stephanie. But after she graduated in 2004, when her mother began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, Stephanie reread the letter and realized how much it meant to her. Two summers ago, she carried it with her on a 350-mile bike ride to raise money for Alzheimer's research.
"She never went to college, and my father never graduated from high school," said Soscia, who earned a doctorate in neurobiology and now works on Alzheimer's research at Harvard. "She wanted to be part of the process but she really didn't know how to contribute."
When Stephanie rediscovered the letter, "I loved reading it," she said. "I cry every time."
"When you lose a parent either because of death or in my case a debilitating brain disease, sometimes there are things that go left unsaid," she said. "I find I can get closure through that letter. I know that during our time together her love for me was strong, and she really put her all into it."

'2012 Billboard Music Awards': Tributes To Robin Gibb, Donna Summer, Adam Yauch And Whitney Houston
There were several tributes to fallen musical icons on "The 2012 Billboard Music Awards" (Sun., 8 p.m. ET on ABC), including an impromptu moment of silence for Robin Gibb, the Bee Gees singer who passed away the day of the broadcast. Natasha Bedingfield sang a beautiful tribute to Donna Summer -- at least until the voiceover started talking over her and they cut to commercial in the middle of the song.
Wiz Khalifa gave a shout-out to MCA (Adam Yauch) of the Beastie Boys before giving out the award for Best Duo/Group -- it went to LMFAO. Later, the hip-hop pioneer got a full tribute from Cee Lo Green and Goodie Mob. But the most moving tribute came for one of the greatest vocal artists in the history of popular music.
Whitney Houston posthumously received the Millennium Award. Her daughter Bobbi Kristina and sister-in-law Pat came up to accept on her her behalf. Houston was also honored by Whoopi Goldberg, with performances of her music by John Legend and her "Sparkle" co-star Jordin Sparks taking on her signature anthem, "I Will Always Love You."

Monica Medina: How Whitney Saved My Life
Far from family and friends, Whitney Houston's music became my lifeline, my reason to keep going.	Lisa Kaas Boyle: Robin Gibb and the Soundtrack to My Life
I feel an electric charge, like I am John Travolta walking down that hall, not a scared 13-year-old girl. I make it to my locker with a little smile on my face, and start twirling the combination to the lock. "I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm Stayin' Alive."	David Wild: A Chart-Topping Playlist for "The Billboard Music Awards"
The Billboard Music Awards reminds me that sometimes the public actually is right. Here then is my list of some of my favorite songs that all hit #1 on Billboard's's Hot 100 since that chart started in the late Fifties.	Matthew Lynch, Ed.D.: Living Legends: Paying Homage to the Late-Great Whitney Houston
As an 80's baby, I remember attending family gatherings in which Houston's music, among others, was a mainstay. Young girls wanted to be her, and young boys had a crush on her, including me.	Charles Karel Bouley: Didn't She Almost Have It All
Whitney Houston's end is one many will say they saw coming, that they're surprised it didn't happen years before. No matter the final cause, to some, it won't be a surprise. But surprise or not, at 48, it's a tragedy.	Carrie White: Bad Day for Disco
I've been telling all my friends that when I die, I want to be cremated, my ashes put in a disco ball that can be bounced and passed around the room during my funeral while Donna Summer's "Last Dance" is blaring over the loudspeaker.	Around the Web:

A man in Brighton, UK, reported seeing what he thought was a dimensional vortex in this neighborhood. City officials are skeptical.
Either someone in Brighton, U.K., has been watching too much Doctor Who or the city has a serious wormhole problem.
A concerned resident recently reported that a “wormhole or vortex” had opened up on Montreal Road -- a "portal to other times, places and dimensions," the Argus reported.
The local made the report to a website called "Fix My Street," but provided little other information for this reason: "I would have investigated further but I was concerned my little dog would be sucked into it."
Either the alleged dimensional portal is getting worse or people are having a lot of fun filing crank reports.
"I went past the other day and it seems to have got worse –- it is now emitting an unsettling yellow light and a large snake appears to be emerging from the wall," an eyewitness said, according to the Metro.
City officials said they will not be investigating the complaint, TNT Magazine reported. Also on HuffPost:	Loading Slideshow
Melbourne, Australia, Feb. 2013This is a composite image of how three alleged UFOs maneuvered about in the sky over Melbourne, Australia, in early February, 2013. The final verdict isn't in yet on whether they're birds, aircraft, balloons, bugs or something truly unidentified.LanternsThese candle-lit Chinese lanterns can rise high into the sky and are often mistaken for UFOs.Exploding Weather Balloons, Not UFOsOn Dec. 20, 2012, a bright, circular object (pictured at the top of this composite image) was videotaped exploding in the skies above Sacramento, Calif. It wasn't immediately identified, resulting in speculation that it was either an alien spacecraft, military top secret weapon, runaway planet, North Korean satellite, among others. Within a short period of time, it became apparent that this was a weather balloon. The bottom part of this image shows such a balloon as it ascended over Tampa Bay, Fla., on July 2, 2012, and exploded in an identical manner as the Sacramento object, probably much to the dismay of all true ET believers out there.Boomerang UFO composite images -- 10-5-12This is a composite of images shot by two eyewitnesses of a boomerang-shaped UFO they reported seeing over their Burbank, Calif., home on Oct. 5, 2012. Mutual UFO Network photo/video analyst Marc Dantonio concluded the object was likely "a balloon, floating on the wind that has collapsed in half."Changing UFO Pattern -- Warren, Mich. 1-10-13This four-image series of lights in the sky was recorded over Warren, Mich., on Jan. 10, 2013. The lights were seen changing into several patterns. The most logical explanation for these types of UFOs is a series of balloons or lanterns.UFOs Over EarthThis composite image shows four different times that alleged UFO were photographed above Earth by either space shuttles or the International Space Station. The big question is whether or not they are truly unidentified objects or if they are more likely reflections from spacecraft windows, meteors or fast-moving spacecraft-generated debris.
Pink UFOs Or Lens Flares?What appear to be pink-red UFOs are actually lens flares from the Google Earth street view camera as it snapped images in Texas (left) and New Mexico (right). Lens flares ArizonaThese two flying saucer-shaped, pink-colored lens flares were created by the Google Maps camera as it drove through locations in Sedona, Ariz. (left) and Flagstaff, Ariz. (right). The images were snapped in April 2009. Submitted to HuffPost by trenna.Lens flare Whiteriver, Ariz.This skybound lens flare was created by a Google Maps camera in June 2008 over Whiteriver, Ariz. Submitted to Huffington Post by Cheryl Weeks.Lens flare Gulfport, Miss. This very Earthbound lens flare was created by a Google Maps camera in November 2007 at Gulfport, Miss. Submitted to Huffington Post by Jenni Parker.Lens flare Eureka Springs, Ark.This seemingly grounded lens flare was created by a Google Maps camera in January 2008 at Eureka Springs, Ark. Submitted to Huffington Post by SE.Lens flare Escanaba, Mich.This lens flare appears to be following a car. The Google Maps image was created in October 2008 at Escanaba, Mich. Submitted to Huffington Post by Mary Robinson.Cincinnati Skydivers NOT UFOs Sept. 28, 2012On the night of Sept. 28, 2012, a group of strange-looking lights appeared in the sky near Cincinnati, Ohio. First there was one, then, two, then three lights, slowly descending. It turns out, however, that these lights were originating from a group of skydivers performing a pyrotechnics jump at the La Salle High School homecoming event.Weather PhenomenonSome UFO sightings may be due to a natural phenomenon known as sprites, like this one shown from 2006. "Lightning from [a] thunderstorm excites the electric field above, producing a flash of light called a sprite," said geophysicist Colin Price.CloudsClouds: Saucer-shaped or "lenticular" clouds that form at high altitudes have been confused with UFOs.Blimps or Advertising BalloonsBlimps or advertising balloons: These can look like flying saucers from some angles, especially at night.Sunken Ship in the Baltic SeaOn June 19th the Swedish-based diving company Ocean Explorer discovered something they've never quite seen before. They were exploring in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland looking for sunken treasures when a very unusual image suddenly appeared on the sonar. A 197 feet diameter cylinder shaped object was discovered at the depth of approximately 275 feet which resembles the Millennium Falcon from the movie Star Wars.Baltic Sea UFO 1An image released on June 15, 2012, shows a close-up view of the unidentified object sitting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.Baltic Sea UFO 2Close-up of rock bed that forms the Baltic Sea UFO, which still mystifies researchers.Baltic Sea UFO 3One of several odd stone circle formations, sitting on top of the unidentified object at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.Antarctic UFO -- Aug. 10, 2012A circular UFO hovers above the Neumayer-Station III research facility in Antarctica on Aug. 10, 2012. Theories ranging from a simple weather balloon to a more elaborate ship from another planet have run the Internet gamut. The next slide shows a closeup of the object.Antarctic UFO Closeup -- Aug. 10, 2012This is a closeup of the UFO from the previous slide. No official explanation has been offered about the object.Manufactured UFO -- 2011Pictured is a quad copter -- a deliberately manufactured UFO created by special effects wizard Marc Dantonio for a National Geographic special, "The Truth Behind: UFOs," which aired in December 2011. On the left is what the small device looks like resting on the ground, measuring 4 feet in circumference. At right, is how it appeared behind a tree in the night sky.Police Dashboard Camera In TexasIn February of 2012, this fireball was captured by a Texas police chief's A dashboard camera. F.A.A. say this was probably a meteor, falling to Earth. .MeteorsMeteors: Space debris can create a spectacular light show when it burns through the Earth's atmosphere, and sometimes reported as UFOs.
Civilian or Military AircraftCivilian or military aircraft: Planes can look mysterious at night or in certain light conditions, thus confusing an observer.

TV News
Karen Elaine Harrelson, 48, and Gregory L. Stambaugh, 57, allegedly stabbed each other over an argument about the "American Idol" finale.
You are under Seacrest. When a couple in Pennsylvania couldn't agree over which contestant -- Candice Glover or Kree Harrison -- should win this year's American Idol finale, they allegedly stabbed each other. Only now, The York Dispatch reports, the two can't agree on who stabbed whom first. Karen Elaine Harrelson, 48, and Gregory L. Stambaugh, 57, were arrested after the drunken fight Wednesday, May 15.
According to the affidavit obtained by CBS 21, Stambaugh told authorities that Harrelson started drinking at 5 a.m., "and was drinking beer and a lot of tequila throughout the day." He, on the other hand, claims he did not start drinking until noon and that he "was drinking beer and had a pint of Scotch."
Both alleged that the other went into the kitchen during the argument, grabbed a knife, and began the stabbing. When police responded, the pair were on the front porch, bloody and still arguing, CBS 21 reported. Harrelson and Stambaugh are now being held in York County Prison, according to an inmate roster. The Associated Press reported that authorities slapped the two with assault charges.
According to the Dispatch, both were treated at a local hospital for minor injuries. Seacrest out. H/T Gawker

The GOP's Challenge to Win Back Young Voters

In Jon Stewart's 2004 satirical textbook on government and politics, America: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction, the chapter on elections features an illustration of a graveyard of political parties, complete with an archway sign reading "abandon political viability all ye who enter here." There, next to the Whig and Bull Moose parties, was a freshly dug grave with a tombstone reading "Democratic Party 1828 - ".
Oh, how things have changed.
Today's Republican Party finds itself in dire straits, but the short term challenges the party faces also come with a longer-term concern: the GOP's recent poor performance among young voters. In the 2008 election, Obama defeated McCain among young voters 66-32. Of even more concern for the GOP, young voters kept voting for Democrats down the ballot, with 63% of those 18-29 voting for Democratic house candidates compared to 34% for the Republicans. This is not simply an isolated, Obama-induced phenomenon. In 2006, young voters picked Democratic house candidates over Republicans by a 60-38 margin. But it's also not as if young voters have always been more likely to call themselves Democrats; even when more identified as "liberal" than "conservative" during the 1992 election of Bill Clinton, there were still more 18-29 year olds identifying as Republican, perhaps a lingering effect of the Reagan years. To say that young voters are always more Democratic or that 2008's poor performance among 18-29 year olds is the product of Obama alone is to underestimate the gravity of the situation. The problem is a serious one, and the Republican Party would do well to pay attention. Young voters who start voting today and have a bad taste in their mouth about the GOP are likely to look at politics through that lens for years to come. Gallup just released a study that supports this theory of how people identify with political parties; those who came of political age in the Reagan era were much more likely to identify as Republican than those who came before or after. The events of today matter tomorrow and for decades to come.
But what can be done with young voters? Much of the current discussion has focused around leveraging technology or moderating on social positions. But the idea that the GOP can get all of their members to sign up for Twitter, flip its position on gay marriage and suddenly have young voters rushing to join the party misses the point. The problem is that the Republican Party today has failed to articulate a vision for America that resonates with the values of the Millenial Generation. Luckily for the GOP, there is still a chance to win these voters back.
In order to begin that effort, the GOP needs to have a positive message and vision that focuses on outcomes that matter to young voters. Right now, a lot of what Republicans are talking about is "less taxes" and "smaller government." But young voters are less convinced than older generations that the government tends to be inefficient and wasteful. One of the things that the Clinton years of relative peace and prosperity did was to make young voters less likely to view "small government" as a positive end in and of itself. This isn't to say that there isn't a compelling story to tell about the virtues of keeping a check on expanding government size, but right now the Republican Party isn't telling it. Instead there are calls for smaller government, less spending, and then... full stop. No outcome, no argument for why that is a good thing, just a silence that expects voters see the virtue in the process alone.
Democrats may pass policies that are irresponsible but if the Republican Party doesn't provide a sensible alternative, there's no reason for young voters to be attracted to the GOP. And when I say "sensible alternative," I don't just mean talking about the process of the policies, I mean talking about the outcome. For instance, on the issue of size of government, the question to answer now is "How is my life better because the government is small?" Explaining why Republican policies are worth supporting requires a clear articulation of the positive outcome of those policies. This is perhaps most true for young voters.
The other side of component is that the vision must be positive. If Republicans make these next elections all about the Democrats, with a strategy centered on trotting out tried and tired negative attacks through the traditional 30-second "dark picture and spooky voice" television spot, they lose. And not just among young voters. It is that simple.
Here is where new technology has a role to play. New tools for connecting with voters -- blogs, social media, YouTube, you name it -- should be used by the Republican Party in order to have a fighting chance at reaching young voters, who increasingly are heading online and are getting personally involved in campaigns through the internet. But joining Twitter doesn't guarantee you will have an army of adoring followers. And if a party and its candidates don't have anything compelling to say, it is all just empty noise anyhow. The medium is not the entire message, and one without the other doesn't have a fighting chance with the Millenials.
Longer term, the Republican Party has to confront the issue of diversity. If the Republican Party retains a brand as the party tailor-made for conservative older white males, it will not survive for long. Consider the fact that younger voters represent a more ethnically diverse cohort than other generations. The issue of winning the youth vote is more and more inextricably linked to winning support among Hispanics and African-Americans. There's also the issue of ideological diversity. Some have said that the GOP needs to move one way or another on the ideological spectrum in order to come back to power, but I see that as a false choice. More than fixating on moving the party one way or another, the priority should be expanding the reach of the GOP to reassemble a majority coalition. Former NJ Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, an outspoken GOP moderate, recently said "I am not saying to Christian conservatives, 'There is no place for you.' I am saying, 'Please stop saying there is no place for us.'" The Republican Party should focus its efforts on creating a diverse coalition that can win again, and those efforts need to include bringing young voters into the fold.
In the end, the Republican Party has a long road back with young voters, but the difficulty of the task only underscores the need to undertake it. The political winds have changed since the 2004 election for a whole host of reasons. And without taking proactive steps to repair the standing of the GOP with young voters, there is a great risk that the election of 2008 will echo in election returns for decades to come.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces rising challenges to her leadership of the austerity regime her country has imposed on the weak sisters of the eurozone in exchange for German-funded bailouts of their sovereign due-bills (many of which are owed to German banks, by the way). First, she is being challenged to allow consideration of using the Euro Stability Mechanism funds to strengthen directly the capital position of Spanish, crushed under the weight of bad real estate loans and now a run on deposits, like the U.S. TARP program, rather than indirectly through Spain itself. This latter course would, of course, actually increase sovereign debt (as happened already in Ireland) to knife-edge levels, but it also would also trigger a "troika" receivership structure on Spain's budget with German-style visitation rights, which Merkel's citizens like the feel of. So far, her answer to this proposal remains "nein."
Second, the chancellor is being asked to relent in her opposition to the European Central Bank taking direct action to prop the market for Spanish sovereign debt by renewing its limited but heretofore effective purchases in the market to keep the market interest rates Spain must pay at a level its GDP can sustain. Again, so far, the message from Merkel remains "nein" because Germany's orthodox central bankers don't like this idea (strangely, as it would probably spare German some embarrassing losses on their books later).
Third, Ms. Merkel is being urged to open the door to quick consideration of creating a mechanism for the issue of eurozone bonds that would have the effect of "federalizing" debt, coupled with a new central authority that would monitor and harmonize the fiscal and taxation policies of the various member countries to assure the credit markets that what has happened with sovereign debt in the currency union would never happen again. The Germans like the latter part of this idea (central controls) but aren't too wild as yet about eurobonds -- again, the answer remains "nein." For the moment, then, the United States economy, which trades extensively with Europe, is held hostage to the "Just Say No Chancellor," who seems to believe that doing what financial markets are begging you to do is a sign of weakness -- that governments should not let bondholders push them around. We can forgive a physicist raised in Communist East Germany for having an instinctive loathing of bond markets; even Bill Clinton had to be schooled by James Carville not to pick a unnecessary fight with the bond market. But this is getting ridiculous. Sometimes it seems that the chancellor would rather go down in history as the German who sank the euro rather than appear to be following a made-in-America idea (a TARP-like direct rescue of the impacted Spanish banks in order to stop the bleeding and give the markets time to heal). Yet she seems willing to make the same mistake, however, that U.S. officials made when they said there was no legal basis for stepping in to save Lehman (at a cost of a few billion dollars and an increase in moral hazard) and instead would up the costs nearly a trillion dollars in bailouts plus the Great Recession and the fiscal cost of stimulus. Maybe Merkel is right that there is no direct authority for the ECB to do massive sovereign debt purchases, or for the eurozone countries to agree to underwrite bank deposits -- but at some point, it must be clear that the euro treaties should not be interpreted as a suicide pact!
Nothing much can happen in terms of changing Merkel's mind before the French and Greek elections on Sunday, June 17. But perhaps meanwhile another vision of Merkel's mind will emerge -- that she has indeed absorbed the great lesson of capitalist negotiations -- she who comes to the table as the loudest "no" is the one who eventually defines the "yes"! We can only hope.
