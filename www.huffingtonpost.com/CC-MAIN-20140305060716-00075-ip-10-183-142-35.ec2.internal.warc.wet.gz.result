'Inglourious Basterds' Sequel? Brad Pitt Says Quentin Tarantino Has Spoken About It

After shifting between art house and major commercial success for nearly two decades, Quentin Tarantino hit it huge in 2008 with his World War II revenge film, "Inglourious Basterds." A critical smash, the flick took in $320 million worldwide, obliterating his previous high of $180 million for "Kill Bill: Volume I," and won Christoph Waltz an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
So in this Hollywood climate of sequels, prequels and re-dos, why not make another? According to Brad Pitt, that just may happen.
Pitt, who starred in the film as Aldo Raine, the Army First Lieutenant that leads Jewish-American soldiers on a campaign of Nazi scalp collecting (100 per soldier, to be exact), sat down with NPR to discuss his career ahead of the release of his latest film, "Moneyball." When the conversation turned to talk of a scar on his character's neck, Pitt spilled that Tarantino plans on explaining the mark -- in the future.
"[Tarantino] said it would never be explained in [Inglourious Basterds] and if he ever does what he called a prequel-slash-sequel, then we'll reveal it then," he told Fresh Air. "He talks about [a sequel], but he's got several things percolating at once."
That jives with what Tarantino said all the way back in 2009, when he told Vulture that he was already 40 pages deep into writing a sequel. He's done sequels before; Tarantino's "Kill Bill" saga has seen two hit films already released into theaters, with a third volume set for a 2014 release. The director is currently working on "Django Unchained," the Jamie Foxx and Waltz-starring story of slave redemption.
Pitt also spoke about his personal life, including the decision to sell the first photos of his children. Back in 2008, he and Angelina Jolie sold the first pictures of twins Knox and Vivienne to Hello! and People Magazine for a reported $14 million.
"I know some of these guys who are in that 'stalkerazzi' world, and you really have to separate them from the paparazzi in our industry. That's another breed. They have their heroes who got the big, scandalous shot, which just promotes more of that," Pitt explained. "It's a very strange thing to be selling photos of something that's very intimate and personal. And those of which you want to protect. We have to plan an escape every day just to get out of the house -- kind of a Mission Impossible with decoys, and that's the life we live in, and that's the one we asked for. But we knew there was a bounty on our head ... and we know the lengths they go to to get that shot. So we figured, 'Let's cut it off in the beginning,' and instead of that money going to people I do not respect, we would make some good out of it."
The money was paid as donations to Pitt and Jolie's charitable foundation. Pitt's fame and drew aren't waning, either; his "Moneyball" took in nearly $7 million at the box office Friday night and is on pace to open number one.

Crime News
ATLANTA — A low-flying police helicopter searching for a runaway boy hit a power line pole before it plummeted to the ground and exploded, killing both officers on board but leaving those on the ground unharmed.
Federal authorities were investigating what caused the chopper to crash into power lines along on a busy city street. Electricity was knocked out to nearby homes and businesses in an area filled with shopping plazas, fast-food restaurants and a gas station.
The 9-year-old boy was found wandering on a city street a couple of hours after the crash late Saturday night, Atlanta police spokesman Officer John Chafee said Sunday. He ran away after being scolded by his mother.
The two officers were identified Sunday as pilot Richard J. Halford, 48, of Lithia Springs, who had been with the department for 26 years, and Shawn A. Smiley, 40, of Lithonia, a tactical flight officer who joined the department two years ago.
Atlanta Police Chief George Turner praised the two officers as public servants who died honorably in the search for the missing boy. Both men were fathers. Smiley had three children under the age of 10.
"Every day, they provided air support for our officers, assisting in major events and searches for suspects and missing persons," Turner said in a news release. "Their value to our citizens and our officers on the street is incalculable."
The families have asked for privacy, and trust funds have been set up at Wells Fargo bank locations to help them, said Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos.
Their deaths shook not only the police force, but the entire city.
"It's sad. It's tragic ... for someone to lose their lives trying to find a kid, trying to keep another family together," Rodney Christian, 22, said as he and more than a dozen others looked at the scene in the early morning darkness Sunday. Christian lamented the tragedy and thought of his 1-month-old baby.
"It makes me want to rush home and get back to my kid."
The wreckage of the OH-6A helicopter had already been moved as investigators worked to piece together what happened, said Eric M. Weiss, a spokesman with the National Transportation Safety Board.
Part of the helicopter's landing gear had to be removed from the cables with the help of the power company.
The NTSB investigators were going over maintenance records and had talked to witnesses.
"They saw the aircraft, they heard the aircraft, and then they saw a flash of light when it hit the pole and then it crashed into the roadway," investigator Ralph Hicks said.
Records with the Federal Aviation Administration showed the helicopter was a Hughes OH-6A manufactured in 1967. The Hughes has historically been a military workhorse.
Atlanta police referred questions about what caused the crash to federal investigators.
Bystander Darryl James, 42, said he had gone with a companion to a check-cashing store Saturday night when he heard the helicopter flying overhead and thought it was rather low.
"The tail end went down and then there was an explosion," James said. He said he tried to get close to the wreckage. "As soon as I got close enough to it, poom! It exploded."
James said people are often waiting at a normally busy bus stop near the crash site, adding, "Thank God nobody was out there."
After the crash, fire trucks and police cars with lights flashing converged on the area, blocking surrounding roads. Police put up yellow crime scene tape and kept bystanders so far back they were unable to see the crash site behind a small rise.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said he was saddened by what he called a "terrible accident."
"We mourn these two brave men and offer our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones," Reed said in a statement.

Donald CavanaughDonald "JC" Cavanaugh was reported missing in Mendocino County, Calif., in March 2005.
Additional information can be found at this link: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/donald-cavanaugh-david-neily-missing_n_4319266.html?utm_source=Alert-blogger&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Email%2BNotifications" target="_blank">www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/donald-cavanaugh-david-neily-missing_n_4319266.html</a>
At the time of his disappearance, Cavanaugh was 63, 5 feet 8 inches tall and 140 pounds. He had gray hair and blue eyes. Anyone with information asked to contact Sgt. Jason Caudillo at (707) 468-3423 or the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office Anonymous tip line at (707) 234-2100.David NeilyDavid Neily disappeared in Mendocino County, Calif., on April 14, 2006.

Neily was 69 years old when he was last seen. He was 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighed 150 pounds, and had gray hair, green eyes and a white beard. He suffered from stunted growth due to a heart murmur, and as a result his legs were not proportional to his body.

Fast Company:	"My cell phone was blowing up. It was 7:30 in the morning, two hours before I usually get up. It kept ringing, buzzing. I finally checked it. People were sending me pictures of the place I bought, the Imagination Station, on fire. Mary and I got in the car and drove over. It's two blocks from where I live, and a small crowd was standing around, watching it burn. I didn't know what to think. Someone suggested it was started by kids shooting off fireworks. I don't know. We didn't have any enemies.
"I had a '95 Ford Explorer that was stolen the morning after the Super Bowl. So Mary called her family--they live downriver--to see if we could borrow the Suburban. We had that for three weeks before it got stolen.

Afghanistan Withdrawal Puts Programs For Women And Girls At Risk, Top Watchdog Warns

Women News
WASHINGTON -- As coalition forces withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014, it will be increasingly difficult to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars intended for reconstruction projects in the country aren't being wasted. And according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the lead watchdog for this effort, programs affecting women and girls are likely to be among those not getting the necessary oversight.
More than 40,000 troops are set to leave, and dozen of bases will close in the next year. As the Washington Post reported on Saturday, without that "protective umbrella," only about 20 percent of the country will be accessible for oversight. In testimony before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on Tuesday, SIGAR John Sopko outlined the challenges he expects to face, including in the area of women's rights. "[T]here will be fewer opportunities for contracting officers, their technical representatives and other oversight personnel to observe and assess the extent to which female beneficiaries of reconstruction programs are receiving services, protected from the many dangers they face, and consulted in the design and implementation of programs intended to meet their needs," said Sopko, according to prepared remarks.
Similarly, Human Rights Watch states on its website, "Many Afghans feel enormous anxiety as the 2014 deadline for withdrawing international combat forces from Afghanistan looms and warlords and other powerbrokers jockey for position. ... The Afghan government's failure to tackle discrimination and respond effectively to violence against women undermines the already perilous state of women's rights."
In a new report, the International Crisis Group also notes that as the April 2014 Afghan presidential election approaches, many Afghan women "are concerned that the hard-won political, economic and social gains achieved since the U.S.-led intervention in 2001 may be rolled back or conceded in negotiations with the insurgents."
Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who previously served as her state's auditor, has made improving oversight of contracts one of her top issues. She told The Huffington Post that Sopko's findings underscore the difficulty that the government will have in keeping watch over contracts moving forward.
"Whether it's a contract to improve women's educational opportunities or build a power plant, we need to act on the hard-learned lessons of the past decade -- that without strong oversight, American dollars will be wasted," she said. "Programs that lack adequate oversight usually fail, and that's not in the best interest of our troops, our mission or the Afghan people we're trying to help.”
The legal status of women in Afghanistan has improved since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. Women now make up 27 percent of Parliament, and girls comprise 40 percent of schoolchildren. Gender equality is enshrined in the constitution, and rape is illegal. But the implementation of these laws is far from perfect, and women and girls still regularly face threats. "Since the formal transfer of the security lead to the [Afghan National Security Forces] in mid-2013, insurgent threats to women have increased," concludes ICG in its report. "Their rights are also under attack from yesterday's warlords, now powerbrokers both within and outside government. Rearming their militias as a hedge against what may happen in the 2014 elections or after the transition and attempting to consolidate their electoral base, including by demonstrating independence from the West, they could undo women's fragile gains."
As an example of a program that could falter as troops pull out, Sopko highlighted the Promoting Gender Equity in National Priority Programs initiative. It's designed to increase education, training and promotion of women in Afghan society. USAID plans to commit $200 million to the program, which is set to begin in the middle of 2014, toward the end of the withdrawal of troops.
USAID has said that PROMOTE is meant to work within existing Afghan structures and won't be dependent on a U.S. troop presence. But Sopko is worried that USAID's ability to oversee the program will be "limited" because the agency must rely on outside contractors to monitor progress. While third-party monitoring is common, Sopko is skeptical of how well it can work in Afghanistan. "SIGAR plans to hold an expert panel on this issue in the coming months and will also initiate an audit next year on USAID's use of third-party monitors in Afghanistan," he told the subcommittee on Tuesday. Heather Barr, an Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch, wrote in August that "the frontline fighters for women's rights in Afghanistan since 2001 have been brave, resilient Afghan women who don't have the luxury of ending their struggle next year."
Sopko said his office will focus on "how the military withdrawal, the decline in donor resources, and the transition to Afghan governance and control of the ANSF will affect reconstruction, including efforts aimed at women and girls."
From fiscal years 2003 through 2010, Congress approved $627 million for the Department of State and USAID to support activities specifically for Afghan women and girls.
According to the Washington Post, at least 15 major reconstruction projects, set to cost more than $1 billion, will likely be beyond the reach of U.S. personnel next year.

Rudy Giuliani And The Price Of MilkWhile running for president in 2007, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/news_theswamp/2007/04/giulianis_price.html">told</a> a reporter at a Montgomery, Ala., supermarket that he estimates "a gallon of milk is probably about a $1.50, a loaf of bread about a $1.25, $1.30, last time I bought one." It must have been a few election cycles since his last trip: The grocery store's website listed milk for $3.38 and bread up to $3.49. Dan Quayle And Single MothersDuring George H.W. Bush's reelection campaign in 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19920521&id=b1tWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NfADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6921,388223" target="_hplink">scoffed</a> at the "Murphy Brown situation," referring to a television character who had a child out of wedlock. Quayle called the Brown story "totally unreal," adding, "A highly paid professional woman [with a baby] ... give me a break." Martha Coakley And Shaking HandsIn a display of aloofness that many political observers say led to her defeat by Republican Scott Brown, Democratic Senate candidate and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley erred in <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0110/Coakley_not_sweating_it.html" target="_hplink">brushing off</a> the idea of ramping up her campaigning. When asked whether she was being too apathetic, she referenced one of Brown's ads and fired back, "As opposed to standing outside Fenway Park? In the cold? Shaking hands?"Spiro Agnew And Poor NeighborhoodsRepublican vice presidential candidate Spiro Agnew, branded as Richard Nixon's go-to guy on cities, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/us/spiro-t-agnew-ex-vice-president-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm" target="_hplink">vowed</a> in 1968 to avoid poor neighborhoods. "If you've seen one slum, you've seen them all," Agnew said.Gerald Ford And TamalesWhile visiting the Alamo in 1976, President Gerald Ford <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/No-one-told-Ford-tamales-need-to-be-unwrapped-1536700.php" target="_hplink">bit</a> into a tamale through the husk, a faux pas later deemed the "Great Tamales Incident."George H.W. Bush And Grocery ScannersPresident George H.W. Bush caught flak for <a href="http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.asp" target="_hplink">appearing awed</a> by a supermarket check-out scanner while touring a grocers convention in 1992. It turned out the president was being shown a new bar code technology, and the convention worker who was alongside Bush later said it's "foolish to think the president doesn't know anything about grocery stores. He knew exactly what I was talking about." George W. Bush And Gas PricesIn 2008, President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/business/worldbusiness/03iht-assess.4.11654214.html?_r=1" target="_hplink">said</a> he had not heard predictions that gas prices could soon hit $4 a gallon. At the time, the national average was $3.29 a gallon. John Kerry And Cheese SteakIn 2003, Democratic presidential contender John Kerry <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/battle10/244119/bloombergs-john-kerry-cheesesteak-moment-thomas-shakely#" target="_hplink">ordered</a> Swiss cheese on a cheese steak while campaigning in South Philadelphia, straying from the traditional favorite topping, Cheez Whiz. Michael Dukakis And The TankDemocratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/the-photo-op-that-tanked" target="_hplink">tried</a> to one-up Republican opponent George H.W. Bush on national defense by striking a pose in an M1 Abrams tank.Mitt Romney And WawaMitt Romney has had his fair share of seemingly out-of-touch statements this election cycle, admitting he likes to "fire people" and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/mitt-romney-sandwich-computer-wawa/story?id=16587170#.T-Ca3XBfaUc" target="_hplink">expressing amazement</a> at the touchscreen ordering system at convenience store Wawa. Barack Obama And The Private SectorPresident Barack Obama is not exempt from the "gotcha" moment. In June, he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/08/obama-doing-fine-private-sector_n_1581874.html" target="_hplink">described</a> the private sector economy as "doing fine." The gaffe immediately elicited comparisons with his 2008 Republican opponent, John McCain, who said that the "fundamentals of the economy are strong" in the midst of a crippling financial crisis.

Appeals court to hear dispute over BP settlement
MICHAEL KUNZELMAN | July 7, 2013 01:33 PM EST |

versions NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court is wading into a high-stakes dispute over the terms of a multibillion-dollar settlement of claims arising from BP's massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments Monday by attorneys for the London-based oil giant and for Gulf Coast businesses that say the nation's worst offshore oil spill cost them money.
BP asserts that the judge who approved the deal and a court-appointed claims administrator have misinterpreted the settlement, allowing thousands of businesses to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in payments for inflated and fictitious losses.
"The result is that thousands of claimants that suffered no losses are coming forward in ever-increasing numbers, seeking and obtaining outrageous windfalls and making a mockery of what was intended to be a fair and honest court-supervised settlement process," company attorneys wrote in their brief for the hearing.
BP says it could be forced to pay billions more in "capricious awards to uninjured claimants" if the 5th Circuit doesn't overturn rulings on the issue by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier.
Plaintiffs' attorneys who brokered the deal last year counter that BP undervalued the settlement and underestimated how many claimants would qualify for payments under the terms they negotiated.
"Buyer's remorse does not alter the deal that was struck," they wrote. BP's appeal doesn't apply to payouts to individuals.
The April 2010 blowout of BP's Macondo well off the Louisiana coast triggered an explosion that killed 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and led to millions of gallons of oil spilling into the Gulf. Shortly after the disaster, BP agreed to create a $20 billion compensation fund that was administered at first by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, led by attorney Kenneth Feinberg.
After the settlement was announced last year, Barbier appointed Lafayette, La.-based attorney Patrick Juneau to take over the process of evaluating and paying claims.
The settlement doesn't have a cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay $7.8 billion to resolve claims by tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents and businesses. Now the company says it no longer can give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
Awards to businesses are based on a comparison of their revenues and expenses before and after the spill. BP says a "policy decision" that Juneau announced in January 2013 allows businesses to manipulate those figures in a way that leads to errors in calculating their actual lost profits.
"These problems are compounded by claimants' ability to select the time period that generates the largest payment: Claimants inevitably select time periods in which distortions due to the timing of recording receipts and disbursements work together to generate higher compensation," BP lawyers wrote.
BP says Juneau's policy decision, which Barbier most recently upheld in April, resulted in a $21 million payout to a Louisiana rice mill that earned more revenue in 2010 than it did in the previous three years.
"Such `losses' reflect nothing more than arbitrary cash-flow computations or incorrect recording of revenue and expenses – not actual economic performance," their attorneys wrote.
Plaintiffs' attorneys say BP has never offered an alternative methodology for evaluating these claims.
"BP's position is compromised as a matter of law by its inability, even on appeal, to articulate its version of the proper methodology and to ask for specific relief," they wrote.
BP had agreed from the outset of the settlement agreement that the claims administrator should interpret the compensation frameworks to provide the greatest payouts to claimants, the plaintiffs' lawyers said.
"Contrary to BP's contention, the issue before this Court is not an abstract evaluation of purported accounting principles, but the agreement reached by the parties," they wrote.
Juneau's office has offered more than $2.2 billion in settlement payments to more than 8,600 businesses as of June 23. Through April, more than 28 percent of the offers to businesses that exceeded $3 million were made to construction companies, while roughly 11 percent were for law firms, according to numbers compiled by BP. The average offer for a law firm claimant is $810,000, which is more than triple the average offer for business claims, according to BP's tally.
BP warns of "dire implications far beyond this case" if the appeals court doesn't overturn Barbier's rulings.
"The Deepwater Horizon settlement could serve as a positive landmark in American jurisprudence because of its ambitious size, its innovative nature, and the speed with which it was negotiated to compensate injured parties. Instead, it is poised to become an indelible black mark on the American justice system," the company's lawyers wrote.
Washington-based attorney Theodore Olson, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, is expected to present BP's case and answer questions from the judges during Monday's hearing. Olson represented Bush in the U.S. Supreme Court's review of the contested presidential election in 2000. More recently, he represented plaintiffs who sought to strike down California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage.
James Dennis, Edith Brown Clement and Leslie Southwick are the 5th Circuit judges assigned to the case.
