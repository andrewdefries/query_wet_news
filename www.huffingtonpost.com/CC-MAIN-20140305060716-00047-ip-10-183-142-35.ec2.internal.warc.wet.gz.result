Caster Semenya Makes Olympic Debut In 800-Meter Prelim 3 Years After Gender Test

Sports News
(L-R) Halima Hachlaf of Morocco (L) and Caster Semenya of South Africa compete in the Women's 800m Round 1 Heats on Day 12 of the London 2012 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 8, 2012 in London, England.
LONDON — Caster Semenya perched herself on a lane marker behind the start of the 800 meters and took a few moments to absorb what it feels like to be an Olympian.
She took some deep breaths, then got up, walked to the stagger start and went straight to work. Making her Olympic debut three years after being forced to undergo gender tests that cast doubt over her future in track and field, Semenya finished second in her preliminary heat on Wednesday morning.
The 80,000-seat stadium was almost full, but she's used to big crowds. The whole experience, though, was something new.
"It was a very important race," Semenya said. "It was a tactical race. I wanted the race to be a fast one. To be a good contender, you have to run under 2 minutes."
This is the Semenya of 2012 – she's 21 and she's reserved, almost guarded, and generally restricts her public comments to topics of competition.
And who could blame her?
She was still a teenager when she had no choice but to endure having her most intimate details debated and discussed in the global media.
Semenya was sidelined for 11 months – while track and field's governing body decided whether or not to allow her to compete – after she won the 2009 world title at age 18, posting a stunning time of 1 minute, 55.45 seconds.
She was tested and eventually cleared to compete in 2010, but she struggled with a back problem for a while before returning to the world championships at Daegu and winning a silver medal.
The backing she has from the South African federation was in evidence when she was selected to carry the flag at the opening ceremonies at the London Games, where she's a genuine medal contender.
And she wants to return the support.
After posting an Olympic qualifying time at the national trials earlier this year, Semenya said: "I have to win a gold."
"My dream is to win the Olympics," she said, "and that's my plan."
She will find a fierce rival in defending champion Pamela Jelimo. She said she feels for Semenya, but she has a title to defend and is fit to retain it.
"I know it's hard," Jelimo said. "We all train hard, every day. When I am in shape, I am in shape. So why should I care if somebody did not train for the past year?"
Semenya ran her heat in 2:00.71, finishing just behind the 2:00.47 run by American Alysia Johnson Montano, the fastest qualifier from the preliminaries. Jelimo won her heat in 2:00.54 to advance with the second-fastest time.
Semenya ran a controlled race, hanging back with the pack while Montano went out quickly, then relying on a late kick to cut down the gap and secure the second automatic qualifying spot from the heat.
She knows she has to run a sub-2 minutes to be competitive, and appeared to have a lot in reserve after her opening run in the first of the 800 heats.
And even though she's only new to the Olympic scene, Semenya has recruited a coach with almost unsurpassed experience in Maria Mutola, who retired in 2008 with an Olympic gold medal and three world titles to her credit.
Mutola was among those who tabbed Semenya to break the world record when the young South African burst onto the international scene in 2009. Now they're working together to achieve it.
And while there's still plenty of public attention on Semenya, her presence is simple for other athletes to quantify.
"She's just like any other competitor for us," said Canada's Jessica Smith, who also progressed to the next round Wednesday. "The faster she runs, the faster we have to compete with her."
Like other athletes in the 800, Smith wanted to leave the gender issue to the experts.
"I have confidence in what the IAAF has done to ensure that she's competing at the right level," Smith said. "I trust in what they're doing and hopefully she's just like any of us."

Employers Adopt Stricter Health Care Policies In Face Of Surging Costs

Business News
Faced with rising health care costs, employers are adopting stricter policies to keep workers healthy. Failure to comply with those measures could hurt employees' wallets.
Workers at tire manufacturer company Michelin could miss out on reducing their deductibles by up to $1,000 if they show unhealthy signs like high blood pressure or waistlines over 40 inches, The Wall Street Journal reports. Companies such as Walmart and Home Depot have similar policies, designed to reduce surging health care costs. But often these new policies require employees to share personal health information, something critics say is both unfair and an invasion of privacy.
With health care costs rising in 2012 to $12,136 per employee on average, according to a recent study, companies argue that the new policies not only help cut costs, but also contribute to the overall well being of their workforces. Indeed, Michelin told The Huffington Post that The Wall Street Journal’s claim that the company is penalizing workers for showing signs of obesity is not accurate. Instead, the new policy set to take effect next year “helps us help our employees” by rewarding workers who meet standards for at least three of five health indicators, such as waist size, cholesterol and blood pressure.
CVS made a similar defense in March of its new “wellness review” policy, which will dock employees $600 if they elect not to disclose personal health information to the company’s insurance provider. The policy is designed to “help our colleagues engage more actively to improve their health and manage health-associated costs,” a CVS representative wrote The Huffington Post in an email in March.
Fair or not, it’s likely that more companies will soon adopt stricter policies regarding employee health. Sixty percent said they plan on penalizing workers who don’t meet health standards in the future, according to a recent survey by Aon. Meanwhile, 80 percent say they’ll soon increase the cost of employee insurance premiums, a separate survey found.

Upper-Income HouseholdsStarting Jan. 1, individuals making more than $200,000 per year, and couples making more than $250,000, will face a 0.9 percent Medicare tax increase on wages above those threshold amounts. They'll also face an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Together these are the biggest tax increase in the health care law.Employer PenaltiesStarting in 2014, companies with 50 or more employees that do not offer coverage will face penalties if at least one of their employees receives government-subsidized coverage. The penalty is $2,000 per employee, but a company's first 30 workers don't count toward the total.Health Care IndustriesInsurers, drug companies and medical device manufacturers face new fees and taxes. Companies that make medical equipment sold chiefly through doctors and hospitals, such as pacemakers, artificial hips and coronary stents, will pay a 2.3 percent excise tax on their sales, expected to total $1.7 billion in its first year, 2013. They're trying to get it repealed.Insurance IndustryThe insurance industry faces an annual fee that starts at $8 billion in its first year, 2014.Pharmaceutical CompaniesPharmaceutical companies that make or import brand-name drugs are already paying fees; they totaled $2.5 billion in 2011, the first year.People Who Don't Get Health InsuranceNearly 6 million people who don't get health insurance will face tax penalties starting in 2014. The fines are estimated to raise $6.9 billion in 2016. Average penalty in that year: about $1,200.Indoor Tanning DevoteesThe 10 percent sales tax on indoor tanning sessions took effect in 2010. It's expected to raise $1.5 billion over 10 years.
The 28 million people who visit tanning booths and beds each year – mostly women under 30, according to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology – are already paying. Tanning salons were singled out because of strong medical evidence that exposure to ultraviolet lights increases the risk of skin cancer.

CHICAGO - JULY 01: Actress and Oscar winner Octavia Spencer, is interviewed during the red carpet arrivals for the 'Fruitvale Station' movie screening at the Showplace ICON Theatres in Chicago, Illinois on JULY 01, 2013. (Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) NEW YORK -- Writing a children's book isn't enough for Oscar winner Octavia Spencer. She's also narrating the audio edition.
Spencer's "The Case of the Time-Capsule Bandit" comes out Oct. 15. It's the first of two planned books for middle schoolers that feature 12-year-old vigilante Randi Rhodes. In a statement released Wednesday by publisher Simon & Schuster, Spencer says her background as an actress helped her bring her story "to life" on tape.
The 43-year-old Spencer won an Academy Award in 2012 for best supporting actress for her role in "The Help."

When Erin was 23, she woke up one morning feeling a little run down. Between jobs and without insurance, she decided to forgo the expense of a doctor's visit. A couple of days later, she awoke in a critical care unit, eventually developing a nerve disorder so severe that it limits her ability to perform even the simplest of day-to-day tasks. Now 26-years-old, simply changing positions makes her light-headed. Her life goals have gone from buying her first home and going to graduate school to simply being able to stand while taking a shower.	Erin did not have the benefit of health care reform. She did not have the option of staying on her parent's insurance. She had been turned down repeatedly by insurance companies on account of her pre-existing condition and was terrified that the insurance she had secured would be rescinded when the cost of her care tripped some unknowable line. It was why she would not speak on the record during the debate. Our broken health care system had forced this young woman into the shadows.
The Republican-led House of Representatives, by a 245 to 189 margin, just voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was a determined, if largely symbolic gesture to undo the sweeping reform of our health care system signed into law by President Obama last March. And, though the Republican leadership has touted its steadfast opposition to "Obamacare" and its commitment to "repeal and replace" the law, their action last night leaves the millions of Americans now benefiting from health care reform -- like Erin -- wondering how undoing this law will make their lives better.
Erin's experience makes poignant, real and obvious the need for reform. She is now benefiting from experimental drug therapy that is very much the result of American medicine's sophistication and excellence. But she is, for the first time, secure in knowing that she will be able to access the wonders of American medicine, and to realize her original life goals as a result. The Affordable Care Act did that.
On Tuesday, a young man named Alexander Lataille, from Rhode Island, testified before a group of Democratic House members. He is a recent college graduate who studied to be an atmospheric scientist, and had a job lined up at a private company which contracts with the Federal Aviation Administration. When the economy went south, however, the opportunity evaporated and he went to University of Rhode Island to take a research assistantship. The job does not offer health benefits, but he has been able to deepen his expertise and increase his value on the job market and to a future employer, all while maintaining health coverage through his mother's plan. The Affordable Care Act did that.
The House vote may end up being symbolic, but the idea of repeal has real consequences for real people. For people like Erin, who struggle with illness, repeal could mean the end of a lifeline and a return to the fear of interrupted care and upended medical progress. For people like Alexander, who are riding out the end of an economic downturn, undoing health care reform represents just one more -- government initiated -- obstacle to independence and the freedom to pursue one's dreams.
Repealing the Affordable Care Act is a step backward. Just ask Erin and Alex, and the millions of Americans like them across this country, who will lose coverage and newfound freedoms if health reform is overturned. They deserve better than that.

Every holiday season, our Metropolitan Singers perform concerts in retirement centers as part of our Seattle Glee Clubs' community service. It's musical light during these darkest days of the year, live music to accompany those elders who often can't get out and about for other concerts. So we bring music to them. We always ask the elders to join us in holiday songs. And every year, as I recognize some of the same elders -- who are also the strongest singers -- I marvel at how singing and good health are connected.
This year, as we stand before over 60 elders, we warm up in front of a bright and fanciful Christmas tree. This audience is mostly women, with a few fortunate gentlemen who get lots of attention.
Our inspiring director, John, wittily engages the crowd with introductions to our lively spiritual "Great, Getting' Up Morning."
"Gabriel, Gabriel, blow your trumpet!" we sing, rejoicing in our four-part treble harmonies. Feet start tapping, silver heads nodding and a gentleman in the front row hums right along with us.
Our Russian-trained accompanist, Diana, passionately leans into the ringing chords, "In that morn, fare thee well!" and everybody claps happily. Then we shift into the lilting melodies of two Russian lullabies, "Little Birch Tree" and "Good Night." Diana has taught us the tongue-twisting Russian patiently -- and phonetically. Diana's piano always lifts us up. Before immigrating to the U.S. with her family, Diana taught in a Russian music conservatory for 20 years. "Music is its own country," Diana always says. "It makes you forget all your pain."
It does seem to have that healing effect on the elders. They sit up straighter; others lean forward into the music like spindly plants to sunlight.
As we move into "Isn't It Romantic," a song from their generation, the elders smile dreamily and close their eyes, remembering. Romance is eternal. And I see a very old couple reach out very shyly and take each other's hands. How many decades have they loved each other?
"Isn't it romantic, only to be young on such a night as this?" we sing. And suddenly I remember one of the influential elders in my life, Beata, explaining to me, "The tragedy of getting old is that you're not really old. Inside, you're still young."
Beata was 72 and I was 24. I didn't understand her meaning at the time. But now I do. Memory keeps us always young, even as our bodies fail, even as we sometimes forget ourselves.
Singing, like memory, can also help keep us young. Research has indicated that singing may help to enhance memory. "How Singing Improves Your Health" advises, "Singing, particularly in a chorus, seems to benefit the elderly particularly well." The article cites a three-year study of how singing affects the health of those 55 and older. Seniors who participated in a chorale showed significant health improvements compared to others their age: fewer doctor visits, fewer eyesight problems and falls, improved lung capacity and less asthma, less incidence of depression -- even the need for medication decreased. The average age of the elder singers studied was 80, and they noticed that singing improved their posture, breathing, mood, and their energy level. Overall, their quality of life was heightened by the simple act of singing, especially in community.
More brain research has shown surprising results in singing as a way of easing Alzheimer's disease. Singing for the Brain is an organization that helps those with dementia, Alzheimer's, and memory problems through singing. "Music has the ability to access words," says Singing for the Brain voice coach Liz McNaughton. "People who have lost their ability to speak can access songs and words from melody."
If singing can help us as we age, what can it do for us at all ages of life? Brian Eno, British composer and producer of Talking Heads and U2, told National Public Radio that "Singing is the key to a long life, a good figure, a stable temperament, increased intelligence, new friends, super self-confidence, heightened sexual attractiveness and a better sense of humor."
Amen, brother. And sister! Who wouldn't want to join in communal singing with that recommendation?
As we all, elders and chorale join together at the end of our Seattle concert to sing holiday songs, I feel a surge of physical well-being and gratitude to all the voices raised so strongly.
"Joy to the world," the elders sing with us. And yes, that's what I feel now. Joy to be joining my voice with others, to still be in this world together, surviving and singing.
Brenda Peterson is the author of 16 books, including the recent memoir I Want To Be Left Behind: Finding Rapture Here on Earth, which was named a "Top Ten Best Non-Fiction Book of 2010" by The Christian Science Monitor. Many of the chapter titles in this book were song titles. For more: www.IWantToBeLeftBehind.com

David Wild: Get Boxed In: A Few Last Minute Musical Gift Suggestions
If you feel the need to buy someone you love a product from which I in no way personally profit, then here are a few more decidedly last-minute musical gift suggestions from a lazy idiot who still hasn't done his holiday shopping. Paul Guest: Are the Operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan Still Relevant?
2011 marks the 100th anniversary of the death of WS Gilbert one half of the Victorian-era composer-librettist duo Gilbert and Sullivan and after Opera North's production of Ruddigore, only my second outing to a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, well, guess what? I've got a little list. Rev. P. Kimberleigh Jordan: Thinking About Heaven On The 1st Anniversary Of My Mother's Death
My deep sadness about my mother's death and absence from my life has been somewhat lessened by imagining that when her soul left her sick and failing body last December 21st, it entered some such lovely scene somewhere. Danielle Tumminio: Lowering Holiday Stress With the Help of Handel's Messiah
There's no doubt the pitch around the holidays is elevated. But perhaps, when we make conscious efforts to lower the pitch, the music we make in our lives will be that much more beautiful. Around the Web:

FIRST SLIDE
PREVIOUS SLIDE

Caneel Bay keeps wedding options simple and elegant -- an ideal combination that, naturally, comes at a high price. The Equator Restaurant, which fits up to 150 people, is a popular reception location. A one-hour reception with hot and cold hors d'oeuvres, a champagne toast, an open bar for three hours, and a four-course plated dinner costs anywhere from $185 to $230 per person. Designed like rustic bungalows with natural wood and stone, rooms are clean, simple, and lack TVs and phones. There are a wide range of rooms and suites available, but newlyweds usually stay in the Premium Beachfront (you can walk right out onto the sand) or the Premium Ocean View Rooms. READ WHOLE POST
