DETROIT — Former Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson has been placed in hospice care at his Thousand Oaks, Calif. home for complications resulting from dementia.
Anderson's family said in a statement Wednesday that they appreciate the support and kindness that friends and fans have shown throughout the Hall of Famer's career and retirement. No further details were released.
The 76-year-old Anderson was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 2000, culminating a major league career that included one nondescript season as a player and an historic run as a manager.
He won 2,194 games as a manager, which was the third-highest total in major league history when he retired, trailing Connie Mack and John McGraw. He now stands sixth, also trailing Tony La Russa, Bobby Cox and Joe Torre. Anderson was the first manager to win World Series titles in both leagues and the only manager to lead two franchises in career wins.
He led Cincinnati's Big Red Machine to World Series wins in 1975-76. He won four National League pennants in Cincinnati from 1970-78, then was fired after consecutive second-place finishes.
Anderson went to the American League and won there, too, directing the Tigers to a World Series title in 1984 and a division title in 1987. He retired after the 1995 season and was added to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee.
"We are very sad to hear the news of Sparky's failing health," Reds owner Bob Castellini said in a statement. "Every day here we are reminded of his contribution to the success of this proud franchise."
The Tigers said they would keep Anderson, his wife, Carol, and their family in their thoughts and prayers.
"Sparky led one of the most beloved teams in franchise history to the World Series title in 1984 and remains the winningest manager in franchise history," the organization said in a statement. "His contributions to the Detroit Tigers remain a significant part of the club's history."

Whether it's guarding the stoop, taking a ride in the family car, or hanging out at home on the couch, sometimes it's just tough to resist a snooze.
Let's face it, the life of a pooch can be downright exhausting. So much to chew, so little time! Can you really blame the cute dogs in these five video clips for needing to take a power nap?

The book series of A Song of Ice and Fire is what nerds wished The Lord of the Rings was; It's more violent, there's less decorating and dinner parties, there's a ton of sex, and it's longer... way longer. There are a vast amount of characters in the series, and many that people love, hate, and Joffrey. Joffrey is one of the most universally hated characters in fictional history. You can dispute my claim, but more importantly, shut up.
To keep in line with American standards, I will not go further in to the book series than what HBO has already filmed. Reading is hard for a lot of people because it requires patience and the ability to sit still for more than 5 minutes before ranting about how Taco Bell drive-thru takes too long. The show of shows is coming back this Sunday (March 31) on HBO, and I give you the five most lovable characters on Game of Thrones.
Samwell Tarly
Who? You dolt. Jon Snow is in the North hanging with his loyal companion, Sam. He's the husky guy who is hated by his father and joined the Night's Watch over suicide. It's a tough choice. Every time Sam is on screen I smile. He does nothing but be nice to everyone because he's just a great dude. Even the White Walkers gave him a pass at the end of Season 2 because "AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!" I hope for his survival through the entire series, because, as Jon Snow said with his Dire Wolf as intimidation, "No one touches Sam."
Eddard Stark
My cousin's last name is Stark, and also Iron Man. What does that have to do with anything? Everything. The Starks are impossible to not like. Eddard, however, is different because of who he is, who plays him, and his honor. Sean Bean (Who you may know from every movie he dies in, which is everything) is perfect for the role. He was the face of the Game of Thrones, and without him, this show would have probably not have been as awesome without his characters jumping off point. His story sets off everything throughout the entire series. Watching Eddard in the series is like watching your best friend date someone boring who treats him like garbage, and then becomes friends with her friends that are equally terrible all get in a car accident, Eddard dies, and they all get insurance claims for millions. Eddard, you could have just said, "Screw this, I'm staying at Winterfell."
Tyrion Lannister
The Imp. The guy that killed his Mother through birth. The best character on the show. Tyrion Lannister burns through screen time like Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. He schemes, figures, plans, observes, and generally recognizes that everyone in the 5 kingdoms is dumber than he is, but power is power, and sometimes he doesn't come out on top. He's played by Peter Dinklage, and is called THE DINK by the internet. He could set my house on fire and I would still probably offer to give him a ride to the airport.
The Hound
Where does his loyalty lie? Who cares? He's amazing. He does something so honorable as to deserve medals from the highest order and respond with a "Meh, more wine." Why? Who knows? He saves people because he can. He loves killing, and hates fire. I love killing, too, but more in a video game environment with the Contra code. If you don't get that reference then I'm sad. I mean, even with the 30 lives in Contra that game was still hard to beat.
Bronn
The medieval version of a hired gun without morals. He is up there with The Hound in ultimate bosses of the GOT universe. What comes with Bronn and his fighting skills is also hooking up with the hottest prostitutes (all those naked chicks with out many lines, yeah, porn stars) and drinking like a fish. Also, he matches wits with Tyrion and talks smack to anyone who talks smack back to him, even The Hound. He reminds me a bit of Bruce Willis from Die Hard. No one else will step up, and he does because no one else will but for chicks, booze, and sarcasm. I like that guy.

If the sun sets and I am at the bus stop, then I am in danger. -Zimbabwean activist
An Indonesian rights lawyer is fatally poisoned on an international flight. State agents abduct a Zimbabwean activist and hold her incommunicado. In Colombia, leaked documents reveal plans to assassinate human rights defenders. These shocking incidents occur in a context of routine surveillance, threats, and harassment.
The Irish organization Front Line has released Strategies for Survival: Protection of Human Rights Defenders in Colombia, Indonesia and Zimbabwe. The study documents the dangers that defenders face and the creative strategies they adopt in response. (I wrote the report together with Front Line staff and human rights activists in the three countries).
A human rights defender may be a farmer, union organizer, journalist, lawyer, or anyone who works non-violently for the rights of others. Based on interviews and group discussions with more than 100 defenders in three countries, this report shares effective strategies with activists around the world.
Below are some dangers they face, followed by examples of their protection strategies.
Violence
Dozens of labor organizers, community leaders, and other defenders are killed in Colombia every year. One of Indonesia's leading human rights lawyers, Munir, was murdered on an international flight in 2004. In Zimbabwe, rural activists were beaten in the run-up to recent elections, and defenders were abducted and tortured in late 2008. A rural defender from Zimbabwe described her working conditions:
We are lone officers and isolated. I am the messenger, the secretary, the field worker. There are lots of risks: a visitor knocks, you say come in, and he attacks you. No one comes to your rescue quickly, or at all. There's no computer to send an e-mail, and the land-lines are off. If you are lucky that day, you have money on your cell phone. Threats and intimidation
Text messages and letters come from paramilitaries, religious extremists, or even government officials. One Colombian defender received a box containing a headless doll -- and a note: "You have a nice family -- look after it and do not sacrifice it." An Indonesian activist for religious tolerance told us: We always get calls and other intimidation by the Islamic Defenders Front. They ask "Aren't you afraid to die?" and I tell them, 'Everyone will die one day.'
Unfair trials
Baseless charges consume time and money and may lead to months or years in prison. Defenders told us:
The next step is prosecution through judicial processes, using testimony from demobilized combatants and threats from the paramilitaries. It is harder to criticize from abroad compared to a killing, and also a double strategy to delegitimize their work. [Colombia]
It looks like a deliberate attempt to intimidate lawyers and make us afraid. If a lawyer is arrested, what hope will we have? [Zimbabwe]
Stigmatization
Government officials call defenders guerrillas, communists, or terrorists, marking them for harassment, arrest, and (especially in Colombia) sometimes death. After the Colombian president referred to activists as "plainclothes terrorists," a defender explained:
My armored car... helps me a bit if the paramilitaries shoot at me. But it doesn't protect me from the president. An Indonesian activist agreed:
Whole families can be affected if one member is called a separatist or a communist, so there is clearly a sense of fear. Strategies for Survival
Some best practices we identified are:
1. Security planning: Assessing risk and planning accordingly are the building blocks of protection. The best examples involved the whole staff and were regularly updated.
2. Collaboration: In the words of one Colombian, "Working together is the first rule of protection." Collaboration may have the goal of:
Advocacy: campaigns at home and abroad to pressure governments to provide protection and change laws. (For example, see this international campaign on Colombia defenders). Creating protection mechanisms: some groups have come together to create bodies that carry out risk assessments and drafts security plans, build defenders' skills, and provide legal aid, relocation assistance, or counseling.
3.	Building public support: At the local level, neighbors can alert defenders to suspicious people or cars and quickly report detentions. At a broader level, public support can help curb government excesses. 4.	Considering women human rights defenders: In implementing these strategies it is important to pay attention to gender-specific risks, such as threats against their family's safety, attacks on character, or community pressure to stay home. See the report for more best practices and recommendations to states and the international community
