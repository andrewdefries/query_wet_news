WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday that the Obama administration's redrawn Afghanistan war strategy is sound, answering claims in a new book that the plan was a politically driven hodgepodge.
Once President Barack Obama announced the plan his entire administration and the military swung behind it, Gates said during a Pentagon news conference. The Pentagon chief also predicted no big shifts as the war moves into its 10th year.
Obama overrode some close advisers last December after months of debate, when he added about 30,000 forces and shifted battlefield priorities. Neither did he satisfy his generals. The resulting divisions and bureaucratic backbiting are laid out in Washington Post writer Bob Woodward's book "Obama's Wars."
Gates shrugged off those divisions.
"Conflict sells," Gates said.
The Obama administration sought a new counterinsurgency strategy to blunt the momentum of the resurgent Taliban. The homegrown Afghan insurgency was defeated in the 2001 invasion but allowed to regroup during several years of what Obama and his advisers call inattention by the Bush administration.
The book suggests the final strategy was fashioned by committee and was partly driven by anti-war politics within the Democratic Party.
The White House will conduct a long-planned review of its Afghan strategy at the end of this year, and some Democrats had hoped that Obama would use the opportunity to signal a swift end to the protracted and costly conflict.
Gates said the Afghan war may have dragged on for years, but the Obama plan to address it is new and only beginning to bear fruit.
He predicted that the administration might order "adjustments and tweaks" to its war plan, but no major shift in policy. The current plan calls for some forces to come home next summer but presumes that the war will go on far longer.
Gates said relationships within the Obama administration were as harmonious as he has seen in his long government tenure. He refused comment on the book's claim that he had chewed out a White House colleague for airing his dissenting views on the war too prominently.
Asked whether he held any reservations about the compromise war strategy that emerged from an unusually long and fractious debate, Gates said no.
"I wouldn't sign the deployment orders if I didn't believe," the policy is sound, Gates said.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that he, too, had faith in the current strategy.
"We're starting to see some signs of progress," Mullen said. "With the right strategy and the right resources and the right leadership, you know, we're starting to move forward."

The release of a Bob Woodward book is something of a tradition in politics, and here's how it works: the week before its release, copies are obtained by reporters, who comb through the tome to find zazzy parts of the book to write about. Obama's Wars recreates that time when Obama was trying to develop a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, working with advisors who were split on what to do. Of course, this is all stuff that you already knew because it was extensively reported in the news. But if you just cannot absorb information unless it comes constructed in mise-en-scene form by an author who can relate the color and contours of the White House tea service in loving detail, then this book is for you. U.S. Drones Killed American Citizens In Pakistan, Woodward Book Says

Looking for a place to call home? You might be able to buy an entire village for the same amount that it costs to buy a house in some places. The French village of Courbefy, in Limousin, a region in central France, has been put up for sale for the seemingly low asking price of $436,370, according to the Telegraph. The village, which includes 19 buildings and a swimming pool, was once home to about 200 people. But after the town failed to transform itself into a tourist destination, local residents say it's now filled mostly with "thieves, drunks and squatters."
But Courbefy isn't the only town to go up for sale recently. Last April, a medieval village in the central Italian region of Abruzzo was put up for sale for about $770,000, according to a separate Telegraph report. The village, which is largely uninhabitable, includes 11 "crumbling stone buildings" and a half-ruined 13th century church. More recently, the British village of Askham Richard near York, went up for sale with a price tag of more than $10 million. The average new U.S. home cost $272,900 as of 2010, according to the Census. As romantic as it may sound, owning a village can often present a series of problems for the landlords. There are about a dozen privately owned villages in the UK, according to The Guardian, and aside from the considerable task of maintaining numerous historical buildings, town landlords also have to worry about the dynamics of the community, like finding the best way to cope with schools running low on students. "Some people call it social engineering," John Rous, who's family has owned a British village for generations, told The Guardian, "I prefer to think of it as keeping the village alive."
That could be why privately owned islands seem to be a more popular choice for those looking to become lord of the land. Billionaire Sir Richard Branson owns the tropical paradise of Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, for example, which can be rented out for the tidy sum of $47,000 a day. Meanwhile, magician David Copperfield actually owns four islands that make up his Bahamian Musha Cay estate.
For potential island buyers looking for a more unspoiled choice, Red Rock Island in San Francisco bay was recently put on the market for $9 million, down from $22 million. The 5.8-acre rock is undeveloped but it may still make a good investment, particularly if you're into secret caves and buried pirate treasure.

Dog Poop DNA Testing: Property Managers Go High-Tech In Quest For Neighborhood Cleanliness (VIDEO)

Green News
Tired of feces-filled communal open spaces, property managers like the ones at Legends, an upscale apartment complex in Montgomery, Ala., are now using DNA testing to determine which pile of poo came from which dog -- and which owner failed to pick it up, WZZM-13 reports.
And according to property manager Joe Johnson, the tactic is working well.
"We sent out letters to residents about what we were going to do," Johnson told the station. "The problem of owners not cleaning up after their dogs just disappeared."
PooPrints, the company used to catch lazy dog owners, is a division of BioVet Pet Lab based out of Knoxville, Tenn., and works with property managers in 28 states. Clients -- in this case property managers -- collect samples found in communal areas, then send them to a lab where the DNA is matched not just to the pet, but to the apartment number of the pet's owner, who has provided a sample beforehand. Depending on enforcement rules, the tenant will then receive a warning or fine.
In addition to cleaner yards and sidewalks, the DNA matching might also result in healthier pets and people. The Huffington Post's Lynne Peeples spoke to Dr. Emily Beeler, an animal disease surveillance veterinarian for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, who said that while poop may seem less gross as it decomposes, it may actually become more dangerous for humans and their canine companions over time.
"It takes many types of parasite eggs a while to ripen," Beeler told HuffPost. Roundworm, for example, can take up to three weeks to become infectious and can remain dangerous for years in contaminated soil and water.

The Saint Bernard dog was once the ubiquitous companion of monks at the monastery tucked 2,500m above sea level, guiding them through the Alps or helping them to rescue stranded or lost travellers in the snowy mountains. However, there are no longer any such dogs living permanently at the monastery these days. In fact, the monks decided five years ago to part ways with their pedigree breeding programme, as the work became too much for the four monks living permanently at the monastery to handle. The breeding kennels faced the risk of being shut permanently if not for a group of Swiss bankers and animal-lovers who set up the Barry Foundation to buy the breeding programme.

At least once a day, my 16-year-old son, Danny, comes to me with an open copy of Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are and says, "Mom, can you read it?"
It is always opened to a single page, the one where Max sails home. It is night, and Max's eyes are closed as he travels back to the place "where someone loved him best of all." The text on the page Danny chooses reads, "and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day". He would be happy to have me read it to him in a sing-song voice a hundred times in a row, but he usually settles for five or six. Danny doesn't actually need me to read it. He can read himself and even if he couldn't, he has had this concise masterpiece read to him literally thousands of times and knows each word by heart. But he wants it read to him, and he wants me to read it; he never hands this book to anyone else. So I'll read it to Danny, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, on Mother's Day, as I do every day of the year. There are a few books Danny can't live without, and this is one of them. He carries it with him to school in his backpack every day, and there is another copy stashed in his classroom just in case he forgets it. He has a Wild Things T-shirt and a Where the Wild Things Are poster on the door of his room. Maurice Sendak, who died on May 8 at 83, created a virtually perfect work of literature that has become a classic. His dreamlike images and minimalist poetry appeal to readers of all ages, as does its vision of an angry, mischievous boy who wears a wolf suit, chases a pet dog with a fork and threatens to eat his own mother, then sails away to be with the wild things. While the book isn't meant to be about autism, I think it has a special resonance for my son, as well as for many other children who have difficulty communicating. Max gets into trouble because he runs wild and then, after a magical boat journey, is confronted by a host of gorgeously grotesque creatures (Sendak said in interviews that the wild things were based on his childhood vision of his own relatives, the kind of nightmarish adults who threaten to eat cute kids). Max joins them in a "wild rumpus" (how many children learned the word "rumpus" from this book?) and they acknowledge him as the "most wild thing of all" and make him their king. But finally, lonely and hungry, he gets back into the boat, and eventually arrives "into the night of his very own room" where the supper his mother denied him as punishment is waiting for him. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what Danny wants and what he is talking about, and I can't help wondering what special appeal the "and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day" passage holds for him. In my mind, this book tells the story of his daily struggle with his autism, which prompts him to act in ways that I -- and most others -- consider wild. But while Danny is stuck here in this world -- and with me -- Max manages to journey to another place full of creatures he can have fun with. When he's had enough of the rumpus, he sends the wild things to bed without their supper, as his mother did when he threatened to eat her, and then -- as the wild things protest, "Oh, please don't go -- we'll eat you up -- we love you so!" -- Max steps back onto his private boat. I think the year and weeks and day that Max travels, and that so fascinate Danny, are the time Danny needs for his own private journey. On this magic sailboat in the night, Danny sees a way he can transform his wildness -- whatever that unquiet, untypical neurological wiring that makes being calm and following the world's rules so difficult for him -- into love and communication. This is my interpretation of what Max's journey means to Danny. I have come to identify Danny with the boy in the book so much that when I wrote a novel, If I Could Tell You, about four families raising autistic children, I named the character that resembles Danny most closely Max. I hope someday, after a year and weeks and a day, he can tell me if my guess is correct. And I hope that the energy that fuels his wild rumpuses and makes him so full of life will stay with him, but will become easier for him to handle, and leave him as content as wolf-suit clad Max is on the final page of Where the Wild Things Are.
When I've read him the page a few times, he often jumps into bed, covering himself with his five or six quilts, and says, "Mom, can you read it again?"
R.I.P., Maurice Sendak. Your work will certainly live on in my house!
