PITTSBURGH — Republican Sen. John McCain on Tuesday called for a summer-long suspension of the federal gasoline tax and several tax cuts as the likely presidential nominee sought to stem the public's pain from a troubled economy.
Timed for the day millions of Americans filed their tax returns, McCain offered some immediate steps as well as long-term proposals in a broad economic speech. The nation's financial woes have replaced the Iraq war as the top concern for voters, and McCain, who has said economics is not his strongest suit, felt compelled to address the problems as he looks ahead to the November general election.
"In so many ways, we need to make a clean break from the worst excesses of both political parties," McCain told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University. "Somewhere along the way, too many Republicans in Congress became indistinguishable from the big-spending Democrats they used to oppose."
To help people weather the downturn immediately, McCain urged Congress to institute a "gas-tax holiday" by suspending the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.4 cent diesel tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day. By some estimates, the government would lose about $10 billion in revenue. He also renewed his call for the United States to stop adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and thus lessen to some extent the worldwide demand for oil.
Combined, he said, the two proposals would reduce gas prices, which would have a trickle-down effect, and "help to spread relief across the American economy."
Aides said McCain's Senate staff was drafting a bill on the proposal. It's likely to face strong opposition not only from Congress but the states. The federal gasoline tax helps pay for highway projects in nearly every town through a dedicated trust fund. In the past, such proposals for gas tax holidays have not fared well as lawmakers and state and local officials prefer not to see changes in their revenue source.
McCain's effort to set his own economic course _ and court independents _ comes as the public is craving change. A new television ad airing in parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio says "McCain will take the best ideas from both parties to spur innovation, invest in people and create jobs."
McCain has faced criticism _ fueled by Democrats as well as his own previous comments _ that his policy strength is not economics. Democrats have argued that his free-market approach is out of step with people feeling the pinch. And, McCain has taken heat on taxes; he twice voted against cuts President Bush championed, but now advocates making them permanent because, he says, doing otherwise would amount to a tax increase.
Shortly before McCain's speech, the Labor Department reported another worrisome sign for the economy: Inflation at the wholesale level soared in March at nearly triple the rate that had been expected as the costs of energy and food both climbed rapidly. Oil prices hit a new high, rising over $113 a barrel.
To immediately address concerns about gas prices and the fallout from the credit crunch, McCain offered the gas-tax suspension proposal and said the Education Department should work with governors to ensure that each state's guarantee agency _ nonprofits that traditionally back student loans issued by banks _ is able to be the lender of last resort for student loans.
In the long-term, McCain offered plans aimed at helping the middle class and eliminating wasteful spending, saying he wants to:
_Raise the tax exemption for each dependent child from $3,500 to $7,000. Aides estimated it would cost $65 billion over one year to double the tax exemption, but argued that McCain would offset such expenses by cutting federal spending.
_Require more affluent people _ couples making more than $164,000 _ enrolled in Medicare to pay a higher premium for their prescription drugs than less-wealthy people.
_Offer people the option of choosing a simpler tax system with two tax rates and a standard deduction instead of sticking with the current system.
_Suspend for one year all increases in discretionary spending for agencies other than those that cover the military and veterans while launching an expansive review of the effectiveness of federal programs. Aides estimated a one-year freeze would save $15 billion.
While he touched on a wide-range of issues, McCain did not discuss the soaring federal deficit or enormous war costs. He also offered few details for his new proposals and did not include estimated price tags. Later, aides said if all of McCain's tax plans are implemented, including those previously announced, the total cost would be $195 billion as changes are phased in. They said McCain has found _ or would find _ the same amount of spending reductions to match.
McCain also sought to draw a contrast with Democratic rivals Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying they would impose the single largest tax increase since World War II by allowing tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 _ and that McCain, himself, opposed _ to expire.
"All these tax increases are the fine print under the slogan of 'hope:' They're going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars per year _ and they have the audacity to hope you don't mind," McCain said, playing on the title of an Obama book.
McCain, who has lagged behind his Democratic rivals in fundraising, made the same argument in an e-mail appeal for money.
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said McCain's proposals offer "no change from George Bush's failed policies by going full speed ahead with fiscally irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans." Clinton policy director Neera Tanden called it "a George Bush-redux of corporate windfalls and tax cuts for the wealthy that will bankrupt our government and leave working families with the bill."
McCain made his remarks a day after he said he believes the country has already entered a recession.

Pope Benedict XVI Arrives In Cuba

WorldPost News
SANTIAGO, Cuba — Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Cuba on Monday in the footsteps of his more famous predecessor, gently pressing the island's longtime communist leaders to push through "legitimate" reforms their people desire, while also criticizing the excesses of capitalism.
In contrast to the raucous welcome Benedict received in Mexico, his arrival in Cuba's second city was relatively subdued: President Raul Castro greeted him at the airport with a 21-cannon salute and a goose-stepping military honor guard, but few ordinary Cubans lined Benedict's motorcade route into town and the pope barely waved from his glassed-in popemobile.
Santiago's main plaza, however, came alive when Benedict arrived for his evening Mass, his main public event here before heading Tuesday to Havana. While the plaza, which has a capacity of about 200,000, was not fully packed there was a festive atmosphere, with Cubans dancing to the rhythms of a samba band awaiting Benedict's arrival and waving small Cuban and Vatican flags.
"It is a message of love, this visit," said Jorgelina Guevara, a 59-year-old homemaker as she waited for the Mass to begin. "The Cuban people need it."
The trip comes 14 years after John Paul's historic tour, when the Polish pope who helped bring down communism in his homeland admonished Fidel Castro to free prisoners of conscience, end abortion and let the Roman Catholic Church take its place in society.
Benedict's message as he arrived was more subtle, taking into account the liberalizing reforms that Raul Castro has enacted since taking over from his older brother in 2006 and the greater role the Catholic Church has played in Cuban affairs, most recently in negotiating the release of dozens of political prisoners.
The pontiff, who at the start of his trip said Marxism "no longer responds to reality," gave a much gentler message upon stepping on Cuban soil, saying he wanted to inspire and encourage Cubans on the island and beyond.
"I carry in my heart the just aspirations and legitimate desires of all Cubans, wherever they may be," he said. "Those of the young and the elderly, of adolescents and children, of the sick and workers, of prisoners and their families, and of the poor and those in need."
The 84-year-old pontiff's voice was tired, and by the end of the day he seemed exhausted after a vigorous four days of travel. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, acknowledged Benedict's fatigue but said his health was fine.
In his own remarks, the Cuban leader assured Benedict his country favors complete religious liberty and has good relations with all religious institutions. He also criticized the 50-year U.S. economic embargo and defended the socialist ideal of providing for those less fortunate.
"We have confronted scarcity but have never failed in our duty to share with those who have less," Castro said, adding that his country remains determined to chart its own path and resist efforts by "the most forceful power that history has ever known" – a reference to the United States – to thwart the island's socialist model.
The two men greeted each other with clasped hands and wide smiles after the pope arrived in steamy, 88-degree Fahrenheit (31-degree Celsius) temperatures.
Benedict's three-day stay in Cuba inevitably sparked comparisons to his predecessor's, when Fidel Castro traded his army fatigues for a suit and tie to greet the pope and where John Paul uttered the now-famous words: "May Cuba, with all its magnificent potential, open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba."
Benedict referred repeatedly to John Paul in his speech Monday, saying his visit was a "gentle breath of fresh air" that gave strength to the church on the island.
He also denounced the ills of capitalism – a theme he has touched on frequently amid the global financial crisis but which took on particular significance in one of the world's last remaining Marxist systems. Benedict bemoaned a "profound spiritual and moral crisis which has left humanity devoid of values and defenseless before the ambition and selfishness of certain powers which take little account of the true good of individuals and families."
Late Monday, Benedict celebrated an outdoor Mass in the colonial city's main square on a blue-and-white platform crowned by graceful arches in the shape of a bishops' miter. Raul Castro was in the front row, and greeted the pontiff at the end of the service.
Just before the Mass began, a man near an area reserved for international press began shouting anti-government slogans such as "Down with the Revolution! Down with the dictatorship!"
The shouting was heard by an Associated Press photographer and others. The man tried to enter the press area shouting "I only screamed that we are not free" and "nobody paid me anything," but he was restrained by security agents and led away. It was not clear who he was or what happened to him. The government had no immediate comment.
Benedict will spend the night in a house beside the shrine of Cuba's patron saint, the Virgin of Charity of Cobre, where he will briefly pray Tuesday morning.
The statue, which is revered by Cubans Catholic and not, was brought to the Mass on the top of a truck to the joy of the faithful present.
"She is a beauty, the most extraordinary thing," Mercy Serra said as the statue made its way through the crowd. "She is the mother of all Cubans."
Cuban state television broadcast the Mass live, even turning over some of the commentary to a Catholic monsignor.
The crowd included Cubans wearing identical white "Bienvenido" T-shirts, as well as a few hundred Cuban exiles from the United States who flew into Santiago on special charter flights.
"It really does exists, the place where I was born in," said Rita Freixas of Miami Beach, with tears welling up in her eyes. Freixas, who left when she was just one year old, said she nearly came back in 1998 for John Paul's visit. "But my father had just died and he had been in the Bay of Pigs, and I just felt that somehow I would have betrayed him if I had come then."
She arrived with her two grown sons and her best friend; She said with a laugh that while she was waiting for the pope, her two sons had gone off in search of cigars.
Benedict will only be in Cuba for a little over 48 hours, and his limited schedule is sure to disappoint many who want a piece of his attention, from the dissident community, to returning Cuban American exiles and even representatives of imprisoned U.S. government subcontractor Alan Gross.
The Vatican has said the pope has no plans to meet with any of them, citing his advanced age and need for rest. More likely but still unconfirmed is a face-to-face with Fidel Castro, who stepped down in 2006 but remains the father of the revolution and is still referred to as "El Comandante."
A new wild card entered into play with the arrival Saturday of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is getting radiation therapy for his cancer. Lombardi said no request for an audience had been received but he suggested Chavez could attend Mass on Wednesday.
The one confirmed meeting is the pope's Tuesday encounter with Raul Castro in Havana.
Since taking over from Fidel in 2006, Raul Castro has ushered in a series of economic reforms, legalizing a real estate market, opening the door to limited private enterprise and turning over vast tracts of fallow government land to independent, small time farmers. Pressed by Havana Cardinal Jaime Ortega, he has also cleared Cuba's jails of the last of 75 political prisoners jailed in a 2003 crackdown.
Cuba denies it holds any political prisoners now. Officials refer to dissidents as mercenaries in the sway of its U.S. enemies. Human rights groups say some Cubans remain jailed for their political activities.
The island's Communist government never outlawed religion, but it expelled priests and closed religious schools after Fidel Castro's takeover of Cuba in 1959. Tensions eased in the early 1990s when the government removed references to atheism in the constitution and let believers of all faiths join the Communist Party.
John Paul's 1998 visit further warmed relations, and today the church is the most influential independent institution in Cuba, and magazines it operates have published frank articles calling for change.
But despite years of lobbying, the church has virtually no access to state-run radio or television, is not allowed to administer schools and has not been granted permission to build new places of worship. Only about 10 percent of Cubans are practicing Catholics.
Lack of enthusiasm for the Church predates the 1959 Cuban Revolution. From the early years under Spanish colonial rule, Catholicism was the religion of the ruling elite while believers of Afro-Cuban faiths were forced to hide their ceremonies and mask their deities behind Catholic saints.
Experts say as many as 80 percent of islanders observe some kind of Afro-Cuban religion, including Santeria, and evangelism is on the rise with some 600,000 Cubans believed to be part of Protestant and or evangelical denominations, less than Catholics but rising.

Meet "The Bachelorette" contestants will compete for Emily Maynard's heart.
Meet the men of "The Bachelorette" Season 8. The 25 contestants below will compete for Emily Maynard's heart beginning Mon., May 14, at 9:31 p.m. ET on ABC.
Maynard, now 26, is the single mom who won Brad Womack's heart on "The Bachelor" Season 15. Though Maynard received Womack's final rose and accepted his proposal, the two split shortly after the finale aired.
In the first episode of Season 8 of "The Bachelorette," the 25 contestants -- whose occupations range from a race car driver (like Maynard's late fiance Ricky Hendrick) to a mushroom farmer -- will meet and attempt to woo Maynard. But by the end of the premiere episode, only 19 men will move into the mansion.
Check out photos of the contestants below.

College News
Youngstown State University will limit the hours of non-union part-time employees to ensure that the university is not required to provide them with health insurance coverage under Obamacare.
YSU, a public institution in eastern Ohio, announced to employees earlier this month that it is restricting part-time employees, including adjunct professors and lecturers, to 29 hours a week or less. Under the Affordable Care Act, the university will have to provide health insurance to full-time employees, classified as anyone working 30 hours or more per week.
According to an email sent to English department employees, which was obtained by The Huffington Post, anyone who violates the new hourly limit will be fired:
It's crucial that you be vigilant about this cap as you consider additional teaching or tutoring assignments. If you exceed the maximum hours, YSU will not employ you the following year. We will have no recourse.
If you teach or work in another department part-time, it will be the TOTAL number of hours. If you teach in American Studies for six hours, you can teach a maximum of twelve semester-hours here over a year. If you work as a tutor, those hours are also important. Same issue: you cannot go beyond twenty-nine work hours a week.
Multiple requests for comment from YSU officials were either declined or not returned. Marilyn Ward, assistant to the provost, said via email that the policy "is still under development."
Following two consecutive years of enrollment decline, YSU expects a loss of state funding. The university has already avoided filling some 100 vacant positions.
YSU becomes at least the second publicly funded school to announce it will limit employees' hours to avoid paying for health insurance. The Community College of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh said last week that it will cut the hours of some instructors to avoid Obamacare requirements. Like YSU, the community college cited state funding cuts and other financial strains as reasons why it couldn't afford the coverage.
Matt Williams, vice president of New Faculty Majority, a group that advocates for collective bargaining rights of adjunct instructors and professors, said he expects this type of action to become "par for the course."
Short of going on a "wildcat strike," Williams said, there's not much YSU's adjunct professors can do if they're unhappy about their working conditions because Ohio law doesn't provide collective bargaining rights for part-time faculty.
"A public university can't be compelled to recognize their union, so there's no recourse to speak of for contingent faculty," Williams said.
He also pointed to another concern: These employees may be working at several state institutions on a part-time basis and thereby racking up full-time hours on the state's education payroll, yet not receiving the same benefits as full-time employees.
"Should those people not be entitled to health insurance if they're working at three state institutions?" Williams asked.
Read one of the memos circulated among employees here (PDF).
Read the full text of an email sent to YSU employees in the English department:
Colleagues,
I'm sorry about this long message, but it's important, and I want to tell you everything that I know about this situation.
At the chair's meeting with the Provost held this Tuesday, Marilyn Ward, Assistant to the Provost, announced that non-union part-time employees were to be limited to working a maximum 29 hours a week. This policy is being implemented because of the federal healthcare laws coming online next year.
Under the law, an employer must provide healthcare coverage to anyone working for thirty or more hours a week. YSU's solution is to ensure that non-union part-time employees work no more than 29 hours.
For immediate implementation, Human Resources has capped part-time faculty teaching at 18 hours a year. The University is using a two-to-one ratio for courses to calculate working hours: one hour of contact time to two hours of prep. So a three-credit course like 1550 is considered nine work hours per week. If you teach three courses, it's 27 work hours per week, thus under the 30-hour cap. In our case, usually that means a maximum of six courses, but 1539 is an exception since it's at four semester hours. If you teach 1539, you are still limited to 18 credits a year; that would be a maximum of four sections of 1539 (16 hours); or a mix of 1539s and other composition courses that stay at or below 18 credits per year.
It's crucial that you be vigilant about this cap as you consider additional teaching or tutoring assignments. If you exceed the maximum hours, YSU will not employ you the following year. We will have no recourse.
If you teach or work in another department part-time, it will be the TOTAL number of hours. If you teach in American Studies for six hours, you can teach a maximum of twelve semester-hours here over a year. If you work as a tutor, those hours are also important. Same issue: you cannot go beyond twenty-nine work hours a week.
English has no choice but to ensure that our part-time faculty remain under the eighteen-credit cap; this cap applies immediately. We don't want to imperil our ability to keep you; you're valuable to us. Guy said he would go through his assignments to ensure that we've kept you in safe territory. We can only check what we know, however, so be sure to check with any other on-campus employment to ensure you're safely under that hour-limit.
Below I'm pasting in the email that the chairs received that outlines the situation:
Part-Time Faculty Benefits (presentation from Kevin Reynolds and Debby LaRocca)
Due to the recent Healthcare Reform, YSU will now be required to offer Health Benefits to any employee who has worked 30 hours per week or more during a look-back period. The University is permitted to define the look-back period (determining the time frame for which the 30 hours will be reviewed) and to define clock hours as it relates to Workload hours (for part-time faculty). Human Resources is finalizing these two definitions. As proposed, the period will be defined as one calendar year, beginning Fall and running through Summer. The first period will be Fall 2012 through Summer 2013. In addition, the workload that will be allowed for one calendar year (as defined) will be a TOTAL of 18 workload hours. No part-time faculty will be permitted to work more than 18 WH during this time period. Should this occur, the part-time faculty members will not be eligible for employment for the next year (unless the University pays health benefits, which YSU does not intend to do). The Provost's Office hopes to have HR finalize the definitions next week and then send out a final set of definitions. In the meantime, you should review your part-time faculty's load and be sure that no one has hours in the spring term that will put him/her over the 18-hour limit.
Guy and I wish this weren't the case. We'll do our best to keep you informed and to work with you to ensure that you remain in compliance with the caps. We value your hard and careful work.

Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World'One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had "the best health care in the world," so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's "the best," the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce.
What do the people in America who "fly coach" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/24/us-health-care-expensive_n_624248.html">overpriced and underperforming</a> -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing.
When the <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/Jun/Mirror-Mirror-Update.aspx">Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation</a>, the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/06/us_health-care_system_still_ba.html">observed</a>:
"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'"Death PanelsThe only thing that perhaps matched the vastness of the spread or the depth of the traction of the "death panel" lie was the predictability that such a lie would come to be told in the first place. After all, this was a Democratic president trying to sell a new health care reform plan with the intention of opening access and reducing cost to millions of Americans who had gone without for so long. What's the best way to counter it? Tell everyone that millions of Americans would have increased access ... <i>to Death!</i> The best account of how the "death panel" myth was born into this world and spread like garbage across the landscape has been penned by Brendan Nyhan, who in 2010 wrote "Why the "Death Panel" Myth Wouldn't Die: Misinformation in the Health Care Reform Debate." <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/health-care-misinformation.pdf">You should go read the whole thing</a>.
But to summarize, the lie began where many lies about health care reform begin -- with serial liar Betsy McCaughey, who in 1994 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/07/andrew-sullivans-mccaughe_n_313157.html">polluted the pages of the New Republic</a> with a staggering pile of deception in an effort to scuttle President Bill Clinton's health care reform. As Nyhan documents, she re-emerged in 2009 when "she invented the false claim that the health care legislation in Congress would result in seniors being directed to 'end their life sooner.'"
Nyhan: "McCaughey's statement was a reference to a provision in the Democratic health care bill that would have provided funding for an advanced care planning for Medicare recipients once every five years or more frequently if they become seriously ill. As independent fact-checkers showed (PolitiFact.com 2009b; FactCheck.org 2009a), her statement that these consultations would be mandatory was simply false--they would be entirely voluntary. Similarly, there is no evidence that Medicare patients would be pressured during these consultations to "do what's in society's best interest...and cut your life short."
But the match that lit the death panel flame was not McCaughey, it was Sarah Palin, who repeated McCaughey's claims in a Facebook posting and invented the term "death panel." As Nyhan reports, Palin's claims were met with condemnation from independent observers and factcheckers, but the virality of the term "death panel" far outstripped its own debunking. To this day, the shorthand for this outrageous falsehood remains more firmly planted in the discourse than the truth.
One thing worth pointing out is that Palin, in creating the term "death panel," <i>intended</i> to deceive people with it. In an interview with the <em>National Review</em>, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/228636/rogue-record/rich-lowry">Palin admitted</a>: "The term I used to describe the panel making these decisions should not be taken literally." Rather, it was "a lot like when President Reagan used to refer to the Soviet Union as the 'evil empire.' He got his point across." Of course, while Reagan was exaggerating for effect, he wasn't trying to prey on the goodwill of those who were listening to him.The Affordable Care Act Is A "Jobs-Killer"Naturally, the GOP greeted anything that the Obama White House did -- from regulating pollution to flossing after meals -- as something that would "kill jobs." The Affordable Care Act was no different. As you might recall, Republicans' first attempt at repeal came in the form of an inartfully named law called the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." But did the health reform plan threaten jobs? Not by any honest measure. <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/01/17/106950/is-health-care-law-really-a-job.html">Per McClatchy Newspapers</a>:
<blockquote>"The claim has no justification," said Micah Weinberg, a senior research fellow at the centrist New America Foundation's Health Policy Program.
Since the law contains dual mandates that most individuals must obtain health insurance coverage and most employers must offer it by 2014, "the effect on employment is probably zero or close to it," said Amitabh Chandra, a professor of public policy at Harvard University.</blockquote>
As McClatchy reported, the "job-killing" claim creatively used the "lie of omission" -- relying on "out of date" data or omitting "offsetting information that would weaken the argument." The Congressional Budget Office, playing it straight, deemed it essentially too premature to measure what the effect the bill would have on the labor market. At the time, Speaker John Boehner dismissed the CBO, saying, "CBO is entitled to their opinion."
Perhaps, but lately, job growth in the health care industry has <a href="https://www.advisory.com/Daily-Briefing/2012/03/07/Jobs-report-preview" target="_hplink">bucked the economic downturn and health care has remained a robust sector of employment</a>. And it stands to reason that enrolling another 30 million Americans into health insurance will increase the demand for health care services and products, which in turn should trigger the creation of more jobs. Is there a downside? Sure. More demand, and greater labor costs, could push health care prices upward even as other effects of health reform push them down. But it's more likely that repealing the bill will have a negative impact on jobs than retaining it.The Affordable Care Act Would Add To The DeficitThe only thing more important than painting the Affordable Care Act as a certain killer of jobs was to paint it as a certain murderer of America's fiscal future. Surely this big government program was going to push indebtedness to such a height that our servitude to our future Chinese overlords was a <i>fait accompli</i>. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/18/cbo-score-on-health-care_n_502543.html">As Ryan Grim reported in May of 2010</a>, the CBO disagreed:
<blockquote>Comprehensive health care reform will cost the federal government $940 billion over a ten-year period, but will increase revenue and cut other costs by a greater amount, leading to a reduction of $138 billion in the federal deficit over the same period, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, a Democratic source tells HuffPost. It will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the second ten year period.
The source said it also extends Medicare's solvency by at least nine years and reduces the rate of its growth by 1.4 percent, while closing the doughnut hole for seniors, meaning there will no longer be a gap in coverage of medication.</blockquote>
Recently, the CBO updated its ten-year estimate by dropping off the first two years of the law (where there was little to no implementation) and adding two years at the back end (during which time there would be full implementation). As you might imagine, replacing two years of low numbers with two years of higher numbers increased the ten-year estimate. But opponents of the bill immediately freaked out and declared the costs to have skyrocketed. <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/obamacare-haters-angered-by-facts.html">As Jonathan Chait reported</a>:
<blockquote>The outcry was so widespread that the CBO took the unusual step of releasing a second update to explain to outraged conservatives that they were completely misreading the whole thing:
"Some of the commentary on those reports has suggested that CBO and JCT have changed their estimates of the effects of the ACA to a significant degree. That's not our perspective. ...
Although the latest projections extend the original ones by three years (corresponding to the shift in the regular ten-year projection period since the ACA was first being developed), the projections for each given year have changed little, on net, since March 2010."
That is CBO-speak for: "Go home. You people are all crazy."</blockquote>
As Chait goes on to note, the CBO now projects that "the law would reduce the deficit by slightly more than it had originally forecast."The Affordable Care Act $500 Billion Cut From MedicareNormally, if you tell Republicans that you're going to cut $500 billion from Medicare, they will respond by saying, "Hooray, but could we make it <i>$700 billion</i>?" But the moment they got it into their heads that the Affordable Care Act would make that cut from Medicare, suddenly everyone from the party of ending Medicare As We Know It, Forever got all hot with concern about what would happen to these longstanding recipients of government health care. In fairness, <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/03/a-final-weekend-of-whoppers/">as Factcheck pointed out</a>, the GOP opponents of Obama's plan were simply picking up a cudgel that had recently been wielded by the president himself:
<blockquote>Whether these are "cuts" or much-needed "savings" depends on the political expedience of the moment, it seems. When Republican Sen. John McCain, then a presidential candidate, proposed similar reductions to pay for his health care plan, it was the Obama camp that attacked the Republican for cutting benefits.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/03/a-final-weekend-of-whoppers/">Nevertheless</a>! <blockquote>Whatever you want to call them, it's a $500 billion reduction in the growth of future spending over 10 years, not a slashing of the current Medicare budget or benefits. It's true that those who get their coverage through Medicare Advantage's private plans (about 22 percent of Medicare enrollees) would see fewer add-on benefits; the bill aims to reduce the heftier payments made by the government to Medicare Advantage plans, compared with regular fee-for-service Medicare.</blockquote>
The <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1005588">concurred</a>:
<blockquote>A phased elimination of the substantial overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, which now enroll nearly 25% of Medicare beneficiaries, will produce an estimated $132 billion in savings over 10 years.
[...]
The ACA also produces nearly $200 billion in savings by assuming that providers can improve their productivity as firms in other industries have done. On the basis of this presumed improvement, the law reduces Medicare's annual "market basket" updates for most types of providers - a provision that has generated controversy.</blockquote>
The law doesn't cut any customer benefits, just the amount that providers get paid. Hospitals and drug companies agreed to these cuts based on the calculation that more people with insurance meant more people consuming what they sell and, more importantly for the hospitals, fewer people getting treated and simply not paying for it.The Affordable Care Act Provides Free Health Care For Undocumented ImmigrantsThis lie was launched to prominence with the help of a false accuser, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson, who famously heckled President Barack Obama during an address to a Joint Session of Congress by yelling "You lie!" after the president had mentioned that undocumented immigrants would not be eligible for the credits for the bill's proposed health care exchanges.
As Time's Michael Scherer pointed out, this was not much of a challenge for factcheckers:
<blockquote>In the Senate Finance Committee's working framework for a health plan, which Obama's speech seemed most to mimic, there is the line, "No illegal immigrants will benefit from the health care tax credits." Similarly, the major health-care-reform bill to pass out of committee in the House, H.R. 3200, contains Section 246, which is called "NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS."</blockquote>
In fact, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/04/why_immigrants_get_short_shrif.html">as Ezra Klein pointed out</a>, the Affordable Care Act "goes out of its way to exclude" undocumented immigrants:
<blockquote>As the AP points out...there are about 7 million unauthorized immigrants who will be prohibited from buying insurance on the newly created exchanges, even if they pay out of their own pocket. And the exclusion of this group from health reform -- along with other restrictions that affect fully legal immigrants as well -- could create a massive coverage gap that puts a strain on the rest of the health system as well.</blockquote>
Klein goes on to add that "immigrants-rights advocates tried to prevent this scenario from happening," but they ended up losing to the politics of the day. The concession they won was a promise from the president that he would shepherd a comprehensive immigration reform package through the legislature. They lost that round, too.Republicans, And Their Ideas, Were Left Out Of The Bill And The ProcessWere health care policies dear to Republicans left out of the health care reform bill? Totally! <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2009/10/29/171026/top-10-reasons-why-republicans-should-support-the-house-health-bill/">Unless we're counting the following</a>:
--Deficit-neutral bill
--Longterm cost reduction
--Interstate competition that allows consumers to purchase insurance across state lines
--Medical malpractice reform
--High-risk pools
--An extension of the time young people were allowed to remain on their parents' policies
--No public money for abortion
--Small business exemptions/tax credits
--Job wellness programs
--Delivery system reform
In fact, the Democrats were eager to get GOP input and enthusiastic about including many of their desired components in the bill. Oh, and did we mention that the Affordable Care Act was modeled on a reform designed and implemented by a former Republican governor and presidential candidate, whose innovation was widely celebrated by the GOP while said former governor was running for president? And did we mention that the individual mandate that was used in Romneycare to ensure "no free riders" was originally dreamed up by the Heritage Foundation? And did we add that additional DNA of the Affordable Care Act was borrowed from the Senate GOP alternative to the Clinton plan in the 1990s and the <a href="http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2009/08/bipartisan-policy-center-releases-report-improving-health-care-quality-a" target="_hplink">2009 Bipartisan Policy Committee plan</a>, which was endorsed by Tom Daschle, Howard Baker, and Bob Dole?
As for the process, you might recall that the White House very patiently waited for the bipartisan Gang Of Six to weigh in with its own solution, and openly courted one Republican gang member, Sen. Chuck Grassley, long after it was clear to every reporter inside the Beltway that Grassley was intentionally acting in bad faith.
And perhaps you don't recall the bipartisan health care summit that was held in March of 2009? if so, don't feel bad about it -- RNC Chairman Michael Steele couldn't remember it either, <a href="http://politicalcorrection.org/blog/201002250005">when he yelled at the president for not having one</a>.The Demonization Of 'Deem And Pass'So, here's a fun little story about obscure parliamentary procedures. In May of 2010, as the health care reform michegas was steaming toward its endgame, it looked like the measure might fall. The Senate had passed a bill, but the House was stuck in a bit of a jam. It had no other choice but to take a vote on the Senate's bill, because if the House bill ended up in a conference committee to be reconciled with the Senate's, the whole resulting she-bang was assured of a filibuster, as the Democrats had, in the intervening period, lost their Senate supermajority. But the House had a problem. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/health-care-opponents-dem_n_501353.html">As I wrote at the time</a>:
<blockquote>House members are averse to doing anything that looks like they approve of the various side-deals that were made in the Senate -- like the so-called "Cornhusker Kickback." The House intends to remove those unpopular features in budget reconciliation, but if they pursue budget reconciliation on a standard legislative timeline -- where they pass the Senate bill outright first and then go back to pass a reconciliation package of fixes -- they'd still appear to be endorsing the sketchy side deals, and then the GOP would jump up and down on their heads.
Enter "deem and pass." Under this process, the House will simply skip to approving the reconciliation fixes, and "deem" the Senate bill to be passed. By doing it this way, the Democrats get the Senate bill passed while simultaneously coming out against the unpopular features of the same.</blockquote>
"Deem and pass" is the aforementioned obscure parliamentary procedure. And here's the thing about obscure parliamentary procedures -- everyone <i>loves</i> them when their side is doing them, but when they're being <i>done to you</i>, then they are basically evil schemes from the blasted plains of Hell.
So if you're guessing that the Republicans declared the Democrats' use of "deem and pass" -- which also carried the moniker "the Slaughter Rule," after Rep. Louise Slaughter, who proposed its use in this instance -- to be a monstrous and unprecedented abuse of power, then give yourself a prize! And give yourself a bonus if you guessed that in reality, the GOP had used "deem and pass" <i>lots of times</i>. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/16/house-has-long-history-of_n_500623.html">As Ryan Grim reported</a>, "deeming resolutions" had been in use dating back to 1933, and in 2005 and 2006, Republicans employed them 36 times.
Other Republicans complained that Slaughter was supporting a tactic that she once vigorously opposed. <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/the_arms_race_of_rules.html">That's true</a>! She fought the "deem and pass" during the Bush administration and lost. Which is precisely when she learned how effective it could be!The Affordable Care Act Would Create A Mad Army of IRS AgentsLots of people wouldn't mind having better access to more affordable health care. But what if it came with thousands of IRS agents, picking through your stool sample? That sounds pretty bad. It also sounds pretty implausible! But that was no impediment to multiple health care reform opponents making claims that the tax man was COMMINAGETCHA!
In this case, the individual mandate -- which requires people to purchase insurance or incur a tax penalty -- provided the fertile soil for this deception to spread. A March 2010 floor speech from a panicked Sen. John Ensign was typical of the genre:
<blockquote>My amendment goes to the heart of one of the problems with this bill. There is an individual mandate that puts fines on people that can also attach civil penalties. And 16,500 new IRS agents are going to be required to be hired because of the health care reform bill.</blockquote>
March of 2010 was a pretty great time for this particular lie. In one five day period, Ensign was joined by Reps. Paul Ryan ("There is an individual mandate. It mandates individuals purchase government-approved health insurance or face a fine to be collected by the IRS which will need $10 billion additional and 16,500 new IRS agents to police and enforce this mandate."), Pete Sessions ("16,000 new IRS agents will be hired simply to make sure that this health care bill is enforced.") and Cliff Stearns ("There is $10 billion to hire about 16,000 new IRS agents to enforce the individual mandate on every American").
All wrong! <a href="http://factcheck.org/2010/03/irs-expansion/">Per Factcheck</a>:
<blockquote>This wildly inaccurate claim started as an inflated, partisan assertion that 16,500 new IRS employees might be required to administer the new law. That devolved quickly into a claim, made by some Republican lawmakers, that 16,500 IRS "agents" would be required. Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas even claimed in a televised interview that all 16,500 would be carrying guns. None of those claims is true.
The IRS' main job under the new law isn't to enforce penalties. Its first task is to inform many small-business owners of a new tax credit that the new law grants them -- starting this year -- which will pay up to 35 percent of the employer's contribution toward their workers' health insurance. And in 2014 the IRS will also be administering additional subsidies -- in the form of refundable tax credits -- to help millions of low- and middle-income individuals buy health insurance.
The law does make individuals subject to a tax, starting in 2014, if they fail to obtain health insurance coverage. But IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman testified before a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee March 25 that the IRS won't be auditing individuals to certify that they have obtained health insurance.</blockquote>
As Factcheck goes on to note, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf">on page 131 of the bill that was passed</a>, the IRS is explicitly prohibited from "from using the liens and levies commonly used to collect money owed by delinquent taxpayers, and rules out any criminal penalties for individuals who refuse to pay the tax or those who don't obtain coverage."Affordable Care Act Bill Is Way Too Long And Impossible To Read!Oh, Congresscritters, the poor dears! So many bills to read and so little time -- between raising campaign cash at lush fundraisers and receiving marching orders from powerful corporate interests -- to actually read them all. <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_08/019629.php">And this Affordable Care Act was a real humdinger of a long bill</a>. And long bills are bad because length implies complication and complication requires study and study implies some form of "work." So the proper thing to do is to mulch the entire print run of the bill and use it to power the boiler that heats the "sex dungeon" in the Longworth Office Building, the end!
Actually, reading the bill is not that hard, despite the complaints. As the folks at <a href="http://computationallegalstudies.com/2009/11/08/facts-about-the-length-of-h-r-3962/">Computational Legal Studies were able to divine</a>:
<blockquote>Those versed in the typesetting practices of the United States Congress know that the printed version of a bill contains a significant amount of whitespace including non-trivial space between lines, large headers and margins, an embedded table of contents, and large font. For example, consider page 12 of the printed version of H.R. 3962. This page contains fewer than 150 substantive words.
We believe a simple page count vastly overstates the actual length of bill. Rather than use page counts, we counted the number of words contained in the bill and compared these counts to the number of words in the existing United States Code. In addition, we consider the number of text blocks in the bill -- where a text block is a unit of text under a section, subsection, clause, or sub-clause.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/09/house-health-care-bill-ac_n_350810.html">As HuffPost noted in March of 2010</a>, "the total number of words in the House Health Reform Bill are 363,086," and when you throw out the words in the titles and tables of contents and whatnot, leaving only words that "impact substantive law," the word count drops to 234,812.
"Harry Potter And the Order Of The Phoenix," a popular book read by small children, is 257,000 words long. (Although in fairness to Congress, the Affordable Care Act contains very few exciting accounts of Quidditch matches.)The 2012ers Join The FunWe couldn't have a list of Affordable Care Act distortions without noting the ways some of your 2012ers have added to the canon. Herman Cain said that if the ACA had been implemented, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/politics-elections/177511-video-cain-if-obamacare-had-been-implemented-already-id-be-dead-">he'd be dead</a>. Not likely! The new law expands coverage so that uninsured individuals who face what Cain faced (cancer) have a better chance of getting coverage, and it restricts insurers from tossing cancer patients off the rolls based on their "pre-existing condition." But more to the point, Cain would have always been the wealthy guy who could afford to choose his doctor and pick the care he wanted. The Affordable Care Act doesn't prohibit wealthy people from spending money.
Rick Santorum says that his daughter, who is diagnosed with a genetic disorder called trisomy 18 and who required special needs care, <a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/04/25/santorum-more-disabled-people-will-be-denied-care-under-obamacare/">would be "denied care" under the Affordable Care Act</a>. Nope! Again, the law restricts insurers from throwing people with pre-existing conditions off their rolls. And for individuals under 19, that went into effect in September of 2010.
Michele Bachmann believes that the Affordable Care Act would open "sex clinics" in public schools. This is Michele Bachmann we're talking about. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/01/bachmann-sex-clinics-will_n_306292.html">Do you even need to ask</a>?
And finally, Mitt Romney has said, as recently as March 5, that he never intended his CommonwealthCare reform to serve as a "model for the nation." "Very early on," he insisted, "we were asked -- is what you've done in Massachusetts something you would have the entire government do, the federal government do? I said no, from the very beginning." Unless "very early on" and "from the very beginning" mean something different from the conventional definition of those phrases, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/03/05/438044/romney-mandate-model-video/">Romney should augment his daily pharmaceutical intake with some memory-enhancing gingko biloba</a>.So Many More To Choose From!Obviously, we did what we could to include as many of these lies and distortions as possible, but there's no way to include them all.

JERUSALEM -- An Israeli and a Palestinian official say preliminary peace talks agreed to after a shuttle mission by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are to begin in Washington on Tuesday.
Israeli-Palestinian talks on the terms of a Palestinian state have been frozen for five years, and both sides have low expectations of the new U.S. peace push.
The two sides still disagree on the rules for actual negotiations, including the principles for drawing a border between them.
It's unclear if those disputes can be resolved in Washington.
Israeli Cabinet Minister Silvan Shalom says "there is a good chance" the preliminary talks will start on Tuesday.
A Palestinian diplomat on Thursday confirmed the date, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with journalists.

On Wednesday, I caught up with the Gordon Monson Show on 1280 The Zone in Salt Lake to discuss my NFL Power Rankings and the Miami football debacle.
I talked about why I rated New Orleans so high at No. 3, with first round running back and former Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram being the culprit. The Falcons could very well be best in the NFC South, but with new center Olin Kreutz and a more balanced offensive attack, look for the Saints to re-establish themselves as an elite force.
I also considered some potential sleepers, notably St. Louis, Houston and Tampa Bay. The Bucs, with budding superstar Josh Freeman under center and Mike Williams on the perimeter, could be prime for a playoff push in just Freeman's third season as a pro.
In regards to a Mr. Nevin Shapiro, I called the guy a flatout "loser." Shapiro is a disgrace to collegiate athletics and a perfect example why, despite trying awfully hard, the NCAA will never fully be able to legislate on campuses the way it wants. Look for the Hurricanes to have the hammer laid down very hard in terms of a severe loss of scholarships and postseason ban, but not the "death penalty" which SMU so infamously received in the late 1980s. Taking out such a premier ACC power is simply not a realistic option in this day and age.

When my mom and I started the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation in memory of my brother four plus years ago, we were animal lovers like many of you. We had pets and had always cherished them, but through our work with animals and the shelters in Los Angeles and the United States, we have learned a tremendous amount about the national challenge of homeless animals.
Did you know that in the United States, we kill almost 4 million animals a year? Euthanasia is the number one killer of cats and dogs. Why are so many animals being put down? Is it because our shelters are overflowing with unadoptable, mean, old animals? Many people believe that animals that are in the pound are damaged goods -- that the dogs and cats have somehow done something to belong there. However they are very often the victims of circumstances. Their owners might have lost their jobs and had to choose between vet care and food for their family. Foreclosure could have forced the family to move into an apartment where pets weren't allowed. Or the once beloved puppy might have grown into an unwieldy adult. Most animals killed each year in shelters are killed for one reason -- lack of a good home, NOT for behavior issues. Puppies, kittens, purebred animals alike -- they all suffer when there is no home to take them in and space restrictions mean that the shelter can no longer hold them. Half of all of the dogs and three-quarters of the cats that enter the shelters of America each year are killed, more than 10,000 each day.
At the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation, we work to change the outcome for thousands of pets annually. In 2012, we transported over 800 dogs from high kill shelters in Los Angeles to no kill shelters elsewhere in the U.S. Here in Los Angeles, the shelters are overflowing with small dogs while elsewhere in the country, the shelters have none. We relocate the dogs so that everyone can find the kind of pet that they want. We provide funding for free spay/neuter for dogs and cats -- over 2000 in 2012 alone! We offer no questions asked sterilization for pets -- if you want to get your cat or dog fixed, we'll pay for it*! We offer free training classes to help new owners learn the basics about how to care for their new pet. Our goal is to end the needless suffering of animals. In the past, my mom and I have funded the Foundation with help from an occasional grant. However we know that we can't continue to do it alone -- we need your help to really make a difference for the animals of America who don't have anyone to speak on their behalf.
I've been working on a very special project lately -- and it's not one that you can see on your TV or movie theater -- it's called Just One and it's a line of pet products whose profits go to help support the work that we continue to do to help save pets. The name Just One isn't a marketer's manufactured title. The name actually speaks to the goal of the Foundation -- it only takes Just One person to make a difference. So when you hear numbers like "almost 4 million a year" or "over 10,000 a day" there's no need to get overwhelmed by how many animals are suffering because you can make a difference -- by helping us help Just One at a time! Each of us can help one and together we'll help them all. For more about this project and the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation, visit the website Just1pet.com. As author Libba Bray says, "And that is how change happens. One gesture. One person. One moment at a time."

After weeks of tackling dated songs (and generally performing them poorly) all it took to give "American Idol" a shot of adrenaline was to allow the contestants to sing songs from their own musical idols. Finally, no more trying to fit their voices to Billy Joel's style, or forcing them to sing Stevie Wonder when all they want to do is Dave Matthews. This week saw most of the finalists truly bringing their A-game, resulting in an eclectic array of musical choices that actually offered some modicum of entertainment value. Unfortunately, with only 9 contestants left and two hours to fill, we were also subjected to three trio numbers -- only one of which was actually worth listening to -- but such is life, since Fox apparently remains resistant to shortening the Wednesday night show to 90 minutes. Here's the rundown of this week's performances -- feel free to weigh in with your favorites in the comments. Colton Dixon: "Everything" by Lifehouse
This is one of my favorite songs, so I'm certain I'm judging it a little more harshly than most, but I wasn't all that impressed with Colton's take on Lifehouse's soft, nuanced ballad. He prefaced it by telling Jimmy Iovine and mentor Stevie Nicks that it's one of his favorite worship songs, and I'm all for a performer picking songs that resonate with them or take on particular significance because of their faith, but somehow, it all seemed too calculated here. Later on in the show, Joshua Ledet would literally break down at the end of his song because of the emotional impact of the lyrics, but here, Colton seemed like he was faking that emotional connection -- repeatedly pointing at the sky and ending the performance kneeling, as if in prayer. It felt tacky and unnecessary, but that's just me. Vocally, he kept good control, though I would've liked to see him hold the notes in the chorus a little longer to give them room to breathe, since his phrasing seemed abrupt. Technically, it was fine, but to me, everything going on around the vocals felt contrived. Naturally, the judges loved it, as they love everything Colton does, because he's a competent, inoffensive and attractive pop-rock singer who is almost certain to win the competition, since he doesn't have the less-marketable individuality that Phillip Phillips displays every week. (Randy Jackson practically said so, while somehow managing to restrain himself from uttering "in it to win it," for once.) Steven Tyler called him a judge's dream come true and insisted that he has perfect pitch (hmm), while Jennifer Lopez admitted she was "honestly moved," and Randy praised his believability. Skylar Laine: "Gunpowder and Lead" by Miranda Lambert
Talk about tonal whiplash, to go from a song as measured and methodical as "Everything" to this. We heard Skylar sing it during the audition rounds and there wasn't anything different here; nor was it particularly distinct from some of her other live show performances, which isn't going to cut it when she's going up against powerhouses like Jessica, Joshua and Hollie. It all had a vague air of karaoke, with Skylar once again rushing through the lyrics without having time to really showcase her range, although no-one could fault her attitude or enthusiasm. But when all you can really say about a performance was that it was "energetic," there's definitely something missing.
Jennifer called it "the perfect song for you," and praised ... you guessed it, her energy; Steven called it "over the top," which I guess he meant as a compliment; and Randy called her a "great performer" and actually had the cojones to compare her to Carrie Underwood in terms of range. Hyperbole, thy name is Randy.
We were then treated to our first trio performance of the night, courtesy of the dream team of Elise, Colton and Phillip, who harmonized deliciously on a Fleetwood Mac medley. To me, Colton's rendition of "Landslide" actually had a lot more emotion and passion in it than his solo performance, and Elise knocked "Edge of 17" right out of the ballpark. Phillip couldn't quite keep up with the vocal acrobatics of his teammates on "Don't Stop," but it was an enjoyable enough mix that suited their voices.
Heejun Han: "A Song For You" by Donny Hathaway (yes, we know Leon Russell did it first)
After last week's surrealistic performance, I was half expecting Heejun to tear his clothes off again, but it appears that he's finally got the kookiness out of his system -- on stage, at least -- and wants to prove that he should stick around. He did that admirably with "A Song For You," which had a beautiful, pure tone that seemed utterly natural. His enunciation is improving and when he's pouring all his focus into the vocal, it's one of the nicest voices to listen to in the competition -- not overly showy, but impressive nonetheless. Steven gushed that with a voice as "deep and beautiful" as Heejun's, he "[made] the song come alive in a way no-one else can." Jennifer enthused that he displayed "the most beautiful tone, the most beautiful vibrato," and Randy was just glad to see that the Heejun they selected finally came back to them. Hollie Cavanagh: "Jesus Take The Wheel" by Carrie Underwood
Hollie seems to be pulling a Melanie Amaro and letting her British accent grow stronger every week, but in terms of performances, I actually think she's been backsliding. Her rehearsal with Stevie Nicks moved the experienced artist to tears, but I failed to feel that emotional resonance during Hollie's actual performance. I'm not sure whether the key was pitched too low for her or whether her crisp enunciation was distracting, but since I cry every single time I listen to Carrie's version -- even after all these years -- I was a little disappointed that Hollie couldn't connect for me. She seemed to miss more notes than she hit, and was holding back on the sweet, clear vocals she demonstrated with such maturity on "Reflection." Randy opined that, although there were "a couple pitchy moments, mostly in the lower range," she did a really good job with the song. Jennifer felt connected to it emotionally, while Steven (thankfully) said that he wished she'd sang a different song, and that it was "just okay" for him. Steven Tyler as the voice of reason, who'd have thunk?
DeAndre Brackensick: "Sometimes I Cry" by Eric Benet
At this point, DeAndre is comfortable in his soulful, R&B niche and there's likely no getting him out of it, so if you like what he does, you'll be satisfied week-to-week, and if you don't, every performance will alternate between snooze-worthy and grating. I generally fall into the latter camp, although this wasn't quite as irritating as I find most of his performances. He was evidently trying to shatter some windows with his falsetto this week, but if you closed your eyes and took a couple of tequila shots, he could've passed for Prince. It's a unique sound, although I'm not sure it's terribly marketable as-is, and he sang it competently enough, so I actually had less to complain about with this performance than I did with Skylar's. Steven offered the Prince comparison too, praising "the passion it took to do those runs," while Jennifer noted that his voice is something you don't hear every day. Randy was glad he's honed in on who he wants to be as an artist, calling it "beautiful." Jessica Sanchez: "Sweet Dreams" by Beyoncé
At this point, I agree with the judges -- the girl is beyond critique. She's confident in her notes, capable of pulling off dazzling runs, knows exactly the right amount of vibrato to use, and has a crystal clarity to her voice. And yet, the judges gave standing ovations to DeAndre and Heejun, but not Jessica -- I think they've started to take her talent for granted, perhaps because they know that a guy's going to win this whole thing. I think Jessica's major problem is the same as Pia's last season: she doesn't really have a personality. She can sing the hell out of a song, belting like Mariah or Whitney, but she's lacking the stage presence and charisma of someone like Elise or Phillip, and I think that's her biggest obstacle right now (aside from her ladyparts). I would love to see her win the competition, as a true testament to talent, but the judges repeatedly hammer home that they're looking for the whole package, and as "teachable" as Jessica might be in rehearsals, I think she needs a few more years and a few hard knocks before she's ready to graduate to superstar status. Still, she was the most technically accomplished of the night, hands down. Our second trio performance was a Michael Jackson medley, courtesy of Joshua, Heejun and DeAndre (racial profiling, much?), who, as expected, didn't gel so well together. "Hot mess" pretty much sums it up.
Phillip Phillips: "Still Raining" by Johnny Lang
As I've mentioned before, Phillip's style isn't something I'd willingly choose to listen to if I was buying an album, but I know there are plenty out there who dig his graveled, bluesy vibe, and he does what he does very well. He seemed to be more engaged with this performance than some of his previous appearances, and you could tell from his expression that he was straight-up enjoying the song. That enthusiasm was infectious (and something missing from a number of other performances this week) and I respect his authenticity and his determination to follow his own path. "You make everything go away and we're just riding the rhythm," Jennifer enthused, noting that he always makes them feel the music and forget they're judging (too easy). "Every song you sing, you own," Steven agreed, while Randy jumped straight to the "I love you," telling him that he loves who Phillip is as an artist and that he has big things ahead of him.
Joshua Ledet: "Without You" by Mariah Carey
Jimmy Iovine called this one of the five most challenging songs anyone could possibly attempt, and with good reason, but Joshua nailed it. He made it look effortless, laying on the vibrato thick but not overdoing it too much -- until the second chorus, at least, when he threw in everything but the kitchen sink, with wild runs and belting high notes that pretty much epitomize the overused phrase, "he took us to church." It had that emotional connection that Hollie and Colton were missing, since Joshua actually broke towards the end of the song, finishing with tears in his eyes. He, like Jessica, often tries too hard, but that's not always a bad thing. Yes, I got goosies. "When you have a voice this big, you need to sing big songs," Randy said reasonably, before calling it "flawless." Steven agreed that it was beautiful, while Jennifer was almost verklempt, calling him a "phenom," "an absolute angel from heaven," and that his voice was "God sent." Hollie, Skylar and Jessica then teamed up for a Madonna medley, which was generally forgettable, despite the talent in the trio, although they were far better than the bumbling Michael Jackson team who preceded them. Elise Testone: "Whole Lotta Love" by Led Zeppelin
The producers truly did save the best for last this week, because even though Jessica and Joshua pulled out the most technically proficient performances, no-one can sing Zeppelin, let alone with all the swagger and growl that Elise put into this rousing rendition. She ate the song up, prowling around the stage like a star and snarling, wailing and roaring her way through the choruses like a bona fide rock star. Female rockers have a poor track record on the show, and because Elise is slightly older and a woman, I'm sure the majority of the "Idol" audience doesn't "get" her, but that doesn't alter the passion and power she brought to this performance. After another standing ovation, Steven validated her (since he's the only qualified rocker on the panel) by insisting, "nobody can pull that song off -- you made Robert Plant proud." Jennifer agreed, "that was some real rock star stuff, that was crazy," while Randy praised her performance too, saying, "that's the hardest song in the world to sing, congrats!" Who do you think were the best and worst performers of the night, and who do you think will go home this week? Weigh in below!
"American Idol" airs Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.
