Some had young children, wives and girlfriends. Others were just starting to make their way in the world.
But the brothers, fathers, sons and uncles who died when a U.S. military helicopter was shot down in eastern Afghanistan all had something in common: a love of family and country, according to friends and family members. Those who knew them said the soldiers were aware of the dangers they faced but were dedicated to their mission – even if it meant giving their lives.
Here are the stories of some of the fallen:
____
Patrick Hamburger planned to propose to his girlfriend, but had a job to do first: a mission in Afghanistan.
The 30-year-old sergeant from Grand Island, Neb., had joined the Nebraska National Guard when he was a senior at Lincoln High School but had never been deployed, his brother Chris Hamburger told The Associated Press on Sunday.
"He didn't have to go, and he wanted to go because his group was getting deployed. He wanted to be there for them. That's him for you," Chris Hamburger said, adding that Patrick always looked out for his two younger brothers and friends.
He was also the kind of guy who helped his girlfriend raise her 13-year-old daughter from another relationship as well as the couple's own 2-year-old daughter, and planned to propose marriage when he got home, Chris Hamburger said.
Patrick Hamburger had been in Afghanistan less than two weeks and had arrived at Forward Operating Base Shank a few days before climbing aboard the helicopter with U.S. Navy SEALs and other troops to rush to the aid of a U.S. Army Ranger unit under fire from insurgents.
"It doesn't come as a total surprise that he was trying to help people and that's how it all ended up happening," Chris Hamburger said.
___
If someone was sad, Michael Strange tried to make them smile. He loved snowboarding, surfing, scuba diving, running, and shooting guns on the range.
"He loved his friends, his family, his country; he loved making people laugh. He was one of a kind," Strange's brother, Charles Strange III, 22, said Sunday outside the family's Philadelphia home, where American flags were planted throughout the neighborhood.
Strange, 25, decided to join the military when he was still in high school, and had been in the Navy for about six years, first stationed in Hawaii and for the last two in Virginia Beach, where he became a SEAL about two years ago, his mother, Elizabeth Strange, told The Associated Press.
But he always told his family not to worry.
"He wasn't supposed to die this young. He was supposed to be safe," Elizabeth Strange said. "And he told me that and I believed him. I shouldn't have believed him because I know better. He would say `Mom, don't be ridiculous and worry so much. I'm safe.'"
Charles Strange said his brother loved the SEALS, especially "the competitiveness, getting in shape and running and swimming and all of that."
He also had two sisters, 21-year-old Katelyn and 7-year-old Carly, and recently became an uncle. The family last saw him in June, when he came for a weeklong visit for his birthday, his mother said. He was supposed to be back for Thanksgiving.
"It was going to be such a good time," his mother said.
____
If Elizabeth Newlun wanted to have a serious conversation with her son, John Brown, she had to shoot baskets with him.
"There's nothing athletic about me, but I realized that you have to get into other people's comfort zone to get information," said Newlun, of Rogers, Ark., explaining that her son, an Air Force technical sergeant, was a "gentle giant" who "just loved anything physical, anything athletic."
Newlun said her son played football and basketball in high school and went to John Brown University on a swimming scholarship. He had wanted to go into the medical field and become a nurse anesthetist, but decided to join the military after seeing a video of a special tactical unit, she said.
The airman was a paramedic and ready to attend to the medical needs of anyone who was rescued, his mother said.
Arkansas state Rep. Jon Woods went to high school with Brown in Siloam Springs and remembered playing basketball and watching "Saturday Night Live" on the weekends.
"When you think of what the ideal model of a soldier would be, he would be it," said Woods. "He could run all day."
___
Aaron Carson Vaughn was a man of deep faith, insisting to his family that he didn't fear his job as a Navy SEAL "because he knew where he was going" when he died.
"Aaron was a Christian and he's with Jesus today," Geneva Vaughn of Union City, Tenn., told The Associated Press on Saturday. "He told us when we saw him last November that he wasn't afraid ... he said, `Granny, don't worry about me.'"
"He was a tough warrior, but he was a gentle man."
Geneva Vaughn said her grandson, 30, joined the SEALS straight out of boot camp and was already a decorated fighter when he was asked by the Navy to return stateside to become an instructor. But he applied to SEAL Team 6 after two years, earning his way onto the squad in 2010.
He asked the military to return him to combat and shipped out just six weeks before he was killed, Vaughn said.
"He was doing what he loved to do and he was a true warrior," Geneva Vaughn said.
Aaron Vaughn leaves behind his wife, Kimberly, and two children, 2-year-old son Reagan and 2-month-old daughter Chamberlyn.
___
Robert James Reeves and Jonas Kelsall had been childhood friends in Shreveport, La., where they played soccer together and graduated from Caddo Magnet High School, Kelsall's father, John, told The Times of Shreveport and KLSA-TV.
Both joined the military after graduation, though the 32-year-old Reeves spent a year at Louisiana State University first, his father, Jim Reeves, told the newspaper.
Reeves became a SEAL in 1999 and served on SEAL Team 6, his father said. During his many deployments, he earned four Bronze Stars and other honors.
Kelsall, 33, was one of the first members of SEAL Team 7, his father said.
He trained in San Diego and met his wife of three years, Victoria, when he was attending the University of Texas out of Basic Underwater Demolition training, his father said.
Reeves placed several American flags outside his home and his neighbors joined in, many decorating their homes in red, white and blue in support of the families.

The Detroit Tigers' Miguel Cabrera injures himself while scoring on 2-run single by teammate Victor Martinez against the Chicago White Sox in the fifth inning at US Cellular Field in Chicago, Illinois, Monday, July 22, 2013. (Scott Strazzante/Chicago Tribune/MCT via Getty Images)
CHICAGO (AP) — Detroit third baseman Miguel Cabrera left Monday night's game against the Chicago White Sox in the fifth inning with a sore left hip flexor.
Cabrera appeared to slow up when he was scoring on a two-run single by Victor Martinez. He came out to play third base in the bottom of the inning, however, and seemed fine before leaving the field with trainer Kevin Rand after Paul Konerko's one-out fly out to right field.
The team tweeted that Cabrera was bothered by a sore left hip flexor. Don Kelly replaced him at third base.
Last year Cabrera became baseball's first triple crown winner since 1967. He was batting.359 with 31 home runs and 96 RBIs heading into the game against Chicago.
The team said Cabrera will be re-evaluated Tuesday and likely is day to day.

Entertainment News
Zac Efron is still nursing a broken jaw, but that doesn't mean he's shirking any promotional duties. Jumping on the viral success of "Bound 3," Seth Rogen and James Franco's shot-for-shot remake of Kanye West's "Bound 2" video, the 26-year-old actor teased a photo for "Bound 4." On Tuesday, Efron posted a shirtless photo of himself and co-star Seth Rogen from their upcoming movie, "Neighbors," with "Bound 4" written in block letters. His caption: "Whether you're a #KanyeWest﻿ fan or not, fans are #Bound2 get a kick out of this new still from #ZacEfron and #SethRogen﻿'s film #NeighborsMovie Check out all the neighborly shenanigans when the comedy hits theaters next May! #uhhuhhoney."
Whether "Bound 4" lives up to the standard of "Bound 3" is unclear. That parody was even appreciated by West and his fiancee, Kim Kardashian, who tweeted at Rogen: "You nailed it!!! Sooo funny! Kanye says what's up! He loves u guys! He laughed so hard at this."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — "Octomom" Nadya Suleman pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of failing to report $30,000 that authorities say she was earning when she applied for public assistance benefits.The 38-year-old single mother of 14 children was released on her own recognizance after arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court on three counts of welfare fraud.She was ordered to report to the county's early disposition court on Feb. 3, where Deputy District Attorney Bill Clark said authorities will try to resolve the case without a trial."If she can pay the money back, that makes a big difference," he said.Suleman, dressed in a dark blue pantsuit, her hair piled up in a bun, appeared before Judge Roberto Longoria for only a couple of minutes. She spoke just one word, a barely audible, "Yes," when the judge asked if she understood she was waiving her right to a preliminary hearing.Immediately afterward Suleman, her attorney Arthur J. La Cilento and two other people quickly left the courtroom, escorted down a hallway by bailiffs who kept them from reporters.Authorities say Suleman failed to disclose residuals from videos and money she was paid for personal appearances when she applied for welfare last year."She was running short on money. She went to the Los Angeles County Department of Social Services and asked for food stamps," Clark told reporters outside court. "And they gave them to her."Soon after, he said, authorities got several calls from people reporting she was earning money during the time she was collecting the welfare.While she might have qualified for some public assistance during that time, he said, authorities calculated that she collected $16,000 more than she should have and they want that back."That's taxpayer money," he said.She is charged with one count of aid by misrepresentation and two counts of perjury by false application. If convicted, she could face five years and eight months in prison.But Clark indicated it was unlikely she would face that much, if any, time behind bars."She's got 14 children. We'll try and work out a deal for her," he said.Suleman, whose real name is Natalie Denise Suleman, shot to fame on Jan. 26, 2009, when she gave birth at a Southern California hospital to eight children, who quickly became the world's longest-surviving octuplets.Like her six older children, they were all conceived by in-vitro fertilization. She has never disclosed the identity of the father.After learning that her physician had actually implanted 12 embryos in her womb, the state Medical Board revoked his license.Almost from the beginning, she struggled to support the additional children. She defaulted on payments on a house she bought in 2010, and the lender foreclosed.She has found ways to make money: doing a porn video, posing topless for various publications, dancing in a Florida strip club and taking part in so-called celebrity boxing matches. One of her boxing opponents was Amy Fisher, the former "Long Island Lolita" who was 17 when she shot her much older lover's wife in the face in 1992.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals paid Suleman $5,000 and gave her a month's supply of vegetarian hot dogs and hamburgers in 2010 for endorsing birth control for dogs and cats.

Some of us might have noticed that the age span between us and our grandchildren is wider than between that of us and our children. This is especially pronounced if we gave birth to our own children at the tender age of twenty-something, but, unlike us, our children felt the need to delay the production of offspring until they had accomplished certain minor things in life.
