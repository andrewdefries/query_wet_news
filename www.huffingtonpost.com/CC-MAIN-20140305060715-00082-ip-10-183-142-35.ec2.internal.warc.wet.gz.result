WASHINGTON -- A Republican congressional candidate in Nevada is facing criticism from Asian-American groups for his controversial new ad that portrays China taking over the country and a scary army of Asian people marching on the U.S. Capitol. Mark Amodei, a former chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, was recently picked to be his party's nominee for the 2nd congressional district in the state. Dean Heller held the seat before he was appointed to the U.S. Senate, replacing John Ensign, who resigned in disgrace in May.
Amodei's campaign ad is a fictional news report from the future, with an Asian anchorwoman telling -- in heavily accented English -- the story of America's downfall. "Once upon a time, America became its own worst enemy," says the narrator. "When all its borrowed money ran out, they kept spending. Out of control, their President Obama just kept raising the debt limit, and their independence became a new dependence. As their debt grew, our fortune grew. And that's how our great empire rose again."
Amodei then appears on the screen and says, "It's not too late to stop this nightmare. ... As your congressman, I'll never vote to raise Obama's debt limit and risk our independence." WATCH:
In a statement to The Huffington Post, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) condemned Amodei's ad but noted that he is, unfortunately, far from the only candidate to play up fears of China's economic power. Chu is chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).
"In recent campaign cycles, we have seen an explosion in the number of political ads that invoke Chinese language and imagery in a sinister light," said Chu. "Both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of using China as a scapegoat for the recession, and the ad being run by Mark Amodei is just one of many we've seen to date."
“We’ve seen how these anti-Asian sentiments can lead to real consequences for our community," she continued. "Tomorrow marks the 29th anniversary of the murder of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American who was beaten to death by two Detroit auto-workers at the height of anti-Japanese sentiments during the crisis in the auto industry. I call on Mr. Amodei to take down this ad immediately, and I urge all candidates and elected officials on both sides of the aisle to refrain from resorting to these scare tactics to score political points."
On Tuesday, the Asian American Action Fund (AAA-Fund), a Democratic Asian Pacific American political action committee, also issued a statement calling the ad "xenophobic."
"The AAA-Fund strongly condemns Mark Amodei’s offensive, fear-mongering campaign ad," said Gautam Dutta, executive director of the AAA-Fund. "We call on Mr. Amodei to immediately remove this racially charged ad from the airwaves and issue an immediate apology to every Nevadan."
Amodei said that he was standing by the ad and wasn't planning to take it down.
"It's not a China ad, it's a U.S. debt ad," he said. "I don't think there was any negative statement about the Chinese in there. The editorial of the ad, if you will, was about our spending habits and our debt habits. So if they took offense, I'm sorry that they did, but the issue that the ad addresses is the U.S. Congress' and the administration's spending and debt habits."
This story was updated with comment from Amodei.

Abby Huntsman Livingston, daughter of GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, appeared on Fox News Friday to push back against a controversial video, reportedly released by Ron Paul supporters in New Hampshire, that scrutinized her father's ties to China and the family's two adopted children.
"I think it's unfortunate that the political conversation has become this vile," she said. "I think this video goes a bit far. My two little sisters are the love of my dad's life. They came from very unfortunate circumstances, and we feel blessed every day to have them in our lives. So, they're the ones I think about in a video like this."
Abby Huntsman Livingston continued, saying "the Ron Paul supporters don't realize that these actions really affect the Ron Paul campaign."
The video, posted to YouTube by a group claiming to be "New Hampshire Liberty 4 Paul," attempts to draw a sinister connection between Jon Huntsman's fluency in Mandarin -- he was a former U.S. ambassador to China -- and adopted children to suggest that he may be some sort of Manchurian Candidate. It closes with an illustration of Huntsman as Chairman Mao.
The Paul campaign quickly disavowed the video after it surfaced on Friday.
"The video is disgusting. Whoever put it up should remove it immediately," Paul spokesman Jesse Benton said to CNN. The campaign later posted a more lengthy response trying to distance itself from the spot.
Huntsman, responded to the video himself on Friday, calling it stupid and explaining his family background.
"I saw just parts of it yesterday," he said. "First of all, it is just stupid. Second of all, yeah, I lived overseas four times ... I speak Chinese, of course I do. If someone wants to poke fun of me for speaking Chinese, that's OK. The thing I object to is bringing forward pictures and videos of my adopted daughters and suggesting that there is some sinister motive there. I have a daughter from China who was abandoned at two months of age and left in a vegetable market, picked up by the police and sent to an orphanage."
"I have a second daughter who was born in India in a very rural village ... and left for dead the day she was born," he added. "And luckily she was picked up before the animals got her, and she was sent to an orphanage for her safety, was raised and now she is in my family. So I have two little girls who are a daily reminder that there are a lot of kids in this world who don't have the breaks that you do and face a very uncertain future ... and now these two girls are on the presidential campaign trail. I say, how cool is that?"

When I first arrived at Edda Lopez's house, I wondered how this elderly woman lives on the second floor of her elevator-less home despite being wheelchair bound. After an hour with Edda, I no longer wondered. Edda is a fighter. She fought for her family and her way of life, persevering even after her home burned down and her husband died a few years later. And now, Edda is fighting Bank of America.
Bank of America services one out of every four mortgages in the United States and is responsible for more foreclosures than any other bank in the country. And now Bank of America is foreclosing on Edda.
Edda lives in Bronx, NY, on a tree-lined side street with playgrounds and parks nearby. You think it might be different, being in the big city, in one of the poorest parts of the nation. But Edda's block looks a lot like the small towns and suburbs that speckle our country. You would feel right at home in her cozy living room or the wide front porch Edda's husband once built with her sons.
When Edda's husband died in 2005 and she lost her job in 2008, she still held on. Edda was approached by a mortgage re-financing company who promised to lower her monthly payments. But buried in hundreds of pages of documents were loopholes and scams. Edda was surprised to find herself an unwitting victim of predatory lending and a sub-prime mortgage. Her payments actually went up.
She tried again. Edda re-negotiated her mortgage with another, more-reputable bank and got her payments down to $2,101 a month, which she could handle. Everything was fine until, in early 2010, Bank of America bought Edda's mortgage and announced her payments would be at least $1,000 higher. What? Edda called Bank of America and only then found out that they had rejected her modification and Bank of America considered Edda behind on her loan for failing to pay the higher amount all along. On the phone -- and only because she called them -- Bank of America told Edda Lopez that her home would be sold at auction on June 26, 2010.
To all those who blame the hundreds of thousands of families facing foreclosure for their predicament and argue that big businesses like Bank of America should be able to do whatever they want, whenever they want, in the spirit of "free market" capitalism and the American way, you need to meet Edda Lopez. Edda is just like the many other hardworking Americans, struggling to play by the rules and reach their dreams but repeatedly knocked down by cheating, greedy corporations. Since when did the American dream turn into corporate-only heaven? You can watch a video about Edda Lopez and sign a petition to protect her home at http://showdowninamerica.org/edda-lopez. The community organization National People's Action has made over 23 formal requests to meet with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan to demand an end to unjust foreclosures for Edda and thousands of other American families. Today, Edda will at a vigil outside the $1 billion Bank of America Tower in New York along with her family, community leaders and clergy members praying that Bank of America does the right thing. It's a sad day in America when hardworking families are reduced to praying for their livelihoods to the gods of big banks.
