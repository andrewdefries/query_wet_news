The Office Ten Years On: Where Are Ricky Gervais, Martin Freeman And The Other Personnel Now?

Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant struck gold on 9th July 20001, when their sitcom about the day-to-day lives of the employees of a Slough paper merchant became the most successful British comedy export of all time.
In a frighteningly confident burst of comic vision, The Office ran for two seasons (just like its natural forebear Fawlty Towers), two Christmas specials and then was gone from UK premises - enjoying instead a lucrative and longrunning US counterpart to prop up its offshore accounts. The doors of its Slough branch closed a full decade ago (yes, it really has been that long), so what happened to the stalwart staff of the Wernham Hogg Paper Company? On the tenth anniversary of the sitcom that changed British comedy AND fly-on-the-wall documentary, here's a fresh look at the personnel who helped shape it...

David Brent (Ricky Gervais)	1 of 10
First Slide	Previous Slide	@
At the helm of the Slough emporium - wool-chewing, key-sucking manager David Brent, an achingly accurate depiction of a man in mid-life meltdown, shrouded only by a veneer of self-denial and comic aspiration. In testament to Gervais' talent, even now a decade has helped numb the pain, Brent can only really be watched through the fingers, hitting as he does pulse points of contempt, pity and, of course, our own social fears and self-doubt. A comedic mould-breaker with a worthy place alongside Basil Fawlty, Alan Patridge and Frasier Crane.
Ricky Gervais has proved to have far more professional acumen than Brent, selling The Office across the world, including the US where he remains the show's executive producer. Gervais subsequently made and starred in Extras as frustrated artist Andy Millman, which won him an Emmy and a Golden Globe.
In between continuing with stand-up comedy, writing a couple of children's books and becoming the first Brit to write an episode of The Simpsons, he barely broke a sweat with Merchant to send their bald, beleaguered pal Karl Pilkington off to visit the seven wonders of the world.
But Gervais's lucky charm hasn't been limited to TV. He's also broken into film, featuring in Night at The Museum, Stardust and, despite his distinctly non-Hollywood teeth, playing a dentist in Ghost Town. And returning behind the camera as well to write, direct as well as star in The Invention of Lying and Cemetery Junction.
His acceptance into the highest echelons of Hollywood seemed complete when he was asked to host the Golden Globes in both 2010 and 2011. However, the return outing proved a double-edged sword, when his uncompromising contempt for his glittering audience left them non-plussed, though garnering him even more comedic kudos everywhere else.
He's about to line-up with his favourite co-star Elmo, for the new Muppets movie, as well as lending his voice to Spy Kids 4 with Jessica Alba and Antonio Banderas.
But his most anticipated project, and possibly most controversial yet, is the mockumentary currently in production, Life's Too Short. Gervais has described this distinctly non-PC offering as a mix of The Office and Extras, with action centering on real-life dwarf actor Warwick Davis. With Stephen Merchant once again in the co-pilot's writing and directing seat, it seems Gervais is back on familiar territory of making us laugh and squirm in equal measure. He appears unstoppable.

Brazilian politician Carme Cristina Lima is accused of exchanging cocaine for votes.
How low can politics go when a Brazilian candidate is accused of helping voters get high? Carme Cristina Lima, 32, who was campaigning for councillor in Itacoatiara in northern Brazil. allegedly handed out cocaine in exchange for votes on Sunday, which was election day. Police officers reportedly became suspicious when they spotted a group surrounding Lima's vehicle. As they investigated, the cops allegedly sniffed out hundreds of packets of cocaine attached to her leaflets, which included instructions on how to vote for her, Metro reported.
Lima and an unnamed man who was with her allegedly tried to flee in the car.
Police chief Daniel Ottoni told the Brazilian website TNOnline that the drug-doling duo reportedly threw a plastic bag filled with other small baggies out the window.
Lima has since been charged with electoral corruption and drug dealing. If convicted under Brazilian law, she would be unable to serve as a public official for at least eight years, Gawker reported.
There are many ways to drum up support. During this past election cycle, at least six candidates across Brazil adopted a variation of President Barack Obama's name to convince voters of their political prowess, the Telegraph reported.

Nov 24 (Reuters) - A Florida woman photographed two months ago riding an endangered manatee in violation of state law was arrested on Saturday on misdemeanor charges, authorities said. The Pinellas County Sheriff's office said deputies arrested Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 53, without incident at her job at a Sears store in St. Petersburg on a warrant for violating the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act. The state makes it illegal to "annoy, molest, harass or disturb" the endangered aquatic mammals, whose survival is imperiled by manmade threats, including boating collisions. Violations are considered a second-degree misdemeanor. The arrest stemmed from reports on Sept. 30 that an unidentified woman had been seen touching and riding a manatee - which can grow up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) in length and weigh up to 1,800 pounds (818 kilograms) - at Fort Desoto Park, a few miles from downtown St. Petersburg. Following media coverage of her cavorting with the mammal, Garcia Gutierrez called the sheriff's office two days later to turn herself in. She admitted the offense claiming "she is new to the area and did not realize it was against the law to touch or harass manatees," the office said in a news release. It was not immediately clear what penalties Garcia Gutierrez would face if convicted. (Reporting by Tim Gaynor; Editing by Paul Simao)

Justin Bieber's Spiked Hat Sparks Criticism: Is It Really His Worst Look Ever? (PHOTOS)

We don't always leap to Justin Bieber's defense, but the latest sartorial backlash against the singer has us wondering if people are being a little too harsh on the kid.
While out and about in London yesterday, the Biebs decided to rock purple leopard print pants, thick-rimmed glasses and -- the pièce de résistance -- a yellow spiked hat. Strangely enough, his critic was none other than Damon Lindelof, one of the writers for "Lost" and the upcoming "Star Trek" film (aka not your usual style pundit). Lindelof took to Twitter to vent his frustrations with the look -- specifically, that hat:
@DamonLindelof
Damon Lindelof
Seriously. Do you think everyone in Bieber's entourage is like, "HOLY SHIT I LOVE THAT HAT!"

"But what if someone tries to STEAL MY HAT, yo?" "Well, Justin, THEIR SHIT WILL GET SPIKED!!!" (high-five, falsetto cry of victory)

Why Lindelof was totally cool with Bieber's drop-crotch pants is beyond us, but, for whatever reason, he really took issue with the 18-year-old's headgear. Rather than take the blame, Bieber took to Instagram to implicate his fans and his friend Ryan Butler: "Ryan said you won't go out in that. I said watch mea haha toocolorful next time im gonna wear a black hat ... But a fan did get me this hat so I'm glad I wore it :)"
We can't help but wonder: Is this spiked-hat ensemble really the worst look the "Boyfriend" singer has ever rocked? Of course, there was that whole controversy about his choice of overalls last November, but we seem to recall some getups that were even more offensive to the eye.
Here's the bizarre look in question:
But is it weirder than this?
Or this?
Or even this??
We'll let you be the judge of that. For now, we're going to lay off Justin for a little while and give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps he's just caving under all of the pressure?
Just in case you hadn't had enough, here's more of Bieber's style:

Packers over Bears: As (I) expected. Two good halves of football were played Sunday. Unfortunately, they weren't by the same team. The Packers looked unstoppable for the first half. And then Jay Cutler went down, Todd Collins played like, well, Todd Collins, and they handed the game over to rookie Caleb Henie, who had never taken an NFL snap. "OK, kid, here's the situation. It's f-ing freezing. We're in the NFC Championship game, down by 14 points to a division rival. The fans are out of it - we think they may actually have been cryogenically frozen by the stadium conditions at this point - our starting QB is hurt and our backup QB is a mess. Good luck!" Surprisingly, the kid did pretty well - better than Jay Cutler was doing, at any rate. How hurt was he? I can't say, but it was the NFC Championship game. Moving on, Matt Forte had a good game. And the Bears D came alive in the second half. But with a rookie under center, it just wasn't enough. And the Pack are going to Texas. Think they can win it all? Well, not if they play like they did in the second half yesterday.
Steelers over Jets: As (I also) expected. The thing is, if the Jets' receivers could catch a ball or the Jets' defense could've tackled ANYONE, this game could have gone completely differently. It's a different kind of football than Eagles fans are used to - actually, that's the case with both teams here - with a QB managing the game with a strong defense and a strong ground attack, when his main job is to not make any big mistakes. And Mark Sanchez can totally handle that. And the Jets have gone to the AFC Championship game - and lost - both of his first two years in the league. That's something that's quite familiar to Eagles fans. Sigh. Reading Gang Green Nation sounds really familiar - lots of looking on the bright side, lots of "we had a great season," lots of "we're contenders," lots of "other teams fear us now," etc. That's familiar to Eagles fans, too. Whatever. Show me the Lombardis. Oh yeah - that would be the Steelers all over. Sigh again.

Casting director Natalie Joos and Style.com Editor-in-Chief Dirk Standen hosted a party on Wednesday night to celebrate the relaunch and redesign of Joos' blog, Tales of Endearment, and the upcoming collaboration between her site and his.
Held atop the James Hotel at the border of SoHo and TriBeCa, the space was intimate -- half indoors, half outdoors, though for whatever reason, the crowd gathered around the glass doors that divided the two. Glasses of champagne and an array of cocktails were passed and poured as industry insiders mingled.
The party's attire was simply stated as "vintage," and many attendees took it to heart. Joos donned a flowing turquoise maxidress with a deep neck and delicate silver chains across her sternum, designed by Lebanese designer Jacques Cassia, provided by Resurrection Vintage. Joos exuded a Rachel Zoe-esque air, partially due to her movements, and partially due to her petite stature and thin frame. Co-host Standen opted for a simple suit and (assumedly) vintage, precariously-knotted neckerchief.
The blogger/casting director gushed to friends about the new layout of her blog with an infectious enthusiasm, much unlike Zoe, who lets her guard down in such a manner for only the most "I Die"-worthy moments. Two months in the making, the layout is cleaner and more mature than her previous one. Such a drastic change will take some getting used to, as Joos joked with friends that she can barely figure out how to use it.
The attendees were a melange of editors, writers, designers, models, bloggers, and friends. Waris Ahluwalia, Phil Oh, Vogue's Stephanie LaCava, Giovanna Battaglia, Genevieve Jones and Prabal Gurung were among the bigger names present. Top models Behati Prinsloo, Tati Cotliar and Anna Selezneva towered above many of the other guests, draping themselves over the shoulders of their favorite designers and writers.
I tried my hardest to arrive fashionably late to the party, but the unbearable heat forced me to seek air conditioned shelter. Fifteen minutes after the event was slated to start, there were no more than 20 guests present.
Among those who were early (by industry standards, of course) was designer Erin Fetherston, wearing a stunning red dress and nude sky-high Louboutins, topped off with her unmistakable bleached bob. Fetherston appeared to be the life of the party just as much a Natalie herself, chatting and giggling with Joos and members of the WWD crew. The photographers ate it up.

Music was provided by Sophomore NYC designer, Chrissy Miller, who was situated in a corner inside with a slew of girls who seemed apt to be featured on The Cobra Snake. Sky Ferreira and Cory Kennedy were among Miller's high-class hipster posse. Party pop jams by Robyn, Katy Perry, and Kid Cudi were played, adding to the already-laid-back atmosphere.
Later in the night, Jamie Strachan, boyfriend of top model Behati Prinsloo, made the questionable decision to cool off in the rooftop pool with his clothes on. He was subsequently escorted out of the hotel by security with Prinsloo following close behind.
An afterparty was held in the ballroom at the Jane Hotel. Kirsten Dunst, Dree Hemingway and Olivier Theyskins were in attendance.

I recently posted The Best (and Worst) Education News of 2011, and thought I'd take a stab at some prognostication for 2012.
I think I batted close to 50 percent in last year's predictions -- that can't be that much worse than those made by professional pundits.
Feel free to add your own predictions in the comments section -- and don't hesitate to include "wishful thinking!"
Here are my Education-Related Predictions For 2012:
1. Proponents of what is typically called "school reform" -- expansion of charter schools and teacher merit pay, primarily evaluating teachers by student test scores, erosion of seniority rights -- will emphasize expanding their agenda through three major avenues: Teach For America will use their new $50 million grant from the federal government to enter multiple new districts, KIPP Charter Schools will do the same with their new $25.5 million grant from The Walton Family Foundation, and, in California at least, charter operators will build on their recent push to have county Boards of Education's approve charter applications over school district objections.
2. Notwithstanding recent court decisions in New York City, efforts to publish teacher ratings by test scores in local newspapers will "peter out." Newspapers will shy away from publicizing this misleading data after seeing the backlash received by the Los Angeles Times after they pioneered this ethically questionable practice. In addition, since more districts are unfortunately including student test scores in teacher evaluations, the practice of making "job reviews" public will becoming increasingly questionable legally.
3. There will be a surge of interest in the concept of Social Emotional Learning (SEL), the idea of explicitly helping students learn about and develop character traits like self-control and perseverance. Unfortunately, that interest will be combined with a strong desire to test and grade, and much of its potential effectiveness will be lost.
4. Here in California, Governor Brown and his allies will be successful in convincing proponents of other tax initiatives to focus on supporting his ballot drive. His plan to increase taxes would result in billions more for schools, and will pass handily. That success will inspire similar efforts in other states during following years.
5. As the 2012 presidential election nears, and the polls show a Romney/Obama contest as a nail-biter, the Obama Administration will offer a "fall surprise" to teachers by offering states waivers to No Child Left Behind requirements that don't have the "poison pills" of rules and costs that their present waiver hold. The tactic will work, and larger numbers of educators will actively campaign for the president in the election's final months.
6. The awful and inaccurate teacher evaluations in New York, Tennessee and Florida will force states to go much more slowly in implementing ones that include student test scores as a sizable percentage of the ranking. Unfortunately, the momentum for these types of evaluations will only be slowed, not stopped.
7. At the same time the momentum for awful teacher evaluations is slowed, there will be a renewed interest in using Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) as an evaluation and professional development strategy. Districts that expand the use of this process, which treats educators as professionals, will find increasing success for students, their families, and educators alike.
8. Michelle Rhee will continue her decline in public credibility and relevance. Her work with some of the most conservative, and anti-teacher Republicans has made her a contagion among many Democrats. And, as her Republican allies falter in their own success and popularity across the country, she is incredibly trying to build a base here in California -- unsuccessfully.
9. Strategies to use technology as a transformative tool in education will take a backseat as for-profit online learning charlatans and the Khan Academy take up the tech money and the media space.
10. As I did last year, I'm borrowing this last one from Bill Ivey, a colleague in the Teacher Leaders Network. He predicts: "Each and every school day will bring tens of thousands of reasons to celebrate in schools across the country." That sure sounds good to me...
