Incomes in America barely rose last year, and that's in part a result of companies deciding against doling out extra bucks if possible.
Only a third of Americans received a pay raise, promotion or bonus last year, a new survey by Adecco finds. For the lucky minority that's been good news. This month Ford Motor Co., for one, announced pay raises and bonuses for 20,000 of its white-collar workers in the U.S. and Canada. That more than half the country didn't receive any hint of financial relief last year is bad news, though, for the almost half of Americans that say they live in households that lack economic security, according to November survey. Not that many expected much in the way of financial relief. Recent studies have found Americans workers to be particularly disillusioned when it comes to the prospect of a raise. Nine out of ten surveyed in a 2010 study said they did not expect any pay increases to keep up with the rising prices of food and fuel. Corporations are reaping the benefits of a workforce that's working harder and not costing much more. Indeed, last year, profits per employee continued to rise, according to an August analysis by Sageworks. Adecco's survey also found that workers are more concerned with keeping their job than getting a pay increase. Those listing job security as their highest priority nearly doubled the percentage that said the size of their salary. That makes sense with the job market so week: Though the unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in December, it hovered near 9 percent for years. Such desperation may also explain why the survey found that nearly two-thirds of respondents viewed temporary jobs more favorably than last year. Of those surveyed, 86 percent considered taking such a position a good career move.

At Home Exercises

Celebrity fitness trainer Joel Harper shared a few excellent at-home exercises with us during his last visit. "I am big on using your body as a gym," said Joel. One of the easiest tips he recommends is to use the stairs in your own home. Using two steps, step up 25 times on one side, then switch. Do four sets of these to make 100 steps total. An expert insider tip: don't pound your feet! Instead, bounce your bottom foot back down softly onto the floor each time you step down, using your ankles and knees as springs.Jumping rope is another great option. Again, be sure to stay light your feet. "Pretend you’re on a sheet of glass," said Joel, emphasizing the importance of a soft landing each time. Another great at-home workout is Joel's Towel Run. It's a great way to get your heart rate up and blast calories," Joel told us. See the video below to learn how to do this exercise.For more of Joel's tips for a healthier 2014, see the slideshow below:
Loading Slideshow
Drink Plenty Of WaterIn order to calculate how much water you should be drinking per day, divide your body weight in half, then make sure you drink that amount of water in ounces every day. Your body is 50-65% water, so it needs water to function efficiently and effectively. Metabolize Before BedAlways eat three hours before going to sleep to allow your body time to fully digest and absorb the nutrients of your meal. Importance Of ProteinAlways eat protein within 30 minutes of working out. Your body needs protein in order to repair and build the muscles that you just worked. Count Out LoudIf you catch yourself holding your breath during exercise, count out load. This helps to avoid straining and moving the tension to other parts of your body. Fiber-Full BreakfastAlways eat a healthy balanced breakfast with fiber to boost your metabolism and help you avoid overeating later in the day. Avoid Dehydration Headaches85% of all headaches are caused by dehydration. When the body is dehydrated, your blood volume drops, leading to lower blood and oxygen flow to the brain. Keep It Eye LevelWhen walking as well as exercising, always look eye level or above. It automatically improves your posture and helps you to avoid rolling your shoulders forward. Buffet EtiquetteWhen at a buffet, make sure none of your food touches on the plate to avoid piling on too much and overeating. An Almond-Eating TrickSoak your raw almonds in water for one hour before eating them. This makes them much easier to digest and helps your body absorbs the enzymes better. Abs Workout TipWhen doing ab work, put your hand on your stomach to make sure you are pulling the muscles down, not pushing them up. Count BackwardsAlways count backwards when exercising. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment, plus you'll work out harder from the instant gratification.Keep It ConsistentMake sure to never go two days in a row without exercising. Consistency is key with any fitness program -- look at it like brushing your teeth! Always try to get in a minimum of 15 minutes a day. Take Care Of InjuriesNever exercise with joint or muscle pain. Always fix it first. These types of problems will not work themselves out, and you want to avoid long term damage. See more clips

Infant Formula Standards
Parents News
WASHINGTON (AP) — After nearly two decades of study, the Food and Drug Administration proposed rules Thursday designed to make sure that infant formula is safe and nutritious.Most formula makers already abide by the practices, but the FDA now will have rules on the books that ensure formula manufacturers test their products for salmonella and other pathogens before distribution. The rules also require formula companies to prove to the FDA that they are including specific nutrients — proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals — in their products.It is already law that formula must include those nutrients, which help babies stay healthy. But the new rules will help the FDA keep tabs on companies to make sure they are following the law. The rule would require manufacturers to provide data to the FDA proving that their formulas support normal physical growth and that ingredients are of sufficient quality."The FDA sets high quality standards for infant formulas because nutritional deficiencies during this critical time of development can have a significant impact on a child's long-term health and well-being," Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods, said.The rules also are aimed at new companies that come into the market. In recent years, grocery store aisles have become even more crowded with new kinds of formula, some capitalizing on natural or organic food trends.The agency said breastfeeding is strongly recommended for newborns but that 25 percent of infants start out using formula. By three months, two-thirds of infants rely on formula for all or part of their nutrition.The FDA doesn't approve formulas before they are marketed but formula manufacturers must register with the agency. The FDA also conducts annual inspections of facilities that manufacture infant formula — far more often than the agency does inspections of other food facilities. Dr. Stephen Ostroff, chief medical officer of the FDA's Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine, says the rules will help the agency enforce the law if it inspects a facility or looks at a company's records and find problems. He said the rules were stalled for so many years — they were first proposed in 1996 — as the agency was keeping up with science that became available on food safety and other related issues.Congress passed the Infant Formula Act in 1980 after a major manufacturer reformulated some of its formula products and omitted salt. A year later, infants who had eaten the formula were diagnosed with a chloride deficiency. The act required formula makers to use specific nutrients.Over the years, infants occasionally have been diagnosed with cronobacter, one of the pathogens formula makers will now be required to test for and that is linked to infant formula. Found in the environment, hospitals and homes, cronobacter can multiply when formula sits out between feedings. It has only been found once in an unopened powdered formula, in 2002.In 2011, the FDA and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested infant formulas for cronobacter after four infants were infected with the pathogen in four states, and two of those infants died. They found no cronobacter in unopened cans of formula and were unable to link the cases to each other.___Follow Mary Clare Jalonick on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mcjalonick

1. Breastfeeding is good.If there's one thing that researchers have confirmed in recent years, it's that breastfeeding has benefits. And several 2013 studies uncovered even more evidence supporting that fact: <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/264080.php" target="_hplink">One found </a>that breastfeeding longer may help boost babies' intelligence, perhaps because breast milk contains DHA, which has been linked to cognitive development. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/breastfeeding-adhd_n_3288462.html" target="_hplink">Another suggested</a> that breastfeeding may be protective against ADHD -- although it did not establish cause and effect (so it might be that other aspects of children's upbringing, for example, or genetics played a role). Most medications are safe for nursing mothers ...A major American Academy of Pediatrics report issued this year concluded that the majority of medications are safe for nursing mothers, despite the fact that many women are counseled to discontinue their use. Some medications do transfer to breast milk, but the amounts tend to be small, while others do not transfer at all. The difficulty, however, is knowing which drugs are safe and which are not. "There are traditional medications, like aspirin, that have been around for years and that we have a lot of information about, we're secure in our knowledge," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/medication-nursing_n_3806389.html" target="_hplink">one doctor told HuffPost</a>. "But there are new drugs coming out all the time, including new antidepressants and antipsychotics, and we know less about them." Buying breast milk online is risky.Buying and sharing breast milk online has become increasingly popular, but it is not a particularly safe practice, according to data released in 2013. Researchers purchased samples from one of the most popular milk sharing websites in the U.S. and compared them to those from a milk bank (milk banks, which are regulated by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/PediatricAdvisoryCommittee/UCM235619.pdf" target="_blank">Human Milk Banking Association of North America</a>, follow strict guidelines and pasteurize their milk). The online samples had higher levels of contamination, with 64 percent testing positive for staphylococcous, and three of the samples testing positive for salmonella. Though many parents are, understandably, eager to provide their babies breast milk and may not be able to for various reasons, there is no getting around the potential risks: "There is hardly anything that, as a buyer, you could use to determine if a given sample is safe for your baby," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/21/breast-milk-safety_n_4124682.html" target="_hplink">the study's researcher told HuffPost</a>. The vaccine timetable is safe.A comprehensive review conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that the current U.S. vaccination schedule is safe, and that there is no evidence that immunizing children against polio, whooping cough, measles and other diseases leads to health issues, such as autism or asthma. While the IOM said it hopes the findings will reassure parents and health care providers that current guidelines are safe, it also called for continued monitoring, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/16/vaccine-safe-for-children_n_2488449.html" target="_hplink">Reuters reported</a>. 'Flatspots' are common (and no cause for concern).Since the advent of the "back to sleep" campaign (aimed at reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), the number of babies with "positional plagiocephaly" -- medicine-speak for flat spots on their heads -- has soared. A Canada-based study found that more than 46 percent of 2- to 3-month-olds have some form of the condition (most mild). Because the researchers didn't have past figures for comparison's sake, it's entirely possible that this has long been the case, and parents and doctors are just more aware of it now; or it could be because more babies are sleeping on their backs. Whatever the reason, the good news is that flat spots tend to be totally harmless. Bedtime consistency matters.It's not just how much sleep kids get, but how regular it is that is important, according to a study out of the U.K. Children with consistent bedtimes scored better on reading, math and tests of spatial skills. And the effects appeared to be cumulative: Children who had inconsistent bedtimes when they were 3 (the researchers asked parents about their kids' bedtimes at ages 3, 5 and 7) scored lower at age 7. And kids who had inconsistent bedtimes at more than one of those ages showed more pronounced effects on their tests. It is not clear yet whether not having a set bedtime is simply a reflection of children living in "chaotic settings" where they were more likely to skip breakfast or have a TV in their room, the researchers wrote or whether the effect was more direct, but sleep experts say the message is clear: "I would tell you that in my estimation, the majority of parents have no idea how important sleep consistency is," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/11/kids-bedtimes_n_3580201.html" target="_hplink">one told HuffPost</a>. "It's not because they don't care. They haven't been told." Most packaged foods for toddlers have too much salt.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/sodium-baby-food-_n_2925776.html" target="_hplink">One of the first studies</a> to take a close look at the amount of sodium in packaged foods made for toddlers found that 70 percent of them exceeded 210 mg of sodium per serving -- the threshold researchers used to classify a food as high sodium. And some of the toddler meals had roughly <em>half</em> of the maximum daily recommendation. Fortunately, baby foods fared better: Almost all of the commercial foods for babies up to one year were relatively low in sodium, the researchers found.Childhood obesity is down.For the first time in decades, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/childhood-obesity-kids-healthier-_n_3922637.html" target="_hplink">childhood obesity rates dropped</a> -- at least among low-income preschoolers between the ages of 2 and 4. These lower rates are, of course, good news but health experts say the overall numbers are still too high: One in 8 preschoolers in the U.S. is considered obese.ADHD diagnoses are up.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/health/more-diagnoses-of-hyperactivity-causing-concern.html?_r=0" target="_hplink">A comprehensive <em>New York Times</em> analysis</a> of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released in 2013 uncovered a significant jump in the number of children who were diagnosed with ADHD in the past decade. Up to 11 percent of school-age children have been told they have disorder, according to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/health/more-diagnoses-of-hyperactivity-causing-concern.html?_r=0" target="_hplink"><em>Times</em></a>, for reasons that are not yet understood. It could be, for example, that there is simply more awareness of ADHD or that children are being over-diagnosed. Or, perhaps, there are factors causing ADHD to be more prevalent than before. Autism might be more common than previously thought.The prevalence of parent-reported cases of autism is up from 1 in 86 in 2007 to 1 in 50 between 2011 and 2012, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/autism-prevalence_n_2909533.html" target="_hplink" CDC data revealed</a>. Researchers argued that the uptick was largely due to doctors identifying previously unrecognized cases of ASD, although it is also possible that other factors are at play. The 1 in 50 figure is, clearly, at odds with the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/research.html" target="_hplink">1 in 88 figure</a> provided by the CDC, which is often used as the best estimate of autism prevalence in the U.S. That estimate comes from data collected in health and special education records, whereas the 1 in 50 figure comes directly from parents. TVs, high chairs, magnets and rides can all be risky.Research now shows that certain seemingly harmless things can prove risky for children. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/tv-injuries_n_3625056.html" target="_hplink">One study found</a> that televisions injure roughly one child in the U.S. every 30 minutes -- largely by falling on them. Another showed parents should be vigilant when their children are in high chairs (around <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/09/high-chair-injuries_n_4411868.html" target="_hplink">9,400 young kids</a> in the U.S. are injured falling off high chairs each year, it concluded). Magnets also pose a risk: The number of yearly swallowing incidents jumped from roughly one child in every 200,000 in 2002 to six per 200,00 in 2010, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/29/us-kids-magnets-idUSBRE97S13V20130829" target="_hplink">one study showed</a>). And amusement rides (at parks, fairs, restaurants and malls) injure more than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/01/rides-injury-children_n_3187571.html" target="_hplink">4,400 children yearly</a>). Bullying has physical (not just emotional) consequences.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/bullying-physical-effects_n_3935056.html" target="_hplink">A startling study</a> found that when school-age children are bullied by their peers, they're twice as likely to experience so-called "psychosomatic symptoms," including headaches, stomachaches, dizziness, bed wetting and sleep problems. Sometimes, parents and teachers ignore children's physical symptoms or assume they're faking a stomachache, for example, to get out of an activity. But the study emphasizes that adults should take such symptoms seriously, as they might be a sign that something else is going on. Yelling at kids can be just as harmful as physical punishment.Words matter, and so does the way they are delivered. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/yelling-at-kids_n_3875832.html" target="_hplink">A study</a> concluded that harsh verbal discipline increases childrens' risk for depression and aggressive behavior (it focused on 13 and 14-year-olds) -- in much the same way that physical punishment often does. "The negative effects of verbal discipline within the two-year period of [the] study were comparable to the effects shown over the same period of time in other studies that focused on physical discipline," one of the researchers said in a statement.Teens are engaging in healthier behaviors.Obesity rates appear to be "cresting" among adolescents and teens, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/childhood-obesity-kids-healthier-_n_3922637.html" target="_hplink">a separate study found</a>. It also concluded that middle and high school students are engaging in healthier behaviors, like eating more fruits and vegetables and fewer sweets; skipping breakfast less often and exercising more. (The study did not establish a causal relationship between these healthier behaviors and the apparent leveling off in childhood obesity rates.) The amount of time spent watching TV also decreased, however, the amount of time teens spent playing video games or chatting online remained largely the same.Marijuana might permanently hurt teens' brains.The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/26/teen-marijuana-brain-adolescence_n_3653778.html" target="_hplink">study was highly preliminary</a> and conducted with mice, but it nonetheless generated a lot of attention for its finding that regular marijuana use during adolescence might damage brain function, putting teens at risk for psychiatric disorders down the road. The study is not the final word (indeed, a paper published in 2012 found teen marijuana use <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/21/teens-marijuana-brain-tissue-alcohol_n_2331779.html" target="_hplink">does not appear</a> to affect brain tissue health). But as the lead researcher explained, "Over the past 20 years, there has been a major controversy about the long-term effects of marijuana, with some evidence that use in adolescence could be damaging."

A Credit Deficit or a Democratic Deficit?	Read More:

Economic remedies for the fiscal crisis continue to frustrate their political backers. On that black Monday when the U.S. Congress refused to pass the 700 billion dollar bailout, the market plummeted 477 points. A few days later, after Congress reversed itself and passed the 700 billion dollar bailout, the market dropped nearly 800 points. Since then, it has gyrated wildly, drawing markets in England, Europe and Asia into the maelstrom. What's going on? A crisis in economic capital? Or in fiscal confidence?
Not exactly. As the ongoing global hysteria makes evident, trust is at stake, but not purely fiscal or economic trust. Deleveraging banks, insuring deposit accounts, penalizing CEOs and socializing risk can't do the trick because trust is ultimately political - more specifically, democratic.
Trust is a crucial form of social capital, a recognition of the common ground on which we stand as citizens. It is the glue that holds rival producers and consumers together and lets them do the business that would otherwise do them in. Whereas the whole point of the market is competition - selfishness and narcissism as self-conscious instruments of market calculation. The dirty little secret is, however, that complacent market capitalism works only when it can feed parasitically off of active democratic social capital. When too many mortgages fail and too many banks come under pressure and too much bad paper gets sold and too many hedge funds don't realize what they've bought, and credit freezes up and stocks tumble, then the trust deficit appears. And no amount of fiscal tinkering, government pushing, banking reform, resolute de-leveraging or Presidential and Ministerial rhetoric can make up for this democratic deficit.
Because the secret of the invisible hand is not economic capital but social capital. Because Adam Smith knew moral sentiments no less than capital markets undergirded the wealth of nations. The liquidity crisis is a political crisis; the credit deficit is a democratic deficit. For trust is the social capital that permits private capital to be exchanged, contracts to be enforced, promises to be kept, expectations to be realized. Democracy is the common sea in which all those competing market boats and bickering fiscal sailors are kept afloat.
So although it was bad loans and greedy bankers and stupid hedge fund managers and ignorant investors who made the mess, it has been four decades of de-democratization that has done the real damage. A hemorrhaging of social capital that nobody noticed because government was supposed to be the problem and markets the solution. Runaway Thatcherism and exuberant Reaganism railed against government until citizens were literally talked out of their democracy. Government was allegedly the villain but government was just democracy's tool, not always very efficient and often insufficiently transparent and accountable, but democracy's tool nonetheless. And democracy's real product was trust. As the war on government became a war on democracy it drew down the well of social capital and eroded trust, causing citizens to lose faith in each other and their common power to govern themselves.
Why now should consumers trust banks? Or bankers trust one another? Or investors trust the stock market? Or anyone at all trust the Prime Minister or the U.S. President or his Treasury Secretary or for that matter the M.P.s and Congressmen who don't trust their own leadership? Trust is at once both precious and precarious, foundational but fragile. No leveraging without trust. No housing market without faith. No stock market without fidelity. No international trade without confidence. All products of social capital, all victims of the "cash nexus" that Marx associated with capitalism's essence. For capitalism is rooted in selfishness and cold calculating self-interest and necessarily dedicated to the welfare of shareholders rather than common goods and it thus is incapable of generating the trust on which it depends. The way out of the crisis then demands more than technical fixes or propping up banks or pumping billions into the frozen credit market. It means consumers must also be citizens if contracts and promises and mortgages are to be honored. Remember Jimmy Stewart in the Christmas classic "It's a Wonderful Life"? An accidental loss of economic capital drove his neighborhood bank to the brink of ruin and Stewart to the brink of suicide. No stemming the run on his bank and the economic chaos it produced. Until his friends and neighbors and good willed fellow citizens who had benefited by the bank's neighborly policies and felt affection for Stewart assembled their own neighborly assets and saved Stewart and his bank. Social capital rescued Bedford Falls from the consequences of economic capital run amok.
The lesson? The remedy today lies not simply in deleveraging but in re-democratizing. Recreate social capital and trust will follow. Then, and only then, markets will calm and lenders lend again, investors invest again, consumers buy homes again, and - with the private economy once more subordinated to the public good - prosperity again become possible, disciplined by civic faith and democratic justice.

It's charity time, and not just because the holiday season reminds us to be charitable. As the tax year draws to a close, the charitable tax deduction beckons.
America's wealthy are its largest beneficiaries. According to the Congressional Budget Office, $33 billion of last year's $39 billion in total charitable deductions went to the richest 20 percent of Americans, of whom the richest 1 percent reaped the lion's share.
The generosity of the super-rich is sometimes proffered as evidence they're contributing as much to the nation's well-being as they did decades ago when they paid a much larger share of their earnings in taxes. Think again.
Undoubtedly, super-rich family foundations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are doing a lot of good. Wealthy philanthropic giving is on the rise, paralleling the rise in super-rich giving that characterized the late nineteenth century, when magnates (some called them "robber barons") like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller established philanthropic institutions that survive today.
But a large portion of the charitable deductions now claimed by America's wealthy are for donations to culture palaces - operas, art museums, symphonies, and theaters - where they spend their leisure time hobnobbing with other wealthy benefactors.
Another portion is for contributions to the elite prep schools and universities they once attended or want their children to attend. (Such institutions typically give preference in admissions, a kind of affirmative action, to applicants and "legacies" whose parents have been notably generous.)
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the rest of the Ivy League are worthy institutions, to be sure, but they're not known for educating large numbers of poor young people. (The University of California at Berkeley, where I teach, has more poor students eligible for Pell Grants than the entire Ivy League put together.) And they're less likely to graduate aspiring social workers and legal defense attorneys than aspiring investment bankers and corporate lawyers.
I'm all in favor of supporting fancy museums and elite schools, but face it: These aren't really charities as most people understand the term. They're often investments in the life-styles the wealthy already enjoy and want their children to have as well. Increasingly, being rich in America means not having to come across anyone who's not.
They're also investments in prestige - especially if they result in the family name engraved on a new wing of an art museum, symphony hall, or ivied dorm.
It's their business how they donate their money, of course. But not entirely. As with all tax deductions, the government has to match the charitable deduction with additional tax revenues or spending cuts; otherwise, the budget deficit widens.
In economic terms, a tax deduction is exactly the same as government spending. Which means the government will, in effect, hand out $40 billion this year for "charity" that's going largely to wealthy people who use much of it to enhance their lifestyles.
To put this in perspective, $40 billion is more than the federal government will spend this year on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (what's left of welfare), school lunches for poor kids, and Head Start, put together.
Which raises the question of what the adjective "charitable" should mean. I can see why a taxpayer's contribution to, say, the Salvation Army should be eligible for a charitable tax deduction. But why, exactly, should a contribution to the Guggenheim Museum or to Harvard Business School?
A while ago, New York's Lincoln Center held a fund-raising gala supported by the charitable contributions of hedge fund industry leaders, some of whom take home $1 billion a year. I may be missing something but this doesn't strike me as charity, either. Poor New Yorkers rarely attend concerts at Lincoln Center.
What portion of charitable giving actually goes to the poor? The Washington Post's Dylan Matthews looked into this, and the best he could come up with was a 2005 analysis by Google and Indiana University's Center for Philanthropy showing that even under the most generous assumptions only about a third of "charitable" donations were targeted to helping the poor.
At a time in our nation's history when the number of poor Americans continues to rise, when government doesn't have the money to do what's needed, and when America's very rich are richer than ever, this doesn't seem right.
If Congress ever gets around to revising the tax code, it might consider limiting the charitable deduction to real charities.
ROBERT B. REICH, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley, was Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. Time Magazine named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century. He has written thirteen books, including the best sellers "Aftershock" and "The Work of Nations." His film, "Inequality for All," will be out in September. He is also a founding editor of the American Prospect magazine and chairman of Common Cause.
