After last night's debate, Progressive Accountability compiled a video of the similarities between Bush in 2000 and Palin in 2008. It's pretty incredible. She really is Bush in a skirt.

NEW YORK — Derek Jeter and CC Sabathia got the New York Yankees off to a winning postseason start in their new ballpark. Even Alex Rodriguez broke out of his playoff rut against these tired Minnesota Twins.
Jeter tied it with a two-run homer, Sabathia was the ace the Yankees signed him to be, and New York romped over the Twins 7-2 Wednesday night in the opener of their AL playoff series.
After Jeter's third-inning homer off loser Brian Duensing pulled New York even at 2-2, Nick Swisher pulled a go-ahead double down the left-field line in the fourth that scored Robinson Cano from first as the Twins made a pair of poor throws.
Rodriguez had gone 0 for 29 in the postseason with runners on base dating to Game 4 of the 2004 AL championship series before chasing Duensing with an RBI single that made it 4-2 in the fifth.
On a night with sustained winds blowing to right-center at 20 mph, with gusts up to 43 mph, Hideki Matsui followed with a two-run homer into Monument Park on left-hander Francisco Lirano's fourth pitch. The Yankees celebrated like kids, just as the Twins did when they beat Detroit in an AL Central tiebreaker at the Metrodome on Tuesday night. New York went on to win its first playoff game since Joe Girardi replaced Joe Torre as manager after the 2007 season.
Rodriguez added another run-scoring single in the seventh against Jon Rauch following an error by first baseman Michael Cuddyer, with A-Rod's drive hitting halfway up the right-field wall.
Minnesota didn't arrive to its hotel until nearly 4 a.m. and appeared to lack the energy that propelled the Twins during a 17-4 finish, which overcame a seven-game division deficit. The teams get a day off before resuming Friday night, when A.J. Burnett pitches for the Yankees against Nick Blackburn. New York will be trying to get off to its first 2-0 postseason start since 1999 against Texas.
Casey Stengel hit the first postseason home run across the street at original Yankee Stadium, an inside-the-parker that gave the New York Giants a 5-4 win in the 1923 World Series opener.
It was Jeter, naturally, who hit the first home run in the Yankees' $1.5 billion palace, where New York was a major league-best 57-24 at home during the regular season. The captain also got New York's first hit, was on base four times with two hits and two walks, and scored three runs.
New York won all seven games against the Twins during the season, and was 23-3 at home against Minnesota during the regular season from 2002 on, but the Yankees had split four home games against Minnesota in the playoffs in 2003 and 2004.
After getting past the Twins in 2004 and taking a 3-0 lead against Boston in the ALCS, the Yankees lost 13 of their next 17 postseason games. To rebuild their rotation, the Yankees signed Sabathia and Burnett for a combined $243.5 million.
Sabathia, who had lost his last three playoff decisions for Cleveland and Milwaukee, didn't disappoint. Wearing long sleeves on the blustery night, he got past a 22-pitch first inning and found a sharp slider. Sabathia allowed one earned run and eight hits in 6 2-3 innings, striking out eight and walking none.
He left with two on after 113 pitches, tipping his hat to a ballpark record crowd of 49,464 that included actress Kate Hudson and rapper Jay-Z. Phil Hughes came in and struck out Orlando Cabrera, one of the Twins' tiebreaker stars, in a 10-pitch at-bat.
Duensing, who was pitching for the U.S. in the Olympics last year, made just nine starts during his rookie season but was on the mound following the Twins' busy pennant race run. He gave up five runs and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings.
Sabathia escaped trouble in the first after Denard Span's leadoff double and the first of Jorge Posada's two passed balls by striking out AL batting champion Joe Mauer and retiring Cuddyer on a flyout.
Minnesota took a 2-0 lead in the third when Cabrera singled with two outs, Mauer doubled, Cuddyer hit an RBI single and Posada crossed up with Sabathia and allowed a run-scoring passed ball.
Jeter tied the score with a drive about 10 feet fair down the left-field line. With his 18th postseason home run, he tied Yankees stars Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson for third on the career list behind Manny Ramirez (28) and Bernie Williams (22), another former New York star.
Swisher doubled in the go-ahead run. Left fielder Delmon Young picked up the ball at the wall and made a one-hop throw to Cabrera, whose one-hop throw up was up the first-base line.
Rodriguez flied out ending the first, extending his playoff hitless streak with runners in scoring position to 19 at-bats, and struck out with a runner on in the third before coming through.
NOTES: Matsui has seven postseason homers. He hit 13 off left-handers during the regular season, tied for big league lead among left-handed batters. ... Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth, even though it wasn't a save situation. He struck out two.

Legendary fashion designer Donna Karan and mega mogul Sheila Johnson were honored last night in New York City at Parsons The New School for Design's annual Fashion Benefit. Johnson and Karan were feted “as women who have risen to the top of their chosen fields and have shaped contemporary culture,” Parsons executive dean Joel Towers told WWD. While we're well aware of designer Donna Karan's super status as a fashion icon -- she's been one of the world's top designers for over 25 years -- it may come as a surprise that Johnson is also revered for her contributions to the fashion industry. Sure, Johnson was one of the founding partners of BET, owns three professional sports teams (WNBA’s Washington Mystics, NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals), serves as CEO of Salamander Hotels, manages to produce films and happens to be a member of our AOL Huffington Post Media Group family -- serving as Strategic Advisor for Multicultural and African-American Initiatives -- but her heart also belongs to fashion. As the chair of the Parsons Board of Governors, Johnson dedicates significant time and resources to the school to support their mission of developing the next generation of fashion professionals and business leaders. And both Johnson and Karan deserve plenty of praise for their impassioned contributions, which is most readily felt through the presence of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center, the Donna Karan Professorship and the Stephan Weiss Design Strategies Dialogues program.
In addition, at the event Towers announced the establishment of the Donna Karan Fashion Design and Society Scholarship Fund, to provide financial support to students pursuing the MFA in Fashion Design and Society, and also the Sheila C. Johnson Design and Diversity Scholarship Fund, to provide financial support for tuition, housing, and living expenses to exceptionally talented, but under served students who may not otherwise have the opportunity to pursue higher education.
Simply amazing! Check out the slideshow below for a glimpse at the event, which was hosted by Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs -- the design duo behind Cushnie Et Ochs. And make sure to vote on who you think was best-dressed! Loading Slideshow

versions ORLANDO, Fla. — LeBron James had 36 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds, and Chris Bosh scored 22 points to help the Miami Heat slip past the Orlando Magic 112-110 in overtime Monday.
James scored eight points in overtime, including two free throws that clinched it with 1.5 seconds left. Dwayne Wade, who had 21 points, had a dunk with 6.2 seconds to go to give Miami a four-point lead.
Arron Afflalo scored 28 points for the Magic and J.J. Redick added 23, but he committed the turnover that led to Wade's decisive dunk. Nikola Vucevic had 20 points and set a team record with 29 rebounds as Orlando lost its sixth straight. The previous record was 28 rebounds by Shaquille O'Neal in 1993.
James scored on a driving layup with 1:07 left in the extra period to give Miami a 108-106 lead. He missed a shot from the top of the key, giving Orlando a chance to tie, but Shane Battier stole a cross-court pass from Redick and fed Wade for his late slam.
Josh McRoberts cut it to two with two seconds to play, but James sealed it at the line.
The first half was a series of momentum swing by both teams, with Miami breaking off a 10-0 run early and Orlando responding with a 12-0 burst in the second quarter. The Magic finished the half on a 21-8 run to take a 54-48 halftime lead.
The back-and-forth play continued in the second half. Miami scored the first seven points to go ahead 55-54 on an 18-foot jumper by James, but the Magic responded with a 13-2 run, punctuated by a 20-foot jumper from the corner by DeQuan Jones to go back in front 67-57. The Heat scored the last four points of the third quarter and the first nine of the fourth, eventually taking a 79-77 lead on a vicious slam by James with 9:38 left in regulation. Miami forced three turnovers and three missed shots in the 13-0 run.
Redick stopped the rally with back-to-back 3-pointers, which set up a mad dash for the finish line. A 3-pointer by James gave Miami a 91-89 lead, but the Magic went back in front on a three-point play by Afflalo that made it 94-91 with 2:45 left.
Orlando led 99-95 after Vucevic hit a 15-footer with 1:07 to go, but Bosh tied it with back-to-back baskets. The Heat forward had a chance to win it in regulation, but his runner from eight feet hit the side of the basket, sending the game into overtime.
James took on three separate defenders to start the overtime and scored on all three. He hit a runner over Josh McRoberts, a fallaway over Afflalo and was fouled by Vucevic, making both free throws to put Miami up 105-101.
The Magic fought back again, going ahead 106-105 on a driving layup by Redick. However, Orlando turned it over on its next three possessions, giving Miami the opportunity to regain control.
James and the Heat did, ending a two-game losing streak with solid execution at both ends of the floor in the final minute.
Notes: James has scored 20 or more points in all 29 of Miami's games this season. . Magic PG Jameer Nelson sat out his second straight game with a hip injury. The Magic are 1-8 when Nelson is out of the lineup. . Miami F Udonis Haslem returned after missing one game with a shoulder injury. Haslem had 2 points and 6 rebounds. . Dwayne Wade, a 78 percent free throw shooter, missed his first four attempts. Wade was just 3 of 10 from the line for the game.
