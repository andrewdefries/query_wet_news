Probably the only wedding photographer in NYC who came from the art world as an artist/illustrator, G.E. Masana's roster of wedding clients have included, among many others, Vanessa Penna (Beauty Editor, ELLE), Kelly Keskes (Model, BRIDAL GUIDE), Jen Chapin (daughter of legendary singer-songwriter Harry Chapin), Barrie Gillies (BRIDES magazine), Gaines Peyton (SEARS-PEYTON GALLERY, NYC), Evan Galbraith (son of E. Galbraith, Ambassador to France), Craig Kanarick (Founder, RAZORFISH), as well as assorted art directors, actors, opera singers, cinematographers, fashion designers, graphic artists and photographers.
He's been seen in BRIDES, BRIDAL GUIDE, TOWN & COUNTRY, NEW YORK MAGAZINE and STYLE ME PRETTY as well as other magazines and blogs too numerous to mention here, and served on "The List" of Contributing Photographers for MARTHA STEWART WEDDINGS.
He's been interviewed by the two leading international professional wedding photography journals, RANGEFINDER and STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHY. Recently he was awarded by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHERS for his wedding documentary photography. You can see more of his work at GEMASANA.COM	Show full bio
