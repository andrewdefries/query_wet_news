Map: England
Australia's Mitch Larkin qualified for the 200m backstroke semi-finals with the 10th fastest time in his heat.The 19-year-old from Queensland's Sunshine Coast qualified with a time of 1:57.53 after finishing third in his heat.Fellow Australian Matson Lawson failed to make the cut after finishing sixth (1:58.92) in the same heat.America's Tyler Clary qualified fastest at 1:56.24, 0.12 seconds faster than compatriot Ryan Lochte."I woke up this morning ready to race," Larkin said after his heat."There were definitely some errors this morning. My turns coming in, I was a stroke off."Last year at the worlds I didn't have the performance I would have liked, I've learnt a lot from that."For Lawson, despite failing in the heats, being at the Olympics has proven to be a joyride."The sense of adrenalin running through is an amazing thing," he said."It's still so surreal, I still can't believe I'm here representing my country. I had the drive to make the team since I was a young kid."In the 200m individual medley, Daniel Tranter qualified 13th-fastest for the semi-finals with a time of 1:59.70.Tranter only finished sixth in his heat, but it was in a strong field featuring Lochte, who was doubling up from his 200m backstroke finish.Lochte won the heat and qualified second-fastest overall.
