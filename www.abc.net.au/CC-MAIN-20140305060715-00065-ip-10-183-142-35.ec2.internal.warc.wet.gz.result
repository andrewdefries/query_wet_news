Sri Lankan situation: the truth must come out
137 Comments
Sunili Govinnage
Tonight, ABC's Four Corners will show Killing Fields, the UK Channel 4 documentary that claims to provide evidence of war crimes committed at the end of Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war.But yesterday, the Sri Lankan High Commission asked the ABC not to broadcast the documentary. The program was shown to the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva last month and has already aired in the UK. The Sri Lankan government claims the documentary contains manipulated videos and is biased. The Sri Lankan government is also claiming it now has the 'original' version of a video that it says has been doctored and sent to the documentary's producers by pro-Tamil groups.The conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the separatist Tamil Tigers, also known as the 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' (LTTE), left the country in tatters. It also gave the world suicide bombing - the LTTE pioneered the use of suicide belts and introduced female suicide bombers. The LTTE fought for an autonomous homeland in the island's north and reacted with violence against government policies seen to have privileged the dominant Sinhalese population to the detriment of Tamil Sri Lankans.There is no doubt that as part of their fight, the LTTE was responsible for killing thousands of both Sinhalese and Tamil civilians, kidnapping children and forcing them to become soldiers, and assassinating several public figures, including India's prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and Sri Lanka's president Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993. The fact that the LTTE, a known terrorist organisation committed atrocities cannot come as a surprise to anyone. But the most worrying part of this tragic story is evidence that appears to show that the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) was also committed crimes against humanity during the dramatic conclusion to the conflict in 2009. Killing Fields claims to have proof the SLA executed unarmed LTTE soldiers and knowingly shelled civilian safe areas.In March of this year, a UN panel released a report (UN Report) concluding there are 'credible allegations' that both the LTTE and the SLA were involved in the commission of war crimes. It's alleged that the LTTE used thousands of Tamil civilians as human shields during the final throes of the conflict, and that the SLA indiscriminately shelled no-fire zones, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to hospitals, a UN hub and Red Cross facilities. The Sri Lankan government, which had previously prevented the UN panel from actually visiting the country to conduct interviews and gather evidence (UN Report, p 6), urged the UN not to make the report public, but it was eventually released.In a nation notorious for its lack of press freedom the government went on a propaganda offensive, keeping journalists' and even the United Nations' eyes away from the end of the war. The old 'first casualty' adage really did ring true in Sri Lanka in 2009. The stories of what actually happened are only now trickling out, with Al Jazeera's People & Power program one of the first to make it into war-torn areas, with strict military supervision.One of the Sri Lankan government's consistent arguments against discussing what happened during the end of the war is that now the conflict is over, it is time to move on. The Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission was established in an attempt to let bygones be bygones. But the UN panel found that this body failed to 'satisfy key international standards' and has 'not conducted genuine truth-seeking about what happened in the final stages of the armed conflict' (UN report, p v; also 88-96). The thing with forgiving a wrong is that the wrong must first be acknowledged. Notably, South Africa's painful Apartheid history was addressed by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which even with its name highlighted the need to uncover the truth. That foundation was imperative for South Africans to 'come to terms with their past on a morally accepted basis and to advance the cause of reconciliation'.Talking about a civil war that arose from centuries of ethnic tension and tore a nation to shreds is no easy feat. Any such discussion will have to deal with the biases of language, the competing paradigms of thought about colonial legacies and the visceral feelings of nationalism that come from being on one 'side' and not the other. Because of this, trying to identify causes and tell any story about any conflict such as the one that devastated Sri Lanka will trigger passions, fears, resentments and accusations that may prevent the whole story from ever being understood. Despite these challenges, the truth must come out.Burying traumatic secrets will only foster the ongoing resentment and anger that still festers between Sri Lankans both on the island, and abroad. The pain of a Tamil diaspora which continues to view the LTTE as innocent martyrs will only serve to fuel Sinhalese nationalism, breeding a vicious cycle of hate that will put a pox on both their houses. The tragedy here is that both parties are to blame; both must acknowledge the pain before ever being able to forgive and let go.If the government of Sri Lanka and the SLA was indeed responsible for the atrocities alleged in Killing Fields and identified by the UN panel, those responsible must be brought to account. Fighting terrorism is one thing. But a civil government that intends to command the respect of the international community can never commit crimes against humanity in the name of winning that fight.Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions, which outlaws war crimes. It is not, however, a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court (ICC) in order to prosecute individuals for serious crimes against humanity. An ICC investigation to investigate and prosecute war crimes in Sri Lanka can only occur if the UN Security Council makes a reference to the ICC.As the propaganda war continues, the evidence must be carefully assessed according to international law. At this stage, it appears unlikely that the ICC will be in a position to look for the truth, and the Sri Lankan government is definitively denying any wrong doing. Given that the Geneva Statutes (and indeed all aspects of the UN) focus on protecting humanity, not sovereign pride, an investigation into allegations of atrocities is in the interests of everyone. Where the Sri Lankan government has nothing to hide, it surely has nothing to worry about. Or if it wants to take responsibility, it must let its people learn what happened and refuse to let comrades get away with murder.While escalating tension is inevitable, it is vital that the truth is brought to light. If the videos in Killing Fields have indeed been doctored, the truth must come out. However, the government of Sri Lanka's previous behaviour in keeping stories of the war quiet affects its credibility in relation to these allegations. We, as viewers, would of course hope that Channel 4 and the ABC are confident that the documentary will not further muddy the waters.But above all, it is important to remember that where stories have been spun to sanitise an inconvenient PR mess and keep those on their payroll from facing justice, courageous and diligent journalism can inspire the world to demand global justice.

Anyone who is pro-LTTE (will not call Tamil tigers as they do not represent innocent Tamil community) must realize that they are the people who killed the PM of India, President of Sri Lanka, much loved foreign minister of Sri Lanka Lakshman Kadirgamar (Tamil origin but married to a Sinhalese) etc. etc. They first started the war killing Duraiappa, the Mayor of Jaffna. Only 400k (14%) of Tamil community live in Jaffna, while the rest of three million live in other parts of Sri Lanka well in harmony with Sinhalese, Muslim and Burgher.

Do what I have just done & cancel your trip to Sri Lanka & don't visit the country until their truly horrific politicians & military are brought,if ever, to account! Vote with your feet & force our politicians to bring sanctions to bear. The Sri Lankan government's atrocities raise the spectre of those committed by Germany & Japan;furthermore,they completely disgrace the nobility of their majority religion,Buddhism!

Looks like the Drum has already consigned this issue to the dustbin. Had to search hard for this story now.The ABC Four Corners program detailing atrocities in Sri Lanka including where bullets were used to put down raped Tamil women attracts a lot less attention than the Four Corners program a month ago on the mistreatment of Australian cattle in Indonesia.And not a mention of the Sri Lankan issue in Parliament today.Pathetically illuminating of misguided Australian priorities based exclusively on self interest.Pity refugees from the Sri Lankan war.

Those of us living in Australia thought that the war in Sri Lanka was over, Sunili.It seems that many posters on this Blog think otherwise and, given the opportunity, seem more than willing to continue the hatred and the violence.This may be why Australians respectfully decline to engage in the issue.

As female watching the yesterday’s BC 4 Corners documentary, I felt sick to death, watching how the Tamil women were treated by those Sri Lankan soldiers. I believe it the worst form abuse I ever saw in my 36 years of living. Those perpetrators should be brought to justice in Sri Lanka or in the International criminal court. Until then for NO Sri Lankan tea, cricket match or Victoria's secret bra for me!

Now there is two versions of the videos shown by Channel 4 in UK and ABC. Soldiers in the video speak Sinhalese in the videos shown and in the other video now circulating soldiers speak fluent Tamil language. Sri Lankan soldiers do not speak Tamil as their mother tongue, but use it only to communicate with Tamil civilians. So what is the truth? LTTE is a well-known terrorist organisation with well-established international propaganda network. Millions of dollars pumped in to the war from all around the world and they ran used sophisticated media units all the time during 30 year as all their money income depended on the money sent from overseas units, and bias propaganda needed to be funnelled to those countries to get the sympathy for the organisation and spread hate towards the Sri Lankan government. This truth never be heard by the average person who lives in UK or Australia and watch those videos. Truth must come out. And the LTTE propaganda who still holds millions of dollars of blood money will do anything to prevent that from happening. Tamil diaspora and LTTE cells who still spreading hate towards Sri Lanka only digging their own nation's grave. Truth is like a rubber boll hold under the water by force, soon after the hand released… one day the truth will come out.

The videos are true. But it is the Tamil Tigers who killed and videoed them. Even the narrator of the documentary says that Tigers killed their own civilians to stop them from going to Govt areas – so thing about it:Who gains by killing innocent civilians? 1.	SL Govt who are actually defeating the Tiger carders in the battlefield or 2.	Tigers who have lost all leverage in the battlefield? (this was a time when 7 ships carrying their weaponry was destroyed by the SL Navy with the help of US satellite images )I’m begging the International community to look into the facts. (This is why US, UK, AUS govt are quiet on this issue – they know the truth) Tiger diaspora along with the LTTE ran a well organized arms and drug smuggling syndicate – they have now diversified into the human smuggling “market”. Aus govt should look into the Tamil diaspora in Aus and investigate and freeze their assets. (No doubt, a few people who are commenting on this page would get caught)

1. LTTE are terrorists (see reasons as to why they are banned in other countries)2. They and their Tamil diaspora are very well organized. Those who used to send money for the war are now spending it to media outlets to give fake reports.3. There are original videos of those shown last night, which show the SL soldiers talking in fluent tamil. (they dont speak Tamil - not that fluently anyway)CONCLUSION - LTTE terrorist supporters have doctored these videos to spread false allegation to gain international support. We know that Aus people genuinely are concerned, BUT please be aware that this is all done with Blood Money..Let the Sri Lankans reconcile...

There is no question that the LTTE committed unspeakable atrocities. However, they did not sign any international protocols. It is because of their inhuman conduct that they are termed terrorists!! It is no excuse for a 'civilised' government to act similarly. People seem to forget this. Does the SL government want to be judged by terrorist standards? It seems to be what their supporters want!!The SL government has taken up an untenable stand - that it was a 'humanitarian operation' when in fact it was a brutal war to destroy an enemy.That there were 'zero civilian casualties' - utterly stupid, in that in any war there will be some collateral damage.At the beginning of the 'seige' the Sl government stated that there were only '50 thousand civilians'. However at the end they triumphantly stated that they had 'liberated 300,000'!It has appointed a 'Lessons Learnt Commission' whose crediblility has been undermined, as the reports of previous such commissions have not been publish or acted upon. The Commission to investigate the murder of 17 aid workers; the commission to investigate the murder of 5 students; the All Party Commission to resolve the Tamil problem; the commission report on corrupt defence purchases - to name a few. Nobody takes the government's commissions seriously. A real investigation is required to ascertain the truth!

Although we should be thankful to the ABC for showing the documentary "Killing Fields", I am disappointed with the Australian reaction. Just a few weeks ago, there was an uproar around the country when the awful treatment of live stock exports were shown but yesterday's Four Corners showed the massacre of innocent civilians in a civil war and yet the response is muted.Sri Lanka is not just another country that Australia has little to do with. The Australian cricket team will be visiting SL to play against that nation's government-controlled team. The same government that a UN Experts Panel has accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of its own citizens during the last months of the civil war. At least in England, some in the cricket community are questioning the England's upcoming cricket tour of SL later this year, given the brutal nature of the current SL regime and its influence and control over SL cricket. Why the silence in Australia??And worse still, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President of SL responsible for the slaughter will be visiting Perth in November as part of the CHOGM summit. Where is the outrage??

Well done Richard, You have identified the nub of the problem for Australia. We are outraged over the killing of cattle that we send off for slaughter in Indonesia, yet mute in the face of apparent genocide committed by a Govt we consider our friend.In 2008/2009 Tamils were arriving in Australia by boat and our position was to send them back to safety in Sri Lanka. Australia stands condemned for either wilful ignorance or tacit complicity. All that is required for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing.

What we witnessed on "Killing Fields" last night were absolutely shocking atrocities committed by trigger-happy maniacs the SL Governemtn have the gall to call thier "military men". Our esteemed, dignified, past military leaders would be turning in their graves! Life was cheapened. Death was cheapened. Women and children suffered the ultimate indignity at the hands of military monsters! There should be nothing short of a full independent UN investigation into these abominable war crimes and the people responsible should be brought to justice! As far as I am concerned, the SL Government has desecrated the country's flag that we all once held dear. Shame, shame, shame!

One difference is that this is over. Definitively. Both sides in the conflict committed atrocities; most of the Tamil perpetrators are probably dead, so it remains for Sri Lanka itself to prosecute those of their own who went too far.

Rudd and Bishop have been so very quiet on the treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka that one wonders what the cause of such silence could be...let me think..oh yes...Tamils might actually be legitimate asylum seekers..and we can have a discussion around that issue can we?If the Libyan govt is going to be called to account for the treatment of its citizens then surely the Sri Lankan govt must be sighted on suspicion of committing Human Rights violations, war crimes and clear breaches of the Geneva Convention...Over to you Kevin Rudd and Julie Bishop....
