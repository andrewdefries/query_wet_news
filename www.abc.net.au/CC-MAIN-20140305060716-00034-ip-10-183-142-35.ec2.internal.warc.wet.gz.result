Who advised James Hird to take the course of denial he has taken?
In a misguided attempt to protect his brand, James Hird insists on denying his responsibility as senior coach for the doping scandal besetting his club, so bringing the whole game into disrepute, writes Wayne Goldsmith.Every club has a code of conduct (flexible).They all have rules of behaviour (bendable).And they all have mission statements, vision statements, team values, team trademarks and team policies (all negotiable).But there is one rule - one overriding law that every person in every AFL team knows and understands and cannot deny - that is unbreakable.No-one can do anything in an AFL football department that directly affects or involves the players without the full knowledge and approval of the senior coach.The senior coach in an AFL club has absolute power and total responsibility for all aspects of training and playing, and that includes the team's sports science and sports medicine program (e.g. player nutrition and supplement use).Anyone who has any connection with AFL - or for that matter, professional football - knows that the rule applies to everyone, every situation, every aspect of preparation and performance - and all the time.The fact that it has taken months for ASADA, the AFL and more legal minds than you'd find chasing a fleet of ambulances to come up with these decisions, sanctions and penalties is laughable.It is clear this Essendon exercise has nothing to do with "clean sport" or risk management or player welfare. It is all about brand protection. It's been drawn out because the stakes for so many - the players, the senior coach, the club and the game - are so high.Every sporting club and every professional athlete is justifiably protective of their "trademark" - their "brand" - the image that they "sell" to generate revenue.The trademark and the protection of the trademark is everything in the corporate world, and it is the same in sport.If you think about Sally Pearson, words like "professional, performance under pressure, superior athletic ability, composed" may come to mind. That's Sally's trademark.Now think about Lance Armstrong. What words and images come to mind - "cancer survivor, athlete and champion" or "cheat, liar and deceiver"?Professional sport is all about money and selling "trademarks", and no one - not sponsors, not fans, not the television networks, not advertisers - will throw money at a club or an athlete whose "trademark" is associated with alcohol abuse, violence, racial discrimination, bullying, sexual vilification, illegal gambling or, in this case, drug use.That's why James Hird, the Essendon Club and its officials have fought so hard for so long to diminish their responsibility for what happened.The Three Laws of Diminished Responsibility in SportThere are three laws in sport â€“ the Three Laws of Diminished Responsibility - which are as consistent and reliable as anything Newton ever wrote about gravity, movement or motion:Under no circumstances accept full responsibility for anything you say or doIf the weight of evidence against you is so strong that it is impossible to continue to deny full responsibility for your words and actions, refer to Law of Diminished Responsibility Number 1Do not do anything to contradict the first two lawsWhat kind of message does it send - to kids, to fans, to sponsors, to the public - that it is OK to deny any responsibility for your actions until you are faced with an avalanche of irrefutable and undeniable evidence?After months of denial, maybe we will finally see some humility and admission of partial responsibility from those concerned, but only - only - when they had no other choice but to fall on their swords - or more accurately in this case, their hypodermics.As for Hird himself, the question is - who advised him to take the course of denial he has taken?Imagine for a moment that back in February he came out and declared: "I pushed the limits and boundaries in an effort to help my players become successful. I took some risks - I made some mistakes and for that I am very sorry. I take full responsibility for what's happened and I willingly accept any penalties or sanctions."He would have got out of this with his reputation largely intact and may even have been admired for having the courage and the character to accept the full responsibilities of leadership. The club and the players could have moved on and enjoyed a successful 2013 season with little or no penalty. The game of AFL would have recovered quickly and the incident buried in a stack of good news stories and exciting on field contests. In this version of the story, everyone wins.Instead, by persisting with the diminished responsibility defence, the reputation of the club, the coaches, management, staff, players and the game is tarnished - perhaps permanently.Wayne Goldsmith is one of Australia's foremost thinkers on sport.

Couldn't agree more. My 20 year old made the comment some weeks ago "Why don't they admit they made mistakes, take their punishment and get on with it?" The whole affair has been handled appallingly - by all parties involved.

James Hird is a 'class act' in denial and damage control - as one the chief architects and engineers of the morally repugnant and reprehensible performance enhancing program at Essendon he should literally and rightfully have the 'book thrown at him' by the AFL - there are a whole generation of young and upcoming players that need to categorically see that this indefensible, opportunistic behaviour has no place in AFL or any sport for that matter.

The "morally repugnant and reprehensible performance enhancing program at Essendon"Which was entirely within the rules set by ASADA.What is the point of "throwing the rule book" at Mr Hird, all he will do is open it and point to the section which allowed him to do what he did.

What, John? "borderline and dubious drugs" don't constitute a scandal? They don't constitute bringing the game into disrepute? Are you serious or did I miss your sarcasm? Hird is a grub IMO, a cowardly, self important grub who should be made an example of. He's a pretty boy, he'll find something else to do.

"What, John? "borderline and dubious drugs" don't constitute a scandal?"No.The only scandal was that ASADA made intentional leaks and made eroneous allegations to the media about Mr Hird (which created the media storm) which they themselves found to be incorrect.Mr Hird has behaved and acted within the rules, can you say the same about ASADA?And exactly what example are you going to set? Something like "here is a man who keeped to the rules and was punished for it"?

Spoken like a true Essendon Denileist. I've read the charge sheet that was released to the public and if even half of it is true then Hird should never be allowed near an AFL ground using Borderline and Dubious drugs without any regard for player welfare is a disgusting and arrogant way of behaving. Essendon have left themselves wide open for a plethora of Lawsuits from the family. I guess though we don't have to worry about the Father-Son Rule from the current crop of Bombers as one of the side affects from the drugs was infertility!Part of the AFL document mentioned the use of Human Growth Hormone to treat a shoulder injury and the last time I heard Human Growth Hormone is a banned Substance.
Alert moderator
JoeBloggs:

It is however telling that ASADA has found that these compounds were not banned by ASADA and as such were allowed to be used according to the rules set by ASADA.Perhaps ASADA should have finished their investigation before shooting their mouths off to the media and making incorrect allegations about an innocent man.And before you make the same allegations that you did about JohnM, for the record I don't even follow AFL.

"Borderline and dubious drugs" and that's OK with you? Many of the players involved are very young, late teens and early twenties and Hird and his ilk abused their positions of power by subjecting these kids, who in reality don't have a lot of choice in the matter, with your "borderline and dubious" drugs. There appears to be no accurate records of what was taken and in what quantities or frequencies and no real understanding of whether or not they face the possibility of side effects and long term medical consequences, whether that be reduced fertility of higher risk of disease and most disturbingly, or remorse or contrition.The bottom line with Hird is that he is the Senior Coach. He was either fully aware and therefore 100% complicit in the program or he was supremely incompetent, blindly allowing his players to be subject to goodness knows what by people who's credentials and methodology had not been properly verified. Either way the buck stops with him and he needs to now show the good grace to accept responsibility and to show at least some contrition. I know if any of my sons were to play organized sport, Hird is the last person I would now want anywhere near them!!

JohnM,We don't agree about much but I agree with you on this one.ASADA found that Essendon did not break the rules set by ASADA.I do however wonder whether ASADA was allowed to leak incorrect information to the media before the investigation was complete and make wrongful and damaging allegations about Mr Hird. Does ASADA have a code of conduct to follow? The certainly have bought the AFL into disrepute by their actions.

Yes Wayne you may have some sound words (maybe not so much of advice) there. But your laws of Diminished Responsibility, once entered into, sound like a recursive loop that feeds on itself. So the question is, particularly for James Hird, once in there , how do you get out? With your reputation and name intact?
Alert moderator
Adelaide Rose:
27 Aug 2013 2:55:24pm
Hird cannot get out with his reputation intact any more. His best bet would be to accept responsibility for his errors, apologize, cop his punishment on the chin and move on. Instead he seems to be digging himself in deeper and deeper.

This whole Essendon, AFL, Australian Crime Commission, ASADA, WADA, thing about sports doping has become a non event has anyone been charged with a criminal offence "No" will anyone be "No" why because they all look after themselves it will be dealt with in house and life will go on. The Australian media were quick to can the Tour de France and international cycling as a sport but there has been no similar outrage with regard to our footballers or sportspersons could that be because its Australians at home this time. Just a lot of hot air that should be kept on the sports pages and not lead news items far more significant things happening in the would than a bunch of drug cheats.

Bringing the AFL into further disrepute is a more appropriate charge. Fair dinkum, the antics of football players has the game in permanent disrepute. Drugs, grog, bashings .... anything goes, whatever it takes with people in the AFL.

Parts of the AFL and NRL seem to have been conned into flirting with a mess of doubtful concepts, immoral, possibly illegal, brainlessly applied. They tried to seek advantage by cheating against the norms. It happens in nearly all pro sports, it seems, as the keen and naive hope to succeed at any cost or price. There are many Hirds out there, yet to be unmasked. What can be done, except severe punishments, in the hope of some deterrence? Little hope, for this nation was founded by a class of deterrence-unaware dregs, forced to cheat, lie, do crime and suffer the consequences. Whether genetics or environmental circumstances are to be investigated, nothing much has changed. Ball and chain??
