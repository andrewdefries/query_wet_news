The US dominated the pool yet again to move past China on the medal tally with 21 golds to 20. Hosts Great Britain also made a big move, taking three of the four track cycling golds to reach eight and sit fourth overall. Australia failed yet again to add to its single gold tally and has slumped to a lowly 19th, behind even New Zealand (12th), which now has three gold. Check out the full medal tally here.There's 25 gold medals to be decided on Day Eight. Among the highlights:Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake start their 100m campaigns while Oscar Pistorius makes history as the first amputee to feature at the OlympicsMichael Phelps looks for his 18th gold and 22nd Olympic medal in the men's 4x100m medley relayMaria Sharapova and Serena Williams clash in the women's singles finalRead our Day Eight preview.

TENNIS:8:00am: The mixed doubles quarter-final between Lleyton Hewitt/Samantha Stosur and Andy Murray/Laura Robson has been rescheduled for 9:00pm AEST.BEACH VOLLEYBALL:7:45am: In a shock on the sand, the reigning men's gold medallists, US pair Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser, have been knocked out of the competition by lowly-ranked Italian duo Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai 21-17, 21-19. The women's favourites, Brazilian pair Larissa Franca and Juliana Felisberta, thumped their way into the quarter-finals by beating the Dutch team of Madelein Meppelink and Sophie van Gestel 21-10, 21-17.ARCHERY:7:37am: One for the humour files. We informed you earlier about South Korean Oh Jin-hyek's gold medal in the individual archery with his defeat of Japan's Takaharu Furukawa. Apparently he's been saddled with the unflattering nickname of the "Soft Drink Pig" due to his fondness for fizzy drinks.TENNIS:7:18am: A usually unflappable Andy Murray says he's not been able to stop smiling since beating Novak Djokovic to make the men's singles gold medal play-off against Roger Federer:"I know how much winning tonight meant to me. It was one of the biggest matches of my career, one of the biggest wins of my career. It was one of the most emotional I've been after a match. I haven't stopped smiling since I came off the court. The atmosphere was unbelievable. We always said night matches at the US Open had the best atmosphere, but it's not even close to what it was today."
