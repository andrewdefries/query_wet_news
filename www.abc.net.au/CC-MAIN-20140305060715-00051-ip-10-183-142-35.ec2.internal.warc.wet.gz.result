Ramona Koval: Barry Lopez is a writer/activist. He thinks he has a duty to be socially active as an artist. For example, his work with Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a summit called Quest for Global Healing, an international gathering of dignitaries, activists, artists and writers talking about religious tension, global poverty, access to clean drinking water and other things. But Barry Lopez is best known as the author of Arctic Dreams, for which he received the National Book Award, and among his other non-fiction books are About This Life, his collection of essays of travel writing and memoir, and Of Wolves and Men, an early book about what he calls 'the fundamentally mysterious and complex nature of this maligned creature'.The winner of numerous awards and prizes, his also writes fiction and seems to always have a new essay around, but his new book, co-edited with his wife Debra Gwartney, in that book he's back in the country where he was born. It's called Home Ground: Language for an American Landscape.He's in Perth for the writers festival, and he joins us at a valiantly early time from the ABC studios there. Welcome to The Book Show Barry Lopez.Barry Lopez: Thank you Ramona. I'm going to tell my wife that I was valiant.Ramona Koval: Yes, you tell her that! This book is a kind of encyclopaedia for terms of geography in different American micro-landscapes, and it started for you with the words 'flat iron', 'cowbelly' and 'Detroit riprap'. Let's talk about what those words mean and why they led to this book.Barry Lopez: Well, if I can back up one more step, I'm an avid reader, as I know you are, and I would come across terms and not really be sure what they meant, they were popular terms or regional terms, and I've had that sensitivity I think all my life. In fact I just finished a novel by Tim Winton and noticed as I was going through that there were many casually used...you know, just part-of-a-sentence terms, and I wasn't sure what they meant but I knew most Australian readers would probably know right away what it meant.So in my own landscape in North America, Debra and I decided let's see if we can get together with people who really care about language, poets and writers, many of whom we knew, and put together a list of 800 or 900 terms like 'cowbelly' and give these terms to these very different kinds of writers and set up a board of academics and make sure we didn't stray too far from the centre, and have them write brief essays, nothing more than about 300 words, mostly shorter, about what that term meant.It wasn't an effort to make an encyclopaedia, it was as much as it was an effort to celebrate language and the relationship between language and places that people say they love. I could tell you what a 'cowbelly' is now that we've both used the word...Ramona Koval: Yes, please do, we're all on the edge of our seats now.
