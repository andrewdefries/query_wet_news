Doping to Win
Do "performance enhancing" drugs really work and what are the side effects? Dr Maryanne Demasi reveals all. TRANSCRIPT Comments
download segment mp4 (average size 10 MB)
CommentatorThere's 20 metres left to swim!CommentatorShe's over the last!CommentatorHe's digging as deep as he can!NARRATIONFor those who dedicate their lives to sporting excellence, there's no greater prize than winning. Seduced by fame and lucrative sports deals, many have been pressured into a dangerous drug culture.Marion JonesAnd so it is with a great amount of shame... ..that I stand before you and tell you that I have betrayed your trust.NARRATIONIn February this year, the Australian Crime Commission unleashed the biggest doping investigation in our sporting history.Jason ClareThe findings are shocking and they'll disgust Australian sports fans.NARRATIONThe ACC exposed systemic drug cheating among our Aussie athletes.Prof John RaskoIt's always going to be a war of escalation between the cheats and the people who want to detect them.Dr Jason MazanovoIf you get tougher, people will find other ways of getting these substances and ways of using them.NARRATIONSo, what are these drugs? What are they doing to our athletes? And are they causing more harm than good?Dr Maryanne DemasiThis time, peptides are in the headlines. Now, you've all heard of peptides, but what are they? Technically, it's just a generic term to describe a small protein. Now, these proteins occur naturally in food, in our bodies. But they can also be man-made as medical therapies. And it's these peptides that the drug cheats are exploiting to get that winning edge.NARRATIONIf your sport is about power and strength, then one of the most commonly abused peptides is human growth hormone. Athletes use it to bolster their weightlifting capacity and to gain muscle strength. But world-renowned hormone expert Professor Ken Ho says that's a big myth.Prof Ken HoGiving more growth hormone than what the body needs does not make you stronger or more powerful. We looked at the quality of muscle function, the ability to jump, the ability to pull a dead weight and the ability to maximise one's endurance.NARRATIONHuman growth hormone is actually a naturally occurring molecule released by the pituitary gland. It stimulates bone and tissue growth, particularly in children. Drug cheats inject a synthetic version of this peptide hormone, but more doesn't mean better.Dr Maryanne DemasiOur hormonal system is under exquisite control. We make hormones as we need them and switch off their production when we don't. So if an athlete supplements their system with more HGH than they need, they're putting their health at significant risk.NARRATIONExcess growth hormone can lead to complications like an enlarged heart muscle, which can be fatal. Aesthetically, muscles look bigger, but it doesn't mean the muscle is stronger.Prof Ken HoEven though the muscle is increased, most of that is accounted for by fluid retention. So, what you're looking at is muscle tissue having more water, rather than having more muscle fibre.NARRATIONFor decades, there hasn't been a reliable test to distinguish between natural and synthetic HGH in the athlete. But the net is closing in.Dr Maryanne DemasiIn the last few years, the World Anti-Doping Authority has launched a new sensitive test for HGH, but this has only seen the drug cheats get smarter.NARRATIONThe latest class of peptides to cause controversy work by stimulating the athlete's own natural release of growth hormone. These are illegal peptides, like CJC-1295, listed in the ACC report. It's been suggested that players use these peptides to help with soft tissue repair and shorten the time it takes to recover from injury.Prof Ken HoEven though there is a lot of interest and appeal with regards to the use of these peptides, I know of no scientific evidence that they bring performance benefit.NARRATIONProfessor Ho is more concerned about the safety of these peptides. He says theoretically they could accelerate the growth of cancer - an issue recently raised since the death of Cronulla player Jon Mannah, who was given peptides just two years after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Professor Ho fears many online products could be manufactured in backyards under substandard conditions.Prof Ken HoThere is no moral oversight to ensure the safety of these drugs. The standards of manufacture are not as strict as drugs or medications administered
