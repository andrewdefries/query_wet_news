Politics of growth needs a rethink
372 Comments
Satyajit Das
Economic growth has become the universal solution for all political and economic problems, writes Satyajit Das, but the ability to maintain high rates of economic growth is now questionable.The 2013 Australian federal budget assumes a continuation of strong economic growth. It assumes an 'aspirational' nominal GDP growth target of around 5 per cent over two years, despite complex headwinds.All brands of politics and economics are deeply rooted in the idea of robust economic growth, combined with the belief that governments and central bankers can exert substantial control over the economy to bring this about.Politicians and policy makers relentlessly pursue growth. In his 1929 novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald identified this fatal attraction: "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther."But in nature, growth is only a temporary phase which ceases with maturity. As academic Jay Forrester noted: "Past civilisations have grown into overshoot and decline. In every growth situation, growth runs its course, be it in seconds or centuries."Gimme growth…Economic growth has become the universal solution for all political and economic problems, from improving living standards, reducing poverty to now solving the problems of over indebted individuals, businesses and nations. In The Shadow of Keynes, Chicago economist Harry Johnson writing with his wife Elizabeth about England in the 1970s described this pre-occupation: "…faster economic growth is the panacea for all … economic and ... political problems ... faster growth can be easily achieved by a combination of inflationary demand-management policies and politically appealing fiscal gimmickry."Growth allows higher living standards. It generates higher tax revenues, helping balance increased demand for public services and the funds needed to finance these.Strong growth hides disparities in the distribution of wealth in many societies. Combined with the democratisation of credit allowing lower income groups to borrow and spend which ironically helps drive growth, it avoids having to deal with the problem of stagnant real incomes.The prospect of improvements in living standards, however remote, limits pressure for wealth redistribution. As Henry Wallich, a former governor of the US Federal Reserve, accurately diagnosed: "So long as there is growth there is hope, and that makes large income differential tolerable."But much of recent growth was based by policies encouraging debt-fuelled consumption, as well as unsustainable degradation of the environment and profligate use of natural resources. The ability to maintain high rates of economic growth is now questionable.Rainmakers who can't make it rain…Economists and policy makers (the alchemists attending the court of modern rulers) face a parallel crisis of credibility. Their power and influence derives from the well-crafted illusion that they can control the economy and markets with the application of applied mathematics and statistics.In 1965 President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers led by Walter Heller stated:"Tools of economic policy are becoming more refined, more effective, and increasingly freed from inhibitions imposed by traditions, misunderstanding, and doctrinaire polemics."The council declared that economic policymakers could now "foresee and shape future development."University of Chicago Professor Robert Lucas raised the bar on self-congratulation claiming in 2003 that macroeconomics had "solved, for all practical purposes" the problem of economic depression.More recently, US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke argued that improvements in monetary policy helped create the Great Moderation. In 2007, on the 10th anniversary of its independence, Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King spoke of a "sea change" in economic stability which he believed could not be dismissed "solely as a result of luck".But policy makers may not have the necessary tools to address deep-rooted problems in current models. Revitalised Keynesian economics may not be able to arrest long-term declines in growth as governments find themselves unable to finance themselves to maintain demand. It is not clear how if, at all, printing money or financial games can create real ongoing growth and wealth. Former German finance minister Peer Steinbruck questioned this approach: "When I ask about the origins of the crisis, economists I respect tell me it is the credit financed growth of recent years and decades. Isn't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again?"A Ptolemaic world…In 130 AD, Ptolemy developed an astronomical system that fitted the accepted view of philosophers and the church that the earth was at the centre of the universe and all stellar bodies moved with perfect uniform circular motion. Observing the heavens, Galileo found that the actual movements of heavenly objects did not actually fit Ptolemy's theories. Presented with the evidence, the ruling powers resisted the change to their world view, seeking to repress the truth. But eventually the system collapsed.Political economy increasingly resembles the Ptolemaic system. The possibility of reduced wealth, lower growth and constrained economic sovereignty do not feature prominently in the policy debate.Debates about the economy, assume the inevitable return to robust growth. Politicians everywhere repeatedly mouth the sacred mantra of economic policies that lays the foundation for long term growth. Even in Japan which about to enter its third successive decade of economic stagnation, the latest government recently outlined its growth strategy.The reason is not difficult to discern. Writing about the US in The American Future, historian Simon Schama observed that no-one ever won an election by telling the electorate that it had come to the end of its "providential allotment of inexhaustible plenty". Like Fitzgerald's tragic hero Gatsby, the incredulous battle cry of politicians and policy makers everywhere is: "Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!"But the inability to acknowledge and manage the potential economic stagnation increases the chance of social conflict and political breakdown. Writing in The War of the World: History's Age of Hatred, Niall Ferguson identified the risk:Economic volatility matters because it tends to exacerbate social conflict….periods of economic crisis create incentives for politically dominant groups to pass the burdens of adjustment on to others… social dislocation may also follow periods of rapid growth, since the benefits of growth are very seldom evenly distributed….it may be precisely the minority of winners in an upswing who are targeted for retribution in a subsequent downswing.Governments need to rethink their role and adjust policies to an environment of low growth with attendant problems of employment, labour relations, industrial policy, social welfare and stability. Relations between nations -both economic and political- need to be reshaped to cope with increasing competition for growth, markets and scarce resources.Earlier versions of this article were published at the Independent, marketwatch.com, minyanville.com and economonitor.com.Satyajit Das is a former banker and the author of Traders Guns & Money and Extreme Money.

Economic growth - its just a religion. It has a priestley class with their own set of liturgies and incantations.Economic Growth is a hard god that can never be appeased despite the sacrifices its worshippers make. It also keeps them constantly afraid so that they never stop sacrificing their lives and efforts to this insatiable god of their own construction.

Money is created via credit by the creation of debt. Borrow from a bank, and money is not transferred to your account from existing currency held at the bank. It is created into existence by the loan. The money created is balanced out by the debt created. As the loan is paid back to the bank, the repayments don't go into bank coffers but cancel out the original debt owed to the bank in a spreadsheet.The interest paid on loans is the fatal flaw in our modern currency systems. Say there is $200,000 generated in interest in the loan above. While the original capital is created and then cancelled out, an extra $200,000 must be found somewhere. The only place this interest money can be found is from circulating money generated by a different loan. This, of course, means that even the capital of the second loan cannot be paid back, as there is now a shortfall of money in circulation. The second loan amount - plus its interest - can only be repaid via money generated from yet further loans, and so on.The world is now obliged to repay banks more money than the banks ever create in the first place. That's why economies must grow at 2 – 6 % per year or they disintegrate. Economic growth is not for the benefit of people as is commonly believed. Economic growth is solely to create enough currency to keep the faulty global economy treading water so it doesn't collapse.This is also why the global economy grows at about 4%, while global debt grows at about 10%. Note that the gap between economic growth and debt is getting increasingly wider every year. Politicians proudly report strong national economic growth statistics, perpetuating the illusion that this implies some kind of bonus for the average person, yet they systematically ignore ballooning debt as though it is inconsequential. At the current growth ratios of economies to debt, by 2020 the annual global increase of debt will be larger than the gross global income. This is simple mathematics. Clearly the global economy will collapse long before this ridiculous scenario arrives. Unless fundamental changes are made to the present economic system, in less than ten years the global economy will destroy itself. No amount of productivity, foreign trade, gold mining, hard work or anything else can change that fact. We have until 2020.In the pre 20th century economy, increased productivity created more money in circulation. In our present economy, money in circulation controls productivity. If money supply is scarce, then commerce seizes up. Borrowing ever larger amounts of money is now the only way to keep the economy running. However, this short-term economic fix only creates a larger currency shortage down the track, because of the problem created by interest. Fundamental changes need to be made to align the money system with reality. Time is quickly running out. Each passing year sees increased destruction of the

Another good read, thanks Satyajit. I think one of the problems with this growth issue is the blurring between economic growth and population growth. Although we know they are intimately entwined with each other they need to be disentangled into the two separate issues they really are. People seem to be convinced that you can’t have economic growth without population growth or that they are one and the same thing. This blurring, this conflation is sold to us and maintained by a few in order to serve those few and inveigle the many. It doesn’t take an Einstein to work out that if there is x amount of resources to share, I am better off if there is less people to share them with. If I build myself a three bedroom family home and then have three kids, then four, then five, am I not going to be more economically stressed with each new mouth to feed?Come on all you young budding economists out there, take this more people equals less pie rationale and extrapolate into some sound sane economic advice for our governments – they obviously need the education.

Great book from 1867, it's called Das Kapital written by this little known fellow called Karl Marx, might learn a thing or two from it. I actually find it hilarious that some economists who are finally starting to open their eyes are making observations about the limits of the system that Marx explained in full and in outrageous detail almost 150 years ago.I've also found it hilarious that economists and Capitalists alike say that Marx doesn't take into account human nature, when Marx and Engels pretty much founded the entire field of Socio-Economics while modern Capitalist "Subjective Theory of Value" pretty much ignores everything that doesn't fit into their models.Until people stop thinking of Marx as a dirty word because of the State Capitalist ideology adopted by the USSR under Stalin and Khrushchev and exported around the world in the 20th century while crushing any alternative Socialist systems (I raise my glass to you Catalonia) and we keep using stupidly bias measures like GDP (Socialist countries will always have low GDP because of the non-materialistic nature of them)then we will keep getting worse and worse crisis until the system is broken for good, which many can see, is coming very very fast.

Hi Satyajit DasSadly you were or are still a banker?You know what the general public think of bankers?Based on your opening quote below I'd like to suggest that most governments around the world are trying to address global warming - yes! this is a result of industrial expansion - yes! new industries will evolve from this initiative? - hence new growth as well as the decline of carbon industries as we know it will result - but growth will result from innovation - innovation will occur with Gonski reforms - the social fabric of society here in Australia will be reinforced by the NDIS and slowly slowly mining will be reformed for the common good - when a strong government emerges - it will."Economic growth has become the universal solution for all political and economic problems, writes Satyajit Das, but the ability to maintain high rates of economic growth is now questionable."

Our leaders know the limits of growth, peak oil, overpopulation, peak resources, water scarcity, etc, so why won't anyone in power do anything about the real issues. A transition needs to be made from our current system to a new system of sustainability.Some people were making comments that why should we even try to do something, humans are doomed anyway. Well when the collapse of global civilization happens, it won't mean the end of humanity at all, just the majority of humans will perish (and the ones who choose not to do anything will be the ones who perish). In a few billion years the sun will die and with it the earth but that's a long way off. Transistion can be achieved and is already happening in many communities around the world. Permaculture & polyculture are ways to produce food without fossil fuels. The biggest issue to tackle is population, degrowth is the way forward. The collapse of global civilization is going to happen, can you live independant of the system...?

Hi Satyajit DasI feel that your closing paragraph was a summary that summed it up quite literally - civil unrest could well result from our lack of social awareness - yet here in Oz we are actually a micro global situation of your topic and our political lack lustre is taking us to the very situation you describe - thank you for a thoughtful challenge? "Governments need to rethink their role and adjust policies to an environment of low growth with attendant problems of employment, labour relations, industrial policy, social welfare and stability. Relations between nations -both economic and political- need to be reshaped to cope with increasing competition for growth, markets and scarce resources."

For no reason based in evidence that is clear to me, almost everyone seems to accept as a given that economics and politics are fundamental to the recipe for human happiness.The range of goodies we have now is possible because of developments in Man's technological abilities. Politics and Economics have conspired, after the fact and for their own purposes, to make the quantum of their supply enormous. But are these things that we have so much of things that we need. Do we create the stuff of happiness or do we create the (I contend very different) mixture and weight of stuffs that serve politics and economics?Given that we have asked so much of our environment and have directed so much of our efforts and our life-potentials to the making of such stuffs, how is it that we have achieved so very little on a scale of global Happiness? If so much has done so little, why are we fixated still on ever more?Politics and Economics are thoughts, systems of thoughts, that proceed from quite simple fundamental ideas. Their fundamental ideas - of the genus 'selfishness' - are all anti-social. Their products, ultimately and today, are anti-societies in which 'winners' mispend the product they have managed to connive from the many times more 'losers'.Happiness, and good society do not lie that way. They lie in much better ideas, like generosity, regard, respect and responsibility. We consume way more than enough to make everybody very reasonably happy. But we use it to ends of unhappiness, and anti sociability instead. Such awful ways of living demand incredible levels of sacrifice, of the general environment and of the potential for wonderfulness forgone by 7000 million people.

The whole point of this article is not that it is an absolute given, it can't be. ie. If tomorrow an announcement is made that the fusion of hydrogen problem has been cracked, then whoopee, break out the champers. We'll all enjoy a few decades of explosive, virtually free energy fueled growth before we are back where we started. No, we just have a probability to consider. If it turns out that Das is correct we have a big problem. If our society can't withstand a full stall in growth and crashes, the outcome would result in a dieback of population which will affect everyone.Working out the odds of that happening is the individual's problem. Just don't expect sympathy if you ignore the possibility.

The great analogy I have come to embrace is that, whilst we should be structuring ourselves as a closed-loop ecosystem, we actually model ourselves on bacteria, viruses or fungi: they exponentially take over the Petri dish until the space constraints, waste toxicity or depletion of input resources stops further growth - or, in a natural host, the host is killed.Why can't we learn to be wise parasites and not kill our host?

An artcile that starts to demythologise current economic theory. At its best econmics as now practiced may be a social science. but at it s worst it is a religion, that takes into account a number of beliefs without testing them in anyway. Current economic dogma does not question the impact of damage to the environment or use of finite resources as externalities, or even enter these into its equations. It hides the value judgements involved as terms in complex equations. It promotes the cart driving the horse. It is not a matter of going back to Keynes or even a modification of Keynes. It is a matter of defining the outomes required and developing a system of payment and reward that produces this outcome. This may or may not be a market system. If it is a market system, it will need to take into account the tendency of markets to become corrupt, the tendency of markets to pool interests in order to shift benfits toward one group at the expense of another. This si no a matter of politics either, what is required may be individualist or socialistic,but not because of an unjustified belief system, but justified by the outomes produced. Current economic analysts show a disturbing similarity to evangelical preachers rather than propery trained academics.

I want to talk about gardening...Since I started to become more proficient in keeping my plants alive, I noticed a few universal truths.(1). Plants that grow big and old usually are slow growers. (2). Growth will slow down invariably.(3). All plants will eventually die.(4). Regular pruning will encourage new growths.(5). Death of an old tree will allow new trees to thrive.(6). Lots of water and fertilizer will promote rapid growths. However, as soon as it encounters some adverse conditions like drought, or lack of fertilizer, it will crumble because it has not "hardened" up.I believe our world economy works in a very similar fashion. We have enjoyed much good times. Finances are quite easily available, and cheap goods are available at many times less than what we had to paid some 30 years ago.Then we falsely believe finance, rather than manufacturing, rules the world.

Mindless economic "growth" didn't remove the problem of global or local poverty and inequality in the best times ever enjoyed by humans; not having done so prior to peak oil, peak water, peak minerals, climate change, and peak food, it certainly won’t now. In its Intergenerational Report of 2010, Treasury suggested a population of 37 million by 2050 with GDP growth to fall from the 3.3% of the last forty years to 2.7% average for the next forty, plus productivity increasing from an average of 1.4% over the last ten years to 1.6% pa for the next forty. A minimum of 30 million seems certain, even with much reduced immigration. The Global Footprint Network calculates that we plunder the usable output of around 1.5 times the available land to support current consumption, which means we’re looting irreplaceable environment capital. While the Earth has 2.1 hectares of productive land per head to support the 7 billion people currently living on it, Australia's lifestyle requires 6.6 - so if everyone lived like us, more than three worlds would be needed. Vested interests in growth at any cost ensures only denial of the damage to our quality of life plus the environment plus our resource security by the very rapid growth of population that is predicted by Treasury and demanded by business and the politicians they own. We need to minimise waste. Society in fact has the resources for a lasting but much more frugal lifestyle, especially by completely rearranging and redesigning goods, services, and the way we use them every bit as much as minimising greenhouse gas emissions. Designing consumer goods to allow easy repair or renovation is the best way to extend the life of a product.A much more socialist society is essential, for both efficiency and fairness. Obviously wealth would need to be redistributed, and both our consumerism and the huge profit-seeking industries that push consumerism would have to be reined in, so that people and the future are put before profits.

It is my understanding that for each cent's drop, the farm sector will gain an extra $250 millions.So now you are whinging about the low dollars and its effects on importers.

An article that is a small island of common sense in a sea of dross. Thanks for the article. What I dont get is how do so many people get put in charge of stuff who have absolutely no idea of simple logistics. There is no infinite anything. Instead, lets just keep getting bigger and bigger and everything will take care of itself and there is no other plan. That is why I liked the reference to them being "the alchemists attending the court of modern rulers". Anyhow, if the forming depression doesnt force change (re private debt spending that is exhuasted in western economies with reducing middle class jobs/wages)then the crunch industrialised food production will receive when peak oil hits will. I am sure that will have an impact on population growth. I am sure it cant be that easy to plug in and recharge an electric combine harvester?

Given the importance of food it will not be a huge ordeal to develop an electrically powered combine harvester. But harvesting will be a problem nonetheless.Peak oil is real and the increase in the cost of fuel is already threatening harvests. Crops must be sown, fertilised and harvested and all takes fuel. Often fuel is also expended on pre and post sowing herbicides and at the end of the day for many farmers its just not worth planting any more (just ask WA wheat farmers).Peak oil will crunch us with climate change throwing its own spanner into our food production machine. Heat waves, floods, fires and outbreaks of unheralded pestilence are all, already taking their toll on our ability to feed ourselves. When the food supply system breaks (and it won't be more than 10 years away) we will see some mightily confused people out there. Those who believe that peak oil is a green conspiracy as is global warming are going to be both angry and hungry. There is a cresting wave about to smash down on us all and ignoring it won't help us deal with it. Will our 'leaders' ever acknowledge it? Not while our media remained focus on trivialities and refuse to inform about the real crisis that threaten to overwhelm us all.

They don't espouse growth it but they DO accept their own very generous super entitlements etc which are BASED on growth continuing.Similarly, when they rabbit on about fairness or helping out the poor and so on, the implication is that money will at least HOLD it's value, so that more money will equate to more "affluence"; that an extra 10% in payments will bring an extra 10% in real stuff. This means that production will at least match the "face value" of the currencyLikewise ending poverty in the Third World, and such aspirations, work on the understanding that a billion bucks in aid will buy a certain amount of something; that the billion bucks will NOT buy half of that certain something when it's turned into goods + services.The really important thing to consider is that the Big Green.....Bob Brown... is a very wealthy fellow who knows very well that his accumulated wealth is "wisely invested for growth".

Economics is a social science & not an exact science. John Maynard Keynes was not only a great economist, he was a keen observer of human behaviour as seen in the following quote:“The difficulty lies not in developing new ideas as escaping from old ones”Keynes was by nature adaptable to change, certainly no fool and would be adapting to today’s reality if he were here now. Politics of growth does need a rethink in terms of a move to renewable services, renewable energy and a holistic optimisation of resource use (economic, social and environmental), but if you are a political party you need to be in power to enable you to instigate changes. The two major political parties, Labor and the Coalition are now poles apart on policy development.....we find ourselves with a watershed federal election on 14 September 2013; where the promotion of security and new versus old ideas ( maintenance or otherwise of the status quo) will become central to the election.The big difference between Labor and the Coalition is that Labor is prepared to initiate change where necessary and make the hard policy decisions, copping flack in the polls and even from their own supporters, while the Coalition sit back lacking conviction and in populist mode, finding fault and at the last minute when they feel they may have an advantage cherry pick and claim it as their own ...eg. the 12.5 per cent GST opposed by the unions, big business and the Coalition back in the 1980’s and subsequently reintroduced at 10 per cent with some refinements in the 1990’s....they are doing it now with the May 2013-2014 federal budget. The Coalition are fair weather sailors and not visionaries!...they sell-off viable income generating government assets that in the main they never supported and call waste , like Medibank Private the market leader with a AAA international credit borrowing rating, whilst claiming a budget emergency...not the governments but their own generated $100billion budget black hole they would have to address if they are the government after 14 September, 2013.Labor have to finish the job on productive infrastructure spending...there is no point in having spent more on communication and transport infrastructure than all previous governments combined if the voters have apparently turned off politics. Multi-billionaires Gina Rinehart, Rupert Murdoch & Clive Palmer are all honing in on WA, NT & QLD as part of the Coalition’s northern Australia plan. If Gina Reinhart is following the playbook of her late father Lang Hancock then the voter inspiring privately funded $45billion “Project Iron Boomerang” becomes front and centre in future revenue creation.

Mr Das has done a very poor job of explaining what economic "growth" is. And a great many here have no idea whatsoever. 99% are fixated on manufacturing, whilst this part of the economy becomes ever less important.Example; it used to be that a great number of women stayed at home to look after the kids..and contributed "nothing" to GDP. Now most of them work...and there are millions of kids in child care etc. Many of the women now working actually do so IN the child care centres.OK. So the women at work......many in office/clerical/admin jobs, are adding to GDP, whilst the child care centres are ALSO adding to GDP. The guy who mows the lawn or who washes/walks the dog; the people who prepare all the take aways; the people who work in tourism/hospitality....all of these paid by the women now-working who weren't doing so in the 1960s, are adding to GDP growth.

Bean counter,I take your point about adding extra services does not deplete resources. However, it worries me that mums who care for their kids at home add nothing to the GDP but when they do exactly the same thing in a kindergarden they add to the GDP. We then say that we have GDP growth and a higher standard of living, even though that same person now has to spend time traveling and has to pay for those travel costs and is doing exactly the same work but is now under the control of a boss. Is this really a worth while improvement? Some of the other improvements you mention are of a similar vain. If working hours were shorter individuals would have the time to mow their own lawns and enjoy walking their own dogs.

This is the argument that economic growth is not the same as resource use, and that it's possible to have economic growth that is effectively uncoupled from growth in the use of physical resources. That's a comforting idea with a grain of truth (if you pick the right examples to quote) but it doesn't hold up in practice. While all those dog walkers are adding their bit to GDP, the mining and agricultural giants are using energy and materials on a massive scale, where "growth" definitely refers to physical resources. If you read Herman Daly's work he convincingly debunks this idea - see also Prof Tim Jackson's report "Prosperity without growth". It would be a great concept if it were true.

We get economists by the thousand handing out advice on the markets, each with a thousand differing views as to how the market should perform. Then when the inevitable bust comes these same thousands of economists all have differing views as to why the market failed. Markets generally fail because of the greed factor, which fuels the market to unsustainable lengths and heights, which in turn is caused by lack of regulatory mechanism to inhibit the greed factor. The people who suffer the most from a down turn or collapse of the market are those who are least able to cope with the rigors imposed on them, and are also benefit the least from a strong greedy market. We were fed a line not so many years back that we would have a rosy future in front of us. Where we would all be working a reduced working week and have time on our hands all to come via globalisation in trade, it never happened. The opposite is the case people are working longer hours, working all sorts of night and odd hour shifts, more married women are out working than ever to sustain the household budget, and if families want to get off base one and own a house, it is inevitable that they both husband and wife go out to work. The talk now is even with both working the pundits are saying that young couples will never afford to either build or buy a house as the years go on The clamour from The Coalition and business groups is to further encroach in to the living standards of working people with their demand to work longer hours without penalty provisions. The Coalition are not willing to support the Gonski report as they say the country can't afford to educate the children in the working class areas, yet at the same time to support the rich and subsidise their health care, their private schools, their superannuation and then offer rich women $3000.00 a week for six months to have a baby. If that is not welfare for the rich then what is? At the same time we have Hockey telling us the age of entitlement is over.

Grumpy, government revenue as a % of GDP is now nearly 3% lower than Costello's last year as treasurer (22% compared with 25%), while expenditure is now down to 24.5% after reaching 26% just after the GFC, and an average of about 24.5% under Costello. It is a complete distortion to say that this government is a big spending government. It certainly did spend up big to stimulate the economy after the GFC (thank goodness!). But expenditures are now down to the average of the Costello years in terms of % of GDP. The big difference is that Costello spent money on middle class welfare and sacrificed revenue to reduce taxes. On the other hand, Swan is spending money on national infrastructure and is having to cope with massive revenue cuts (in % of GDP) caused directly or indirectly by the GFC.Your last sentence is so ridiculous that even you should feel embarrassed to read it!

What a refreshing article. I've never studied economics apart from some business based accrural accounting methodology, and just couldn't get my head around the smoke and mirrors aspects of that. Kind of akin to the way I view "politically appealing fiscal gimmickry" and I'm for to sinical about that. If you are right in saying "tools of financial managementare becoming more refined" it really does beg questions about what the Australian Treasury is using when forward estimates and budget figures are so far from reality and not so readily available outside budget night. The fact that the treasurer was forcasting a 1.5 Billion surplus twelve months ago, the Prime Minister stould by that six months ago the revised it to a 11 Billion (I think) deficit one month ago only to conceed a 20 Billion deficeit (or so) on budget night is mind boggleing. As one political reporter asked, who in treasury has been sacked? or could it be that the treasury lot so poorly educated Gonski really does have a point? I think we all realise LABOR's simplistic stimulous approach for growth (based on policies encouraging debt-fuelled consumption) has really wrecked the economy in such a short period. That in my book is just incompetency and how the treasurer gained accolade's on the world stage for responsible fiscal management speaks volumes about the rest of the worlds dire situation (engineered by politicians of course). As a final point about "growth in Japan being stagnant", I'm thinking it is more about Japan's competators rapidly catching up more than anything else. Post WW-2, Japan had hugh investment and became a market winner by producing quality goods at a cheaper price. Remember the first Japanes cars in the Australian market, hardly quality goods but the price was right, Gradually the quality improved and they became a world leader in manufacturing. Then there was Tiawan, and Korea etc, and now we are seeing cheap and lower quality Chinese and Malaysian manufactured cars in the market that will improve in time. Japan peaked and is now in the doldrums until some other inovative way ahead is found. I was always intrigued by the quality regime and perhaps Governments should be adapting the method there of introducing inovative changes (Gonski, NBN, etc, etc, ) using the Kaison modelling (small improvements giving time to bed changes in) with funding models to suit. But then the election cycle would suit that at all especially since treasuries funding models and Government fiscal management are so obviously flawed.

I've heard it said that negative or no growth economies are unstable. Not many it seems like to point out that positive growth is also unstable.It would appear to me that positive growth tends to outsource the burden of instability to other 'less quantifiable' systems ie. society and the environment (which tend to underpin the aforementioned economy).It's little more than an accounting trick to placate the shareholders. A game of smoke and mirrors with very real outcomes.PS. Is it possible to have a growth by focusing on improvement rather than just making more of lesser quality?

I found your article interesting but limited.

The US national debt is "only" $16 trill. Can you imagine the potential damage such vast sums can be and probably are causing while sloshing around the planet...ducking in and out, "Soros like", different economies and financial stuctures...in their own, arguably unethical and manipulative self interest? If you can't...well I certainly can! Nor do you or nial ever consider the enormous economic damage still being inflicted on countless millions by the supposedly "civilising" former colonialist powers.How do either of you suggest suggest we tackle those issues...if you feel growth is no longer an option?...which I seriously doubt...especially if done in a low key or moderate manner. For example there's heaps of infrastructure that can built in a safe non polluting and non inflating way I'm sure. Also I'm hoping Obama soon puts a price on carbon ...that in itself should require massive "safe" reallocation of resources requiring huge numbers of individuals being employed... earning a life saving income...if only?

Cheap energy allows economic growth, get the price of oil back down to $60 and economies will grow, so we just have to reduce the demand for oil and increase the supply.Cheap oil allowed us to modernize agriculture, this allowed us to maintain a high population growth rate over the course of the last century, without a similar breakthrough technology (and ignoring other constraints) economic growth is restricted to population growth.

Oil is getting very close to a cost of $60 per barrel, and will undoubtedly go below that in the very near future, so we don't need to reduce demand. In the USA, shale oil is now being produced at very attractive rates. These are significant cost structures for several deposits:Permian Delaware $78 Permian Cline $65Bakken Sanish Three Fork	$64Wilcox	$63Permian Midland Vertical	$62Eagle Ford	$61Permian Wolfcamp	$61Utica	$58Niobara	$55Mid-Bakken	$54Woodbine	$48Mississippian Lime	$43Those prices are for extraction, pipeline/truck transfer, refining and storage in US$ per barrel. Cost of delivery to customers is additional but not quantified.Costs will also drop when extraction reaches full production and economies of scale come into play.Costs are based on existing State and Federal royalties and production taxes.Source: Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global ResearchIn addition, gas in the USA is in such glut proportions that it is being practically given away.

I don't doubt we've got some massive problems coming our way.I don't agree with the blind optimists and their historicism. They look to the past and discern historical rules. Humans will always innovate, they say. Populations have grown, technology has improved, material living standards have improved, therefore they will continue to improve, they say. There's a big Turkey Problem lurking behind that logic.But the capacity of humans to innovate and create does give me hope. My son in particular has a gift for innovation and creation that heartens me greatly. Bear with me I am coming to a point. Its interesting how the education bureaucracy deals with his talent. They identify it and then try to beat it out of him. They shunt him into gifted program and try to standardize and commodify him. Bizarrely they complain about his behavior problems, then give us elitist literature from some Gifted Parents Association about indulging those behaviors.The point I'm driving at is that Das is wrong. Bureaucracies (government and corporate) are likely to push us over the edge. Don't let them plan for anything. Don't let them standardize anything. Their role is broad strokes (like the carbon tax, make us pay for it and we'll find a way to reduce it)Its individuals and small groups that will tinker, innovate and adapt. Bureaucrats and planners will stultify adaptation.

So we end up with myriad single issue groups all making demands which cannot be met to the satisfaction of individuals. Working counter to this paralysis is the propaganda machine which hides the truth so that only certain spin is touted and perception prevails over reality. Otherwise government, big or small, cannot cope with the demands. This the state we have in this country, where we are being manipulated by the power mongers. Take the 'fiscal crisis', for example.

I'm guessing this because it sounds as if you're still at the stage where you expect the school's behaviour to make sense. Which it does, of course, but only if you know their actual (as opposed to presented) objectives. The Department has a lot of pamphlets, web pages, policies, and programs, and the staff have to comply with the "letter of the law" (Departmental decrees). Presumably distributing literature is part of some program. However in general this will be disconnected from the realities of your child's day-to-day school life if he regularly requires any extra effort during class.Think middle manager.

Satyajit,Not all brands of politics are deeply rooted in robust economic growth! I think Bob Brown and those of his ilk would take issue with you on that, even though they presumably like where you're heading with this article.In some ways (and despite our smart phones and brain surgery) aren't we a bit like bacteria in a petri dish? We seem to have made a habit of repeatedly eating ourselves out of house and home. Or is it wrong to compare our modern selves to the less enlightened (said somewhat tongue in cheek) preceding generations? There are some signs that as a group we are getting smarter, developing a higher average level of self awareness etc. On the other hand, the same sorts of people seem to be running large parts of the show now as then. The ones who profited the most from unsustainable growth, pooh poohed the naysayers etc.Until we reach some post-scarcity society, which presumably looks like Denmark crossed with the "5th Element", aren't we stuck with the innate desire for a better life and more options? Won't any reduction in growth mean widespread disillusionment and the secondary economic effects that has? Or is all that the sign of immaturity? Is that innate desire compatible with reduced economic growth? Are there ways to achieve a constant improvement in living standards etc that don't require numbers to slowly tick upwards? Would the mere suggestion of that send the Murdochs and Abbotts of this world to search under their beds for reds? I've read that the middle class in Brazil have higher self-reported levels of happiness than us, despite much lower PPP income and distressingly low per capita jet ski numbers.

That's actually dead wrong. It didn't pass the smell test so I did some homework. Some developed countries are declining in population, that's true. Also true is that some others would be declining, were it not for immigration. Based on 10 seconds on google and about 1 minute of counting and mental arithmetic, that's 28 countries totalling 665 Million people. So in countries representing less that 10 per cent of the world's population, population decline is occurring. Slightly. As in, between about 0.4% in the biggest countries, Japan, Russia, South Africa, up to 4% in the little countries in the Pacific. Overall though, the world population is climbing faster than any other time in history. It was about 4 billion in the 70s, it's now blown through 7 billion, less than 40 years later!

The fundamental interdependent dynamics of progress for Humankind are cooperation and competition. Both are the ingredients of our success as a species to date.We are at our best when cooperation dominates; and at our worst when the dominant factor is competition. One is unifying, the other factionalises and isolates, at least psychologically. The strive for balance seems elusive.Underpinned by the current malaise of pure self interest that permeates our societies, its small wonder when we have a system when competition is the fundamental that is hugely dominant that we now have all these looming issues confronting us.As for all these dire predictions, I recollect many made decades ago by very eloquent, knowledgeable people that grabbed a lot of media and societal genuflection at the time. Very few came true. The author reflects this in relation to economists and policy makers, but a broader brush across the professions can be applied with equal relevance.Climate change is one of those that did come true. It's because of the failure of many of those old predictions to materialize that those few with substance are now tarred with the same brush, and 'experts' are no longer trusted. Hence the huge cynicism, dubiousness and dismissiveness we see against the current round of dire warnings - some of which may be true, many will not. The 'experts' themselves have none other to blame but themselves for this outcome. Simply 'Peter & the wolf'.So, in all this its hard to see anything but "we're here for a good time, not a long time" as the prevailing human condition. Change will be reactive imposed by external factors, not so much by anything we do as a result of prediction - its in our DNA - literally. It's our capacity to successfully adjust to imposed changes, whether of our own making or not, that will see whether we are successful or not as a species or civilization. At the moment the world is switched off to predictions and warnings, preferring to watch ants whilst elephants run by.The only thing certain about the future is that it will be uncertain and unlikely to be what we think it will; and given that extinction, not survival, is the dominant in nature, the decisions really are about how much we delay or enhance that final inevitable outcome. Not looking too good just now. I doubt we can bear to be separated from our toys in order to adequately ponder. C'est la vie!

Authoritative predictions about tobacco, DDT, asbestos, acid rain, CFC and Ozone depletion, and unfortunately global warming and many more have all come true, even though they were misreported in the media.

You are an ALP supporter, so I suspect you approve of the NBN.The $100 Billion being spent will "pay for itself" with GDP growth..says Labor. How do you see the GDP growth from first building the NBN...then using the NBN...to be "unsustainable"?Are you stuck in the 1950s when "growth" meant "manufacturing" maybe? Not giving any thought to services, value adding, intangibles etc, at all?

So when is a budget deficiet too much, from my reading of the Union/Labor party 19.4 billion is OK so why not 30 billion. As soon as the states run a deficiet due to the Labor Union party demanding they throw money into all of their ideas they lose their rating. Yet 19.4 billion is fine. Sorry I am not an economic major.GONSKI is no certain thing 16 billion so there is better communication between the parents and the teachers, 16 Billion to impose a national curriculum which is a stage of socialism. 16 Billion to teach those who have problems at school the price for Multi Cultralism. In Perth a Head Mistriss reduced Suspensions from her school significantly by banning Mobile phones and other Electronic devices, pretty cheap solution. In the USA and other countries have dropped NAPLAN has it has created the opposite effect.

This is the IMMORAL dimension.Second. A default on public debt destroys the whole economy in one swoop. This is because a default shakes the whole $300 BILLION in one shot, whereas private defaults are really "small beer" in comparison.Most private debt is being paid down even as we blog. Private debt levels have been declining in Australia for at least five years. However...the far more dangerous public debt has exploded. The far more IMMORAL debt has skyrocketed. In all respects public debt is the greater problem.Get it?

Interesting a number of comments that refer to Austerity and yet bemoan growth as a bad thing. Firstly there is very limited austerity in Europe. The high unemployment rates come from lack of growth and the lack of balanced spending by govts in the lead up to the GFC. They squandered their money on social services and public (and regulated) employment. This continues but there is limited private investment to pay for it. They say no one knew the GFC was coming. Bollocks. Everyone knew but just didn't want the party to end. You can't make money from money forever. Of course the same is happening now. Central banks giving huge sums of free money to the financial sector who because noone wants it places it in equities and all the other stuff that led to the GFC. In Australia we have our own version, which is superannuation. Possibly Australia's biggest growing industry which would hardly exist without 2 things - a tithe on employers and sizeable tax breaks. The other thing is economic growth elsewhere is basically irrelevant. Australian economic growth is relevant. Keep in in mind we have a population of 23M in a world market of 7.5B. The opportunities are endless given the right leadership.

Great article Satyajit! I would love a classical economist to explain to me how the human species can keep growing forever on a finite planet without breaking the laws of physics, particularly the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Perhaps the chief economics editor over at The Australian might like to give it a go. Until we break the back of the Murdoch controlled mainstream media, the question of limits to growth will never be debated in the print media, only in online sites. As David Suzuki said, " economics is a form of brain damage". Perfectly said! Believing in endless growth on a finite planet is a form of mental illness, a collective delusional myopia. If we don't stop growing, then nature will stop us with the simple laws of population ecology. We're in overshoot now- we're using up the natural capital of the earth as if we're living on both the capital & interest of a bank account. Later this century we're going to come back down to earth with a thud when our population crashes and modern industrial society grind to a halt as we come up against the energetic limits to growth. It's time to transition to a steady-state economy with a stable population while we still can.

Quoll, I agree it is not possible to have infinite population growth on a finite planet. However you are confusing this with economic growth, which is not related to physics nor the 2nd Law of thermodynamics. Rather it is more closely correlated with the cost of energy production and individual human productivity, both of which are not finite, but governed by innovation and technological advancement.We are currently transitioning slowly to a stable population by raising the global population from poverty. Steady state economics works against that process, and so is actually the process opposed to physics that you bemoan.

The major thing that correlates with economic growth is debt. It's the main way in which new money is brought into the economy.Costs of energy may have a little influence, only in so much as expensive energy may prohibit people's access to credit.The "human productivity" belief, is of itself meaningless. If someone wants to pay you a hunfred bucks an hour for breathing, you are then considered highly productive.However, the industrialised concept of "human productivity" relates to producing more "widgets" her hour, which is merely a dictate of those seeking to increase their own profit from your enslavement.

Some good points. Thanks.I am always a little confused about economic growth. While it is obvious that we cannot continue to use ever increasing amounts of finite resources and population cannot continue to grow indefinitely, economic growth seems somehow different, as it is based on money, which is an abstract concept. Maybe the problem is that we have come to think of money as being a real and tangible entity.The Greeks and Romans used slaves to drive their economies, the middle ages used serfs and since the industrial revolution we have used machines. There seems to be no reason why the use of machines cannot keep expanding and improving our living standards as long as the use of resources are sustainable. In this sense I believe that GDP is not a good measure of living standards. I, also, suspect that garbage tips have greater concentrations of most mineral resources than the rocks they are currently being extracted from. That is, we could use machines to recycle (which we already do to some extent). However, globalisation, with the resultant increased power of international corporations I do find frightening. They are not democratic in that they only exist to serve their own interests and no-one else's.

Mr Das has really muddied the waters.In Australia, economic growth is mainly service-related, which means that the economy grows without NECESSARILY depleting resources at an ever-increasing rate.When the average Aussie talks about "rising living standards" it's on;y partly about having more stuff. A lot of it is in utilizing services, or consuming value-added items.

When I studied economics, the idea was that the markets would always provide, nothing would ever or could ever run out. If a commodity became scare the price would go up and this would encourage producers to produce more and consumers to consume less and the hence the system would balance. Or magically technology would produce a substitute. And of course economic growth would ensure everybody was better off.Of course this view of economics does not factor in all the costs, for example climate change. Hence we now have forests, which are carbon sinks being cut down to increase farm land to grow cattle. The net effect is to increase the rate of climate change. This is but one example.Of course Satyajit Das is correct, the real question is how do we move to a sustainable economic system and quickly. Alert moderator

New innovation is driven by $$ and the desire for growth and rewards is the key motivation. Perhaps the socialist mantra cuts ok in academia but may dampen young innovators looking to kick butt in commerce. Much growth to be achieved by developing new technologies that solve our global problems as far as more and higher quality food, better air and water and even work out how to burn more coal effectively. We could have the cheapest power on the planet. Glad I dont play sport with this give up attitude. Doesn't matter if we lose all the time, its too hard to win.

Firstly, scarcity can be created by taxation or prohibition. Indeed, regulation of economies has become the default. We need economic growth to employ our children because even if we had a stable population it is the nature of competition to maximise profits by producing more with less.If we depend on markets for change, there is an inherent delay as punters second guess each other about where prices will go, which causes the saw-tooth graph up or down that we are accustomed to. All of this you doubtless also learned when you studied economics.Thing is, major changes in infrastructure, such as a rapid shift away from heavy atmospheric carbon emissions require more than normal market forces to attract the huge capital involved. The thing about big shifts is that, unless competition is suppressed, power and wealth is likely to change hands. The unsurprising thing about the rich and powerful is that they resist this change by whatever means are available. We don't like to talk about it, but politics is also driven by unsurprising rules about how humans behave as a herd. The system is built on assumptions that we all have agency and act in our own interests based on the clarity we derive from the media. The underlying problem of politics as a way of setting strategy to solve big problems is that individuals in the human herd are confident about their opinions in an inverse proportion to their mastery of facts. In short, the dumber we are the more certain we tend to be.Rants - like the one I'm having here, are not how humanity plans best. We need to squabble less and find a way of making democracy more effective.

I reckon humans have still got about 200 years of growth and advancing civilisation (in terms, at least, of increasing sophistication of science and technology) before the final decline begins. A civilisation like ours will never rise again; it was built and fed on millions of years of stored solar energy that simply cannot be replaced. And without growth it dies. It takes a society of about 100 million to provide all the infrastructure and resource and manufacturing complexity needed to build one silicon chip from scratch and such a society is impossible without fossil fuels. The last gasp will come when all the available methane and coal on the planet has been exhaused. Woe betide the peoples of those days.

200 years? a bit optimistic I'd say. If we weren't running headlong into a food crisis then you might be right. Sadly I'd say we're at, or extremely near, the peak of our sophistication right now. The last decade is one where we've been running to keep still as we've drawn down the global larder and with farming land lost to desertification at the same rate as we clear ever more marginal land to farm on.And we've done next to nothing about the exponential rise of population or the exponential rise of greenhouse gases. Something's gotta give - and I'd suggest that the first crack is the loss of the summer arctic ice cap, widely expected this decade. Civilisations always seem to forget that they don't work unless there's a surplus of food. Northern agriculture will not survive the chaotic rearrangement of the seasons that started after the first Great Melt of 2007 and will continue until we learn to refreeze the arctic.

If the Chinese method of industrialising and modernising is used in other countries the worlds coal supplies may not last very long.One of the main uses of oil in China has been as an energy multiplier where oil energy is used to extract, transport and consume coal for the purpose of using it as its main energy source. Four billion tonnes of coal were consumed in 2012 which corresponds to about 80% of China's energy source when classified by fuel type. And it is worth noting that China now consumers about 25% more energy than the US and this figure is growing rapidly.

In fact, there has been a significant change. Man's capacity for mass destruction, which has developed in advance of his behaviour. When the globally expanding militarism of the U.S./NATO/Israel/Partnership member alliance results in the almost inevitable situation of direct conflict with another nuclear armed military bloc, this capacity for mass destruction will be realised. Many do not understand that all that is required is the 'perception' of an imminent pre-emptive (overwhelming conventional and/or nuclear) first strike that would necessitate a decisive counter pre-emptive response. Unfortunately only when this situation occurs (and it almost certainly eventually will), shall all understand (and indeed experience) the horror of war. Only time will reveal who is correct.

This essay from Mr Das is I hope the start of a number of essays from him and others. It is a refreshing change.You see it is essentially about a topic that too many pollies and economists skirt around because it is in the too hard basket. It is all about population growth and the rusted on adherence to economic values that have no relevance anymore. The main value that we labor under is of course the no limit to growth philosophy - there are limits but we choose to ignore them.Political "isms" do not come into it; whoever is in power will do anything to stay in power and this is at the expense of (for example) the environment whereby it is still used and abused. The environment is a finite system and to allow the continual pillage of forests eg Tarkine, the ruination of farming land eg Hunter region and the allowing of coal mines to sell CO2 generating coal to the Northern hemisphere is typical of the "expansionist model" (already stated elsewhere) which ensures growth regardless of social and environmental cost.So what happens now with an ever increasing and demanding population within an increasingly finite world.We only have one world and it looks as though the economists and oxygen thieves (pollies) are going to ruin it for us.

Maybe we would be happier in a world in which our achievement and success is not measured by what we have, but by who we are....our attitudes to others and what we give. We may also be happier if we learnt to appreciate the world of which we are part, for what it is and can give us....does destroying the other animals and life-forms on the planet really engender happiness and contentment? What about the fact that we are changing the climate to such an extent that the environment in which our children live may be much diminished and bordering on uninhabitable in many places.....does this give us a feeling of satisfaction and well-being?

I'm really interested in this idea of prolonging future generations on a philosophical level. Why? At some stage humanity must face its extinction. Why is it better to do that in a thousand years time and not 50? If we do want to prolong future generations I'd suggest technological innovation is the only way. Its a big, bad universe out there. Lots of nasties that could wipe us out at a moments notice.Living in tree houses won't save us in the long run.Also what constitutes 'quality of life'? Who are you to answer that question for future generations?What if their answer is Brioni suits and Bolinger?

Subtle and clever as usual, Hudson. A major flaw in growth as a measure of welfare is some perverse quality v quantity outcomes.

Not sure if it is possible for Australia to achieve %5 GDP growth in a major drought.The current drought is only just beginning and it seems the worst start to a drought I've seen. Even the drought of the 1960s found farmers better prepared than now. Having to cull stock at the beginning of a drought is very bad indeed.Gun control was great for people but with farmers stopping feral control the feral animal plague is about to impact on the country at the same time the drought decimates the farming industry.Politicians don't seem to realise the consequences of decisions or take variables into consideration. Farm support has entered a black hole just when most needed.We would do well to remember that we are not an economy but a society and that needs are more important than wants.

I agree with gun control. We certainly haven't had a massacre and the drive by shooting in Sydney is limited by the type of guns used.What I am implying is that as a broadacre farmer at the time gun control came in most farmers decided it was just too hard to continue feral control.We decided to leave it up to the government and the professional shooters with appropriate high powered weapons. Time is showing they did not take the task seriously.Most farmers these days have a .22 and a shotgun and not much else.I imagine the cull of cattle going on now includes the use of professionals.I do know that the dingo fence is failing in the North and becoming a huge problem.Perhaps as Craig suggests we don't need farmers or water but I think he will find agriculture is a bigger proportion of our economy than he thinks.Do you really think mining does not use water because I don't but then again I lived next door to a gold mine once.Pity it contaminated my land though.

Another excellent and thought provoking article Satyajit.

We can still have "growth" but at a much more moderate, balanced and sustainable level.There is actually enough monetary and natural resources around to enble us to transition to moderate levels of growth- free from the debt driven consumption of the past decades and free from the damn influence of economic rationalist who we allowed to stuff up OUR world. Surely it is not beyond us humans to design a system where as the Pope said "Money should serve the people and not rule them- not to create the heartless dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking in any truly humane goal" Surely the rapid advances in technology can be harnessed to make it possible- after all is that not what computers were supposed to do,give us more time for family, friends,community, reflection and the good life?In this country we are ineed lucky- we can almost tell the rest of the world to get lost and still prosper but we do not need to go that far.All we have to do is use our natural and human resources to enable that transition as fairly and as less traumatic a spossible.That would mean our people having the guts,foresight and intelligence to stand up to the vested interests. It would mean us telling both the ALP and the LNP to get it!!But alas- I think our ME ME thing is now so ingrained in us- we have been so brainwashed- that we will continue to 'pursue happiness" with greed,over consumption, ego centricity,self interest and stuff only to find that porsuit is delusional.

It is amusing to watch many posters trotting out rote-learned anti-growth banalities while at the same time bagging rational economics. The very first thing you would need to achieve for a no-growth economy is zero debt, which means zero deficits, which means austerity and all that boring don't-spend-money-on-feelgood-frolics stuff. Growth slowly but surely pays off debt. If you want zero growth, pay down debts and don't spend any money you haven't already made.

I am simply pointing out a logical inconsistency in the argument of people who want zero growth for environmental or other good-sounding reasons, but who despise the fiscal discipline that would be needed to achieve it.Governments don't have big money sitting around in the bank. To fund stuff (good stuff or bad) Governments borrow, and pay interest in real money. Borrowing a lot is fine, on one of two conditions. Either it's spent on something that pays interest and capital in real dollar terms (i.e it's profitable in the way a capitalist uses that word) OR it drives enough overall growth in the economy that after 30 years it doesn't look like such a lot anymore (e.g. a social program that successfully lifts people out of poverty). The latter is why Europe is desperate to kick-start economic growth again - to make their unpayable debts diminish over time - through growth. My argument is not that funding all these important programs is bad or wrong - far from it- or that we must screw down spending to magically create growth. My argument is IF you want low or zero growth economy (as a few people seem to want) we would have to be even more disciplined about justifying expenditure and even more (not less) dependent on boring right-wing things like business cases and credit ratings. And yes DTM, a sovereign government can default on debts, just the same as it can nationalise its industries and so on. There are some (drastic) cases where default can dig a country back out of a hole. But given Australian's poor record over 200 years to finance our own development from re-investment of savings, and hence our dependence on foreign capital I really wouldn't recommend it. Our currency would collapse, and the only thing making any money would be those foreign-owned farms and mines everyone freaks out about.Be careful what you wish for.

Money was created to facilitate more efficient trading of services and goods. Fiat currency is now a representation of debt that is no longer a representation of anything of intrinsic value such as a physical commodity like gold. This is the basis of fractional-reserve banking whereby banks literally create money as part of a debt contract, put simply, an IOU. But interest is not a necessary component and is in fact an unsustainable Ponzi-like debt structure (requiring perpetual growth to cover the interest component, which is not possible in our biosphere). There is a significant difference between the planned development of society and an exploitive/adversarial system of long term debt bondage to ever more profit seeking financial institutions dependent on a structure of unsustainable Ponzi-like (expanding debt based) growth.Furthermore, the level of sovereign debt (and associated interest payments) of many countries that has been created is unserviceable. No amount of positive thinking (market optimism) is going to change this situation and bailouts are inadequate to meet increasing debt obligations. Austerity measures will further contract economic activity. Our current economic model (of public/ private debt to private financial institutions that are dependent on perpetual growth) has short term benefits for some but long term consequences for all.But you are entitled to your views for as I previously stated (refer AC comments on 'Can innovation drive sustainable growth?', Satyajit Das, 1 May 2013), this issue will soon be rendered mute.

There are a lot of options being put forward by economists, options which could better manage the fallout from the GFC, aging populations, global warming. We have great economic thinkers at the University of Western Sydney, and Newcastle University, to mention just two. But what they propose would require that the people who own and run things give something back, so the only time you will ever see their ideas is in academic blogs and research papers, and blogs which promote ideas and debate. You won't see any discussions on Channel 7 or 9, except for who's the biggest bitch in the Kitchen, and who's the fattest laziest slob in the House etc. There is no debate of ideas in most of the mainstream media so no-one knows that there are actually alternatives to the rubbish decisions that are being made in the developed world. All that money that is being printed is for one reason only, to prop up the prices of the assets owned by the richest 400 companies and individuals in the world. Like the prices of gold, copper, silver, lead, coal, real estate, oil, shares and bonds.No money is going to help mortgagees in the US, the printed money is going to banks to assist with the foreclosures. What about Europe ? All the printing presses are sending the money straight to the banks. The ordinary people are losing health care, jobs, you name it.

The Black Plague persisted for hundreds of years right across Europe and was far from solved by the Great Fire... some people argue that it lead to the eventual rise of the middle class as it created a shortage of labour, leading to improved conditions for the peasants as their value increased and they transitioned from being a type of serf. Nuclear power has led to a period of relative peace - there has been no 'total war' since a few days after the bombs went off and, aside from the bomb, our understanding of nuclear physics has led to a tremendous number of goods not least various medical treatments.And in case you didn't notice, Hitler only lasted for a few years and the lessons learnt from his madness resonate deeply in the world's psyche... thanks to modern communications technology such as film and television the lessons learnt from Hitler are being passed on to future generations in a way that was not possible when the Mongols destroyed the ancient Islamic world (possibly a much worse atrocity) or the Spanish destroyed Central and South America.Hitler, by the way, may well have agreed with the tone of this article given he wanted to return the Aryan race to some mythical past where they all lived in harmony with the world in some kind of pure, ideal stasis under the benevolent and perpetual watch of his 1000 year long Third Reich... madness lies not very far down the path that is signposted 'Nirvana'.

Until the mid 18th century the world plodded along at essentially the same economic level, even taking into account the apparent advantages of the Roman era. Then the beginnings of modern Capitalism emerged. Under those changes, we have seen an explosion in wealth and prosperity for the world that has been unprecedented. Today, ordinary people take for granted luxury unimaginable to the wealthiest and most powerful of even just 100 or so years ago. In addition, wherever capitalism has become established, as prosperity has increased, so the birth rate has declined, to below replacement levels. The only threat to all this has been the ideology of socialism, seen in modern Europe, for example, as social democracy and ever increasing levels of welfarism. Socialism also led to the greatest horrors of the 20th century - the Bolsheviks in Russia, the National Socialists in Germany, the Communists in China - with a death toll of over 100 million. It still remains the greatest threat to future prosperity. Ditch Keynesianism, return to market forces, and you will see growth and prosperity return.

The modern economic system predates the industrial revolution by hundreds of years. Italian whizz kids had perfected double entry book keeping and promisary notes long before the 18th century. They might not have invented them but they definitely took them to a new level. A level to which we can all be eternally grateful. Or resentful. The 18th century explosion was more technological than economic. Even the technological advances from James Watt onwards barely trickled down to advantage Jack-Average for the best part of two centuries. Another three in Eastern Europe and still not to every continent of today. You could make the same kind of argument that world prosperity has increased since the writings of Karl Marx, or that western wealth and standards of living coincide with universal suffrage. They may well do, but there's no cause and effect. Capitalism as an economic system didn't increase living standards (traditional hunter gatherers have high standards of living than 19th British industrial workers). Had the Ming dynasty introduced the Enclosure Acts, the seed drill, the steam pump and the spinning jenny they'd have lapped us all, under any economic system known to the planet.

A very very important issue, which the denialists naturally deny.Globally, the Great Recession ended the good times. Not only have six years elapsed without any significant adjustment, but also Europe, the U.S. and Japan are all expected to stagnate for the rest of the decade. To save their loot, the moneybags want polarised, brutalised and plundered societies, "austerity" being one of many tools to that end. Firstly, economic growth as a practicable end is itself coming to an end, permanently. The world's resources are finite. Secondly, people seem unaware - much encouraged by the media's own bias and ignorance - that the Great Recession was entirely predictable. Thirdly, post-industrialism has not been matched by an understanding that the important issue is not to create wealth - ample has been created - but to distribute it much less unfairly. But as the contradictions of austerity are showing, such a position is of course a threat to the moneybags, national and transnational. Fourthly, life in a complex advanced society requires complex advanced structures and increasing redistribution. Otherwise, we have the Star Wars society of technological super-sophistication coexisting with the decline and poverty that Austerity societies in particular are suffering. Thus Abbott's fear-mongering of Debt and Deficit. In contrast, Labor under Whitlam sewered Australia and Labor and Rudd and Gillard have greatly increased infrastructure investment. Fifthly, it is an elementary mistake to conflate "economic growth" with "social development". We lead an amazingly confused lifestyle that promotes waste, environmental destruction, exploitation, and the perversion of social values. In fact, we should adjust to a 24-hour working week and of necessity a fairer sharing of society's wealth. Finally, there seems great reluctance to recognise that any answer to the financial crisis that we all now clearly face will have to be a collectivist answer. Any reaction not giving a central role to government, socialism, and government business enterprises will fail, not merely because they are usually more efficient, but because the profit-seekers loot and waste everything they get. That's the whole idea.

Yes growth is the magic we all seek. It is the profit in all business. In the past 20 years ordinary people have been encouraged to join the share market - in order to inflate it (more demand equals higher prices). However comes a time when the market is saturated - everybody who can invest, has. Thats when the prices stabilise, which breeds fear and people leave the market. Prices fall because negative demand means falling prices.Super was a good trick that gave extra life to the sharemarket. The coming super increase will give it another lift - but in the end it will fall and those who will lose are those who are last out - superannuation will collapse.

DTM, guys like you are the most frustrating. It seems to me from your posts that you have sufficient resources at your disposal. "We all have everything, so why do we need more". What? And (earlier) "my son has two science degrees". Can you understand why some may be offended at your suggestion of not pursuing growth? You already have yours, so no growth from now would not impact you or your family. What would it mean for those who don't have everything they need? Or people who after completing one degree (if they could afford that much) have to get a job because their parents cannot support them? Have you ever considered what your standard of living would be like today if the well-heeled back in, say, 1900, shut the door on growth? Per capita economic growth can occur almost infinitely if population growth is slowed or reversed. It is only nominal growth that has some limitations. And, theoretically at least, those limitations to nominal growth should lead to a natural control on population. This is why Australia, as long as we maintain a strong defence strategy, should be well placed relative to other countries as we have plenty of the limited natural eresources for our relatively small population.

Taxation is also at the heart of paying the true price of consumption, profit and growth. Recently, Bernie Brookes, CEO Myer, claimed an increase in the Medicare Levy would starve retailers of sales. All is quiet in the media, Business Council, Chambers of Commerce and Industry and even Bernie on the weekend release of the Liberal plan to broaden and increase the GST. News Ltd is concerned the working suburbs do not like the Swan budget but will they like an increased GST on health, education and food? Will this increase benefit the people who paid it through improved health services? No, the proposal is to pay it over to the business community to lessen their load. The Mining and Carbon taxes will go under Tony Abbott and then, to add insult to injury, the people of Australia will pay some of their other taxes. Gina was right about the ATM analogy but she, and others like her, are the ones with the PIN.By all means review Australia’s taxation system including an increase to the GST and the removal of inefficient business taxes such payroll tax. However, this does not mean a boost to those who pay little tax at present at the expense of working people, aged pensioners and those on benefits. Corporate Australia, in particular the banks and mining companies, can well afford to maintain their current taxation levels and contribute further to our country.

I have nothing against capitalism as such. The quality of life we enjoy at present is, in part, a consequence of it. I do however think that the premise of continual economic growth is flawed. At some point, we need to ask what it is we are seeking in life? I'd wager that, for most, the answer would include a satisfying job that provides sufficient wages to enable them to buy a house, raise a family, maintain a good work/life balanace and live comfortably in retirement. At present, this is made possible through a market based economy which is reliant upon continual growth. If continual growth is not possible (which in the long term it isn't), then we need to look for a model that sustains a level of economic activity that is sufficient to provide the population with the quality of life they want but is also sustainable into the future. This will, to my way of thinking, inevitably lead to an economy that has greater levels of government control. Governments will effectively need to act as a breaking mechanism to prevent economic activity exceeding sustainable levels. The change would require a paradigm shift in government thinking. It would need to be thought through carefully and implemented consistently over an extended period of time.

The Liberal party only ever has one economic strategy, and it is used in every situation, boom, bust or stable.

Labor has not delivered a surplus,despite Abbott's barracking. However the mortgage belts did not collapse due to lack of business confidence causing massive job losses.

In Australia Public debt is less than 12 % of GDP, in many Western countries it is near 90%.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) allow us to set clear targets and monitor progress. On a journey, knowing one's goal and milestones is essential. KPIs, though have two major shortcomings. Firstly, they simplify a complex reality, and we ignore what is left out at our peril. Secondly, those with power learn to game the system.Economic growth as the principal KPI is far too simplistic. We should be adopting a balanced scorecard/triple bottom line approach to measure progress.we live in a global society. What happens halfway across the world affects us. The mining boom is due to global events. Our refugee problem is due to global events. Our NBN is to connect us to the rest of the world (so we can download US movies quickly :( ).

A truly "stable" economy would approach something like the Feudal System, a fairly politically, socially, and economically stable period in which very little ever changed, and a person was born a farmer, lived a farmer, raised his sons to be farmers, and died a farmer - all within the narrow confines of his village.I am not sure there is such a thing as economic stability concurrently coupled with social and political progress.I am also curious that you did not define what you mean by "economic growth". In some sense, the economy is always productive - it is the creation of new goods and the provision of services - which does not necessarily entail the wanton destruction of natural assets.I was also dismayed by your claim that Ptolemy developed his cosmological model to fit the attitudes of the church - something any history student would identify as false. When Ptolemy was writing in the middle of the second century, Christianity was a minor and politically insignificant sect, under periodic persecution. Why any philosopher who certainly was not a philosopher, living in Egypt, would develop a theory to suit a tiny, unwelcome sect coming out of Judea, is a bit of a mystery.I would suggest a bit of research prior to making historical claims - even for illustrative purposes. After reading this incorrect historical statement, I took the rest of the article much less seriously.

Child allowances, libraries, sports fields, education subsidies and unlimited access to health are all examples of expenditure. Yet somehow this has to be paid for.

The central issue of economic growth is: How are we going to achieve it? We cannot continue to base growth on:a) Increased population size.b) Environmentally unsustainable industrial production.c) Sources of energy that are limited and polluting.Is there a path to growth that can overcome (a), (b) and (c)? Yes, I think there is:a') Stabilise the world population but provide ever greater majorities with the ability to purchase goods and services. First step to achieve this: Get rid of the neoliberal ideology.b') Change the modes of production by focusing on better technologies based on less polluting mechanisms of production: Growth will be sustained by a neverending quest to access the new technologies that will be produced through less polluting means. There is no need here to deny the second law of thermodynamics, but if the the major part of the system that is decreasing in order is something like the sun, then we can live pretty happily and sustainably for a very long time (photosynthesising plants came up with the idea hundreds of millions of years ago...).c) Research on less polluting renewables is ongoing and it must be stepped up. We have very little alternative but to pursue such a path.

Plants as you point out have had millions (2,400 million in fact) years to perfect extraction of energy from the sun. Their perfected life strategy is to stand very still in the sun and rain and soak it all up while (trying to) absorb and repair assaults from bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, birds, some mammals, and us. There has apparently not been enough energy left over for them to develop much in the way of alternative technologies, or poetry for that matter. It is perfectly doable, just not very desirable.

Agreed on all points Alpo, but I'd add a fourth path to growth.In his Mars trilogy Kim Stanley Robinson speculated on a society that focused on growth in complexity over growth in size. As fewer people were required to work in order to produce the goods required to sustain the population, more were able / required to seek work that provided other forms of value.A service-focused economy, basically, with a focus on arts and science. It's interesting.

Why don't I ever hear an economist arguing for sustainable low growth - say 0.5-1% as an ideal. There seems to be robust argument for keeping growth high and a robust response from those who feel growth must stop altogether. Is there nothing coherent in between?

Good question. But you have to understand the maths. I urge you to go to youtube and watch Pr Albert Bartlett's series on exponential growth.There are two problems with "0.5-1% as an ideal".The first one is that is is STILL exponential growth. ANYTHING growing at x% is exponential.The second one is that such low growth cannot sustain the idiotic monetary system we currently have in place which requires 3+% to generate the money creation needed to repay the current debts + interest...... this is why all the morons in charge start having kittens when growth slows, because people start defaulting on their debts from lack of money. The GFC is not called a FINANCIAL crisis for nothing. lack of growth is ALREADY affecting money creation and stifling credit.

Yet another insightful slogan from Abbott's flock. Let me explain it again to you Billy. Growth that consumes resources at a rate faster than they can be replaced by natural cycles, or growth that produces wastes faster than they can be removed by natural cycles is unsustainable in the long-term. And growth that increases inequality of access to resources between communities, or between groups within a community is not only morally acceptable, it is incompatible with Christian values, and will inevitably lead to conflict and human suffering.That, dear Billy, is the 'inconvenient truth' that emerges from history, and the application of simple logic. So if you are listening to any economist or politician who doesn't accept these fundamental rules, then you should stop listening to them - they are either charlatans or conservatives. By the way, the way right-wing politicians style themselves as 'conservative' is surely a very sick joke - they are anything but 'conservative' when it comes to looking after the long-term interests of this planet and the people who live on it. 'R@pers and pillagers' is far more appropriate!Economic growth that respects these fundamental rules is good and should be encouraged, but the focus must be on the wellbeing of ALL people and the environment in which they live, NOT just the continual accumulation of wealth by the rich and powerful in society.

Thank you Satyajit....... finally some sensible economic writing.Infinite growth in a finite system (a spherical planet) is IMPOSSIBLE. It has to stop, sooner or later, and the time has arrived.Look at graphs of global GDP and oil production, and you see them rising and falling in lockstep. Peak Oil is now here. 'They' now scrape the bottom of the (literal!) barrel with unviable and eneconomic (both financially and energetically) shale oil, tar sands and fraccing....... all desperate measures in desperate times.Growth is finished. The end of growth (and oil) means the end of gobbleisation, effluence, and debt. Without growth, you cannot grow the money supply to repay debts + interest.So yes, "Governments need to rethink their role and adjust policies to an environment of low growth with attendant problems of employment, labour relations, industrial policy, social welfare and stability."But they'll have to be taken there kicking and screaming.

Whether we have had peak oil yet depends on your definition of oil.I think it is fair enough to say that the types of oil that Hubbert was talking about have already peaked and are now at least slowly falling. I think 2005 was the peak for this type of oil.But Hubbert wasn't talking about Natural Gas Liquids, Heavy Oil, Deep Sea Oil, Biofuels, refinery gain, Tight Oil nor Oil Shale. All these expensive options are increasingly contributing to the petroleum liquids total that we now call "oil". They make up over 20mbpd of the 90mbpd of petroleum liquids we now produce and is going to increase further.Even the total of "crude and lease condensate" that people talk about as having been on a bumpy plateau of between 71mbpd and 76mbpd since 2005 and today and that we align most closely with the term conventional oil now includes Heavy Oil, Deep Sea Oil, Canadian Tar Sands, Tight Oil from Baaken and Eagle Ford includes these types of oil which Hubbert did not include in his peak oil theory.The problem is not so much that the increase in the flow of oil has stalled and is now more or less stagnant, the problem is now that an ever increasing number of people are trying to make greater use of that limited flow of oil to improve their living standard. Something has to give and while some people like to characterize this as people in the developed world giving to make way for the improvements in the developing world, its not this at all. It is people at the bottom in the developed world and at the bottom in the developing world who are giving to make way for the improvement in the living standards of a relatively small of people in the developing world. The pain of this transformation is only going to get worse.

Absolutely correct. One of your best articles (all of your articles are good). Particularly the comment re "no politician ever won an election without promising growth". It is inevitable that one day a leader will have to plan for and promise a "mature" stable economy - ie no growth.It will need a substantial group of people (academics, economists, other leaders) to back them up and flesh out the consequences of such an approach and the policy detail to go with it.

Economic growth doesn't have to be just about physical expansion. In-fact, this is likely to lead to stagnation and unnecessary impact on natural resources.Rather, economic can be more about technological advancement. For example, new energy sources and the need to re-tool a society to accomodate them is a lateral form of growth.

Growth is growth. Retooling needs energy and resources. New energy sources are NOWHERE NEAR as good as fossil fuels.

He asked me "why can't we have solar powered cars"...... and the answer was, that to generate enough energy to power my relatively small car all the way to Brisbane would take at least 2 weeks of SUNNY WEATHER (never mind the cloudy variety...) whilst we could achieve this on 12 litres of petrol......And besides.........

It took an awful lot of time to store all that energy from the sun as potential energy in the fossil fuels buried below the surface of our planet, and we are using it all up in almost a mere instant.It goes to show how efficient solar panels are, your trip if solar powered would have used about 80 hours of solar energy for an hour of driving, but how many hours of sunlight over the same surface area as you solar panels would have been needed to produce that much fossil fuel from plant life.What a wasteful lot we are.

Bzzt. Wrong. Look up the Jevons Paradox.For the lazy: history has shown that when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, the rate of consumption of that resource actually tends to rise.Before we can get out of the growth myth/trap, we have to grow up and acknowledge the economic externalities that negatively affect our basic life support system - the environment. We have to reduce pollution and environmental degradation to the point where there is a steady state: where extraction equals replenishment. Only then can we have a sensible discussion about growth and what it really means.

Thanks for calling me lazy. Nothing like a bit of name calling to lower the tone. Just a few things for you to consider:1. Correlation does not mean causation. Consumption is also effected by cultural attitudes and accepted norms, as well as the nature of the resource concerned. 2. Your paradigm applies if a resource has a definable limit. For all intense and purposes, many alternative fuels are effectively limitless.3. My example was just an example. No other agenda was meant to be implied. Another example is reclamation of disused land for other purposes (areas of Newcastle’s CBD that have fallen into disuse).4. Yes. Physical expansion of population is unsustainable growth. This is completely consistent with my original point. So you actually agree with me then?Cheers
