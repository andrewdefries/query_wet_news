Penny Johnston is the presenter of Babytalk (ABC) Can you ever be prepared for the arrival of a baby in your life? It's a tsunami of change that shakes you from head to toe. It's not just your spare room that changes, it's your lifestyle, relationships and even your friendships that undergo a rough renovation. Penny Johnston spent the last year in that very same tumble dryer and came out the other end wondering what she could have done to prepare her for the roller-coaster ride of becoming a mother. Since being back at work Penny's searched out the experts and the unusual stories, tried to tackle some myths and wives tales to bring you some of the most interesting, quirky and difficult aspects of being a parent. Babytalk is the result of genuine first-hand experience and a journalists' need to know why! Even if your baby arrived a few years ago, you can join in and remember, laugh and offer advice to the parents who are part of Australia's new baby boom.
