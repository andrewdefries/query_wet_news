400 Years of the Telescope | A Journey of Science, Technology and Thought
ENGLISH ESPAÑOL
Click here for a larger preview.
Panoramic visuals and engaging interviews make 400 Years of the Telescope the must-see documentary of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.
Beautifully photographed in 4K digital cinematography, the film is a visually stunning chronicle of the history of the telescope from the time of Galileo, its profound impact upon the science of astronomy, and how both shape the way we view ourselves in the midst of an infinite universe.
The film features interviews with leading astrophysicists and cosmologists from the world's renowned universities and observatories, who explain concepts ranging from Galileo's act of revealing the cosmos with a simple telescope, to the latest discoveries in space, including startling new ideas about life on other planets and dark energy — a mysterious vacuum energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
Join us on this companion website to explore this fascinating subject as you meet the film's producers and their worldwide search for the world's greatest telescopes, enjoy captivating interviews with brilliant personalities, learn about planetarium programs in your area and discover local and faraway opportunities to experience our incredible universe firsthand.

2 Comments » Day 6: Reconciliation is a Process Friday, May 13th, 2011 By Michael Tubbs
Anniston, Alabama is an iconic site in the psyche of all those involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Fifty years ago, home grown terrorists slashed the tires and attempted to burn the bus holding the Freedom Riders. Today, we revisited the site of the horrific incident to participate in the grand openings of the photo exhibit and two murals.
In a sense, the movement was defined by that fire. Through those flames, the nation was able to bear witness to the blind bigotry and hatred that consumed far too many. Through those flames, the brave men and women emerged as heroes dedicated to the cause of non-violent direct action and the power of love. Through those flames, my vision of Anniston and civil rights today has been sharpened and borders on being critical.
My experience thus far on the bus has convinced me that reconciliation is a process not a moment. At the dedication of the photo exhibit for the burning bus, the son of one of the mob members hugged a Freedom Rider who was on the bus, welcoming him to the town. Although the moment was special, it was not, as many were calling it, reconciliation. For reconciliation to happen, the present should not bear much resemblance to the social realities of the past. A local woman eloquently echoed these sentiments saying, ” we got this mural after fifty years but we have a long way to go.” In towns nationwide, blacks still face police brutality, inferior education, employment difficulties and a host of other ills.
In many respects the election of the first black president and commerating the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Rides is the beginnining of the long process towards racial reconciliation. Sure moments and memories are nice, but unless we seriously address the racial inequities that plague us in every sphere, fifty years from now our children won’t be able to hold any dedications commemorating the work we did. It’s definitely important to look back and reflect on the past, but it’s more important to collectively turn our gaze to now and the future and frankly engage with the work that still needs to be done.

2 Comments » Day 1: Fifty Years Later, Oh Yes Sunday, May 8th, 2011 By Michael Tubbs
“Fifty years later, Oh yes. Fifty years later oh yes” was my rendition to the popular freedom song, originally sung by the Freedom Riders. They looked at me and smiled as they added their expert voices to the chorus, and we stood united in front of the Newsuem celebrating and marveling what they had accomplished when they risked death to desegregate interstate buses. The entire first night of the Student Freedom Ride was a blur but included a heart to heart with original freedom rider Earnest “Rip” Patton, a brief conversation and photo with one of my personal heroes, Congressman John Lewis and my first time viewing the documentary that got me on the bus, Freedom Riders by Stanley Nelson.
The Student Freedom Ride is an awesome opportunity to reflect on how far the country has progressed but also poses a challenge. It is a challenge that Freedom Ride coordinator Diane Nash characterized as “what history will require of [me].” At the very least, I know that history will require that I give back and pay forward the amazing opportunities I have been given, including this one, as a direct result of the blood, sweat, and tears of those that came before me. Additionally, the training we received from the Children’s Defense Fund’s Director of Youth Leadership and Development Jalaya Lyles Dunn forced me to consider the question, “What am I called to do now?” and to use this trip as a time to begin to chart a new route for freedom and justice in my generation.
At 20, I am the same age as many of the Freedom Riders were in 1961. I can’t fathom facing death or even expulsion from school, but I am passionate about social justice, especially in regards to equal education and ending the cradle to prison pipeline. I am certain that this is what I am called to do and I look forward to hearing the answer to Jalaya’s question from my fellow rides as we embark on this journey. As the night came to an end, original Freedom Rider Robert Singleton said that he has been jailed for his participation in the movement on August 4, 1961 and that a baby named Barack Obama was born on the very same August 4, 1961. The lesson from this was that history is made in the present, and the decisions and sacrifices that I make on May 6, 2011 will impact a child who is just coming into the world on this day.

Global Food Crisis
May 2, 2008	BOB ABERNETHY, anchor: The global food crisis is escalating, as high food prices are forcing humanitarian organizations to scale back operations. At the United Nations, leaders are appealing for more than $750 million in new aid. At the White House, President Bush called on Congress to provide funds to help alleviate the emergency. We spoke about the world food crisis with Reverend David Beckmann, president of the Christian anti-hunger lobbying group Bread for the World. He is a Lutheran pastor.
David Beckmann
Reverend DAVID BECKMANN (President, Bread for the World): Routinely, 850 million people in the world are undernourished. But over the last twelve months the prices of the world’s basic staples — rice, corn, and wheat — have all shot up by about two-thirds, so about another 100 million people are being driven into hunger. It’s partly that incomes have been going up in Asia, and so there’s new demand for food in Asia. There were bad harvests in some important agricultural countries. Higher oil prices have also helped to drive up food prices. In our country, we’re using corn now increasingly to produce ethanol — that’s part of it. We ought to take a look at our ethanol policy and maybe slow it down or modify it some, because it is contributing to hunger around the world and that wasn’t — that clearly wasn’t our intention.
The effects of this hunger crisis are really grim. In Haiti, for example, many people are filling up their children with cookies made out of mud. There’re certain muds that have a bit of nutritional value in Haiti, and so they take that mud with oil and sugar and make cookies and gag that down. There’s a lot of desperation. And then that’s showing up in political unrest, in food riots and other unrest in about 30 countries.
We need more food aid for hungry people. Food aid goes especially to camps. These are the most desperately poor people in the world, and the money that’s been appropriated for food aid is not going as far. So rations in Darfur, for example, have been cut in half. The other thing that needs to happen is a strengthening of global agriculture, especially agriculture in the poor countries. The hidden hope in this crisis is that it can be solved especially by agricultural development in poor countries. There are about 100 million people, really poor people, who are suffering hardship because of the high food prices. But there may be 600 million equally poor people who are struggling to make a living in agriculture in poor countries. So if we can invest in agricultural productivity among those poor people, they can help to bring down the food prices and at the same time improve their own livelihoods.
I think this hunger crisis really is a religious issue, because if we know anything about God we know that God listens to the prayers of hungry mothers who can’t feed their kids. When that mother sighs and asks for help, we know that God is there, and so responding to those mothers by the hundreds of millions is a profoundly religious act. It is sacred work.
