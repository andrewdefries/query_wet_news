Joy is...
Posted by Jen on December 17, 2008 at 7:00 AM in Holidays, Jen
an unexpected handmade gift from a friend
a snuggling growing girl curled up in your mama arms all night long
slap happy children making stupid jokes from the backseat
old songs that make you feel hopeful and warm inside
a buddha baby girl quiet in your arms
a tickle fight with your kids and your neighbors
homemade chocolate chip cookies made from the recipe you stole from your sister
a Charlie Brown Christmas tree
a silly seven year old boy who's still waiting for his two front teeth
everything far from perfect, but plenty good enough just the same
What's making you joyful today?

*A 20 month old who finally fell asleep in the car after a battle of the wills. *A cup of coffee & doughnut at the local Krispy Kreme (drive thru) to enjoy in the car with a good book while she slept.
*The softening, surrender & wave of love that comes after frustration.
