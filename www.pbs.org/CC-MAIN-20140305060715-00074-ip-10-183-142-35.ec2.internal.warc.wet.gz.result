Weekly News Roundup: Talking in Kabul, Air Assaults, Civilian Deaths, and Iran's Influence
written by Matt Elliotton October 15, 2010
The latest developments in Afghanistan center around talks of reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The United States are not directly involved in the discussions, but Defense Secretary Robert Gates says, "there is access into the process and opportunities to make U.S. concerns and suggestions known." In order for the talks to take place, NATO has facilitated the safe passage of Taliban leaders to Kabul, according to Gen. David Petraeus. This short editorial in The Washington Times argues that the advantage lies with the Taliban, since they need only to wait until U.S. troops withdraw next year before expanding their presence in the country, while President Karzai and his government are motivated to reach an agreement now, while they have the backing of NATO.
No one expects the talks to be easy or reconciliation to be reached quickly, and, indeed, violence in Afghanistan continues. Despite granting safe passage for some of the Taliban leadership to Kabul, NATO has reportedly killed the Taliban's second in command in Pakistan. "In a major setback to Taliban, missiles fired from US drones have killed its top commander and group's deputy chief Qari Hussain Mehsud, mastermind of many suicide attacks across Pakistan." This latest drone attack is part of an increased air assault, ushered in by Gen. Petraeus earlier this year. "Last month, NATO attack planes dropped their bombs and fired their guns on 700 separate missions, according to U.S. Air Force statistics. That's more than double the 257 attack sorties they flew in September 2009, and one of the highest single-month totals of the entire nine-year Afghan campaign."
Not surprising, giving the heightened level of military activity, civilian deaths have risen sharply. In Kandahar, the number of Afghan civilians hospitalized for serious war wounds has doubled in the past 12 months. And the effect goes beyond direct war casualties, explains Reto Stocker, the Red Cross chief in Kabul:
"Our greatest challenge consists in maintaining access to the areas hardest hit by the fighting, but the increase in the number of armed groups is making this much harder for us. The result is that children die from tetanus, measles and tuberculosis - easily prevented with vaccines - while women die in childbirth and otherwise strong men succumb to simple infections."
Elsewhere, seven NATO troops across Afghanistan were killed on Thursday, on top of six NATO troops that were killed the day before. What is it like to be out on patrol in Afghanistan? This GlobalPost article provides a gripping narrative and an accompanying photo slide show of an American platoon that gets ambushed toward the end of a recent patrol.
Our own blogger, Rajiv Srinivasan, has a post on The New York Times At War blog about a photo he saw after his return home that brought back vivid memories of his platoon in Afghanistan taking fire from a sniper.
In Iraq this week, a Time Magazine report from Baghdad looks at Iraqis' bleak outlook of their country and compares pre-war Iraq with the current situation and economy.
Perhaps part of the pessimism of Iraqis is the continued violence and the lack of any move toward formation of a legitimate government. The above article mentions that car bombs are still a regular event in Baghdad, and this Guardian report states, " 710 Iraqis had been killed this year with silenced pistols or rifles. At least 600 more had been killed by magnet bombs placed under the cars of officials, according to Baghdad's Major Crimes Unit. Hundreds more have been injured." Sobering figures.
Iraqi officials this week claimed that the United States under reported the number of civilian deaths in the war. "On Thursday, the US military in Iraq released data showing 63,185 civilians and 13,754 members of Iraq's security forces were killed from early 2004 to August 2008, some 22,000 less than Iraq government figures."
Lastly, this piece from The Atlantic argues that Iran's influence isn't nearly as great as the United States may think, after seeing Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki receive the support of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr earlier this month.
Iraqi nationalism and suspicion of Iranian intentions, nearly universal in Iraq, simply do not allow for the kind of Iranian power one hears about in the U.S. While Maliki and Sadr's ascent in Baghdad are in line with the Iranian desire for Shiite Islamist supremacy, their rise is a reflection of Iraq's demography and politics. Of course a Shiite-majority, Islamist-leaning country will elect a Shiite-majority, Islamist-leaning government. Unfortunately, this is how democracy works in a war-scarred country where ethno-sectarian identity remains stubbornly vital to political affiliation. Sadr's political participation, though it may make Iraq less likely to follow every American interest, is simply a reflection of the realities of Iraq's nascent, flawed democracy. Filed Under: Blog

Excerpt from George Fitzhugh, Cannibals All! Or, Slaves Without Masters.
The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and, in some sense, the freest people in the world. The children and the aged and infirm work not at all, and yet have all the comforts and necessities of life provided for them. They enjoy liberty, because they are oppressed neither by care nor labor. The women do little hard work, and are protected from the despotism of their husbands by their masters. The negro men and stout boys work, on the average, in good weather, not more than nine hours a day. The balance of their time is spent in perfect abandon. Besides, they have their Sabbaths and holidays. White men, with so much of license and liberty, would die of ennui; but negroes luxuriate in corporeal and mental repose. With their faces upturned to the sun, they can sleep at any hour; and quiet sleep is the greatest of human enjoyments. "Blessed be the man who invented sleep." 'tis happiness in itself-and results from contentment with the present, and confident assurance of the future. We do not know whether free laborers ever sleep. They are fools to do so; for, whilst they sleep, the wily and watchful capitalist is devising means to ensnare and exploitate them. The free laborer must work or starve. He is more of a slave than the negro, because he works longer and harder for less allowance than the slave, and has no holiday, because the cares of life with him begin when its labors end. He has no liberty, and not a single right. We know, 'tis often said, air and water are common property, which all have equal right to participate and enjoy; but this is utterly false. The appropriation of the lands carries with it the appropriation of all on or above the lands, usque ad coelum, aut ad inferos. (Even to heaven or hell.) A man cannot breathe the air without a place to breathe it from, and all places are appropriated. All water is private property "to the middle of the stream," except the ocean, and that is not fit to drink.
Fitzhugh, George. Cannibals All! Or, Slaves Without Masters. Richmond, Va.: A. Morris, 1857.

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: This is a life's work of my great-grandfather's. He was an aviation pioneer, mainly out of the state of Michigan.APPRAISER: We have a huge album here of clippings, letters, photographs, programs, tickets, you name it. And we have this stack of original early-aviation photographs collected by your grandfather.GUEST: Yes. There's his picture.APPRAISER: His name was Wayne Sheldon.GUEST: Correct.APPRAISER: And, uh, he was obviously someone fascinated by early aviation and its pioneers particularly. So I was struck by some of the images in this wonderful collection you have. Manned flight began with the Wright brothers, of course, and his scrapbook has three nice early shots of the Wright Flyer, 3. Uh, another Wright machine over here, and this is rather nice. This is one of the Wright brothers himself at the controls of his aircraft. Here's an early helicopter... a strange, birdlike machine that someone built. And... let's look at this little group as well. A lot of images of Glenn Curtiss, who was one of the pioneers along with the Wrights. In fact, they later formed a company together. And didn't your grandfather work for the Curtiss-Wright Company?GUEST: Correct.APPRAISER: Uh, this shows some of Curtiss's early experiments: a sort of motor-powered bike, an ice boat powered by a propeller. And over here you have a picture of Curtiss and Alexander Graham Bell, a few of the other early pioneers. What struck me about the collection particularly was how carefully captioned all these were by your grandfather. He identified the individual who was the pilot, the aircraft, the date of the flight, and that kind of documentation is very special and I think it adds to the appeal and the importance of the collection.GUEST: Great.APPRAISER: It's such an enormous group of material that it's hard to value just for its complexity. My own feeling is, though, that it should be worth something in the neighborhood of $25,000. Possibly more, depending on what's in these enormous books.GUEST: Great. Thank you.APPRAISER: The most valuable part of the collection is the photographs, without a doubt.
