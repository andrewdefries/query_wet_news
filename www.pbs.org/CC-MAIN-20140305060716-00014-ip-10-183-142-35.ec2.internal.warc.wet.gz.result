Photo by Cat Wise/PBS NewsHour.My mother used to tell me the world was divided into two groups: those who love Neil Diamond, and those who don’t. I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest the world is actually divided between those love Lil Bub, Henri Le Chat Noir, Maru and Grumpy Cat, and those who have no clue what I’m talking about. For those of you who fall into the latter group, they are cats. Very popular cats who have millions of followers on the Internet. One of Grumpy Cat’s YouTube videos has nearly 10 million views.Last weekend I immersed myself in the world of these cat lovers at the Internet Cat Video Festival in Oakland, Calif. Around 6,000 people gathered on a late spring afternoon to celebrate all things feline and to watch nearly 70 minutes of hilarious cat web videos projected on a 10-story building after the sun went down.Young and old donned cat costumes and enjoyed food and live music on blocked-off streets in downtown Oakland. The event, which was sponsored by the Great Wall of Oakland, also included vendors selling cat paraphernalia as well as local agencies putting cats up for adoption. Proceeds from the event — expected to be around $50,000 — will benefit the East Bay SPCA.An appearance by Dusty the Klepto Kitty was one of the highlights of the evening. People lined up to have their photo taken with the dozing cat, who was dressed up in a prison outfit. Dusty became famous — more than 2 million YouTube views — for stealing things like toys and clothes from the homes of neighbors. He’s even been on “Late Show With David Letterman.” Dusty’s owner Jean Chu says Dusty has taken nearly 1,000 different items during the seven years she’s owned him. “If you want to make yourself happy, find a cat video,” Chu said, adding that her favorite Internet kitty star is little Attila.Heather Nelson, the proud owner of a 4-year-old cat named “Snickle Fritz,” was also in attendance. The Berkeley grad student postponed her honeymoon by a week so she could attend the festival. “People have teased me my whole life for being a cat lover,” Nelson said. “I feel like I can really be me here. I can let my cat freak flag fly and finally feel accepted.” The festival is the brain-child of Scott Stulen, who is project director at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Last summer, Stulen and his colleagues posted a request for people to nominate their favorite cat web videos. They received 10,000 submissions from all over the world, and 79 were selected to be shown at a festival at the museum. Stulen says he expected a few dozen people to attend the screening. More than 10,000 cat fans showed up, and Stulen realized he was onto something.“Yes, it is cat videos. But there are other things going on,” said Stulen. “What is the role of a museum today? You can shoot a video on a phone, put it up on the Internet, and millions can see it. You don’t have to have a curator even touch it. How institutions are responding to things happening in popular culture is interesting.”Stulen admits he’s often asked if what he has organized is “art.”“I jokingly say who cares?” Stulen sad. “But the more serious answer is, some of it is. On one end, you have the Henri video. It is very thoughtfully done. The guy who made it is a filmmaker, and he gets it from an artist perspective. On the other end of it is a 12-second [cellphone] video from six years ago with 30 million hits. There are a lot of things happening within this. It is reflective of what people are looking at, and what they are sharing. I think for a museum it is interesting to be a part of that dialogue.”Stulen and his colleagues have received requests to screen the Internet Cat Video Festival from 200 cities around the country and abroad. So far, in addition to Oakland, they’ve taken it to Boston, San Diego, Memphis, Tenn., and Austin, Texas. In August, the Walker Art Center will host a second festival at the Minneapolis Fair Grounds with all new cat videos.“I thought this would fade away,” Stulen said, “but just the opposite. It keeps growing. It is fun and playful. We’re doing this with a sincere interest and joy about the content. We’re not doing it ironically; we’re not an institution looking at this and saying ‘ha ha.’ We’re saying, ‘It’s ok to like this.’ And people have responded to that beyond my highest expectations.”As the sun set Saturday night, the festival kicked-off with two cats playing patty-cake. The crowd roared with laughter. As an Internet cat videos noob, I found myself laughing and awww-ing with everyone else. My favorite video: Stalking Cat.

Bonus Video: The Wild West in Silicon Valley
Note - video will not appear on mobile devices running iOS.
During the early days of Silicon Valley, physicists and engineers from various companies in the valley would meet at "The Wagon Wheel," a hangout for Fairchild employees and for people who worked at Fairchild spin-off companies. As one Fairchild employee put it, "the Wagon Wheel was a hub of networking." About the Film
Silicon Valley
In 1957, decades before Steve Jobs dreamed up Apple or Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook, a group of eight brilliant young men defected from the Shockley Semiconductor Company in order to start their own transistor business. Their leader was 29-year-old Robert Noyce, a physicist with a brilliant mind and the affability of a born salesman who would co-invent the microchip -- an essential component of nearly all modern electronics today, including computers, motor vehicles, cell phones and household appliances.

In your report From Neurons to Neighborhoods, [you] wrote, "It is
essential to balance the excitement about all the new learning with caution
about the limits of understanding." What did you mean by that? What we meant by that is that, from a scientific point of view, there's always
more to learn, and particularly [in] a new field that's exploding, there's
always a tendency to sometimes get a little bit ahead of what we know and think
we know more than we do. On the other hand, we do know a lot about the
development of the brain. We're learning more all the time. So the caution is
really to be careful about what's not quite ready for prime time yet, in terms
of application. ...
What does neuroscience tell us about the way young children's brains
develop?
Actually, neuroscience per se is telling us very little about how young
children's brains develop. Most of what we know is from animal studies. But if
we take all of what we've learned from animals and some of what we're just
beginning to learn from humans, what it tells us is that all of the experiences
that young children have are influencing the development of their brain.
So what does it say about actually cognitive learning, intellectual
gain?
What the brain science tells us about cognitive and intellectual gains is very
general. It tells us that as you learn more, your brain is changing. That's
what it means to learn more. All of that has to do with brain function. But at
a very specific level, we don't now very much about brain development as it
relates to cognition in young children.
A lot of money was put into programs like Head Start and Early Head Start,
all kinds of preschool programs. And one of the goals was to enhance early
cognitive development. What do you think about that goal, and also the amount
of money that's been spent on these programs?
Maybe it would be better for me to answer what the science tells us rather than
what I think. We have very good evidence that well-designed and well-implemented early
childhood programs, like a good quality Head Start program or other kinds of
interventions, can definitely shift the odds toward better outcomes for
children, in a range of areas -- how they think, how they feel, their social
development, their intellectual development, their language. There's no
question from the research that we could improve outcomes over the short term
and, in some cases, over long term for children. Shonkoff is dean of the Heller School of Social Policy and Management and
professor of human development and social policy at Brandeis University. He
recently served as chair of the Committee on Integrating the Science of Early
Childhood Development, under the auspices of the Board on Children, Youth, and
Families of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, and
co-edited its final report, From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development. He believes that public policy can, and should, be informed by science,
but that it's important to "be careful about what's not quite ready for prime
time yet, in terms of application."
But the question of how much public funds should go into this is more a
question of whether we're getting value for our dollar by putting it into
high-quality programs. The problem is sometimes we take a good model that's
been shown to work, and then we try to bring it to scale and do it to serve
more children for less money, with less well training of the staff; and we get
more confusing and equivocal findings. So that's the problem. The problem is not whether early intervention is a good public investment. The
problem is whether we invest in high-quality services that are shown to make a
difference. And as we found in our report, although the science tells us
interventions can be effective when they're administered early, effective
interventions are not simple. They're rarely inexpensive, and they're not
always easy to implement. ...
Why do you think proponents of early childhood education use the brain
research to help raise money for their programs?
We can have a cynical view of that, and we can have a kind of a more generous
view. The cynical view is that brain research captures people's attention and
imagination. The public responds to stories about brain development, so that's
a cynical view. It's a good strategy to get attention. But the more generous
view is that, if we're concerned about the impact of early experience and
interventions on children's abilities, on children's competence, on how your
intellectual development is going on, on how they're progressing socially,
we're talking about the brain. That's where all of these things happen. The disconnect is that we don't have a lot of brain science related to many of
these early interventions. So people are really making guesses; they're making
extrapolations. But they're good guesses, because if we see effects of
interventions that produce gains in confidence and gains in development, then
we know by inference that it's the brain, even though we haven't studied that
in the brain per se. We've studied it in looking at development and behavior,
which is really another way of looking at the brain. Many people think that brain research is restricted to looking at the cell
structure of the brain, looking at the effects of the chemical systems in the
brain. That is a way to study the brain. But another way to study brain
development is to look at what people are capable of doing, because it's the
brain that really determines that. Do you think there is a "myth of the first three years?" It depends on what you mean by a myth. So if you ask me is it a myth that what
happens in the first three years determines everything that happens afterward
and the window shuts at age three? Absolutely that's a myth. It's just not
true. If you ask me whether the first three years are a very important time in which
rapid brain growth is taking place and brain development is proceeding in a
very rapid clip and that experiences really affect that development, and affect
it in a very big and important way in the first three years? That's not a myth.
That's the truth. That's science. It's absolutely true. New research shows that there is an explosion of growth in the brain around
the 11-year, 12-year mark, and then a subsequent pruning back of that growth.
What do you think of that research, and what does it say?
Well, I'm less of an expert on development in the early adolescent years than I
am in early childhood. But there's a clear message that goes across the whole
life span. Brain development starts before we're born, and brain development
continues until we die, or until we're declared brain-dead, which is one way of
defining death. There are predictable periods in which there is more rapid development of the
brain, [and] in which there's more gradual development. There are parts of
brain development that involve the expansion and proliferation of connections.
There are parts of normal development that involve a pruning back. All of this
is very biologically programmed, but also heavily influenced by experience and
by the environment. It just differs from one age period to another, and we're
learning more and more all the time what those differences are. It's not a different kind of process at one age from what it is at another.
It's always an interaction of your kind of genetic makeup and your
environmental experiences. It's just that different parts of the brain mature
at different ages. Different parts of the brain are more plastic or more open
to change at different times than others. But it's the same process that really
continues, as best as we know it at this point, all the way through. If there is an explosion of growth and pruning in those early adolescent
years, we also see that there are great vulnerabilities of the teenage years.
It seems similar to this period of early childhood. A lot of resources were
poured into early childhood. You may not think there was enough, but there was
a lot. Do we need the same sort of resources poured into the teenage
years?
... If you invest early and create a strong foundation, it's easier to get a
better return on your investments later, because you're just building on
strength. If you don't invest early and you have a weak foundation, then your
later investments are trying to make up for deficiencies. Some of the gains may
be just trying to regain ground that you've lost. So I think it's a big mistake
for us to ask about whether we should invest early or late. In fact, when we invest early, if we stop investing -- particularly for
children who are facing risks in their lives -- we lose some of the gains, the
positive gains of early investment. If we wait and allow children to go without
help who are at risk and we save our money to invest later, we're starting from
further back; in fact, we're trying to make up ground, and we won't get as good
a return on investment. So I think we have to think of this as a lifelong
perspective. ...
What created the "myth of the first three years" that John Bruer talks about
in his book?
The problem is that parents were getting two very strong messages that seemed
to be coming from credible sources, saying the opposite thing. One message was
saying that if things don't happen in the first three years, it's going to be
difficult -- if not impossible -- to make that up. And another very strong and
authoritative message was saying there's nothing special about the first three
years that's different from any other. The lesson that we can take in terms of public education on this issue is that
any kind of overly harsh statement in one direction or another is unlikely to
be completely true, because the truth really is somewhere in between those two
extremes. And this is where the truth is. Are the first three years of life
important? Absolutely. There's no question they're important. Does the window shut at age three on certain things and it's too late to do
anything about it? Absolutely not, when it comes to intellectual development,
language development, social or emotional development. There are critical
periods early in development for children; but they tend to be in very tightly
defined areas, mostly around things like vision, kind of an auditory
perception. There are relatively sensitive or critical periods there. But when it comes to things like intellectual development, emotional
development, their social development, there is not a shred of evidence that
there's a critical period for any of those dimensions. At the same time, the
first three years are very important for the foundation in each of those areas.
So this is kind of where the truth is. It's both important, but not the be-all
and the end-all. The danger of the misinterpretation is to go to either of two extreme
falsehoods. One is that it doesn't matter, therefore it doesn't matter what
happens in the first couple of years; you can always make it up later,
therefore don't waste public funds and invest. That's a huge mistake. That's
against everything we know about science. Another danger would go to the other extreme and say, "Put all of our
investments in the first three years, because that's where it really matters,
and let's not worry about investing afterward." That would be a huge mistake.
Both of those would be mistakes, not just because it doesn't make sense, but
because the science doesn't support that at all. It's nice when science and
common sense come together. I think this is one example where they both come
together.
But there is only a finite pot of money. People have to make decisions to
spend it in one way or another. Right.
So where do they get guidance on that?
To the extent that science can provide guidance, the answer from science would
be to take a long-term perspective -- think about what the different needs are
at different points in the life span, and to be really smart about how you make
your investments. And the other issue here is that we need to bring in more into the policy
debates. The argument should not just be whether we should spend more or less
money at a given age period. The argument should be, "What's the smartest way
to invest our money? What's the best way to get the biggest bang for the buck?"
What that means is there are some ways we're spending money early on where
we're not spending enough. There are other areas where maybe we're spending
more than we need to spend. So it's being smart about it, and making strategic investments and thinking
long term. If you're interested in the early years, also think about the years
that follow, because if you get positive gains from early investments and then
you pay no attention, what happens afterward [is that] children in high-risk
environments will lose the gains that they've made early on. ...
Do you sense that there is a political agenda out there right now about
these issues of learning?
I think there's always a political agenda out there around learning, and the
politics change over time. And I don't think it's realistic for us to expect
that that issues around children's needs and families' needs would ever be
apolitical. What's important is that we separate out the political agenda,
which is real, from what the knowledge base is. And I won't pretend to think that knowledge will totally drive our politics.
But certainly if we're interested in achieving certain goals, if we're
interested, for example, in enhancing school readiness and recognizing that
it's a political issue, at least answering the question of how we enhance
school readiness, would depend a lot on what we know about what children need
to be ready for school. And that is first a knowledge-based question. Then we
can take that knowledge and decide how it's going to play out on the political
arena. But what gets us into trouble sometime is that the politics defines the
knowledge. And then we have very strong positions on programs that really are
disconnected from the knowledge base, and that's unfortunate. It's really
imperative that we can separate out what do we know from what do we believe and
what are our political values. And then we can make a decision as a society
about where to go. ... home + introduction + from zzzs to a's + work in progress + seem like aliens? + science
