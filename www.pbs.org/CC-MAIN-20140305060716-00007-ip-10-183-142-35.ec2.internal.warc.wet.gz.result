1 of 5 ›› The Sincerity Test
Posted: Thu, 12/16/2010 - 6:20pm
Polls can be confusing. Americans generally hate Congress but don’t mind their own Congressman. And many of them say they hate President Obama but consider him a good father and a generally likeable fellow.
What gives?
I did a deep dive into two new polls out this week to see if I could figure it out. As I was scouring the graphs and tables, I came across a question I’d never noticed before.
In the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, voters were asked whether they believe the President and Congressional Republicans are “sincere” when they say they want to reduce the federal deficit.
Think about that. They were not asked whether they agree with their leaders, or even whether they trust their motivations. The question basically was: Do you think they believe what they say?
The results are intriguing. Sixty-four percent say Mr. Obama is sincere; 51% say the Republicans are. This helps to explain other poll results that show voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to fix a range of domestic issues.
But take a peek at the Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll also released this week. A whopping 64% are only “somewhat” or “not at all” confident that the President--- overall---is pursuing “the right set of goals and policies.”
That gives both sides room to run on all manner of issues. So when President Obama delivered a carefully calibrated silver lining update on the mission in Afghanistan, he had to know he was counting on this generosity of public opinion.
“Progress comes slowly and at a very high price in the lives of our men and women in uniform,” he said. “In many places, the gains we’ve made are still fragile and reversible. But there is no question we are clearing more areas from Taliban control and more Afghans are reclaiming their communities.”
This may be what Americans want to hear. But any room to run offers but a narrow path. Only 34% of those responding to the Washington Post/ABC News poll agree that the war has been worth fighting.
Still, according to another poll, this one conducted by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, most Americans still support the President’s plan to keep troops in Afghanistan until 2014.
But once again, this is no overwhelming endorsement. The margin of support is only 53% to 45%. And those numbers flip among members of the President’s own party – with 53% of Democrats opposing the plan, and 46% supporting it.
Americans can be forgiven for being of mixed minds about the big issues facing the nation right now. If you are pessimistic about the economy (as most are) and know someone who is unemployed or otherwise affected by the recession (as many do), you can be forgiven for thinking that tax cuts and unemployment benefits will help.
Yet if the state of the economy makes you more likely to worry about your retirement security, cutting Social Security payroll taxes does not seem like such a good idea even if you think deficit spending is a bad idea. A majority – 56% – says efforts to cut the deficit should begin right away, according to the Washington Post/ABC News poll.
It’s a confusing political landscape, and as members of Congress try out new navigational tools – mostly delaying action by giving long speeches – they can only hope that Americans continue to give them the benefit of believing in their sincerity.
The answers reminded me that Americans are a pretty practical lot. They are not as polarized or as judgmental as the people they elect. So as Congress looks for a way to negotiate a lame-duck session tightrope, know that they are confused too. Tweet Widget

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: These pieces belonged to my mother- and father-in-law. They acquired them about 14 or 15 years ago quite by accident. My wife's uncle was handling the disposition of a friend's estate. His wish was that everything just be sold and the money given to charity. So my wife's uncle asked family members to come on in ahead of outsiders and allowed them to go through, pick something out, and make an offer. APPRAISER: What are you hoping to find out about these vases today? GUEST: I'm hoping to find out that they are authentic. There's been a lot of speculation in the family. We know that they're signed vases. APPRAISER: We see signatures on each vase. They are signed "Louis Comfort Tiffany," so we're wondering if these are authentic Tiffany vases. Indeed, I believe they are. We've got probably about $13,000 worth of Tiffany glass in front of us. I've arranged these in an order. I saw one that was very interesting. This vase, for instance, is a flower-form vase that I would describe, uh.. it could be in the $1,500 range. The second one here would be in that same value range-- about $1,500. They are Favrile glass, as all of these vases are. The second pair, if we look at this great tendril form on them with green leaves and also little tiny flower buds, it makes them even more special than the two gold iridescent ones. I would probably place the value of these two at $5,000 for the pair. And then finally for me the piëce de rèsistance is this really great goblet-form vase... GUEST: It's my father-in-law's favorite piece. APPRAISER: Well, he's got good taste. I would say this one alone is probably in the $5,000 range. It has great blue iridescence in the interior, which is wonderful. And each one of these pieces is unique. Just a great example of American art glass from the turn of the century. GUEST: I've gained a new appreciation for their beauty, that's for sure. Thank you. On TV
