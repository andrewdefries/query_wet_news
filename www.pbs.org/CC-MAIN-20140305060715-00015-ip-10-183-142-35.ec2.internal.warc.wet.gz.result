While there’s no official tally of results, the number of winners from last Tuesday who claim some Tea Party backing includes at least five senators and anywhere from 28 to 40 House members, based on news reports. Those candidates elected, on a platform of smaller government, less spending, and lower taxes, will be confronted with decisions about what exactly to cut. ABC’s Christiane Amanpour pressed Kentucky senator-elect Rand Paul yesterday. RAND PAUL: But someone has to believe it.CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, host, “This Week With Christiane Amanpour”: Give me one specific cut, Senator-elect.RAND PAUL: All across the board.CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: One significant one. No, but you can’t just keep saying all across the board.RAND PAUL: Well, no, I can, because I’m going to look at every program, every program. But I would freeze federal hiring. I would maybe reduce federal employees by 10 percent. I would probably reduce their wages by 10 percent. JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who supported Paul’s opponent in Kentucky’s GOP primary, was asked about some of the senator-elect’s ideas during an appearance on CBS. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Minority Leader: Well, he’s going to have an opportunity in the Senate to offer all of those ideas. We will get votes on them. He’s coming here with a lot of enthusiasm and new ideas. And we will be happy to consider them in the Senate. And I’m sure they will be considered in the House as well. BOB SCHIEFFER, host, “Face The Nation”: Well, I mean, considering them and being for them — are you for those things? SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Some of those things, I may well be for. I may end up being for all of them. We will have to see. JUDY WOODRUFF: Taking clearer aim at the salaries of federal employees was South Carolina’s Jim DeMint. DAVID GREGORY, moderator, “Meet The Press”: Which part of the budget, knowing that there’s only 15 percent that’s non-discretionary, or that’s real — non-defense, discretionary part of the budget, what are you going to target for cuts? SEN. JIM DEMINT (R-S.C.): Well, I don’t think the American people are going to have to sacrifice as much as the government bureaucrats who get paid about twice what the American worker does. JUDY WOODRUFF: In the primaries, DeMint endorsed several Tea Party insurgents over establishment-backed candidates, including in Utah, where he sided against three-term incumbent Bob Bennett. When we spoke to Bennett shortly after he lost his reelection bid last May, he warned that the Tea Party energy would take Republicans only so far. SEN. ROBERT BENNETT (R-UT): Yes, we benefit from the sense of anger and the sense of helplessness and disenfranchisement that this movement demonstrates. But we must recognize that anger is not a sound strategy for governing, and that, once you are in office, you have to have some solutions. JUDY WOODRUFF: Exit polls last week showed 40 percent of voters expressed some level of support for the Tea Party, a sign the movement and its agenda has some wind at its back. Republican senator-elect Mike Lee ran as a Tea Party candidate in Utah, and he joins us now from Salt Lake City. First of all, congratulations. MIKE LEE (R-UT), senator-elect: Thank you. It’s good to be with you. JUDY WOODRUFF: And you. My first question is, how will you be able to work with Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, since he was working for your opponent in the Republican primary? MIKE LEE: Well, you know, there are a lot of people who will be coming together, notwithstanding the fact that they might have been on different sides of different races. And I certainly have no problem with that. I’m sure that Leader McConnell doesn’t either. Look forward to working with him. We agree, as Republicans, on lots and lots of issues, including the issues that are most important to the Tea Party, like the fact that the federal government is too big and too expensive. There are few, if any, Republicans who will disagree with that. JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, your office was telling us today, senator-elect Lee, that one of your top priorities is an amendment to the United States Constitution to balance the budget. How soon would you like to see that happen? MIKE LEE: Well, I think it needs to happen in 2011, in the first year of the soon-to-be-created Congress, because I think we need a framework from which to start this idea that says we need to stop mortgaging the future of unborn generations of Americans. You know, it’s a form of taxation without representation, when we incur debt to the tune of trillions of dollars. You know, we have a national debt that right now sits at a level approaching $14 trillion. Within about a year’s time, at the current rate, we will be at a $15 trillion debt, $50,000 per person just on a per capita basis. That’s a lot of money, a lot of money that’s going to have to be paid back by people, some of whom aren’t even born yet. And, so, we need an amendment to the Constitution that says Congress, subject to very rare, limited circumstances, has to pass a balanced budget every year. JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, to get to that, you told a town hall meeting, I read, in Utah just a few weeks ago that the federal budget might have to be cut as much as 40 percent. Were you serious about that? MIKE LEE: Well, that’s not exactly what I said. What I was talking about was the fact that we need to look at a bunch of different formulas to try to figure out how to balance the budget. I suggested, in hypothetical terms, that that’s one approach we could take, is go through and come up with a hypothetical budget from each department, each federal program, figure out what it would look like if it were cut by that amount, and then figure out what we could tolerate. Another approach would be to go back just a few years, say, examine the budget as recently as 2004, and figure out how that could be made to work today, just a few years later. If we had a budget in place like that today, we could balance it. JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask you because, as you know very well, 60 percent of the budget, defense, Social Security, Medicare, and if you walled that off — and you have suggested you would wall that largely off — all you’re left with are veterans benefits, retirement benefits. You’re left with safe food and drugs, protecting the environment, education, medical research, and a lot of issues — a lot of items that people think are essential for the federal government. So, I guess my question is, what would you cut? MIKE LEE: Well, again, that’s going to be one of the questions that we’re confronting. What we’re addressing right now is the need for a balanced budget amendment that will require Congress to do this. Look, you have a lot of senators and a lot of representatives in both political parties who want a balanced budget. We’re not always going to agree on where we cut or where we cut first. But if we first agree on the need to balance it and on the fact that we need to amend the Constitution to require us to do so, we will get somewhere. And I think we could get there by doing, among other things, a retrospective look at past budgets, say, as recently as 2004, and say, look, if that could work just a few years ago, why couldn’t that work today?JUDY WOODRUFF: And where would you — for example, some of your new incoming colleagues have said they want to look at cutting federal government salaries. They want to look at cutting out the Department of Education, cutting out a number of other things. Are there any specifics you can give us? MIKE LEE: Well, yes. I would like to see a cut with the Department of Education. Look, our education system in the United States of America functions best when decisions affecting the classroom are made as close to the classroom as possible, when they’re made by teachers, by principals, by parents, and by state and local government and educational officials, not from Washington, D.C. And that’s one area where we could cut and we could save a lot of money. We could save about $50 billion a year doing that. Of course, that’s a drop in the bucket compared to what we would need to cut if we were to balance the budget. And that’s I say we’re going to have to look at across-the-board cuts, the likes of which we could discern perhaps by looking back to a budget as recent as the 2004 budget. JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, one of the decisions Congress is going to be making early in the new year is raising the debt ceiling. And I believe you have said you would vote against that. And my question is, even if it means shutting down the federal government, which is what’s happened in the past when Congress hasn’t supported that?MIKE LEE: I would vote against raising the national debt ceiling. Again, this is about mortgaging the future of unborn generations of Americans. It’s a form of taxation without representation. I don’t think we can do that. Now, I think there are alternatives out there that we could use in order to avoid a government shutdown. I don’t want a government shutdown. I don’t think anyone does. I would like to see some form of continuing resolution that would allow spending to continue at current levels.But, if we had to do that in a way that enabled us to avoid having to raise the national debt ceiling, we might have to consider across-the-board cuts being built into the automatic continuing resolution. JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again…MIKE LEE: I would, however, vote against raising the national debt ceiling. JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again, across-the-board, no specifics? MIKE LEE: Correct, across-the-board. JUDY WOODRUFF: And — and — and, in terms of the Bush era tax cuts, you have indicated you’re in favor of extending those permanently. The estimate is, that would cost something like, what, $4 trillion over the next 10 years. How would you pay for that? MIKE LEE: Well, in the first place, I think it’s important that, when we ask that question, we not look at it in terms of a cost. This isn’t money that belongs to the government. This is money that belongs to the people, the people who earn it, the people who are paying their taxes. So, we can’t look at this from the perspective, the same perspective as we would if we were talking about a government program that we were trying to create. This is money that belongs to the American people, to the same people who earn it, the same people who are paying taxes. We have been operating our government based on those tax cuts, but we have been operating at a rate that is far in excess of what we’re bringing in. So, again, we have to look at across-the-board cuts, the same kind of cuts that we would look to if, all of a sudden, we had to pull out the 2004 budget and make it stick right now. JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we’re going to leave it there. Senator-elect Mike Lee from Utah, thank you for joining us. And, again, congratulations. MIKE LEE: Thank you.

Dr. Roizen's Interview with Larry King
Chapter 3 - Sex, Heart Attacks & Stress [5:11]
Is sex after a heart attack dangerous? Are sexual problems an early sign of heart disease? Is stress always bad for the heart? We're sorry but this video is no longer available.
Transcript: Chapter 3 - Sex, Heart Attacks & Stress
Is sex after a heart attack dangerous? Are sexual problems an early sign of heart disease? Is stress always bad for the heart? LARRY KING: Sallie Foley, can you return to life as usual after a heart attack sexually?
SALLIE FOLEY: It's a good question, because some people can and some can't. They have to check with their physician.
DR. MICHAEL ROIZEN: Wait a second; we should ask him, right? [laughter] What do you think about that, Larry?
LARRY KING: Uh... [laughter] I have two boys: one is seven, one is six. It was done without Viagra. I rest my case.
SALLIE FOLEY: And not everyone is quite that fortunate. So the first thing that people think about after a heart attack or any kind of heart disease is not about their sex life, it's whether or not they're going to live. Later, as a quality of life issue, people are concerned about whether or not they can return to sexual activity with a partner. And many people avoid it unnecessarily. The problem is getting people to talk to their physicians about it. LARRY KING: If I can speak from first-hand nature; I may be the only person here who had a heart attack. The big fear is there's a fear of it. There's a fear of what am I going to do? What if I might die? What is the strain on my heart? So you're afraid.
DR. STEVEN NISSEN: There's fear not just amongst the patient but their partner as well. The partner fears that they'll--
LARRY KING: I don't want him to die on me.
DR. STEVEN NISSEN: Exactly. And there's several things that we need to do. One is we've got to talk about this. And the other is physicians have to ask patients about it. So when I see a patient back after a heart attack, I ask, "Have you resumed sexual activity or not?" And if they haven't, I ask them why not. And you come up with some interesting comments like "I'm afraid I'm going to die if I do." The reality is if you can walk up a couple flights of stairs, you can begin having sex again.
LARRY KING: Dr. Roizen, what's the link between stress and heart disease? What do we know?
DR. MICHAEL ROIZEN: Stress, and especially chronic stress, is a great ager of our arteries, meaning causes heart disease. But so does acute stress. The example is after 9/11 defibrillators fired three times more in the next month after 9/11 as they did the month before, not only in New York but also in Alabama and Kansas. So we take these major stressful life events and they really affect us greatly.
LARRY KING: Dr. Johnson, is all stress equally deadly?
DR. PAULA JOHNSON: No. There are some things that are good. For example, being up here today on TV, you get kind of a dose of it, it gets you going and you perform. But the kind of stress that Dr. Roizen just talked about in terms of the chronic stress, that's the bad kind of stress, and stress that is persistent.
And I think we also make a mistake of how do we measure stress. So I think that we kind of have a working definition. But things like the stress of poverty, the stress that it's a day to day wearing and tearing, those are the types of things that we know can actually be connected with the development of blockages in the arteries.
DR. MARIANNE LEGATO: I think that there are some comments about stress that are important to remember, that a feeling of control over your life is healthy. Undergoing some kind of emotional pain, which you feel is endless and that you can't solve is not healthy.
DR. STEVEN NISSEN: It's important that we not over-state this though. You know, we've got these big risk factors of cholesterol and diabetes and smoking and blood pressure, and those are the big drivers. And stress tends to make things worse. But we would do really well if we would attack those major risk factors aggressively, as you did in your own life. But we want to do it not after people have had a heart attack but before. DR. MICHEAL ROIZEN: And that's really the key point, is that everyone knows the conditions. So it's smoking, it's a high LDL, a low HDL. It's not getting any physical activity. It's not having a friend or passion for something you're doing. It's having high blood pressure. If you have one of those and are listening to this show, you should do something about it today, not wait until you have a heart attack.
LARRY KING: Dr. Foley, is sex stress?
SALLIE FOLEY: It's good stress, but it can be if the couple are having difficulties, it could be a negative stress. An early warning sign that is often missed is problem with sexual dysfunction. People don't realize that their sexual health is actually part of their overall health. So sometimes someone will have erectile difficulties and they'll feel embarrassed or ashamed and they'll ignore it, not realizing that it often is a precursor of heart disease.
DR. STEVEN NISSEN: You know, this issue of erectile dysfunction, though; it's something we need to say that's very important. Sometimes the first symptom that a man has disease in their blood vessels is difficulty having an erection. And so that really should-- people should seek medical attention. The same things that cause the blocking up of the arteries in the heart are blocking up the arteries to the penis, and erectile difficulty can in fact be a sign of heart disease and people need to know that. DR. PAULA JOHNSON: The other area that's very important for women and is very much related to stress is depression, and depression after a heart attack is a significant problem for everybody. For women, though, it seems to really put them at even increased risk for a second heart attack. And it can be thought about as yet another type of stress.
