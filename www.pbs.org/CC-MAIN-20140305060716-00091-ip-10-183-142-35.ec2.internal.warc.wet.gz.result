NOVA Online | Tracking El Niño | Mail | Responses (Feb. 9, 1998)
Questions and Responses
Posted February 9, 1998 | next set
Question:We are leaving for Aruba Saturday morning. Having been there several times in the past, and having good weather always, I wanted to know if El Niño is having any effect on the weather in Aruba.Dave SeltzerCincinnati, OHResponse: Well, since it's past Saturday morning, you probably know better than I that Aruba is generally enjoying mild and sunny weather this winter, although there's been more rain than usual. Positioned as it is in the Caribbean, north of Venezuela, Aruba is sheltered from El Niño's most direct effects by the mountains and landmass of northern South America. By the time El Niño's warm, moist air makes it over this land, the moisture has mostly been wrung from it. Aruba and the Caribbean in general are seeing more diversity in the weather than normal, but not enough to ruin most people's vacations.
Question:How long does El Niño last, and how will it affect us down here in Yuma, Arizona? Angel PerezYuma, AZResponse:Down there in Yuma, Arizona, you're probably already realizing that El Niño can mean more rain than normal in both the fall and the winter. In fact, this past September, the pacific hurricane Nora (fed by El Niño's energy) chewed its way across Mexico and landed in Arizona, dumping a LOT of water. That almost never happens, except in a strong El Niño year. Not far from you, scientists have taken tree ring samples that show El Niño has visited Arizona many times in the past. The rain and snow it brings is recorded in thicker tree rings than normal. Look at our section on El Niño's Reach Through Time for more about this. As for your question about how long El Niño lasts: that's kind of a trick question. We tend to think of El Niño only as something that makes bad weather for half a year, and then goes away. But that's like saying Halley's Comet exists only when we can see it, once every 76 years. Even when we can't see it, Halley's Comet is still out there in space, tracing the same orbit that it has for thousands of years. El Niño is the same way. Every few years, we see it in one extreme of its cycle. But even when it seems to go away, it's still out there, hidden in the water of the Pacific ocean and the air above it, a mysterious rhythm of the sea and the wind that only makes itself known every few years. This time around, we can expect El Niño to continue upsetting the weather for another few months, as it has since last summer. Question:Is El Niño likely to have an effect on the growing season in the central US?(name witheld by request)Response:Anything that changes the weather patterns over such a large area as El Niño does, will have some effects. In the central US, El Niño has meant a milder winter than normal in the north, and crops like winter wheat are going to do well. In the southern central US, it's been a lot wetter than usual. It remains to be seen if this will increase the chance of flooding later, but it probably will mean an early and healthy start for spring crops. I'd say farmers in Kansas City, and in the rest of the Great Plains and the Midwest, will generally be pleased with El Niño this year. There is some scientific speculation that part of El Niño's aftermath will be a hot, dry summer in North America. This is not an official scientific prediction, so I wouldn't get too worried yet. We just don't know enough yet to make that kind of prediction with any useful level of certainty. But there are hints in records of the past that we shouldn't be too surprised if this happens. Watch the dispatches section for a guest dispatch next week from meteorologist Peter Chaston on just this topic.
Question:I would like to receive statistics on the effects of El Niño in first, second and third world countries, compared to its effects in the US. Thank you,Stephon BarnesPhiladelphia, PAResponse:I should point out that the first, second, and third worlds are mostly political, rather than geographic, distinctions. Therefore, it's probably more useful to think of geographic regions, like South America or Africa or Southeast Asia. You can take a quick look at El Niño's Reach to get an idea of how El Niño changes weather in different parts of the world. El Niño respects no national boundaries. Even different parts of the same country may feel very different effects from El Niño. In the US, Florida, the gulf states, and the west coast get a lot more rain than usual, while the Midwest gets a break from the usual cold winter. El Niño seems to get its fingers into most parts of the world, one way or another. Question:What is the prediction for the monsoon rains for the southern part of India during 1998?NagendraBangalore, Karnataka, IndiaResponse:Southern India is in a zone of relative unpredictability for the effects of El Niño. That's another way of saying that something abnormal will probably happen, but no one can say exactly what. Last summer and fall, southern India experienced delayed monsoon rains that eventually became more normal. The outlook for 1998 is for more normal conditions, but that's really an educated guess. If you look at historical records (as Gilbert Walker did in the early 1900s - see El Niño's Reach Through Time) you'll see that in your part of the world, in El Niño years, summers are usually drier than normal, and the onset of the monsoons can be delayed. If you want more detail, the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction has compiled a lot of historical records for specific regions and countries. is the summary for India.
Question:Will El Niño continue to influence the weather in 1999 and if so, will it be a warm or cold June and July? (name witheld by request)Response:That's a great question, because it helps us think of El Niño not as an isolated event, but as a pendulum that swings first in one direction, then back in the other. In 1999, it won't be El Niño that affects us, but La Niña, its alter-ego that represents the pendulum swinging back, as the cycle plays out. There is some evidence, but not nearly enough to say with certainty, that a La Niña summer here in North America is likely to be hotter and drier than normal, and the winter to be colder. One thing is certain, though: the cycle of El Niño and La Niña will continue to operate, and anywhere from two to ten years (most likely two to four years) from now, we will see El Niño again. The hidden mechanism out there in the Pacific ocean and the atmosphere above it never stops. Question:Does the "Greenhouse Effect" have anything to do with this, and if so, are there any long-term effects for the environment? If in the future there are many consecutive El Niños, is there a possibility for the polar ice caps to partially melt? DallasBuffalo, NYResponse:Your question belongs under the "let's open a can of worms and pour Tabasco sauce on them" heading. There's a lot of debate about global warming, and some of it is pretty heated, because there are a lot of economic costs involved with changing our dependence on fossil fuels, and stopping deforestation, just to mention two of the many proposed causes of warming. Of course, there are a lot of economic costs to having the ice caps melt and all our coastal cities flooded, too! And that's just for starters. The philosopher Bertrand Russell said that the more heated and angry an argument is, the less likely it is driven by facts. No one has heated arguments about whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow. But if you apply Russell's adage to global warming, it seems that we still have a lot to learn. George Philander of Princeton University put it to me this way: say you are in a canoe going down a river. You know that somewhere ahead is a waterfall, but you don't know where. You want to ride that canoe as far as you can, because you don't want to have to get out and walk. The river looks calm now, so you keep going. Question: when do you get out? We're like the canoeist. Virtually everyone agrees that the Earth's climate is warming. For example, globally, 1997 was the warmest year ever recorded. But there is little agreement about how much our climate has warmed, and how much more it will warm in years to come. Humans have probably contributed to the warming, but again no one knows how much. If current trends continue, then the Earth's climate will undergo some pretty dramatic changes, even in our lifetimes. This could create a *lot* of problems. Like the canoeist, we haven't seen the waterfall, so we don't know how bad it is, or where it is. But most scientists now agree there is a waterfall ahead of us. Will we pull over to the banks in time? El Niño is part of the Earth's weather systems, so it's not appropriate to talk about the Greenhouse Effect's influence on El Niño without talking about its influence on climate in general. And even though 1997 was a very warm year, and the current El Niño is one of the strongest ever recorded, Antarctica had an extremely *cold* winter in 1997, possibly due to El Niño. So it's a very complicated matter...El Niño will not melt the icecaps, it's the total heat content of the oceans and atmosphere (or "global temperature") that will do it, if it should happen. If you throw a baseball through your neighbor's window, will the baseball be blamed? How about your hand? No, it's you who is to blame. El Niño is climate's hand, so to speak. If you'd like to read further about this topic, check out the book "The Next One Hundred Years," listed in our Resources section. It's superb. Question:What data do scientists use to predict that an El Niña might follow the current El Niño? Bob GorsuchAuburn, WAResponse:Good question, but let me be picky for a moment. It's actually La Niña, not El Niña. In Spanish, La refers to female, and El to male. So what's this female/male stuff all about? As we point out in Anatomy of El Niño, Peruvian fishermen gave El Niño its name about a hundred years ago. It means "the (boy) Child," which is short for the Christ Child, because in years when El Niño came, it seemed to show up around Christmas. We now know that El Niño is one extreme of a cycle that takes from two to ten years to complete. Scientists officially call this cycle ENSO, short for El Niño Southern Oscillation, and unofficially call El Niño's opposite extreme La Niña, "the (girl) Child." As El Niño starts to go away, La Niña starts to arise, like two kids on a teeter-totter. (Talk about a couple of spoiled brats!) Roughly speaking, La Niña does in the western Pacific what El Niño does in the eastern Pacific. Therefore, if we see a La Niña form this summer, it will probably get wetter in the west, near Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and drier in the east, along South America, and maybe even in North America. Scientists have good weather records available from the past century, and then some. Generally, the prediction that La Niña will follow El Niño is based on what's happened in the past. This leads to a probabilistic form of prediction, something like "well, in seven out of the last eight times El Niño appeared, La Niña effects showed up in the following year - therefore, there's roughly an 85% chance that we'll see La Niña this year." Scientists are trying to supplement this by making computer simulations of climate (they call them numerical models), which combine past data and current observations to make a forecast.
Question:It seems like spring is coming earlier and earlier to Seattle and the northwest—is this really happening? Are we predicted to have a dry summer? Patty LymanSeattle, WAResponse:Let me ask you a question first. If you were at the coffee shop, and the next person to walk in the door was six feet six, would it seem that all the customers are getting taller these days? Probably not. How about if the next ten people were over six and a half feet tall? Well, maybe, unless the basketball team had just decided it needed a cappuccino break. Scientists avoid trying to draw large conclusions from small amounts of data. That's part of the problem with climate prediction in general, and El Niño prediction in particular: in many cases there's not enough data to make reliable estimates of what might happen. You might have to count a hundred or more customers to get an idea of average height, and you might have to look at a hundred El Niños, or a hundred springtimes, to get a better understanding of the probability of different effects occurring. In other cases, no matter how much data we have, the best we can ever do is say there are several possible outcomes, and assign rough probabilities to them. That's part of the nature of some inherently unpredictable systems - the best we can ever do is talk in generalities. The current term for these systems is "chaotic" and it means that no matter how much data you collect about the workings of some systems, you'll never be able to predict what they'll eventually do, only what they'll probably do in general, and who knows when! I don't want to get into it too much here, but the world is filled with such chaotic systems, where making tiny changes in the starting conditions can lead to huge and unpredictable differences in the outcome. A fresh branch of mathematics, called Chaos Theory, has arisen in the last thirty years to describe these systems. The original idea came from a meteorologist (appropriately enough) at MIT named Ed Lorenz, who was trying to figure out how to use a computer to predict the weather for more than a few days. They're still working on that one. So, the answer to your question depends on trying to figure what an inherently unpredictable system is likely to do. Spring may seem to come earlier lately, but only thirty years ago, most scientists felt that we were on the verge of entering a new ice age. Times change. It may be that the warming trends that have become more pronounced in the 1980s and 1990s are a blip in climate, a random aberration like having the basketball team walk through the door, and that soon it will be business as usual. Or it may be that global warming trends are starting to take hold, and soon you'll be planting zinnias in Seattle on March 1... As for your question about this year, some evidence from the past suggests 1998 will be a drier summer in your region, but don't hold your breath. One thing is certain, though: anyone who tells you they know for sure is a charlatan. (next set of questions & responses)

Food, Politics, and the Iranian Way of Water | Part 2
by CORRESPONDENT
11 Jul 2011 06:04Comments
Part 1: The life and near death of the qanat system.
Part 2: Qanats -- natural harmony. [ personal history ] Anthropologists and archeologists believe qanats were invented in Iran just over four millennia, or two hundred generations, ago. Then the technology spread west and east, bringing new rhythms of life to barren lands, from the deserts of Sudan to the oasis of Turpan. The first qanats were byproducts of mining in the Zagros Mountains, the wall of soaring peaks and deep valleys rising along Iran's western edge. Miners bore secondary tunnels to discharge water collecting in their active shafts. This offered nearby farmers something as precious as the coal itself: endless water. With this gift they could settle and grow food year round. The qanat's simple concept allowed it to develop rapidly: Bore a slightly slopping shaft into the foothills of mountains, and water will seep in along its length and grow into a stream by the time it reaches open air. As foothills rise quicker than the sloping tunnel, the earth rises fast, often more than a 1,000 feet over the far end of the tunnel. Penetrating alluvial layers, soaked by rain and melted snow, the tunnels receive a constant and persistent gift, which they collect and deliver to delighted tea drinkers, dusty travelers, and farmers with equally vital concerns. Typical qanat shafts run from about a mile to over 15 miles, although there are 120-mile-long ones in northeast Iran, still productive after 12 centuries. Thousands still produce near freezing water in places where there is no rainfall from March to November. They deliver millions of gallons of water each day. In fact, the 1967 International Conference on Water for Peace held in Washington, D.C., demonstrates that much was understood about the delicate relationship of qanats and the aquifers on which they depend. Certainly, qanats are complex structures to design and build. They require expert prospectors, engineers, and excavators, and thus, substantial capital. Depending on the historical period, the construction costs were borne either by governments or financially capable land owners. Regions they thus transformed were named after them. For example one of the qanats at Sharifabad is known as the Qanat-e Pazookie, which dates back to the early Sassanid period, circa 1100 C.E. Iran is mostly a high desert plateau, much like eastern Oregon. Similarly, its plains are bordered by mountain ranges, Alborz to the north and Zagros to the west. The eastern mountains don't get much snow, although there is sufficient rain to feed the alluvial reservoirs and the qanats that tap into them. High-grade, foot-deep topsoil covers many mountain skirts. But lack of reliable surface water and scant rainfall for most of the year makes them effectively barren, or at best, grazing land. On the plains, the average annual rainfall is less than a single day's average precipitation in the northwest United States. Useful and abundant water tables in most areas are over 500 feet below the surface, making vertical access impractical. Without qanats, 75 percent of Iran's arable lands would have been left fallow, leaving the desert's periphery scantly populated. Perfect brew, good dough, abundance It is best to enjoy qanats at their roaring or gurgling mouths while sipping tea brewed with their water. Tea helps us ascertain many important characteristics of the water, from alkalinity to mineral content. Tea reacts with all the elements in water and expresses them, making it a good evaluation tool. My father's business office in Tehran was in an old caravanserai, or caravan inn, near the city's bazaar. At its heart was a large courtyard protected by huge trees, surrounded by two stories of offices set behind deep arcades that cut off the rays of hot sunlight that made it through the thick foliage. Next to his office was that of a prominent tea merchant who stored most of his new arrivals in the courtyard. Between his wares and the Sharifabad qanat water, supplied daily in jugs, there was good tea every day. I learned quickly that water is 95 perfect of a perfect brew. It is hard to ruin tea if the water is right. Like memories of certain deserts, those of good tea are indelible. Spiritually, qanats are there to serve tea drinkers first, then for making sangak, with the overflow for agriculture, cooking, and drinking. Until the mid-1960s, qanats provided nearly 70 percent of Iran's irrigation needs, especially between April and November. In spring, rivers deliver snow melt from distant mountains in a short period that allows farmers to sow the first of their annual crops -- mostly table vegetables. Grains, cotton, and fall produce are planted in early and late summer and harvested in the fall, only possible with qanat water. Fruit orchards, too, are irrigated by surface water until late spring and then by qanat water on hot summer days into autumn. The winter solstice ritual of Yalda is incomplete without shinny clusters of split pomegranates and crisp melons. Yalda, which dates back at least 2,800 years, celebrates light's gradual triumph over darkness. Family and friends gather at an elder's house. The melons, symbolizing nature's perseverance, and pomegranates, fertility, keep kids awake deep into the night with sugar highs and abundant vitamin C, and adults as well, for other reasons. Pomegranate orchards require timely irrigation. Too much and they are tart, too little and their seeds shrivel and dry out. Uncontrolled rainfall is detrimental. Predictable qanat water allows irrigation according to plants' needs. For centuries, Iranians used qanats for properly raised produce to consume late into fall and winter. Nothingness to nothing For three months in 1962 we watched, along with two villages' worth of farmers, as a machine bore a 350-foot-deep hypodermic hole into the fertile soil of one of our farms. The promise of a cheap, endless supply of water offered by this Western miracle was intoxicating. It was the mantra of the engineers and workers of the deep-well company. The engineers were from British Leyland, a large engine manufacturer. Their words were like music: no need to maintain the qanats any longer. Water would be had, effortlessly, eternally. That no one would be needed to take care of the qanats suggested that the land owner would no longer be important. "You can be independent" would be the slogan today, but back then, it didn't mean much to a tenant farmer. Anyhow, the seed was planted that qanats, and therefore the land owner, were dispensable. Technology was here to rescue and to free. Technology hit water at 350 feet. A huge engine was bolted atop a nine-foot-high concrete foundation buried seven feet in the ground. Probably that was to keep the engine from deserting its eternal chore of chugging up water 350 feet. Around 1 a.m. some morning in July, its roar rose. Most animals and smart villagers had been fast asleep. A few insects were out to enjoy the cool moisture of the night and the symphony of the owls. To the naked eye, the stars were just as they had been the previous night and probably very much as when the first qanats were being built. Then the dogs who had been sleeping started to howl, perhaps expressing their thanks to the diesel engine for waking them up to such a spectacular heavenly display. Or maybe they were just expressing the sorts of things people articulate to noisy neighbors at 1 a.m. Certainly, that roar was not a sound made for the night. Nights are made to be filled with the sounds of insects and a few lonely guard dog howls. Most animals know that. Our intelligence leads us to ignore natural rules, unwisely. The engine's roar was blinding, loud, and insistent. You wanted to shut your eyes in fear of it blowing up from the pain to which it was giving voice. When finally water gushed out, it flew right across the concrete basin that was built to catch it and overshot its far edge by yards. The engine's noise drowned the jubilant cries of the farmers who had stayed up in anticipation of this transformational moment, a pantomime celebration with the 1,650 RPM diesel drone as background. My sleepless dreams of unending water were appended by another -- endless fumes, vibration, and the engine's incessant moan. I'd seen Tarzan cover his ears near deafening waterfalls. This did not feel at all the same. This was, somehow, unnatural. Nothing like a qanat, delivering in soothing gurgles or enlivening roars that began ages ago and would continue for eons. The engine was making a big deal of doing what qanats did with natural elegance. Water for nothing. But the new god was noisy and smoky. Donkeys in the area started taking roundabout paths, skirting the clangorous beast. The roar of the engine masked the chirping, cawing, and cooing of early morning sparrows, crows, and doves, and let pass unnoticed the cessation of the nightsong of the owls and insects. I bolted up just before noon, puzzled to find myself in a heated debate with no one about the "thing." I walked the few hundred yards from our makeshift camp of mosquito nets to the well. The mechanics were offering more diesel fuel to it and trying to adjust its operating temperature, hoping to reduce its fumes. The temperature seemed to have risen twice as fast as the sun. It does so on high plains, jumping from chilly at dawn to sweltering by midmorning on the way to a searing noon. A cycle, nonetheless, essential for crisp, sweet melons, aromatic tarragon, succulent peaches, and strong cotton yarn. A few farmers were wading in the crater made by the gushing water. In a rush to counter the heat, I jumped in too. If 12-year-olds could have heart attacks, I would have had one then. The water was just above freezing -- like qanat water. The roar of the engine spared me the laughter of those used to bathing in qanat water, and I took the sight of their suddenly exposed teeth as grateful smiles. At least there was one similarity with a qanat. The water was seriously cold. Someone had caught a blind fish -- or, I should say, an eyeless fish. It had been dragged from the depths without getting mangled in the turbine. It was alive, up here, in bright sunlight, far above its home. There was absolutely no way to "throw it back." An ugly sight. I felt a familiar shudder, another "end of age" feeling. The tea brewed with that water was not good. My mother explained that the water had more calcium and manganese than is good for tea. Oh well, I thought, at least the plants wouldn't care, and so it was a reasonable compromise to improve the farmers' living standards. After all, the Sharifabad qanat was just a few kilometers away. But the plants did notice the excess manganese. They were accustomed to an environment where nature had relegated redundant minerals to strata below where they rooted. After a few years, specially formulated fertilizer was required. Even plants know better. Peace across the world We proceeded with the wells, unaware of their true context. As we experienced poor results during the following decades, we blamed ourselves for the unwise use of technology whose consequences no one could have predicted. Not so. For several years, culminating in May 1967, hundreds of people from around the world, each in some way involved with water, had researched and prepared studies to bring to Washington, D.C., to share at the ironically named International Conference on Water for Peace. Their reports are recorded in the conference's eight-volume, 11,000-page proceedings: evidence for the claims made here. It takes little browsing in the reports to make clear that any ignorance of the technological and political consequences was feigned. The attendees were knowledgeable of the conditions, the options, and the vulnerabilities of the system. The geologists, mineralogists, hydrologists, economists, agronomists, physicists, and politicians also understood the critical role of water in every part of the world and the specific role of qanats in Iran. Surprisingly, one finds detailed and comprehensive studies of the alluvial layers in the aprons of major and minor mountain ranges enclosing Iran's central desert. It is clear that everyone knew the qanats were a natural way of discharging these reservoirs without damage or depletion. It was understood, through experience in other corners of the globe, that drawing rapidly from such underground formations would alter their geology and in most cases clog the pores through which water percolated and collected. The proper balance between that made available for human use and that left for feeding the teeming ecology at the desert's periphery, which had kept desertification in check, was known and well comprehended. No one can hide behind "Well, we didn't know." Satisfying an induced thirst Fifteen more deepwater wells were dug on our different lands by September 1968, when I got on a Lufthansa flight to Boston via Cairo, Frankfurt, and New York. Rushing west with the thirst to master electric distribution networks to help electrify the lives of all the remote farmers I peered down upon from seat 15A, I was unaware that a conference the year before would result in changes beyond anyone's dreams. The eight-millennia-long miracle of human ingenuity had allowed a rich life to develop on an otherwise vast, forlorn plateau, a tiny part of which was then visible from my sealed porthole. Shortly after takeoff, I sensed a tingling incongruity. Gazing down on dark green patches struggling to distinguish themselves from the barren land around them in the early morning light, my goal seemed pathetic. Electricity would not improve much; it could even make this landscape freakish -- artificial lights burning all night where there was meant to be darkness, coolness, with little but the aural traces of insects chasing their mates. Perhaps it was just a pang of nostalgia at 35,000 feet, or perhaps a spark of rationality. How much does an 18-year-old know about life? Ashamed, I poked in the pocket in front of me to find something distracting. Most of the water that Khayyam and Khwarizmi drank and with which they irrigated their vineyards while developing their notions of nothingness and zero came from qanats. Thus they laid the foundations of modern mathematics and science, and hence, technology, whose products were eventually used to subvert the system that had nurtured them. In a Persian poetic parable, a dying eagle's glance follows the length of an arrow that has pierced its breast up to its terminus where, through dimming eyes, it notices eagle feathers used to stabilize the arrow's deadly trajectory. How would Khayyam or Khwarizmi regard the trajectory of turbines from where they pierce the earth to their terminus in aquifers deep below? From zero to nothingness in a few short centuries. For several decades, these events have prompted nightmarish visions that seem incoherent, yet related. Mindless embrace of technology? Foolish land redistribution? Coincidences? Benign stupidity? Lack of foresight? Even nightmares have bases. But there was no proof, just speculations. The proceedings of the Water for Peace conference changed all that.
