Teachings
Teachings of Joseph Smith, taken from the Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith.
On Experience Through Suffering:
If thou art called to pass through tribulations; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea; if thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb; and if thou shouldest be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep, if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all; art thou greater than he?
On Justice of the Great Lawgiver:
But while one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; He views them as His offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men, causes "His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men, but, "according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil," or whether these deeds were done in England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India. He will judge them, "not according to what they have not, but according to what they have," those who have lived without law, will be judged without law, and those who have a law, will be judged by that law. We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of the Great Jehovah; He will award judgment or mercy to all nations according to their several deserts, their means of obtaining intelligence, the laws by which they are governed, the facilities afforded them of obtaining correct information, and His inscrutable designs in relation to the human family; and when the designs of God shall be made manifest, and the curtain of futurity be withdrawn, we shall all of us eventually have to confess that the Judge of all the earth has done right.
Prophecies
A majority of the prophecies and revelations that Joseph Smith received are recorded in a book called The Doctrine and Covenants, viewed by the Latter-day Saints as a cannon of scripture.
A Prophecy on the Civil War
One of the more interesting revelations therein, received in 1832, Joseph Smith prophesies of specific events that would later be called the Civil War. As recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants:
Revelation and prophecy on war, given through Joseph Smith, December 25, 1832. History of the Church 1:301-2.
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls;
2 And the time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at this place.
3 For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations.
4 And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war.
5 And it shall come to pass also that the remnants who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation.
6 And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations;
7 That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.
8 Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. Amen.
The Word of Wisdom
Joseph Smith also received a revelation in 1833 outlining a code of health called the Word of Wisdom. According to a study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, LDS Church members who follow the principles contained in the Word of Wisdom have one of the lowest death rates in the United States from cancer and cardiovascular diseases  about half that of the general population.

Gox’s missing money prompt regulation on Bitcoin? +1 EMAILLISTEN http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/rss/media/2010/09/08/20100908_gop.mp3SEE PODCASTSTRANSCRIPTGWEN IFILL: Now, for a Republican view of the president’s speech and his proposals, we turn to Illinois Congressman Peter Roskam. He serves as a Republican deputy whip and is helping to shape the Republican policy agenda for the fall elections. Welcome, Congressman. REP. PETER ROSKAM (R-Ill.): Thank you. GWEN IFILL: We just heard Secretary Geithner say that, but for the actions of the Obama administration, things would be much, much worse; we would — might perhaps be heading toward a depression.Do you disagree with that? REP. PETER ROSKAM: I do. I think that is an overstatement. I think, in fairness to the president, he inherited a difficult economic situation. There’s no doubt about that. Secretary Geithner was sort of arguing in the alternative. He was referring in some cases to the actions that took place in fall of 2008, with the intervention of the TARP, and then some to stimulus argument. But I think, ultimately, we will never know where the economy would have been. But we do know where the economy is right now. And the economy is at a place that the administration told us we would never see. Secretary Geithner and other members of the administration said that unemployment would peak at 8 percent, just declaratively, if only the stimulus bill would be passed. And to use the secretary’s own words, a minute ago, he said that now President Obama has put forth the smartest, most sensible policies. Well, we have seen that rhetoric before, and it’s clearly underperformed. And I think the American public and I know a whole host of businesses in my district are interested in a different pathway. GWEN IFILL: One of the policies the president is — was — was selling today out in Ohio was this notion that the Bush era tax cuts should end right now, something even some of his advisers have disagreed with him on. What is your view on that? REP. PETER ROSKAM: Well, Peter Orszag, who is his budget chief who is leaving, and also Dr. Christina Romer, as you pointed out, who heads up his — is the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, have both essentially said raising taxes at this point isn’t helpful. And where I disagree with the president is the notion of, somehow, not extending the ’01 and ’03 tax cuts for everybody along the line, the president is basically saying, well, we’re going to do the class-envy play. And I say, ultimately, you know, you look at 94 percent of small businesses that file under the individual tax rate, this is going to have an adverse impact on them. So, I just don’t think that the president’s approach so far has created the environment where companies want to get in and invest. And I think he would be well served and we all would be well served if he changed his position and said we’re going to extend those and make them more predictable for everybody. GWEN IFILL: Well, what Peter Orszag said was, they should be extended for two years and then ended, correct? REP. PETER ROSKAM: Yes, that’s right. That’s right. GWEN IFILL: But you talk about the class-envy play. The president has also proposed kind of a — they’re not using the word stimulus, but additional spending, for tax credits for business. That doesn’t balance this out, in your view? REP. PETER ROSKAM: Well, think about it from the president’s point of view. He is actually arguing in the alternative. On the one hand, he’s saying that putting more business — more money in the part of business’ hands through the expensing and through the research and development tax credit, making that permanent, that’s a good thing. But, then, by the same token, why in the very same bill would you then take — take tax dollars away from the very entities that you’re trying to induce to go further and more robustly into the marketplace?I think the president’s approach is internally inconsistent. If you want to create predictability, which is what I’m hearing from small businesses in my district, then make the tax cuts permanent, get control on the spendingside, which actually has an adverse impact on long-term economic growth — and that’s from testimony before President Obama’s own debt commission — do those types of things, and signal to the marketplace that you’re serious about a restrained government, instead of an expansive government. We have seen where expansive government leads. It leads to a nagging unemployment rate of about 10 percent. GWEN IFILL: So, a couple of things the president and his advisers have been saying in past days about the economy. One is that, by continuing these tax cuts, you’re putting the economy in a $700 billion hole. That number keeps coming back. We heard Secretary Geithner say it. And they also said that what the Republicans want to do is hold middle-class tax cuts hostage. Your chance to respond. REP. PETER ROSKAM: Well, we don’t — no, we certainly don’t want to hold middle-class tax cuts hostage. In fact, we’re strong advocates of middle-class tax cuts and for tax cuts for those that are in the lower end of the economic spectrum. But this argument that you mentioned a minute ago is actually coming from an administration and a congressional majority and a secretary of the treasury that have guided our pathway to tripling our national debt in 10 years. You know, nondiscretionary, nondefense spending under President Obama and Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid have — have gone up 84 percent. Now, those types of numbers are staggering. But I just think it’s ironic that the very group that has been pushing the outer edge of the envelope from a spending point of view are now sort of wringing their hands, saying, this costs too much. And only in Washington, D.C., can you come up with a mentality that says that allowing individuals and companies who have earned money to keep their money is a cost. I just don’t think it’s selling right now. GWEN IFILL: Let’s talk about solutions for a moment. We have — you have also heard the president go around the country and say, you know, Republicans, if I told them the sky was blue, they would tell me that it wasn’t, that they only are the party of no. What are your solutions? REP. PETER ROSKAM: Well, I think we’re clearly not the party of no. In fact, there was an alternative to the stimulus that was offered back in the beginning of 2009 that, using, again, Dr. Christina Romer’s own peer-reviewed research, would have created twice the jobs at half the cost. There was an alternative to the health care plan that would have brought costs down. There was an alternative to cap and trade as it relates to energy, a better budget and so forth. But that’s all in the past. Moving forward, what are our ideas? First and foremost, create predictability within the marketplace. All of this ambiguity has created so much tension, that businesses, and small business in particular, which is the real job creator, is saying, you know what, I’m going to sit still. I don’t know what the ground rules are, and I want to know what the ground rules are moving forward. So, our idea — we talked about it — is to make the tax cuts permanent, first and foremost, secondly, get control on the regulatory side. I was in a meeting today with health — with a business not five miles from this studio in northChicago. And they have said: We don’t know how much health care is going to cost us next year, and, as a result, we’re reluctant to bring new people on, because we don’t know what the regulations are going to lead to. And then, finally, from a spending point of view — and I referenced this a second ago — spending that is out of control actually has a drag on the economy. A University of Maryland researcher recently testified before thepresident’s commission and said, once you get above 90 percent on the debt-to-GDP ratio, once you trigger that number, then it costs you a million jobs a year. Well, we’re now at a 93 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. So, John Boehner is correct when he’s making the argument that, when you restrain spending, actually, that has a buoyancy to the economy. So, in a nutshell, those would be the things that we would concentrate on, first and foremost, not just moving on, on a bigger spending agenda. GWEN IFILL: Well, let’s separate that out a bit. You talked about two things generally there. One is job creation and how you do that. And this president has one theory about it. You have another. And the other is deficit concerns. Let’s separate them out. We know what the complaints are. But how do you — what would you do that would be different from what the president is talking about doing? There’s a lot on which you — there’s some on which you agree, I imagine. REP. PETER ROSKAM: Yes, I think so. I mean, we have seen what the president’s plan has brought us. I mean, we have — so, let’s be clear about that. There’s really nobody, I mean, except for Secretary Geithner, that is saying that the economy has this really solid footing right now. Most people are looking at the economy, and they’re feeling very, very tepid about it and very concerned. So, we — we know that the borrow-and-spend mythology that says we’re going to create prosperity that way, that’s a falsehood. Now, the problem is, in my view, President Obama and his leadership has basically said, we’re going to continue on that pathway, in some ways. So, I don’t think you can borrow anymore, without getting right on the edge of a Greek debt crisis. Now, as it relates to the deficit question…GWEN IFILL: What can you do? What can you do? I guess I’m trying to get past the ways in which the secretary is wrong…REP. PETER ROSKAM: From a jobs point of view?GWEN IFILL: … on the ways in which you would fix it. REP. PETER ROSKAM: Well, from a jobs point of view, I would go back to creating certainty in the marketplace through tax policy, through restraining spending that actually, as I have argued, has a buoyant effect on the economy, when it’s under control, and then, finally, bringing more predictability as it relates to health care. Think, for example, for the impact that the health care bill has on the economy. We were told throughout the debate that this was going to bend the cost curve. We all remember that sort of language. But, ultimately, it turned out not to be true. The Congressional Budget Office, a whole host of other third-party and nonpartisan groups have looked at this and said, actually, health care costs are going to be going up. That’s not the direction that we need to be going in this country. And, unfortunately, not withstanding the president’s rhetoric and sort of the full campaign mode that he’s in right now, the reality is that businesses are looking out at this environment and largely looking at anti-business rhetoric that seems to be coming from Washington, D.C.I think we can change that fairly quickly. I’m not saying it’s easy. I’m not saying it’s simplistic, but I am saying it is straightforward. GWEN IFILL: Congressman Peter Roskam of Illinois, Republican, thank you so much. REP. PETER ROSKAM: Thank you.

The opposition last week was lower than it was this week. So, despite a week of making the case, the public is moving the other direction. And it seems that the biggest factor behind it is not that the arguments for aren’t necessarily persuasive, but that the arguments against are really weighing heavily on people.53381Obama Admits He May Never Gain American Support for MilitaryPresident Barack Obama told PBS NewsHour's Gwen Ifill Mondaythat he favors diplomacy to a military strike against Syria and that he isencouraged that the U.S. can work with the Bashar al-Assad regime's allies,Russia and Iran, to find a diplomatic solution.2013-09-09 18:41:00disabledhideQf57u7BPLKUtrueRelated VideoAnd that is the concern that a U.S. military effort in Af — in Syria — excuse me — could lead to unforeseen results that are bad for United States, whether it’s our allies in the region, whether it’s militarily. There’s a concern that this could do more harm than good, and that case, I don’t think, has been made to people yet.GWEN IFILL: Jennifer, tell me what your numbers show in your poll that is out this afternoon.JENNIFER AGIESTA, Associated Press: We’re finding actually that the arguments that have been made in favor of going to — of taking military action in Syria are really not convincing the American public.Only one in five say that they believe it’s extreme likely that an attack would deter other world leaders from using chemical weapons. And many say that they think any involvement would lead to a long-term commitment of military forces. And those opinions are generally consistent across party lines, which is somewhat surprising an on issue such as this.GWEN IFILL: Did your numbers add up with that, Michael?MICHAEL DIMOCK: To some extent.People — six in 10 people in our survey said they believe the U.S. needs to take some kind of action in response to the use of chemical weapons, but among those people, fewer than half favor airstrikes in Syria. They would like to see a different action.Some response sits in their mind as important, but it’s not this one.GWEN IFILL: Is there a moral distinction that people draw in your answer to what should move the U.S. to action?JENNIFER AGIESTA: We haven’t really seen necessarily a moral distinction in our poll.It’s more a resistance to getting involved in another military conflict and having that turn into a longer-term commitment.GWEN IFILL: How about the idea of chemical weapons being this red line, this tipping point? Are people persuaded by this argument?JENNIFER AGIESTA: They seem not to be.As I said, very few believe that a military strike will dissuade other leaders from using them in the future. And so that argument against it, that argument for why that is a red line, is not breaking through to the American public.GWEN IFILL: Michael?MICHAEL DIMOCK: And one argument that has not settled in at all that we tested was this case that doing nothing would challenge America’s credibility in foreign policy. That’s not an argument that is really persuading a lot of Americans.GWEN IFILL: What does this do for the president’s standing? You heard what the president said about this. He doesn’t expect to win over everyone on this matter, but he clearly is being tested on it.JENNIFER AGIESTA: His disapproval for handling the situation in Syria has actually risen, according to our poll.(CROSSTALK)GWEN IFILL: Over what period of time?JENNIFER AGIESTA: In June 2012, 43 percent said they disapproved of his handling of Syria. And that has risen to now a majority say they disapprove of the way he is handling it.He does still have the support of Democrats in his handling of the situation, but it has completely fallen off among Republicans and independents.MICHAEL DIMOCK: Yes.GWEN IFILL: Have you…(CROSSTALK)MICHAEL DIMOCK: I agree. We’re seeing a very similar thing.His overall approval has moved back into negative territory for the first time in our polling in over a year-and-a-half. And it’s undoubtedly related to concerns or reservations about this policy. But he does still have pretty good support within his base.Even though a majority of Democrats are against taking military action in Syria, his support among Democrats seems to be strong right now, and also among other key groups like African-Americans, minorities.GWEN IFILL: The president, I asked him whether he would do this again, go to Congress to have them debate it. He said, absolutely.Is this something that Americans support, the idea that basically handed over his executive power in this matter, that he says is his executive power, to Congress?MICHAEL DIMOCK: Yes. I think most polls suggest that the idea of bringing it to Congress is very popular. There’s kind of a why-not factor in the public’s mind, and getting more people involved isn’t necessarily a bad thing, at least at first.Now, how long it drags out could have some effect on that attitude, I think. And we found that, by 2-1, people are of the view right now that whatever Congress says should be decisive here. If Congress says no, they get to make the final call. That’s sort of the leaning opinion right now for the public.GWEN IFILL: Jennifer, you’re hearing that, too, that even if Congress were to vote against the president, the idea that he might overrule them at this point is not an option?JENNIFER AGIESTA: Yes, I believe that that is the case in the polling.And our question, we asked whether people preferred for Congress to vote for or against the resolution to use force, and found that six in 10 said they believe that Congress should vote against it.GWEN IFILL: Is this something that — is there a connection between that and then what we were hearing? Because, sometimes, it seems like it’s anecdotal or that it’s an organized opposition. But what you’re saying in the numbers and your polling and your surveys is that this goes deeper than just the organized opposition?JENNIFER AGIESTA: Yes, I believe it does. It crosses party lines. It crosses most of the demographic lines that usually divide the public on most political issues. It’s a pretty consistent opinion across the board.MICHAEL DIMOCK: Yes. And the strength of opinion runs very much against getting involved in Syria militarily by about 3-1; 45 percent of the people we interviewed over the weekend strongly oppose this action. Only 16 percent strongly favor it.So, that’s how you can get that tilt in the e-mails and letters and phone calls members are getting.GWEN IFILL: And the president speaks tomorrow night. Are people listening for that? Can they still be persuaded? Do they seem persuadable?MICHAEL DIMOCK: Well, a week ago, a quarter of the people we interviewed said they were not sure what we should so. That shrunk to 9 percent in the current poll. So a case could be made this is a conversation, the direct conversation, he probably should have had a little earlier.But most of the people we talk to, whether they favor or oppose it right now, do seem ambivalent about it. Supporters of it do worry about the risks that it could have for future security. Opponents of it, many of them do understand the need to respond to the kind of red line argument, so there is some ambivalence he could work with.GWEN IFILL: OK. Jen Agiesta and Michael Dimock, thank you both so much.MICHAEL DIMOCK: Thank you.JENNIFER AGIESTA: Thank you.JUDY WOODRUFF: And amid the opposition among the public and in Congress, there was word this evening that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has delayed a test vote on authorizing military force. He said it wouldn’t help to vote on military action while diplomatic efforts continue.

Synopsis
In September 2002, three skinheads were roaming a park in Rheims, France, looking to "do an Arab," when they settled for a gay man instead. Twenty-nine-year-old François Chenu fought back fiercely, but he was beaten unconscious and thrown into a river, where he drowned. The acclaimed French vérité film Beyond Hatred is the story of the crime's aftermath; above all, of the Chenu family's brave and heartrending struggle to seek justice while trying to make sense of such pointless violence and unbearable loss. With remarkable dignity, they fight to transcend hatred and the inevitable desire for revenge.

Lead-up to Labor Day May Determine Winner of Presidential Race By Dan Balz, Washington Post The intensity of the initial skirmishes in the campaign between President Obama and Mitt Romney underscores a new reality about presidential politics.

A Presidential Hangout: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Clubhouse By Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, TIME You would never take a second glance at 716 Jackson Place if you were strolling through the neighborhood around the White House and Lafayette Park in Washington, D.C. But the unmarked, four-story, white-painted townhouse with brown sandstone steps is easily the most exclusive club on the planet. You have to call the White House for reservations — and at the moment, only four men are eligible to use it.Read More

Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney: Self-Restraint in an Age of Rage By John F. Harris, Politico American politics has become so angry and divisive that it favors candidates who appeal to extremists and eccentrics, and even are extremist and eccentric themselves. The nonstop circus of modern campaigns, meanwhile, has left the county’s most accomplished and capable people on the sidelines, with scant interest in running for office. Or so the argument goes. But something strange—or rather something normal—is happening in 2012.Read More

How the World's Most Exclusive Club Was Born By Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, TIME It was one of those moments that, in a mere second or two, changed American history: On January 20, 1953, at the inauguration of President Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman greeted Herbert Hoover on the platform. "I think we ought to organize a former presidents club," Hoover suggested. "Fine," Truman replied. "You be the President of the club. And I will be the Secretary." Up to that moment, the Presidents Club was more an idea than an institution.Read More

Ann Romney Tweets; What Would Hillary Do? By Beth Reinhard, National Journal You've come a long way, baby?

This was a wonderful classic episode that I faintly remember around the time it premiered. After just seeing it now everything just came back to me, thanks to some familiar scenes that I specifically remember from this episode and the unmistakable voice of George Page, the initiating voice of NATURE!
Mary Price
By chance this evening, I found this remarkable show about the ring-tailed lemurs. I saw it years ago and fell in love with these animals. I remember, also, a clip showing the various lemurs’ faces, painted by a skilled aritist. The idea seemed to be that lemurs could communicate by showing each other their facial markings. I’d like to see that clip again. Thank you for all of your wonderful shows.
Jeff Schwartz
Sometimes, Mother Nature is just not fair – sometimes she is just brutal!! This is the reason that I could NEVER do this – I would have helped!! I would have taken them to a vet – (if one even exists) – or done something to at least try to help them survive!! What a truly remarkable documentary!!!!!!!
Ken Ozyuk
A fascinating program.
Ray Marak
I have always been fascinated with lemurs and hold a B.S. & M.S. in Biology. Right after 911 I flew out to San Francisco to visit some friends for New Years. They wanted to go to a club which I believe was called Universe and for some reason that evening they had a wildlife or zoo theme. When I saw they had a lemur I made a “bee-line” path to get to the lady who’s shoulders the lemur was sitting on. I don’t even think she was in an area that most people could get to. Be that as it may I talked with her for about an hour the best I could over the extremely loud music. I asked her about that as the lemur didn’t seem phased at all by all the club music blaring. She eventually let me hold the lemur and I remember it crawling all over me. Of course I am geek and loved every minute of me and was the highlight of my New Years eve and trip out to California. I just find them extremely fascinating and enjoyed this video, even the sad parts about Saphire and the hyper-active baby lemur: we can’t fight nature and life & death are going to happen. Thanks again. I just love Nature.

This episode of Nature entitled, “A Lemur’s Tale” will not play because of an error message that says, ‘This video is not currently available’. I remember seeing this episode when it premiered in February, 1997, and I would love to see it again. Is there anything you can do to make this video playable? Please reply as to what the problem is, and when it will again be available.
Thanks,
