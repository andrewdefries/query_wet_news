"I thought maybe I’ll make one big table piece using all of the collectibles and get them all out of my life at the same time...make a table piece that’s basically about the United States as a whole and use popular culture tchotchkes from around the United States. They’d all be talking to each other, all having these interactions...I decided to intersperse it with milk glass...there's something about this stuff. I also envision having a larger figure here and there, overlooking the whole scenario."

All around Atlanta, thousands of people got stranded overnight in a mass exodus to get home early. Countless wrecks, including jack-knifed trucks, ground traffic to a halt in icy gridlock. Hundreds of students spent the night on school buses.Ray Henry of the Associated Press in Atlanta says others faced their own unique dilemmas because of the weather conditions. We spoke this afternoon via Skype.RAY HENRY, Associated Press: One woman actually ended up giving birth, was en route to a hospital, basically got stuck on an interstate and delivered a healthy child. So, that’s very good.Other people were running out of gas after sitting in traffic that was basically just stalled for six, seven hours. Several people needed to — or many people needed to be picked up by National Guard Humvees and brought into sort of warming stations or shelters. It’s pretty messy out there.JEFFREY BROWN: And some people took to social media, including this snowed-out Atlanta Facebook page, to offer and request supplies and shelter.RAY HENRY: It seems like a lot of useful info was communicated. People were able to get tips about warming shelters. Local churches were advertising that they were opening their doors along routes. People were even advertising, hey, I got a house near the highway and some guest bedrooms, and people are welcome to come stay.Some people were even talking about shuttling to gas to those had just basically run out to kind of keep them going. It was interesting to watch. It seems like at least in some parts it was effective.JEFFREY BROWN: McKenzie Dunn was one of those stranded.MCKENZIE DUNN, stranded motorist: I don’t think they were prepared for it, which kind of irks me, because it happened two years ago.JEFFREY BROWN: It didn’t help that Atlanta’s mayor, Kasim Reed, had tweeted yesterday morning that his city was ready for the storm.MAYOR KASIM REED, D-Atlanta: We’re not sitting around twiddling our thumbs.JEFFREY BROWN: Today, Reed defended the snow response, but also offered something of a mea culpa.KASIM REED: And 120 pieces of state equipment have been mobilized. The National Guard has been mobilized. The city of Atlanta has been running 12-hour shifts. We have been running our spreaders and sanders nonstop.The issue is — and people are going to stop feeling frustration when we get people out of cars on the interstates. And I will take credit for — I will take credit or blame for my statement. We made a mistake by not staggering when people should leave. So I will take responsibility for that.JEFFREY BROWN: Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said the state didn’t deploy its trucks and plows earlier because it wasn’t clear where the snow was going.GOV. NATHAN DEAL R-Ga.: The National Weather Service had continually had their modeling showing that the city of Atlanta wouldn’t be the primary area where the storm would hit, that it would be south of Atlanta. I don’t blame anyone. Mother Nature has a mind of its own, and it does what it chooses to do.And even with the best of forecasting, I don’t think anyone could have totally predicted that was going to have the magnitude within the short window of time in which it occurred.JEFFREY BROWN: All of the children stuck on school buses were rescued by this afternoon. Others had hunkered down last night in their schools, and officials spent the day trying to get them home safely.GOV. NATHAN DEAL: We are having the National Guard and the state troopers working, and the National Guard will provide lead vehicles as the school buses make their routes to return those children back to their homes.JEFFREY BROWN: The A.P.’s Ray Henry says private citizens have also pitched in.RAY HENRY: The storms also brought out some good sides of people.For example, Home Depot stores regionally had basically just opened their doors for people stuck on the interstate. There are a lot of stories about people helping out one another, for example, opening up homes, guest bedrooms to people who were stuck. One person that the staff interviewed today basically had his own private Humvee and was making sort of runs to pick up people who were stranded on the interstate. So there has definitely been some testiness, but there’s also sort of been some Southern graciousness.JEFFREY BROWN: Ice and snow also made for treacherous travel in Central Alabama, where more stalled and abandoned vehicles littered the highways.YOLANDA SMILEY, stranded motorist: We ended up coming down here.MAN: And we don’t have no way home,YOLANDA SMILEY: No way home. Yellow Cab won’t come and get us, so we’re hoping that my brother-in-law can make it and come and get us. And they need to put some sand and some salt on these streets.JEFFREY BROWN: Overall, emergencies were declared in six states to help expedite much-needed crews and supplies for extensive cleanup efforts.MAN: I hope this is over with soon. I have had enough winter.JEFFREY BROWN: There was hope for a bit of a respite. Forecasters said temperatures in the South will gradually warm in the days ahead.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the reporters on Friday to answer questions about their sources and to provide Lee’s attorneys with notes and other documents from their newsgathering.Lee is suing the U.S. Energy Department and Justice Department, alleging government officials supplied reporters with private information about him and suggested he was a suspect in an investigation into the possible theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the Associated Press reported.Jackson ruled that, in this particular case, the First Amendment principle that typically protects journalists from having to reveal confidential sources was outweighed by the greater importance for Lee’s right to obtain possible evidence of government leaks.The judge did not set a deadline for the reporters’ compliance.Lee was indicted in December 1999 on 59 felony counts accusing him of mishandling nuclear weapons information. He spent nearly nine months in solitary confinement, then was released in September 2000 after pleading guilty to a single felony count.In his ruling, Jackson apologized to Lee, saying the case “embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it.”The journalists ordered to give depositions are New York Times reporters James Risen and Jeff Gerth; Los Angeles Times’ Robert Drogin; H. Josef Hebert of the Associated Press; and Pierre Thomas, formerly of CNN, now with ABC.New York Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said the newspaper would appeal.“We continue to believe that protection of journalists’ confidential sources is essential to providing the public with important information. We expect to seek an appeal,” Mathis said in a press statement.Dave Tomlin, the AP’s assistant general counsel, said his organization was still deciding whether to appeal the order.“Before the First Amendment lets you compel reporters to reveal sources, we think you have to do more than get a small handful of government officials to shrug their shoulders and claim they don’t know or can’t remember,” Tomlin said.A lawyer for the LA Times, Lee Levine, said the newspaper had not decided its course of action, The New York Times reported.Charles Tobin, an attorney for former CNN reporter Pierre Thomas, told The Washington Post that Thomas was “disappointed” by Jackson’s ruling and they were still weighing their options.If the reporters do not comply with Jackson’s order, they could face fines or be imprisoned for contempt of court.Lucy Dalglish, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told the AP, “I think it would be highly unusual if the order stands, and secondly if it stands I would be very, very surprised if the reporters complied with it.”An attorney for Lee, Frank Volpe, told the AP he had not seen Jackson’s order, but said he assumed the news organizations would appeal.Only one journalist, Ian Hoffman, formerly of the Albuquerque Journal, has agreed to answer questions from Lee’s attorneys, but said he would not reveal the names of anonymous sources, The Washington Post reported.Hoffman told The Washington Post that he agreed to do so only because a government official he had quoted in an article about Lee denied ever speaking with Hoffman.“In circumstances such as that, we needed to break with tradition and address it,” Hoffman told Washington Post reporter R. Jeffrey Smith in an interview.In March 1999, The New York Times was widely credited for initially breaking the Chinese espionage story. But, by the following September, the paper issued a lengthy editor’s note, acknowledging there were “things we wish we had done differently … to give Dr. Lee the full benefit of the doubt.” SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERLaw Media wen ho lee Are you aware of our comment policy?Beginning October 24, 2012, PBS NewsHour will allow open commenting for all registered users.
