PBS Hollywood Presents: The Old Settler - In-Depth Interviews - The Director of Photography
Setting Up the Shots
"I usually do storyboards, but in this show we didn't. We jumped right in because Debbie knows what she wants. She can express it. She understands the technology and she understands how to tell a story. She knows lenses. She can call out a lens size in millimeters. A lot of directors have problems getting on the other side of a stage line, jumping to the other side of the room during the scene. She has absolutely no problem with that."
"Debbie has a real visual sense. And since we've been working together for almost twenty years it's pretty easy for us to get on the same page.""In this case, the play is very different from a film. You don't visually see what's happening. And once we got the film script in our hands, even then it was quite wordy. But even though I didn't see it on the page, I knew she knew what she wanted."
"Debbie is also a choreographer, so she makes the camera do a lot of things that you don't expect a director to ask for. So we do very long masters [in this case, with the camera on a dolly], and then we go back and clean them up, [shooting additional coverage to provide editing options].On a 4 x 8 piece of plywood the dolly that the camera's on might take twelve different positions [during the dolly move]. Which means sometimes we're moving the camera three inches, sometimes we're moving three feet. We can show the entire room on one 4 x 8 piece of wood!"

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: Well, I inherited them from my mother who recently passed away. And she started collecting antiques and folk art in the mid '60s when it wasn't very popular. And she's always loved her animals, so she kind of combined the love of animals and antiques with these kind of paintings.APPRAISER: Animals have been painted forever. In the 19th century, though, they took on two different styles of meaning. The first piece on the right of the "Fancy Rabbits" as the artist A.G. Simms calls them, is really a very sort of straightforward animal-as-animal portrait. And an interior scene with a lovely dish and just really sort of captures the feel of the animals. The other piece, the wonderful cat portrait by Charles Van den Eycken, is the style of 19th-century animal painting that's about the animal, but also mischievous behaviors that sometimes humans have as well. And Van den Eycken is a master of that style and medium. He was best known for his animal paintings, his cat paintings, and this is a really elaborate one with the mother cat and the kittens and the jewelry box and the still life. The painting just has everything and it's almost as if you could just reach in there and pick up one of those sweet, little kitties. Do you know what she paid?GUEST: Well, my mother purchased the "Fancy Rabbits" in 1967 for $85. And she paid... in 1962, $250 for the cats, and that was a lot of money back then. So she really loved it. APPRAISER: She did a wonderful job. Uh, the Simms I would value at probably between $2,000 and $4,000.GUEST: Oh, really?APPRAISER: But the really quintessential kitty painting and animal painting, the 19th-century view, is the Van den Eycken, and I would be putting that at between $15,000 and $25,000.GUEST: Really?APPRAISER: Oh, yes.GUEST: It's wonderful.APPRAISER: They're good kitties. I hope mine at home aren't doing that, though.

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: My husband bought it from a man who collects antiques.APPRAISER: And how long ago was that?GUEST: About four years ago. They told us that it came from Boston to Salt Lake in the 1900s. We use it as a stereo cabinet. APPRAISER: It's a nice stereo cabinet. Well, this is a classic, actually New York City, cabinet. And believe it or not, we can pretty strongly attribute this to a maker, which is kind of fun. GUEST: Really?APPRAISER: And it's sort of rare that we can attribute Victorian furniture. This is made about in the 1860s in America. GUEST: 1860s.APPRAISER: And it's a style we see a lot of on the ANTIQUES ROADSHOW. Victorian. We put it under the umbrella of Renaissance Revival. We see the Louis XVI style and some of the ormolu mounts here and these tapered columns. We see a neo-Greco sort of style here in these shells. And what do you think about that plaque? Do you like that? GUEST: It's beautiful.APPRAISER: Isn't that beautiful? GUEST: It is.APPRAISER: Well, we very rarely find Victorian cabinets like this with these porcelain plaques. And it's one of the reasons we know that this is made by a certain maker in New York named Pottier & Stymus-- two French gentlemen who came to New York and started making furniture in this incredible style. Contrasts: many different materials of porcelain, ormolu we see in the capitals here. Different types of wood like rosewood, mahogany, ebonized wood, giltwood. I mean, it's got everything imaginable. GUEST: A little of everything, yeah.APPRAISER: And that's one of the reasons we know it's by them. And not only that, but there's a documented cabinet that's in Providence, Rhode Island, in the governor's house, documented and signed by Pottier & Stymus. It's very closely related to this. Pottier & Stymus made some of the finest furniture made during the Victorian period, for families like the Rockefellers, and made furniture for the White House. GUEST: Wow.APPRAISER: Really, these were meant to be used as status symbols. GUEST: Really?APPRAISER: And they were pretty impressive. You had this in your drawing room or music room, and this platform would hold a vase, like a porcelain vase or a marble sculpture. GUEST: Right.APPRAISER: Now, um, how much did you pay for this piece, may I ask?GUEST: I think around $6,000, $7,000.APPRAISER: Well, based on sales of pieces like this, this is probably worth in the range of about $10,000 to $15,000, so... GUEST: Interesting. Pretty nice.APPRAISER: You have a nice stereo cabinet.GUEST: Yeah. I tell you.APPRAISER: So are you going to keep the stereo inside?GUEST: Oh, yeah, yeah, we are.APPRAISER: Oh, good. GUEST: Put it back where we had it.

About the Series
RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY delivers one-of-a-kind news coverage from around the nation and the world.
Since its debut in 1997, RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY has set itself apart from the mainstream media by providing distinctive, cutting-edge news coverage and analysis of national and international events in the ever-changing religious world. Hosted by veteran journalist Bob Abernethy and produced by Thirteen/WNET New York, the acclaimed one-of-a-kind TV show examines religion’s role — and the ethical dimensions — behind top news headlines.
Correspondents Saul Gonzalez, Fred de Sam Lazaro, Tim O’Brien, Deborah Potter, Betty Rollin, Lucky Severson and Judy Valente, along with managing editor Kim Lawton, travel around the nation and the globe to explore how issues of faith, religion and ethics shape both national and international events. Newsmakers, scholars and policy analysts also provide insightful perspectives in roundtable discussions from the show’s studio in Washington, DC.
Winner of more than 115 industry awards — including the Sigma Delta Chi, the Gracie Allen, the Chicago TV Fest, New York Festival and CINE Golden Eagle — the program has been hailed by the Religion Newswriters’ Association for setting “a national standard for balanced and fair coverage of religious topics.” Phil Mushnick with The New York Post says, “Week after week, R & E similarly delivers, helping restore one’s faith in, of all things, television.” And Charles Honey of The Grand Rapids Press writes, “As far as news stories go, there are none better.”
To complement the program’s weekly broadcast, RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY offers a Web site, pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics, and a companion viewers’ guide. The Web site features individual show transcripts, streaming video of weekly reports, full transcripts of interviews with notable guests, related articles dealing with significant issues in religion and ethics news, a list of related resources and an online pressroom featuring downloadable versions of the program press kit and quarterly newsletter, as well as detailed summaries of individual stories. Audio and video podcasts of the program are also available.
Major funding for RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY is provided by Lilly Endowment Inc. with additional support from Mutual of America Life Insurance Company and individual supporters.

“I find Abernethy and his team of correspondents so refreshing. They take a thoughtful, in-depth approach to religious issues often skimmed over or sensationalized by mass media . . . Abernethy and crew are reporting the depths of meaning millions find in faith amid chaos. As far as news stories go, there are none better.”
– GRAND RAPIDS PRESS
“Week after week, R & E similarly delivers, helping restore one’s faith in, of all things, television.”
– THE NEW YORK POST
“Religion is usually covered only as it pertains to other news stories . . . That’s what makes news ventures such as PBS’s RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY . . . all the more newsworthy.”
– TELEVISION WEEK
“RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY provides an important source of information to members of the general public who may not understand the nuances of the religious world that it reveals.”
– RELIGION NEWS SERVICE
“Anchored by an experienced, low-key TV newsman Bob Abernethy . . . RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY defies market expectations. The TV program and Web site . . . become a precious library for research.”
– NATIONAL CATHOLIC REPORTER
“RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY . . . has become a respected voice in the conversation about American religion and culture.”
– PUBLISHERS WEEKLY
“The show has become something of a blueprint for how to accurately report on religion.”
– THE DES MOINES REGISTER
