How do artists mine the past to explore the present? Why do some historical events shape the way we think today, and why have some been forgotten? In what ways do artists use their own histories to examine the human condition? In this episode, artists play with historical events, explore and expose commonly held assumptions about historic ‘truth’, and create narratives based on personal experiences.
Special Q&A with the artists: Leave a question for Mary Reid Kelley and Marina Abramović!

And Then One Night, The Making of Dead Man Walking: Creative Process: State of the Opera
State of the Opera
by Marc Scorca
The following essay was commissioned from Marc Scorca, President and CEO of Opera America. He was asked to reflect on the future of the opera, and to explain why, in his opinion, opera is still a successful form of cultural expression.
Contrary to popular belief, the opera audience has been getting younger and younger. Between 1982 and 1992, the U.S. opera audience
grew by almost 25 percent, according to the Survey of Public
Participation in the Arts, conducted by the National Endowment for
the Arts in association with the Bureau of the Census. This trend
continued through 1997, when opera's audience grew by another 12.5
percent, more than any other art form.
In fact, opera enthusiasts' numbers among audiences in the 18- to
24- year old age group have grown at a remarkable rate. Between 1982
and 1992, the number of 18- to 24- year-olds attending opera
performances in the US increased by 18 percent, even though the
number of individuals in that age category declined by 16 percent
during the same period. What are the reasons behind this explosion of
interest in opera? They are simultaneously surprising and
familiar.
Opera resonates with our brave new multimedia world.
Increasingly, the world around us requires us to deal with words,
sounds, and pictures all at the same time. Opera is growing in North
America because of its unique resonance with the contemporary
multimedia aesthetic. When we watch and listen to the news on
television, we read sports scores or weather reports across the
bottom of the screen, usually while talking on the telephone. This
multimedia world provides a training ground for the
aesthetic complexity of opera.
Opera has become infused into the popular culture.
We are surrounded by the sounds of opera. Academy-award winning
movies have woven opera excerpts into their stories as important
thematic elements. Popular artists such as Aretha Franklin and
Michael Bolton have added opera music to their repertoire.
Innumerable television commercials have used opera music and settings
in recent years to sell their products, bringing the sound of the art
form to millions of people who otherwise might never think of
listening to it. In addition, groups like The Three Tenors, composed
of Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carrera and Placido Domingo, have sold
millions of records and taken opera to arenas never before expected,
like Dodger Stadium.
Projected and seatback translations have overcome the
language barrier.
Opera is truly an international art, and more and more opera
companies are choosing to perform the classics in their original
language. Not a problem: Surtitles and seat-back translations have
become so ubiquitous that any opera-goer  newcomer or
aficionado  can enjoy an opera without the barrier of a foreign
language.
Trends in contemporary American composition are more
accessible to audiences.
Whereas contemporary music used to be characterized as dissonant
and challenging to the average listener, today's composers are
creating scores that are being received as both musically appealing
and dramatically effective. New American operas that are named after
literary works, current events, or current personalities, such as
Nixon in China and Harvey Milk, reveal to the public that opera is
about their world.
Education and community programs have helped to build an
appreciation for the art form and increase audiences.
Opera companies have been uniquely dedicated to education programs
for a full generation. Perhaps it is because we are so eager to
overcome the negative stereotypes about opera that our education
programs have been animated by near-messianic zeal.
The development of the Internet offers a new opportunity to reach
young and adult audiences with educational material that helps them
to enjoy opera, regardless of their level of experience.
The Future is Bright.
Opera continues to provide an artistic prism with which to view
our increasingly complex world. With a growing audience, an expanding
repertoire, and ever-improving artistic quality, opera promises to be
a vital form of cultural expression for American audiences into the
21st century and beyond.

May 29, 2003: NASA plans to launch a probe to seek out life on Mars. MARGARET WARNER: One of the most powerful geomagnetic storms on record hit the earth today at 1:13 a.m., Eastern Time. It disrupted some airline and space satellite communications and led some electrical grids to curb their power transmissions as a precaution. The storm was triggered by a giant eruption on the sun’s surface, known as a solar flare.Here to tell us about the storm and the solar flare that triggered it is Robert Roy Britt, lead science writer for Space.com.And Rob, welcome. Start us from the beginning here back to yesterday when scientists noticed an unusual event on the sun’s surface. What happened?ROBERT ROY BRITT: Well, there’s these giant sun spots on the Sun. And there’s several right now and a couple of them are as big as Jupiter. They are huge. And the sun spots are areas where the suns magnetic energy gets all twisted up and it’s — it puts sort of a cap on the solar energy that’s trying to get out of the Sun. It’s a bit like a loose cap on a soda bottle and sooner or later that cap’s going to blow off and this material is going to come flying out. That is what happened yesterday.MARGARET WARNER: And so is that what a solar flare is, is this huge eruption?ROBERT ROY BRITT: Yes. It’s a little bit complex. You have initially a solar flare and that’s a visible event that is seen about eight minutes later from earth or it’s seen even sooner from spacecraft. It takes about eight minutes for the sun’s light and radiation to travel to earth. Then there’s an associated event that is sometimes cast out from the sun called a coronal mass ejection. Yesterday’s solar flare also had one of these coronal mass ejections. The initial event hit earth yesterday very rapidly after eight minutes or so. Today, earlier this morning the more devastating event or the more important event was this coronal mass ejection, a giant blob of gas, a big cloud that just expands outward and travels through space.MARGARET WARNER: And I gather it’s just huge, what, 13 times the size of Earth?ROBERT ROY BRITT: The sun spot itself is many times the size of Earth. It’s as big as Jupiter. The expanding gas cloud is much larger than Earth, yes.MARGARET WARNER: All right. So it approaches Earth and hits the Earth’s what, atmosphere and magnetic field? What then could happen? What did scientists fear was going to happen?ROBERT ROY BRITT: Yeah. You think of Earth as a giant magnet, and coming out from the poles are these magnetic field lines that come out and go all the way around the earth and they actually go out beyond the atmosphere. Those generally protect Earth from these charged particles that race out constantly from the Sun. But when you get a big storm like this one, it can overwhelm the magnetic field. And scientists feared that the two magnetic fields, the one of earth and the one that’s associated with the storm might be aligned in opposite directions. If that had happened, things might have been worse. As it turns out the magnetic fields were aligned in the same direction and the storm — it was powerful and we felt it but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.MARGARET WARNER: Well, I noticed the headline on your story this morning on Space.com was space storm hits, Earth survives. I don’t know if that was tongue in cheek but tell us, what really was the impact. Was most of the impact precautionary steps that were taken or did it actually seriously disrupt some communications?ROBERT ROY BRITT: One Japanese satellite has been temporarily disabled and it may have suffered some permanent damage, we don’t know yet. Some power grids were reported to have shifted how they control their power. They try to reduce the amount of flow and not do any major power exchanges with other companies. The interesting thing is that because these storms can be forecasted now with some accuracy by the folks who run the Soho spacecraft, and the equivalent of the National Weather Service for space, run out of Boulder, Colorado, the power companies and the satellite operators can take some measures to keep the storm from damaging things the way it might have.MARGARET WARNER: So, in other words, that’s why the effect wasn’t half as bad as in 1989 when Quebec Province went dark for nine hours and there were all kinds of disruptions here?ROBERT ROY BRITT: That’s right. This was a similarly powerful storm but people have learned, the engineers have learned a lot since then. We didn’t have a solar forecasting department then — solar weather forecasting. We do now.MARGARET WARNER: This afternoon the federal scientist as the NOAA, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, said this storm, first of all, is still going to kind of be around on Earth, I’m probably not using the right word there, but anyway, with us up for to 24 hours, and there could be further eruptions in the next week. Do they think the worst is the over or could the worst get be to come?ROBERT ROY BRITT: Yeah. I talked with Joe Conchus there at NOAA’s lead forecasting office for space weather this morning. He told me that this storm will probably linger about 24 hours, so that puts us into tomorrow morning, still. We could have some bright colorful lights, the aurora tonight that could extend this evening into the United States and into Europe. And I just spoke with Paul Brecky, a scientist with the Soho spacecraft, just before I came in here. There was another major eruption this evening from the sun and the effects of that storm we could feel tomorrow or the next day.MARGARET WARNER: Rob Britt, thanks so muchROBERT ROY BRITT: Thank you.

For that, we’re joined by two members of the House. Xavier Becerra is a Democrat from California and assistant to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Adam Putnam is a Republican from Florida and chairman of the House Republican Conference.Welcome to you both.REP. XAVIER BECERRA (D), Calif.: Thank you.GWEN IFILL: Mr. Becerra, you heard what Congressman Burton was saying a few minutes ago about what it is American people want to know about this war. When you talk to people in your district, when you travel home to a district where you were re-elected on the idea that perhaps the war could end, after what you’ve heard this week from General Petraeus and from Ambassador Crocker, what do you tell them?REP. XAVIER BECERRA: I tell them that I still haven’t heard a plan, an exit plan, a clear mission that, after five years, more time than we spent in World War II, 4,000 lives lost, close to 30,000 Americans wounded, and over $500 billion spent, we have very little to show for it.And we are fighting every day in Congress to try to change the course. But as you’ve heard from the general and the ambassador, the occupant in the White House is determined to keep us there, no end in sight.GWEN IFILL: No end in sight? Let me ask that question to Adam Putnam. Is that true? Is that the same thing you’re hearing from folks in your district?REP. ADAM PUTNAM (R), Fla.: Well, in my district, I’m fortunate to represent the servicemen and women who live around MacDill Air Force Base and Central Command and Special Operations Command.And those families tell me that they don’t want the sacrifice of the last five years to have been for naught. They tell me that what they see on the ground is a more secure Iraq as a result of the surge plan that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have implemented.They tell me that, while there’s a lot of talk in Washington about the cost of the war, there’s not enough discussion about the cost of losing this war. And here we are, five years later, and thank the good lord there has not been another attack on American soil.Al-Qaida is on the run. Al-Qaida does not have a base of operations in the Middle East because of the presence of the American forces and the training that they have given to the Iraqi forces.Surge's gains 'not irreversible'GWEN IFILL: So when General Petraeus, Mr. Putnam, talks about the fragile situation on the ground, the fragile success on the ground in Iraq, what does that tell you? Does that tell you that there should be some sort of plan put in place for a gradual drawdown or that everyone should stay the course?REP. ADAM PUTNAM: Well, let's not forget that, because of the success of the surge, and as part of General Petraeus' plan, five brigades are on their way home. And so we have drawn down the number of troops in Iraq from their high.The other thing that I take from General Petraeus' testimony is that the progress in Iraq has been significant, but it is not irreversible. In other words, it is fragile.And so we cannot allow the gains that have been secured as a result of that surge to fall back as a result of a precipitous withdrawal that then creates that vacuum for violence. It creates a humanitarian crisis that would rival the killing fields of Cambodia in the 1970s, and it has a direct impact on the economy of the United States.I mean, you heard an awful lot of discussion in that opening clip about the costs. Well, we're dealing with gas prices in the United States that are a dollar more per gallon today than at the beginning of the 110th Congress.Imagine what they would do if you totally destabilized Iraq and put the pipeline in Basra into the hands of insurgents instead of into the hands of what is now a competent Iraqi army and police force.Bogged down with no way out?GWEN IFILL: Let me direct some of the points you just made to Mr. Becerra. I wonder whether any of that rings true to you or, just as important, I suppose, rings true to the folks you represent?REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Gwen, the question I would ask is, what was the price of gas before we launched the invasion of Iraq?The reason that prices are very unstable when it comes to gasoline is because there's an unstable, even more unstable region in the world as a result of this invasion. We are costing ourselves so much lives, money, lost opportunities here at home. And members of our communities are losing their jobs and their homes.We need to have a different course. We need to change the direction of this country. And you can't just continue to say, "Things are getting better." It's one of these catch-22s. When things are going poorly, the president says, "We can't leave because they're going poorly." When things have gotten a little bit better militarily, he says, "We can't leave because we're having some success."The reality is the Iraqis have to step up so we can stand down. And we are in the midst of a civil war where the Iraqis -- it used to be the Shia against the Sunnis, Sunni against the Shia. Now it's even Shia against Shia.And so we're in the middle. We're a very expensive private security force for the Iraqi government that's unwilling to resolve its problems.GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you about something that Mr. Petraeus, General Petraeus suggested, which is that after July that any drawdown be paused. Is that something that you think is workable?REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Again, the so-called surge was never a surge. It was just an escalation. It's a continuation of the "stay the course" on steroids. And now we're going to have more troops still in Iraq, even with this so-called drawdown, than we had before the so-called surge occurred.It's a failed policy that doesn't have a plan. These are Keystone Kops looking at the fork in the road and deciding to go backwards instead of taking even the fork in the road.It's very difficult to say, because I agree with Adam. Our men and women are fighting with great, great determination. They're doing everything we're asking of them. The problem is I'm not sure we know what we're really wanting as a result of asking them for their service.U.S. politics meets Iraq strategyGWEN IFILL: You know, Mr. Putnam, I hear you and Mr. Becerra talking, pretty much making the same arguments that you would have been making five years ago about this war, certainly two years ago about this war.I wonder if, when you go home to your districts, whether anybody gets exasperated about what's being discussed in Washington, whether anything that we saw this week, with the general and the ambassador, signals that maybe this argument is about to be pitched forward?REP. ADAM PUTNAM: Well, let me begin by just saying that I don't think that my friend from California intended to refer to the leaders of the war effort as Keystone Kops. I'm confident that that's not the case...REP. XAVIER BECERRA: You're correct.REP. ADAM PUTNAM: ... that General Petraeus is not the Keystone Kops and Ambassador Crocker is not Keystone Kops.REP. XAVIER BECERRA: That's correct.REP. ADAM PUTNAM: We can disagree about the policy, but I think we all hold our troops in the highest of esteem.REP. XAVIER BECERRA: I agree.REP. ADAM PUTNAM: And there is something of a credibility gap here, though, I think in that, prior to the surge, we saw Democratic leaders come to the microphones and the cameras and say, "The war is lost. The surge can't possibly work." Obviously, public approval of the war last September was at an all-time low.The surge did work. And we're seeing a reluctant admission of that by people who declared that it never could and that the war was already lost.The surge clearly did work. And the public recognizes it, because the public support of what's going on over there has risen because they have seen the success of our military, of the security situation, because of, I think, the genius behind this plan and the service of General Petraeus and all the men and women under him who have implemented that.Now, there, I think, is bipartisan frustration that the Iraqi parliament has not fully maximized that security situation, although they have made substantial progress on reconciliation, sharing of oil revenues, et cetera, but there's more yet to be done.And on a bipartisan basis, I think that we can move forward in asking the Iraqi people or specifically the Iraqi government to transition more of the domestic burden of this, the reconstruction costs, onto the Iraqi government just as we are transitioning security responsibilities onto the Iraqi army and police force.Both sides firmly dug inGWEN IFILL: Mr. Becerra, finally, if you listen to Mr. Putnam, it sounds like the Republicans are invested in victory and the Democrats are invested in defeat. What are the American people invested in?REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Gosh, it's so frustrating, because I think Adam and I don't veer very far from each other on believing that our military is doing everything we're asking of them.If we had 500,000 troops in Iraq, things would be even more stable. But that's not the point. We didn't take out Saddam Hussein to then have hundreds of thousands of troops there forever and ever to try to stabilize the Iraqi government.We went in there because we were told that they would come together. They haven't; they've not been willing to. And so, until they do, we're acting like very expensive police, taking all the shots.And I think the American public has every right to be frustrated. Our generals and our soldiers are simply following commands.The Keystone Cops are not on the field. It's the folks that are making the policy decisions that have left us in this tremendous, tremendous debacle we see in Iraq.There is a way to get out of this. But I don't see the occupant in the White House talking at all about doing that.GWEN IFILL: Same question to you, Mr. Putnam, briefly.REP. ADAM PUTNAM: Look, let's recap the successes that we've seen over there, because we really were talking about this -- we were having this debate in a very different framework the last time General Petraeus appeared on the Hill.And, frankly, there has been a noticeable lack of press attention to this visit, because things are so much better on the ground, because there is a widespread acknowledgment that the surge worked, that we have seen their economy take root, and it's growing 7 percent a year, to the point that the Iraqi government has a surplus that we're talking about using for reconstruction.People open small businesses. People feel safe on the streets because of the security that was brought to them with American leadership, training the Iraqi forces.We are seeing their political reconciliation move ahead. We are seeing Anbar province, which has gone from being the most violent, dangerous place on Earth, to being a place that is now secure and under Iraqi control.We're seeing five brigades come home from Iraq. All of these things are tangible progress in Iraq brought to you by the sacrifice of the American people and particularly our servicemen and women. We can't walk away from that.GWEN IFILL: And we will have to leave it there. Adam Putnam and Xavier Becerra, thank you both very much.REP. ADAM PUTNAM: Thank you.REP. XAVIER BECERRA: Thanks, Gwen.

‹‹ 3 of 5 ›› The Political Storm Ends; the Drama Begins
Posted: Fri, 11/16/2012 - 11:09am
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio -- Perhaps it's just my imagination, but one of the most hard-fought electoral prizes in the nation -- the Buckeye state -- seems oddly quiet.
Less than two weeks ago, voters in pivotal southwest Ohio's Clark County trotted to the polls and delivered a mixed verdict -- roughly 31,000 voted for Mitt Romney, while 30,000 chose Barack Obama. That's less than a two percent difference between the winner and the loser. Statewide, the numbers flipped, with 51 percent choosing the Democrat, and 48 percent backing the Republican. It was a raucous, hard-fought and narrowly-decided race.
The race between President Obama and Mitt Romney in Ohio was tight with less than a two percent difference between the winner and loser [Photo:CNN].
But when I strolled down the streets of Springfield this week, on the way to a visit at Wittenberg College, things had abruptly returned to normal. The incessant campaign advertising had stopped as if a spigot had been switched off. The candidates who had made the Buckeye State their second homes had disappeared.
It was hard to recall that just two weeks ago, when President Obama came to the local high school the Friday before the election for one of his final big campaign rallies, Springfield was the center of the political universe.
I went back and looked at the transcript of that Springfield speech when I arrived here this week. In hindsight, it is full of clues to why Romney lost, and why he is apparently still bitter about how things turned out.
"After four years as President, you know me," Obama told the cheering pre-election crowd. "You may not agree with every decision I’ve made. Sometimes you may have been frustrated at the pace of change. But you know what I believe. You know where I stand. You know I tell the truth.
"You know I’ll fight for you and your families every single day, as hard as I know how," he said. "That’s why I’m running for a second term, because I want to fight for you. That’s why I need your votes, Springfield. That’s why I need your vote, Ohio."
In a conference call with donors this week, Romney, who has apparently been licking his wounds and reading post-election memos, complained that the President won by offering "gifts" to targeted groups -- citizenship to undocumented immigrants; birth control to young women; free health care to African Americans and cheaper tuition for students.
"The President's campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift," the former Republican nominee said. "So he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars."
Romney may have been reading an internal post-election Republican party memo. It noted that the nominee won independent Ohio voters by 10 points, but was swamped by an increase in African American voters -- 178,000 more than four years ago -- of which the President won 96 percent. There were 123,000 fewer independents voting. The RNC documented serious adverse outcomes among young voters in Colorado and Hispanic voters in Florida.
But Romney's remarks reeked so distinctly of sour grapes that leading Republicans -- including staunch campaign surrogates like New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal -- moved swiftly to denounce them.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was among the the republican surrogates that denounced Romney's "gifts" comment [Photo:CNN]
They would much rather Romney stay quiet, or at the least, talk about what comes next instead of the defeat just past. Romney is clearly not there yet. "Frankly," he told his supporters, "we're still so troubled by the past, it's hard to put together our plans for the future."
But look again at the President's Springfield speech. Romney's remarks may have come across as graceless, but they were not so far off the mark.
The President has pledged to offer a path to citizenship for the undocumented. He has promised to preserve access to birth control by supporting Planned Parenthood. He does plan to move forward on his Affordable Care Act, and he did spend considerable time during the campaign promising to preserve tuition tax breaks for college students. Romney's mistake was in characterizing these policy positions as "gifts" to special interests.
The President says Election Day settled those arguments. House Republicans, who still say they will not raise taxes on the wealthy to avoid a much-discussed fall off the fiscal cliff, and some Senate Republicans, who have already begun threatening to block nominations and convene Watergate-style hearings, do not seem to agree.
Many of us who live in Washington doubt that these line-in-the-sand arguments resonate much beyond the capital. It feels like we have returned from the campaign only to climb back onto a familiar, dizzying carousel.
So imagine my surprise when I asked my Wittenberg University audience if they even cared about the arguments about the fiscal cliff. The vast majority of hands in the audience shot up.
And as I drove back through Springfield's quiet streets --as deserted at night as they had been at midday -- I realized why. The campaign ads may have stopped. The direct mail may have dried up. Bill Clinton and Barbara Bush may have stopped their incessant robo-calling to the good people of Clark County.
But voters are still paying attention.

EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND
Video Transcript: Writing
[opens with teacher at a whiteboard, cuts to students in the class]
Teacher: I want you to write things that are true and accurate about the metric system that you know.
[cut to Max, a sixth grade student, in interview with Dr. Mel Levine]
Student: Ah, I'll remember what I want to write but when I write it down I'll forget words and stuff.
[fade to a writing sample]
Dr. Mel Levine: So if you focus on the mechanical parts of writing, it's hard to have good ideas.
[cut to Max]
Student: Yeah, so it's sort of hard for me to focus on both of them.
[cut to Dr. Levine]
Dr. Levine: One of the most common writing liabilities in middle school occurs in a student for whom nothing is automatic when it comes to writing. [onscreen label: "Automatization"] It may be that forming letters is taking too much time and effort, or the recall of spelling or punctuation is requiring a tremendous search of memory in order to do it properly.
[cut to student writing in class; Dr. Levine in voice-over]
And kids who have what we call delayed automatization, they just can't remember the little bits and pieces of writing automatically, often hate to write.
[various students writing in class]
voice-over: In addition to the memory requirements of writing, students also need to be able to organize and arrange their thoughts in a logical order.
[cut to Nick writing in class]
Teacher: So what does that paragraph say?
Nick's teacher, Sandi LaRoche (voice-over): Nick has learning problems with processing. He can't do more than one thing at a time. When he's writing, he can't write and be creative and spell and use all the grammar and all the punctuation. So that has to be more steps for him.
[Nick writes in class]
Teacher: Well, if we covered it by three rhombuses, what would we have covered? Nick (voice-over): Well, like, when the teacher's going fast, she wants us to write notes, I might have to ask--I might look over and see what other notes people have.
[Nick in interview; onscreen label "Nick, fourth grade student"]
Dr. Mel Levine: Why is that?
Nick: Because I can't keep up with the notes.
