Life's Little Questions:Sand to Nuts
Footprints on the beach, a can of mixed nuts, sand in an hourglass and coffee spilled on kitchen counters may not seem like critical topics for study, but these same subjects have led scientists to some fascinating explorations into materials science. In this story, watch as seemingly trivial questions lead curious scientists into inspired investigations about much bigger issues.

RELATED FRONTIERS SHOW AND ACTIVITY
Science in Paradise: (Show 901): Big Dish ACTIVITY 1: LESSONS LEARNED FROM COFFEE
As you see in this episode of Frontiers, seemingly insignificant questions sometimes lead to complex answers -- and to other questions.
Physicist Sidney Nagel of the Materials Center at the University of Chicago began his investigation by wondering about something we've all seen many times -- coffee stains on a kitchen counter. His questions about why the stains form as they do became almost an obsession with scientists from several fields. Watch the program to find out what they discovered. Then try this simple experiment to learn more.
MATERIALS
powdered tempera paints or other water colors (light colors work best)
various liquids: coffee, salt water, tap water, soda, juice, Tang, tea, cocoa
plastic lids from butter tubs, coffee cans, etc.
paper, cloth and/or a flat, washable surface
PROCEDURE
Mix the paint and any of the powdered drink mixes with water according to package directions.
Place several drops of paint and of each liquid onto paper, cloth or a flat surface.
Watch as the drops dry.
Write down your observations of the phenomenon. Note what changes occur every five minutes.
Now introduce some variables:
Place a few drops on paper and let it dry upside down. What happens?
Use plastic lids as covers to manipulate the evaporation of liquids. Make covers that will: Completely cover the drop. What happens?
Cover the edges of the drop but expose the center. What happens?
Cover half of the drop and leave the other half exposed. What happens?
QUESTIONS
Which liquid(s) developed the most distinct ring(s)? The least? Why?
How did the rate of evaporation play a role in the formation of the ring?
How did the surface beneath the drops (paper or countertop) affect the rate of evaporation and the development of the deposition ring?
EXTENSIONS
Try the above experiment on pieces of paper with different textures: computer or notebook paper, construction paper or homemade recycled, paper towel, coffee filters, etc. Compare the results achieved by using these different surfaces.
Compare stains left by coffee made using different methods -- instant, filtered, espresso, cappuccino. What accounts for the differences?
Watch a drop of coffee evaporate through a microscope. Explain what you see happening as the liquid evaporates.
Look up the chemical composition of caffeine and sketch an illustration. ANSWERS
liquids that are partially wetting and volatile should cause rings (coffee, Kool-Aid, salt water, soda)
as the liquid evaporates from the drop, molecules of evaporating liquid continually replenish the exterior of the stain
answers will vary
ACTIVITY 2: MATERIALS SCIENCE
Physicists Sidney Nagel and Heinrich Jaeger have made careers out of studying properties and behavior of various materials. As you see on Frontiers, their work sometimes takes them in unexpected directions. Try replicating some of the experiments you see on the program. What do you observe?
Next time you're on a beach, see if you can create a "halo" effect with your feet.
Put some sand and water in a squeeze bottle. Do you get the same results seen on the show?
Find a clear plastic tube. Put some sand and a small ball in it. Can you get the ball to climb to the top of the tube? Can your friends do it? (Try testing people who haven't watched this episode of Frontiers.)
Obtain a can of mixed nuts. How are the nuts mixed when the can is first opened? Shake the can. How do the nuts mix or unmix? Do you think it would be possible to design a can that keeps the nuts evenly mixed? Explain. (Hint: if nuts are shaken many times, the walls of the can become so smooth that the nuts will no longer unmix. Friction is one key.)
You can learn more about the experiments with coffee and other materials at the Materials Center of the University of Chicago. You'll also learn more about practical applications of these findings. To learn more, visit: mrsec.uchicago.edu/MRSEC/

More about the film John & Abigail Adams
Relying heavily on the extraordinary correspondence between the second president and his wife, this joint biography sheds light not only on the characters of two remarkable people, but also on the tumultuous times through which they lived.
John and Abigail Adams played a critical role in many of the pivotal events of their era: he was a vociferous participant at the Continental Congress; she was an important eyewitness reporter during the Siege of Boston; he was an important wartime emissary to France. In the post-war era, first as vice president, then as president, Adams was caught up in the increasing political divisiveness that characterized the 1790s when rifts in the country almost pulled the fledgling nation apart.
Opening a window onto the revolutionary era, John and Abigail's story provides a strikingly intimate look inside a marriage of true companions, for whom life included not just the great events of history, but also laughter, loneliness, affection, and family tragedy.
The Founding Fathers -- and Mothers -- were not men and women of marble following a script that made independence and American national success a pre-ordained conclusion, but real, flawed, multi-dimensional people, who had no idea how things would turn out.

It was the most wonderful production of the Nutcracker I’ve ever seen. My daughter danced as a child for 10 years at Boston Ballet. Sarah Van Patten was a classmate of hers. BRAVO, SARAH! It was wonderful to see you dance as a mature dancer and grown woman. We are so proud of you. Someday I hope to make it to San Francisco and see you live on stage. BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!!
laura magasanik,
Is this performance being shown at any other day or evening other than tonight Dec.17th? 1-3am is hardly an hour for kids.
Thanks
laura
VICTOR SANCHEZ
I love,ed it
Katy Bejarano
Where can I purchase the DVD of this performance? The phone # and address were only on the screen about 30 seconds – no time to even reach my desk, let alone write it down. Please let me know!
Jose Cedeno
WONDERFUL! this is one of the best Nutcraker I’ve seen, very different, great choreography and scenic design. All the dancers were superb it would had been great to be there. Is there going to be an encore?
lawrence ziman
same query as Katy (above) – details, please
Michael Damien Martin
This was way better than the Mukaley Caulkin version.
Albert
You can get the DVD at Amazon. It says “San Francisco Ballet Nutcracker” on the cover.
I myself prefer the Baryshnikov version, although it’s obviously not shot in hi-def and widescreen.
Grace
This ballet was amazing the dancers were very good and this was one of the best productions of the “Nutcracker”.
