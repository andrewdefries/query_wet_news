"Being Alone" by Barry Magid
"Being Alone" by Barry Magid
« "Mindful Teaching and Teaching Mindfulness" by Deborah Schoeberlein | "Meditation: Receiving the Healing, Liberating Power of Love" by John Makransky »
1 March 2010
Whether we are sitting alone or together with a group, we are sometimes liable to fall into a way of thinking in which we imagine that our experience is in some way or another unique. It can take many different forms. We might imagine that no one else could be going through the kind of pain we’re experiencing, whether emotional or physical. We might imagine that our thoughts, feelings, or the essence of who we really are is intrinsically private—that we fundamentally exist inside our mind or our body and that we can only imperfectly send and receive messages out into a world of other separate, isolated minds. Or, we imagine that no one can ever really understand what it’s like to be me.What we lose track of in the midst of these various forms of dualistic thinking is the fact that who and what we are is constituted, and constantly, moment-by-moment, re-constituted, by the world we live in and are part of. It’s true that I may not be feeling exactly what is going on in your knee at this moment, but I know what pain is. I may not be thinking the exact thought you’re thinking at this moment, but I know what thought is. The same goes for longing, anger, anxiety, tension, and so on. All these constitute the emotional ground of what it is to be human just as much as having and recognizing height and weight are part of what it is to be an embodied being. We all share, or rather, are all part of, a common fabric of being.One of the reasons we maintain some of the traditional elements of Buddhist practice in our lay zendo is that they remind us that whatever we are experiencing on our cushions today has been experienced by many thousands of others, over hundreds and even thousands of years of practice. What we feel, they felt. What we suffer, they suffered. What they learned, we can learn. All of us are simply human beings trying to clarify what it means to be human, and to come to terms with the suffering that being human entails. When we imagine that our experience is unique, we may imagine ourselves particularly talented or particularly hopeless at what we’re doing. Sitting may one day catapult us up into heaven; another day plunge us deep into hell. But when we arrive there, we find that heaven and hell are crowded places. Whatever we achieve, others have achieved; whatever we suffer, others have suffered before us. No matter how bad you think you are at this practice, no matter how hard you find it, don’t forget: it was designed by and for people just like you.There’s an old saying, “Don’t try to put somebody else’s head on top of your own.” Well, I think we’re only tempted to exchange our head for another when we’re convinced that its contents are somehow unique—that I could trade my head, which is full of hurt and anger and anxiety, for a different head that has none of those things rattling around inside it. But the more we come to realize the contents of our heads are all alike—that all of us are struggling with the same hurts and problems inherent in being human—the more we’re willing to simply work with the head we’ve got. One’s pretty much like another! The strange thing is, it turns out that all those things we thought were so unique about ourselves are precisely what we have most in common.Excerpted from "Ending the Pursuit of Happiness" by Barry Magid (Wisdom Publications).Barry Magid is the author of the books Ending the Pursuit of Happiness: A Zen Guide and Ordinary Mind: Exploring the Common Ground of Zen & Psychotherapy.

"I Don’t Know" by Lin Jensen: Don’t worry about having the right answer to all of life’s questions.
"Suffering Zen" by Susan Moon: "Buddhist teachings are about suffering and the end of suffering, and Zen Buddhism, in particular, emphasizes sitting still in the midst of your suffering and just letting go," writes Susan Moon. But there are times when "letting go" can feel like an impossible task.
The Dalai Lama: "On Buddha Nature": "Future, everything depends on your own shoulder. Buddha’s responsibility is just to show the path, that’s all."

How do I find out if I have acute HIV infection?
Who should have an AIDS test?
Who should have a test for acute HIV infection?
Is there an effective morning after pill?

How many persons are long-term non-progressors and what does this mean?
Can the new drug cocktails cure HIV infection?
Is there an effective AIDS vaccine?
What are clinical trials?
HIV infection continues to be a global health crisis. Among the frequently
asked questions about HIV and AIDS are the following:
1. How is the AIDS virus transmitted?
The AIDS virus is transmitted from one person to another by three methods:
Blood or blood products: Prior to 1985 HIV was frequently transmitted by
blood transfusions because there was no way to test blood for the AIDS virus.
Since 1985 the blood supply has been screened for HIV with an effective test.
The main way the virus is transmitted by blood products now is through the
sharing of needles by persons abusing drugs.
Sexual contact: The virus can be passed in body fluids including sperm.
Having unprotected sex (for example sex without condoms) can result in passing
the infection. Oral sex can also result in transmission. The infection can be
passed from men to women, women to men, men to men, and women to women.
Mother to infant: The virus can be transmitted from mother to infant
during pregnancy, at the time of birth, or by breast-feeding. Treating
pregnant mothers with anti-HIV drugs is very effective in limiting transmission
to infants, but some transmission still occurs. The risk of transmission is
further diminished by Cesarean section.back to top
2. How does HIV cause disease?
HIV is an infection of the immune system so it destroys the body's ability to
fight off infections. The illness is called AIDS, which stands for "acquired
immune deficiency syndrome." It is caused by a virus, which is a microscopic
organism that can only reproduce itself by entering human cells and using these
to make the building blocks for new viruses. The cell that is entered
eventually dies. Additionally HIV may enter a cell and then remain quiet for a
prolonged time. This is a problem for drug therapy because drugs destroy the
virus while it is active.back to top
3. How many persons are infected?
Over 30 million persons worldwide are infected. In some African countries over
20% of the population is infected. In the US there are as many as one million
persons infected, and there will be an estimated 44,000 new cases of infection
this year.back to top
4. What are the earliest symptoms of HIV infection?
Most people think of HIV infection as causing a debilitating disease called
AIDS that is not apparent until years after infection. In fact, in untreated
persons the average time to the development of AIDS is 10 years or more.
However, HIV infection is also associated with an acute illness in most
infected persons. This illness, called acute HIV infection begins
within one to three weeks of exposure, and most often consists of some
combination of the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, skin rash, swollen
glands, ulcers in the mouth or on the genitalia. Most persons complain of
severe fatigue, but in some there are very few symptoms. The symptoms usually
resolve within one to three weeks, and the infected person can then remain
apparently well for an average of 10 years. During this time the virus
continues to slowly destroy the immune system.back to top
5. How reliable is the AIDS test?
The test for AIDS is a test that measures the immune response to HIV. This
consists of antibodies that are generated in response to the infection. The
standard AIDS test measures these antibodies. Since these take some time to
develop, in the very early stages of infection there may be a negative antibody
test and yet the person can be infected. The way to check for HIV infection in
this circumstance is to measure the virus in the blood. This can be done with
either a viral load assay or a p24 antigen test. Both of these are available
through health care professionals.back to top
6. How do I find out if I have acute HIV infection?
The standard blood test for HIV is negative in persons with acute HIV
infection, so a special blood test has to be used if this diagnosis is
suspected. There are two tests that can help to diagnose acute HIV infection:
HIV viral load and HIV p24 antigen test. These are available through health
care professionals. The standard blood test becomes positive about four to six
weeks after infection.back to top
7. Who should have an AIDS test?
Anyone who has had a blood transfusion before the blood was tested for AIDS
(before 1985), anyone who has had unprotected sex with a person who could be
infected, and the infants of infected mothers.back to top
8. Who should have a test for acute HIV infection?
Persons who have symptoms of acute HIV infection and who have had a known
exposure to someone who is or could be HIV infected (unprotected sex or sharing
needles, for example) should be considered for testing.back to top
9. Is there an effective morning after pill?
Physicians are trying to determine whether anti viral drugs given after
exposure to HIV can prevent infection. In most large cities there are now
trials going on to treat people who have been exposed to see if this can
prevent infection. These trials are referred to as "post-exposure
prophylaxis." In Boston, such a trial is underway at the Fenway Community
Health Center.back to top
10. Who should stop therapy to see if the immune system is strong enough to
control the virus?
This should only be done in carefully controlled experiments under the
supervision of AIDS specialists. The NOVA program "Surviving AIDS" describes a
new kind of experiment in which doctors are trying to determine if the body's
natural defense mechanism, the immune system, can keep the virus under control
after drug therapy is stopped. They have found that persons who are treated
with potent anti viral drugs (often referred to as HAART for highly active
antiretroviral therapy) as soon as they become infected develop strong immune
responses to the virus, and now they are trying to see if this is enough to
successfully control the virus. These experiments are being performed in a
very select group of persons.back to top
11. How many persons are long-term non-progressors and what does this mean?
About 1 in 100 HIV infected persons is a so-called long-term non-progressor,
meaning that they have been infected for up to 20 years and still have a normal
CD4 count and low viral load. Clearly the virus has caused little damage in
these persons thus far, but whether these persons will be affected by the virus
in the future remains uncertain.back to top
12. Can the new drug cocktails cure HIV infection?
The new drug cocktail for HIV, which consists of a combination of three or more
drugs, can be very effective in lowering the amount of virus in the blood, but
it no longer appears that this cocktail will result in complete eradication of
the virus. In fact, persons who have stopped the drug cocktail even after two
years of treatment have generally had a rapid return of the virus.back to top
13. Is there an effective AIDS vaccine?
Attempts to make an effective AIDS vaccine have not been successful thus far.
Numerous different methods are being tried, and progress is being made. Since
anti viral drugs are extremely expensive, the only hope for worldwide control
of HIV is to develop an effective vaccine.back to top
14. What are clinical trials?
Clinical trials of AIDS treatments are studies designed to answer whether new
experimental treatments are more effective. Usually these trials involve
comparing the effects of one treatment compared to another. Information about
AIDS clinical trials in Boston can be obtained from the AIDS Clinical Trial
Unit at MGB, 617-716-3819.

April 23, 2013, 9:55 pm ET by Nathan Tobey	E-Mail ThisTweet	For most Americans, traditional retirement is now a pipe dream. Six in 10 believe they’ll have to delay retirement. Yet, the financial services industry is making billions of dollars a year managing the funds we still have.
What’s going on? And who’s to blame?
In The Retirement Gamble, FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith investigates what happened to retirement in America and the role that financial services companies may be playing in draining your savings, year after year.
Through interviews with Wall Street executives at the helm of the mutual fund industry and former financial advisers who may or may not have their clients’ best interests at heart, Smith traces the remarkable rise of the 401(k)—a product Americans buy without knowing its true cost.
How much, exactly, are Americans paying in fees for their 401(k) accounts — and what are they getting in return? What happened to retirement in America — where did pensions go? And what are some of the biggest misconceptions consumers have about retirement? What do we need to know?
We’ve asked Martin Smith and producer Marcela Gaviria to join us to take these questions — and answer yours.
We’ll also be joined by leading 401(k) expert Robert Hiltonsmith, a policy analyst at Demos who is interviewed in the film. Our guest questioner is Penny Wang, a writer and editor at Money, where she writes a monthly mutual fund column, Fund Watch.
Next Avenue senior editor Richard Eisenberg will also be dropping by to ask questions and offer commentary.
We’d like to thank Money and Next Avenue for partnering with us on this chat.
You can leave a question in the chat window below, and come by at 2 p.m. ET on Wed., April 24 to join the live discussion.
