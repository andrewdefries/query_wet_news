Arguing the World | PBS Online
arguing@pbs.org
rom cafeterias to cocktail parties to
the pages of important magazines and journals, few groups of
friends have argued ideas so passionately and so publicly as
the writers and critics known as the New York Intellectuals.
Rising from America's working class they went on to wield great
influence in the second half of the twentieth century. ARGUING
THE WORLD is the portrait of four members of this group: Irving
Kristol, Irving Howe, Daniel Bell, and Nathan Glazer. It is the
story of a lifelong political argument among brilliant and engaging
individuals who came of age as radicals at the City College of
New York during the Great Depression and then journeyed across
the political spectrum.
racing their rise to prominence as political
and cultural critics in post-war America through magazines and
journals like Partisan Review and Commentary the film charts
their path through the controversies of the Cold War and Joe
McCarthy's reign of terror, their clash with the tidal forces
of the New Left on college campuses in the 60s, and the fights
which pulled them apart in the midst of the conservative backlash
hailed by Ronald Reagan's presidency in the eighties.Driven apart
by their responses to these historical events, by the nineties
the four found themselves at odds with one another. Irving Kristol
became influential in America's resurgent conservative movement,
Nathan Glazer, a forceful critic of liberal social policy, while
Daniel Bell fought to defend a besieged liberalism. Until his
death in 1993, Irving Howe, ever on the political margins, endured
as a key voice of the radical Left.
eaving personal reminiscence, location
photography, archival footage, images of New York and the voices
of friends and critics, ARGUING THE WORLD explores the passions,
the issues and the era that shaped these men.
News: Arguing the World, the book, will contain a much-expanded oral history
of Irving Howe, Irving Kristol, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Bell and the New York Intellectuals along with an introductory essay on the making of the film. It will be published in the early summer of 2000 by the Free Press, a division of Simon and Schuster.

President Obama issued new warnings, while saying the U.S. and the world continue to seek conclusive evidence. All the while, the civil war in Syria raged on.Explosions and heavy fighting rocked Damascus today, as government forces pressed an offensive to retake parts of the Syrian capital from rebels. At the same time, the war of words over chemical weapons escalated. Syrian government officials denied U.S. claims made yesterday. White House letters to senators said, “U.S. intelligence assesses with varying degrees of confidence that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale, specifically sarin.”The disclosure put new pressure on President Obama to take action. He met today with the visiting king of Jordan and said the findings are preliminary.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We’re going to be consulting with our partners in the region, as well as the international community and the United Nations, to make sure that we are investigating this as effectively and as quick — as quickly as we can. It’s obviously horrific, as it is when mortars are being fired on civilians and people are being indiscriminately killed. To use potential weapons of mass destruction on civilian populations, that is going to be a game changer.JEFFREY BROWN: The president has also said any use of chemical weapons would cross a — quote — “red line.”And on Thursday, Republican Sen. John McCain said, it’s been crossed.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-Ariz.: The president of the United States has now told us that they used chemical weapons. Those stocks of chemical weapons, some of which are in disputed areas, must be secured, and we must give the opposition the capability to drive out Bashar Assad once and for all.JEFFREY BROWN: But other lawmakers today were more cautious. Democratic Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland attended a closed briefing on the matter.REP. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER, D-Md.: We feel that there has been some chemical weapons that have been used, but we’re still investigating who did it, where it’s coming from. And right now, we’re just in an evaluation stage. I don’t think we, just as the United States, want to go into another war.JEFFREY BROWN: A spokesman for the Syrian opposition welcomed the administration’s findings and President Obama’s promise of further investigation.KHALID SALEH, Syrian National Coalition: The positions that the U.S. and U.K. took in the last couple of days are very advanced and we welcome them. We will invite investigators. We will cooperate with investigators. And we are certain that the evidence will show that the Syrian regime actually used those chemical weapons against innocent civilians.JEFFREY BROWN: It was unclear how long further investigation might take.

Online NewsHour coverage of Asia The president’s speech, delivered alongside Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University, was broadcast live throughout China.“Life in America shows that liberty, paired with law is not to be feared,” Mr. Bush said. “In a free society, diversity is not disorder. Debate is not strife. And dissent is not revolution. A free society trusts its citizens to seek greatness in themselves and their country.”Mr. Bush also praised China’s progress since his 1975 visit as a tourist.“A lot has changed in your country since then. China has made amazing progress — in openness and enterprise and economic freedom. And this progress previews China’s great potential.”President Bush also engaged in a lively question and answer session with the students.When asked about Taiwan, considered a rebel province by Beijing, Mr. Bush said the U.S. would stick by its pledge to help the island nation defend itself, but hoped for a peaceful resolution.A statement by the state-run New China News Agency, said President Bush’s visit was a “historic moment” and that the two countries “have begun a new stage of developing constructive relations of cooperation in the new century.”Mr. Bush’s stop in China, concluded his six-day tour of three Asian countries, which also included Japan and South Korea.U.S. officials said that although there was little progress made in China on human rights, arms proliferation or the Taiwan issue, the meeting built on the new spirit of cooperation between the countries since China joined the U.S-led coalition against terrorism.At a press conference Thursday, President Bush praised China for its “strong support” of the war on terrorism and asked Chinese President Jiang Zemin to assist him in starting a dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.“We would be willing to meet with the North Korean regime, and I asked his help in conveying that message,” President Bush said. “If [President Jiang Zemin] speaks to the leader of North Korea, he can assure him I am sincere in my desire to have our folks meet.”President Bush labeled the country part of an “axis of evil” during his State of the Union address last month.A spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry rejected the offer, but U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. will make direct contact through the United Nations.

Feature The Bush Conant Files
Find out more about The Manhattan Project.
Support provided by:
The Bush Conant Files
The names of Robert Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves are well known in connection to the first atomic bombs. But who was in charge of overseeing the secret Manhattan Project?
The secret was revealed in 1958. Richard G Hewlett, the official historian of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) opened an old filing cabinet under a stairwell and pulled out a remarkable collection of wartime correspondence files of two men: Vannever Bush and James B. Conant.
The files are a record of the work of two of the major civilian political leaders involved in creating and overseeing the bomb project in the 1940s. Bush was an engineer and Conant was a chemist. Both men had been involved in military research during World War I and would go on to utilise their experience and management skills in shaping the Manhattan Project.
At the time, Vannever Bush was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Scientific Advisor. He had instigated the creation of the National Defence Resource Committee (NDRC) to advance military technology in preparation for the United States’ involvement in World War II.
The files reveal Bush and Conant wanted to forge close relationships between American research bodies, politics and the military to strengthen national security. They moved to absorb other military research committees into the umbrella of the NDRC, including the Uranium Committee, an existing body set up to research the creation of an atomic bomb. The atomic bomb project took on greater urgency when rumors of a rival German project surfaced.
Bush and Conant convinced President Roosevelt to limit collaboration with Britain, who had initially been leading the race to the bomb. This decision, coupled with increased commitment to the Manhattan Project, ensured that the United States leapfrogged their rivals and created a nuclear monopoly.
To organise military efforts a new federal agency was created to take the place of the NDRC: the Office of Scientific Research and Development. It was given almost unlimited access to funding and resources. Vannever Bush was instated as its Director and he reported only to President Roosevelt.
Bush and Conant continually worked to push the program forward. They lobbied for support and funds, and built a momentum that vaulted the United States ahead of their rivals in the arms race. Without their drive and passion, military research would have remained divided and isolated from politics and the United States would have been unprepared for war.
The work overseen by Bush and Conant was done under in absolute secrecy. Even Congress did not know about the Manhattan Project. It was not until President Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace program in the 1950s that nuclear secrets were revealed. However, to this day, the role of Bush and Conant is one of the lesser known stories of the nuclear arms race.

Read More Romney Looks Past Weekend’s Primary as Rivals Find New HopeOn The RadarMitt Romney delivered a 13-minute speech here on Tuesday morning, shook hands with an audience that filled only a small part of a ballroom and caught a plane for a fund-raising gala in New York, a clear sign that he is looking beyond South Carolina.

Appraisal Transcript:
GUEST: My mother's maiden name was Nutting, and her great-grandfather's cousin was Wallace Nutting. APPRAISER: What do you know about Wallace Nutting? GUEST: Well, I know that he originally was a pastor, and then he found some older homes in New England and restored them, and that's how he really got interested, I believe, in furniture. APPRAISER: Wallace Nutting, actually, is from Massachusetts. His "Furniture Treasury" is one of the earliest and best known reference books on American furniture and decorative arts. We've learned an awful lot since then, so much of what you see in the book, the information, isn't necessarily accurate. But he was a pioneer in that area, so you have to give the guy an awful lot of credit. And Wallace Nutting made some serious money selling prints, and he was part of the whole Colonial Revival interest in this country, in that they assembled rooms and set them up in a manner that they thought would have been appropriate for that time frame. This is a good example, a relatively small example, and the water stain doesn't help its value. GUEST: Right. APPRAISER: Let's move to this Windsor chair over here. Now, this is a terrific example of what Wallace Nutting did best. This is an accurate copy of an 18th-century comb-back, continuous-arm Windsor chair. Beautifully proportioned, it's made the way an early chair would be made. It's branded and labeled by Wallace Nutting. When he made this chair, they were finished in natural wood. Period Windsor chairs, when they were new, were painted. He was making furniture at a time where people routinely refinished things. Today there'd be a totally different approach and, in fact, Windsor chair makers today generally make the chairs and then paint them in colors. Now let's get to this chest-on-chest. This particular piece is not made by Wallace Nutting. GUEST: Oh, it isn't? APPRAISER: Wallace Nutting, in reproducing furniture, went for accuracy. He went for quality. The materials used, the techniques that were used in assembling the piece very closely resembled the original cabinetmaking techniques. This piece you don't see that. These various design elements have been a bit exaggerated-- the proportions are off. These fan-carved, double-top drawers. These exaggerated, turned spiral-carved quarter columns repeated on the bottom are pretty heavy. The gadrooning on the base, the claw-and-ball feet-- these are all elements that you wouldn't see in a period piece of furniture, at least not in this configuration. So right away I was suspicious of it. And then in looking at this drawer, we see a label in here, and this label I recognize. This is made by Charak Furniture Company in Boston. They were making furniture during the same time frame as Wallace Nutting, but there's a major difference. This chair is an accurate and very beautiful reproduction. This is quality, but it's not accurate, and it really doesn't look like an antique. Wallace Nutting also probably would have used pine secondary wood. The drawer bottoms would have been chamfered... (wood rattles) Not a flat piece of plyboard, that kind of thing. Nonetheless, it's a good piece of furniture. What'd you pay for it? GUEST: Well, I think it was roughly $800. APPRAISER: Well, that's exactly what I was going to tell you it's worth, so you're okay. GUEST: So I'm all right. APPRAISER: And what did you pay for the chair? GUEST: We have a set of four, two armchairs and two straights. The set... I believe it was in the neighborhood of $1,500, I believe. APPRAISER: That's a good deal. In Massachusetts, this chair would sell for probably about $800. GUEST: Oh, is that right? APPRAISER: It's increasingly valuable, so you're on the right track with this. On TV
