Elite members of the federal anti terrorist squad were sent to scene. It is believed two people were injured by tear gas or pepper spray when a group forced themselves into the building. In a fax sent to news agencies a previously unheard of group — the Democratic Iraqi Opposition of Germany — said it was carrying out a temporary peaceful action. A spokesman for the Iraqi opposition in exile said the action was understandable.SPOKESMAN: Well, the action just shows the frustration of the Iraqi people –this action highlighting the frustration of the Iraqi people, the suffering of the Iraqi people, their wish to liberate their country from Saddam’s regime.KEVIN DUNN: The protesters say they want an end to Saddam Hussein’s rule. Only this week Saddam was named as the sole candidate to run unopposed for another seven year term as president. The siege comes as a sensitive time in Germany. Chancellor Schroeder is facing a general election in five weeks time. He recently provoked controversy by ruling out German support for military action against Saddam. The occupiers of the embassy said their action was also a protest against Chancellor Schroeder. They call the occupation a symbolic liberation of a small piece of Iraqi territory.GWEN IFILL: Terence Smith takes the story from there.TERENCE SMITH: Joining me by telephone is Steven Erlanger, Berlin bureau chief for the New York Times. Steve, welcome. Tell us how this was resolved.STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, it got resolved quite quickly. It took five minutes. German police had been preparing to storm the embassy; they knew that people who took it were unarmed but what they needed was permission from Baghdad, because embassies are sovereign territory of the country that owns them. So once Baghdad gave its permission the German police went ahead and really it was done in about five minutes. Only two people were slightly injured in the action. According to the police, everyone was released basically unharmed and it’s over.TERENCE SMITH: And the attackers, they were taken to jail?STEVEN ERLANGER: Yes, there where are five of them. They kept saying all through the day that they were more than that. But it turned out there were only five people. They were arrested and they are being questioned by the police and presumably will be put into jail while something else happens. I don’t know what sort of charges they’ll face.TERENCE SMITH: Right. What is known about this group? It’s a new name.STEVEN ERLANGER: It is a new name and American intelligence people told us they never heard of them and the German intelligence people said the same. We believe that they may be some former Iraqi army officers who are kind of tired of slow pace of change in Iraq, maybe a bit fatigued with Iraqi national congress when is the London based coalition headed by Ahmed Challaby. It’s very hard to say. There’s some indication that they have been upset by comments by the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in which Schroeder has ruled out German participation in a war against Iraq and opposed it. But, you know, their motives still are pretty vague and we really don’t know very much about them.TERENCE SMITH: Well, do you know, for example, whether they are people who came into Germany to do this or whether they were in Germany, even resident in Germany?STEVEN ERLANGER: I don’t know for sure but I believe they were resident in Germany. Germany has given asylum to large numbers of Muslim people who have had trouble at home. Germany has a large population of Turks, of course, but other nations, other Arab peoples, and it’s very likely these were refugees from Iraq who’d been living in Germany for some time.TERENCE SMITH: Right. So far as you can understand, what was the goal? Was it to demonstrate to the world perhaps that the opposition is now ready to take forceful action?STEVEN ERLANGER: I believe so. I mean, they issued a statement. They faxed it from a Hamburg number in which they said this should be the first step toward the liberation of Iraq, liberation of Iraqi soil begins today — the taking of this little of Iraqi soil in Berlin. But there was no chance they were going to set off anything serious. I think they were looking for the kind of publicity they quite quickly reached.Even Iraqi National Congress said it had nothing to do with group and condemned this kind of action in foreign soil. They said the struggle for Iraq should take place in Iraq proper. And the White House also condemned them. And I think Germans in general will be annoyed that, you know, other people are taking their fights out on German soil. I don’t know how much benefit they got for themselves, but they certainly indicated you know that there were people willing to take risks for the principle of free Iraq. As they were quite annoyed with the sort of German official position that war against Iraq right now makes no sense.TERENCE SMITH: And the target then, was it Saddam Hussein and his government? Was it the German government or perhaps was it both?STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, I think it was mostly the government of Saddam Hussein. I think these people wanted to remind Germans that there are a lot of Iraqi who want Saddam Hussein gone to show their will and spirit. They in fact as part of their statement said that the siege of embassy was intended to make the German people, its organizations and its political powers understand that our people have the desire to be free and will act upon it.TERENCE SMITH: Well, I suppose finally, that it focuses some spotlight on Germany and in a sense makes it part of battlefield?STEVEN ERLANGER: It certainly does that. I mean, I think it embarrasses Chancellor Schroeder also. I think they were pleased that these people weren’t armed and it could end so quickly. Also, as the days go on, one will want to know how these people got into the embassy in the first place. I mean, it’s supposed to be protected by German police. And it is said to have Iraqi armed guards in it. There will be all kinds of questions asked and certainly some of them will be about German foreign policy.TERENCE SMITH: Right. Steve Erlanger, thank you very much.

The country is now home to roughly a third of Syria’s estimated million-and-a-half refugees.The NewsHour’s foreign editor, Justin Kenny, traveled to the kingdom last week and produced this report.This is Zaatari. It’s now second largest refugee camp on Earth. Just over a year ago, the site didn’t exist. Jordan’s King Abdullah now calls it his country’s fifth largest city. More than 120,000 Syrian refugees, including 60,000 children, are packed into the camp, living in tents and trailers on five square miles of dry and dusty ground, just 15 miles from their homeland’s border.They often can hear the fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the rebel Free Syrian Army. The refugees are out of the war zone, but they face plenty of new challenges.NADIA RAJA, Refugee: My children have all been sick for 20 days now.RAY SUAREZ: 25-year-old Nadia Raja and her five children arrived from Syria five weeks ago.READ: Dispatch from Jordan: Syrian Refugees Weary of War, Conferences and LifeNADIA RAJA: They have fevers. They are suffering from the hot weather, the polluted water, and from their situation in general in the camps because of the heat.RAY SUAREZ: A clean tent didn’t protect the family from Zaatari’s fly infestation. To say that life in the camp is hard is an understatement by nearly any definition. In the winter, residents endure snowstorms and flooding. In the summer, they struggle to survive temperatures that shoot above 100 degrees Fahrenheit with only limited water and no electricity.Members of the international aid community say they’re straining to keep up with the ballooning humanitarian crisis.ANDREW HARPER, Representative to Jordan, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees: I don’t think you can think it could get any worse, but it does every night.RAY SUAREZ: Andrew Harper is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ representative to Jordan. His organization oversees the camp in coordination with the Jordanian government and many other international humanitarian organizations.ANDREW HARPER: There’s over 500,000 Syrians have come through since March last year, anywhere up to 3,000 to 4,000 per night, which basically means 1,000 families. And this means 1,000 families with women and children who come across with nothing, and we have to provide everything for them. It’s — we have to provide the tents, the food, the water, the health facilities, the protection.RAY SUAREZ: A constant stream of aid trucks, nearly 500 per day, according to UNHCR, drop off supplies, including water. There are well-organized distribution centers and medical facilities and schools in the camp.Despite that, residents said, they don’t have enough to eat, clean water to drink, or adequate medical care. Only 20 percent of Zaatari’s children attend classes in the camp.10-year-old Hanin Hariri fled to Jordan with her family 10 months ago:HANIN HARIRI, Refugee: We don’t do anything. We sit in the tents all the time. We don’t play anymore.RAY SUAREZ: 20-year-old Abdul Mounim Droubi works at a bakery in the camp’s makeshift market. Unlike many others, he is able to earn meager wages. He still says, however, he’d rather go home to war than continue living as a refugee in Zaatari.ABDUL MOUNIM DROUBI, Refugee: It’s better to die there, actually, because here you would die from hunger.RAY SUAREZ: Many Syrian refugees apparently feel the same way. The Jordanian government announced this week 60,000 of them have returned home.Despite the exodus, more refugees continue to pour into the Hashemite kingdom every day, and this has put an enormous strain on Jordan. It’s a relatively poor country that already hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Iraq war and more than two million Palestinian refugees who have come in various waves over the past 65 years.Last week, the country took out a $150 million dollars World Bank loan to deal with the refugee crisis, and King Abdullah made a plea for help at a World Economic Forum.KING ABDULLAH II, Jordan: Our Jordanian population is now hosting 10 percent of its size in Syrian refugees, and this may double by year-end. The Jordanians are generously sharing scarce water and other resources. For host countries like us and Lebanon, for displaced and vulnerable Syrians, both inside and outside their country, increased humanitarian assistance from the global community is vital.RAY SUAREZ: Marwan Muasher, Jordan’s former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, is now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.MARWAN MUASHER, Vice President, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: We are, I think, coming to the limit of the situation today. You cannot, under any circumstances, deal with 20 percent overnight of your population coming to the country. The economy is already suffering, even without the Syrian crisis, from at least a 12 percent budget deficit. Water is scarce and has been scarce throughout Jordan’s history. The infrastructure, of course, cannot — cannot just absorb all these people.RAY SUAREZ: Nowhere is the impact on Jordan’s own population more apparent than in the north. Most of the country’s 500,000 Syrian refugees live outside camps and many have settled in places like Ramtha on the Syrian border. The city depended on cross-border trade with its sister city, Daraa. That trade is nonexistent today, and Ramtha’s population has surged with refugees. The cost of rent, food, and water are up; employment and wages are down.Jordanian Ali Zoubi attempts to eke out a living by working at various businesses owned by relatives in Ramtha, including in his uncle’s shoe store.ALI ZOUBI, Jordan: I feel bad for the Syrians. They had to all leave their homes. I’m not blaming them. They were forced to come here. They lost family members, brothers and sisters. But with Jordanians, things are bad, too. Jordan is a poor country and the economic conditions are bad.RAY SUAREZ: Talk to Syrian refugees or Jordanians, and it’s tough to find people who expect a political solution, instead of more war. Virtually all the refugees interviewed supported arming the opposition.The Jordanian government, however, has publicly said it is against providing arms to the Free Syrian Army.MARWAN MUASHER: Arming the opposition so far is still a problematic issue. It’s not clear that arming the opposition is going to lead to a political process that would end the conflict. It’s not clear that arming the opposition is going to lead to a reversal of the military situation on the ground.And in a country such as Jordan, a neighbor to Syria, Jordan of course is very afraid that it would be seen as interfering in the internal issues of a neighbor state. And it is Jordan’s belief that is the Syrians themselves who have to decide.RAY SUAREZ: Back at Zaatari, there are tough decisions to be made, says Andrew Harper, including cutting back water and food rations, as the conflict drags on. Harper thinks it may last a long while.ANDREW HARPER: There’s no one can give me one positive indicator from Syria that this is going to be resolved any time soon, whether it be one year, two years or beyond that.Whenever people sort of delay a meeting for a month, then it probably means another 6,000 dead in Syria. It probably means another 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 refugees. So, the bureaucratic timeline doesn’t meet the humanitarian timeline, nor the political imperative is, we do not — we do not see it as being — demonstrating the necessary urgency or importance that these people demand.RAY SUAREZ: Nadia Raja says she has no idea how long she and her family will remain refugees.NADIA RAJA: We don’t talk about it. It’s hard to know. There’s no electricity. There’s no TV. We don’t know what’s going on in the world.RAY SUAREZ: She and the others hold out varying degrees of hope of ever returning to Syria. Until that day comes, if it comes, they share the hope the world won’t forget about them.

The Morning Line: Obama to Renew Focus on Jobs | Updates | PBS NewsHour | PBS PBS NEWSHOUR WATCHpoliticsShields and BrooksSupreme CourtartsArt BeatPoetrynationSupreme CourtworldSocial EntrepreneurshipeconomyMaking Sen$eSocial SecurityAsk the HeadhunterPaul SolmanscienceScience WednesdayMiles O’BrienhealtheducationTeachersteachersThe RundownTV SCHEDULEABOUT USFEEDBACKSUBSCRIPTIONSPRIVACYJOB OPENINGS RECENT PROGRAMSPOLITICSARTSNATIONWORLDECONOMYSCIENCEHEALTHEDUCATIONTEACHERSTHE RUNDOWN SUBSCRIBEFOLLOW US TOPICS > PoliticsThe Morning Line: Obama to Renew Focus on Jobs +1 EMAIL BY David Chalian and Terence Burlij June 8, 2011 at 9:34 AM ESTPresident Obama. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.Of course, saying that while standing next to the German chancellor in the East Room of the White House is not necessarily the best backdrop.On Wednesday, he will try to put some optics to his jobs message when he appears at Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria to talk about expanding an initiative aimed at training community college students for the manufacturing jobs of the future.Christi Parsons of the Tribune Company’s Washington Bureau provides the context:“The message is not a new one for the president, but he is renewing his emphasis on it at a time when Americans are worried about a slowdown on job growth and the possibility that the economy could be headed into a second recession.”A Gallup poll out Wednesday morning helps explain why the White House has said the president will be doing weekly economy/jobs events for the foreseeable future. As a presidential candidate three years ago, Mr. Obama was battling criticism from John McCain (and Hillary Clinton) for being inexperienced and naive on the world stage, without the backbone to use America’s military might yet eager to talk with America’s enemies.Gallup reports that 63 percent of Americans approve of President Obama’s handling of terrorism, 53 percent approve of his handling of Afghanistan, and 51 percent approve of his handling of foreign affairs more broadly.Yet it’s the economy and jobs that Americans care most about, and President Obama cannot seem to find his footing there. Thirty-seven percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 60 percent disapprove.Weekly images of the president pressing a jobs message will likely do little to improve those numbers, but he must guard against the Republican line of attack that he’s completely out of touch on the top issue of concern to voters.ROMNEY LEADS THE PACKMake that two in a row for Mitt Romney.One day after a Washington Post-ABC News poll showed the former Massachusetts governor running in a dead heat with President Obama, a second survey released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University also finds Romney to be the most competitive of the GOP contenders.In the case of the Quinnipiac poll, however, Romney still trails the president by six percentage points, 47 to 41, well clear of the survey’s 2.2 percent margin of error.The three other contenders surveyed all face double-digit deficits in head-to-head matchups with President Obama.Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty trails by 12 percent, 48 to 36. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is 14 percent back, 48 to 34. And 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin runs 17 percent behind President Obama, 53 to 36.For all of the president’s disadvantages, including 9.1 percent unemployment and a clear majority of the public unhappy with his handling of the economy, it’s numbers like these that reinforce the notion that he will still pose a formidable challenge for whomever the Republican voters pick to be their nominee.Among Republican and GOP-leaning independent voters, Romney has the strongest support for the nomination with 25 percent. The only other GOP contender in double-digits is Palin, at 15 percent, although 20 percent of respondents said they were undecided.The rest of the field shapes up like this: Herman Cain at 9 percent; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul each receive 8 percent; Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann gets 6 percent; Pawlenty takes 5 percent; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum scores 4 percent; and Huntsman is in last with 1 percent.It appears the clearing out of potential candidates, such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and real estate tycoon Donald Trump, may have helped Romney put some space between himself and the rest of the GOP pack. Still, there’s a long ways to go between now and the Iowa Republican Straw Poll in August, let alone the 2012 caucuses, leaving plenty of time for another candidate to make a run, especially with 20 percent still looking for someone to support.BACHMANN AIDE TAKES ON PALINVeteran GOP strategist Ed Rollins, who only a few days ago signed on to advise Rep. Bachmann’s presidential campaign-in-waiting, has decided not to wait for the congresswoman’s official launch before going after her potential rivals.On Tuesday, he started with Palin, accusing the former Alaska governor of failing to take a serious approach to politics in the years since she was the Republican Party’s 2008 vice presidential nominee.“She has not been serious over the last couple of years,” Rollins said on a radio show hosted by Brian Kilmeade. “She got the vice presidential thing handed to her. She didn’t go to work in the sense of trying to gain more substance. She gave up her governship.”In an interview with POLITICO, Rollins went even further, contending that Rep. Bachmann would benefit by making the contrast. “People are going to say, ‘I gotta make a choice and go with the intelligent woman who’s every bit as attractive,’” Rollins said.Rep. Bachmann has said she will announce her presidential plans later this month in Iowa. Palin, meanwhile, just wrapped up a highly publicized bus tour along the East Coast, during which she divulged few details about her plans.One thing’s for certain, if both Bachmann and Palin enter the 2012 race, their pursuit of the Tea Party movement’s support will be one of the key storylines to watch.WEINER WATCHThe Anthony Weiner resignation drumbeat continues, but outside his New York home Tuesday the congressman repeated his refusal to resign.The New York Times offers this key detail:“One suggestion of his new vulnerability: Some New York Democrats have approached former Councilman Eric N. Gioia of Queens about running for Mr. Weiner’s seat, according to two people briefed on the conversations. Mr. Gioia, these people said, is open to the possibility. He declined to comment.”POLITICO’s David Catanese notes that former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine called for Rep. Weiner’s resignation. Kaine is running for a U.S. Senate in Virginia in what will likely be one of the most high-profile races next year.If Rep. Weiner can withstand the pressure from the press and his colleagues, he can likely hang on to his job at least until the ethics committee takes action.A new NY1 News/Marist poll shows city voters are in no rush to see him quit.“An exclusive NY1-Marist poll shows that 51 percent of city voters want Weiner to remain in office. Only 30 percent believe he should resign and 18 percent are unsure.”For more political coverage, visit our politics page.Sign up here to receive the Morning Line in your inbox every morning.
