How Social Media Saved #Hothlanta

Atlanta gets pretty hot in the summer, so people call it “Hotlanta.” But this week it’s more like Hoth — the ice planet from “Star Wars.” And so the hashtag “#Hothlanta” started trending. (A similar thing happened in the 2011 storm with its own #Hothlanta Flickr group.) The sky was clear that morning — no [...] more »

It was the most direct mea culpa yet from a top administration official. The first senior official to publicly answer questions from lawmakers, Tavenner is being grilled not only on what went wrong with HealthCare.gov, but also whether lawmakers can trust promises to have things running efficiently by the end of November.She firmly refused to provide current enrollment numbers, saying repeatedly they will not be available until mid-November.Tavenner’s appearance follows the testimony last week of outside contractors who said there wasn’t enough time to test the complex online enrollment system. It froze up the day it was launched, Oct. 1.At stake is what the Republicans’ partial government shutdown could not achieve: a delay of President Barack Obama’s law expanding coverage for uninsured Americans. As a result of widespread sign-up problems, even some Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for a one-year postponement of the law’s tax penalties for the remaining uninsured. The insurance industry warns that would saddle the new system with too many high-cost patients.In prepared testimony, Tavenner acknowledged the initial performance “has not lived up to the expectations of the American people and is not acceptable.” But she also seconded administration talking points that despite the website problems the law is living to its promise of quality, affordable health insurance for those who don’t have access to workplace coverage.Less well known than Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Tavenner was closer to the day-to-day work of setting up the enrollment website, which was handled by experts within her agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, along with outside contractors. Like other administration officials, she previously had assured Congress that everything was on track for a reasonably smooth launch in all 50 states.“If people can’t navigate such a dysfunctional and overly complex system, is it fair for the IRS to impose tax penalties?” said Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich. In a concession, the White House has said it will waive penalties for anyone who signs up by March 31, in effect granting a limited grace period.Tavenner began her career as a nurse and built a successful record as a hospital executive before entering public service. Seen as a businesslike manager, she has enjoyed support from lawmakers across the political spectrum. Indeed, Republicans are calling for Sebelius to resign, not Tavenner. But the Medicare chief’s professional reputation is also at stake.On Monday, a spokeswoman acknowledged Tavenner’s central role. The Medicare agency “has said we are responsible for the issues the website is currently facing,” communications director Julie Bataille said. As administrator, Tavenner “has been in charge of the overall … implementation effort.”What Tavenner knew about the potential for problems and whom she told will be key questions from lawmakers. Additionally, some are concerned about the security of the HealthCare.gov site. Others worry about unintended consequences from the feverish, hasty work to repair the site.Sebelius is likely to face some of the same questions Wednesday when she appears before another powerful House panel, the Energy and Commerce Committee.Momentum to fix the problems has grown since Obama personally acknowledged the problems last week. He sent in management consultant Jeff Zients to assess the situation. By the end of the week, Zients reported that he had two big lists with dozens of needed fixes, and said he was optimistic they could be completed by Nov. 30.HHS also announced that an outside company would assume the role of general contractor shepherding the fixes, in effect taking over the coordination job that Tavenner’s agency had been doing.Although the administration has released a blizzard of statistics on the numbers of people visiting the website, opening accounts and having their income verified by the Internal Revenue Service, it has yet to say how many have successfully enrolled for health insurance.The website was supposed to be the online portal to coverage for people who don’t have a health plan on the job. Its target audience is not only uninsured Americans but those who already purchase coverage individually. A companion site for small businesses has also run into problems.Under the law, middle-class people can qualify for tax credits to make private health insurance more affordable, while low-income people will be steered to Medicaid in states agreeing to expand that safety net program.By Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTERHEATH CARE LAW PREVIOUS POSTView the 11 creepiest objects in the Smithsonian collection this HalloweenNEXT POST 15 years ago today, John Glenn returned to space on STS95 Are you aware of our comment policy?Beginning October 24, 2012, PBS NewsHour will allow open commenting for all registered users.

Talking About War | Did Romney Win Over Skeptics? | Feedback Forum | Transcript
BRANCACCIO: Welcome to NOW. 66 years ago, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor plunged a reluctant United States into a four-year odyssey now known as the Second World War.
This fall, that journey was documented over 14 and a half hours by filmmaker Ken Burns and his team.
As you may have seen, the journey was filled with stories of great courage and sacrifice but that doesn't make it easier to confront the abject horrors at its center.
When we look closely at warfare it raises profound questions—about how the waging of war intersects with our notion of a democratic society.
With me are the producer directors of this remarkable television series, Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, and Dr. James Forbes, the Senior Minister Emeritus of the interdenominational Riverside Church in New York. Welcome. Ken Burns, you've actually shown pieces of this series to veterans of the Second World War. When the lights come up at the end of these screenings, what kind of effects are you seeing?
BURNS: We had one veteran with tears steaming down his cheeks. That I've waited all my life for somebody to tell it the way it was. Thank you. Or someone just exploding, and a family member running out of the room. They'd never seen their dad cry. And it turns out he was just remembering lost buddies. And he couldn't tell that. They were buddies acquired after he left home, and gone before he got home. And there's no one to talk to for 60 plus years.
BRANCACCIO: And surely we have to make it clear, if we were in the role of listening, that we're going to be supportive. You have an important figure in the film, Sascha Weinzheimer. And she, as a young girl, was a prisoner of the Japanese in occupied Philippines. She gets back, and she says very vividly she didn't think people really wanted to hear her story.
BURNS: Right.
BRANCACCIO: So she clammed up. Her words.
NOVICK: Yeah, you know, I think it—it's very difficult for the people who have been through these experiences to come home and be filled with all these complicated feelings of what they've done and what they've seen, and to feel very alienated. And I think one of the most heartbreaking parts of the film for me is seeing how alienated and isolated they feel when they first come home, and—and the people that they love can't understand them and don't really want to know what they've been through.
And there's this essential loneliness. This is partly why they did clam up and not talk about it for so long. And I think we have to remember that we have, I believe, sort of a moral obligation to let them—to give them room to bear witness to the difficult and dark and complicated parts of what they went through, and to really feel that it's safe to do that.
That we will listen, we will understand and will not judge. We will let them tell us honestly what happened. Because that is the best way that we can kind of honor them, is if we actually know what it was like. If we don't know what it was like, then we're not really participating in this process at all.
BRANCACCIO: You have Sam Hynes, he says, "There will always be plenty of evil. And there will always be plenty of wars. Because human beings are aggressive animals," he said. He might just as easily, instead of aggressive, said evil. And if you share that kind of conclusion with somebody, it's very difficult to live with. It's a dark vision.
FORBES: Yes. It's self-incriminating to acknowledge that what we saw at work in our enemies, we also see at work in ourselves. And can you imagine the amount of shame and guilt that you carry around, alongside your sense of valor and your sense of courage. They're all mixed up in there. I mean, guilt is bad enough. But when there's sort of guilt and also a sense of glory at the same time, it's almost too complicated to talk about.
BURNS: And we don't have the traditional way of conveniently reducing the Second World War into a set of causes and then effects. But in fact, say at a very elemental level in the first sentence, that it's—it came about because of ancient human emotions that seem in their listing, so petty: jealousy, anger, rage, victimhood. And—and they—and it ended because other more positive emotions come.
So we see in—in the cauldron of the Second World War, incredible forces massing, not only against each other, but within ourselves. And there are moments at the darkest points of this film, in the fifth and the sixth episode, and even indeed, in the Holocaust, where we have to meet face to face with the demon who is also us. That in order to win the war, you have to kill millions of civilians.
You have to actually train a generation of young men to become professional killers. And then, of course, war, the lie of civilization, requires you to, when it's over, say, okay, don't be professional killers again. And that's where a good deal of the compartmentalizing of these memories takes place.
BRANCACCIO: You hear Quentin Aannenson. He writes this amazing letter to his fiancé that he never sends. At the beginning. He says, "I live in a world of death." But later, he goes on to say, "I am not the same person you said goodbye to. No one could go through this and not change. We are all casualties," he says. And you're seeing this 60 some odd years later, people are still feeling that they're casualties.
NOVICK: It does rearrange their molecules in some way, and it—it—it shapes them. It's just—there's no way to get around that.
So you see it in the way that they choose to tell their story, in the way that they've lived their lives, in their relationship with their family, and how they think about the world. It's—it's part of who they are. They'd been through this ordeal. And if they'd come through it, even with all the complications and baggage. They went about their lives with incredible motivation and sort of direction.
And most of the people that we met have done that. They've sort of put it away—maybe emotionally, that wasn't so good. But for practical purposes, it enabled them to go on and be productive citizens and have happy family lives, and really sort of live life to the fullest. And yet, there's this little piece back there that's still a secret. And I think there's where the—at the end of their lives, to put it all together, and sort of maybe become whole in some way. It's important to tell.
BRANCACCIO: Dr. Forbes, there'll be many people who are left feeling they're in pain—having watched some of this, maybe it dredged up long suppressed things that had happened. As a pastor, you often have to figure out ways for, with people who come to you in pain. What are some ways forward?
FORBES: You know, I have always counseled people to trust the body. It's amazing how the body functions sometimes to, in a sense, dull our senses of some things that would be so painful, that we'd be devastated. So just trust the body. Kind of if it says cry, cry. If it says, take a long walk, take a long—just take your clues from what's inside you. Because we've been, in a sense, made with capability of dealing with grief. Because loss is a part of life and vulnerability too. So that's the first thing.
But the second is the stories. You've got to—you've got to—you've got to find somebody you can tell the story to. I mean, the loneliness that requires you to keep your pain inside yields to so many of the atrocities we have seen. And so, that's another thing. There are religious motifs, also. People need to recognize that they are forgiven. That's a—and we need a blanket statement that we're all needing to be forgiven, all of us.
The ones that did nothing, the ones that did something. The ones that were conscientious objectors. The ones that were just supplying the medicals, the medics. All of us, when we look at it, were inadequate to the enormity of the requirement in that hour. And also, the arts. I guess different folks will find a way. Go to see a film. Listen to some good jazz.
BURNS: Yes, sir.
FORBES: I mean, people say that's not the right thing to do. Don't let anybody tell you what to do. Do what in a sense, makes it possible for you to find the energy to continue to be a human being functioning in a complex world, where you recognize that there's grace. Nobody's going to be perfect. But there's grace. These things, I think, are often the margin of difference between those of us who crash completely and those of us who muddle our way through until a brighter day.
BRANCACCIO: Maybe even write the stories. Eugene Sledge—
BURNS: Right.
BRANCACCIO:—from Mobile, Alabama. He did this amazing contemporaneous diary of his experience. But he came back, as—as your films depict him—he was functioning, but he was troubled?
BURNS: He was very troubled. He could not turn off that compelling dynamic of war. He could not get it out of his head. He had gone off with some, of course, fraudulent vision of what war is. He went off, caught up in that enthusiasm, and was immediate—immediately put into at Peleliu and Okinawa, experiences no human being should ever have to witness. And he could not let this go.
And yet, he found, by taking these notes and scribbled ideas, some of them written in the margins of a New Testament, he found an ability to work his way through it. And he produced such a directly honest memoir. And this is what we—what the whole equation is about, that we've been talking about here. He was so undeniably honest about what he'd seen. And he saw the both sides of it. He'd seen his complicity in the evil. He understood generationally, what his men—his friends had had to do, and how they were on the right.
But he put it in the context of sheer horror of combat, and left us a—a monument of honesty.
BRANCACCIO: I understand that Ray Leopold from Waterbury, Connecticut, who is such a vivid voice, he's recently passed away?
BURNS: He recently passed away, yeah.
BRANCACCIO: Thank goodness you got his story.
BURNS: Well, we said—we sort of in the beginning, as we were constructing the proposals, that we wanted to get to know these people like they were our family members. Or somebody that you could meet at Thanksgiving. And we did. And so, when we lost Ray, it was just intolerable. And that's the kind of urgency that we hadn't really realized, would overtake us in the making of this film.
BRANCACCIO: Well, see, this is key. Because there are many people who have lost the person in their family that may have been most connected to the Second World War. Either that veteran or person on the home front didn't want to share these stories, or it never came up in conversation. And they'll be feeling a sense of frustration, that it's—that it's almost too late.
Ray Leopold looks just like my grandfather, Hyman Fleischer, who served in Europe in the Second World War. He got a Purple Heart. He was wounded. Would never talk about his wartime experiences. He would have a quick quip or joke. And change the conversation.
We lost him. I can't have that conversation. But there may be some things people in my situation, watching this film, could do.
NOVICK: Yes. I mean, if you—if you had a relative who was in the war and you don't have a chance to speak with them because they're gone, there's many different ways you can find out details about what they actually did and where they were, if you have the time and the patience. If you know the unit they were in, you can request documents of where that unit was. You can get the files from the government about their service record. You can go to reunions. You can contact people on the internet. There's all kinds of ways to reach out to people who can fill in the blanks for you about just physically where were they, what did they do. Anyone who might remember them.
You'd be amazed what you can find just by reaching out to people.
FORBES: And—and I'm expecting that the—the film will do that. That people electronically will—will build community again. And that if there is one lonely veteran who does not know where people are who were in his group, if there's anybody else surviving, it'd be fascinating to see what is the process by which we rebuild community? We connect those bones so that someone says, "Is there somebody alive who is in Sacramento who was—who was in my unit?" So, rebuilding community is the antidote to a war, perhaps, that if it comes, and if violence is there, what can we do to reconnect?
BURNS: And there's an embedded message in the—in the story of the Second World War, as well, that isn't just the reality of combat that we are trying to capture, but the sense of community. That in shared sacrifice we made ourselves richer. That's a paradox. We made ourselves richer. And today, we kind of feel a poverty of spirit. That we're all independent free agents. We're making ourselves richer. And at the same time, there is a sense of not being connected. And one of the things that I felt oozing out of each of the stories here was that sense of how much more powerful and enriched our lives are when we're working together for a kind of common purpose. And that was clearly what was going on in the Second World War.
BRANCACCIO: Now, Ken, you've really started something here. Because there'll be some people watching this series who will draw from it the sense that we need a very strong military that is very—well stocked in preparation for whatever the next assault is. And that there'll be a—a hawkish conclusion drawn from your work. There'll be others watching this who see it as an argument to think hard before deploying military power. Those are the types of discussions around the television set or a dining room table that can bring the house down. Does that concern you?
BURNS: No. I think that's exactly what you want to have. And I do expect that there'll probably be an increasement in enlistment as a result of this. And—and a strengthening of many people's anti-war feelings.
I mean, we're showing—it's all about arithmetic. This is the calculus of war. It's horrific. And—and I think, as Sam Hynes says in the opening moments of the war, "There's no such thing as a good war."
And the Second World War has been smothered in that gallant bloodless myth. "There are only necessary wars," he said. And I think it's incumbent upon a democratic society to evaluate what the arithmetic is, the cost of war. And to make sure, particularly in a democratic society, where we actually have the ability to elect the leaders who make the decisions—
NOVICK: Yeah.
BURNS:—that we make decisions about going only to wars that are necessary. Because, as Sam Hynes also said, there's evil in the world. There will always be wars. So we—we, obviously, want to have a strong military. We want to be prepared. But we also want to be mindful of the huge, huge cost. And this is what we have to come face to face with. And so if a film, in any way, initiates that dialogue, let's pray that it is a measured and compassionate and thoughtful dialogue.
FORBES: You know, I—if—if there's an argument at a family between—doves and the hawks, I would wish to say to them I could not imagine that we could ever have won that war if there had not been some sense of national purpose that united members of our nation and of the axis itself. So, whether you're a hawk or a dove, you've gotta be working to discover what is it that unifies us? What is it that makes us a nation where even blacks and whites (and the race issue is in this war, in this film as well). What is it that we affirm so strongly together that even if we differed in perspectives, we would be willing to make a sacrifice because we, as a nation, have this sense of purpose.
We've got this sense of vocation. We've got this set of values. So the—the—let—let me visit the—the dining room table in somebody's home and say look folks, let's see to it that we never go to war unless we have something of a unifying sense of why we're doing it.
And then, when the war comes, if it must, though I'm gonna fight against the war, using that word, let's make sure that we are so clear that we are one people with a purpose of liberty and justice and peace for us all. That we will sacrifice even our lives in order that we will pass onto another generation a world in which family is not just a term we use for three people living in the same house. But for the nation and, ultimately, for the world.
BRANCACCIO: There's, among the dark themes of these episodes, is this life affirming theme of the allies could not have pulled this off unless the country moved forward with something close to unity.
BURNS: That's exactly right. And let's not—let's remember that there were people across the whole political spectrum that we have today. I mean, people had a variety of—of political beliefs, just as we find.
But—but they're in the service of working together, not—spending their entire lives pointing out how we're different. And that's what we do today in our media culture. And so, yes, we had that diversity of political beliefs.
And, obviously, torn on the bias and questions of race and language and region of the country. But, still, we were able to find a common cause, and to do it. And, of course, this is the essence, the other paradox of war is that it is, of course, the worst of us.
But it also brings out the best of us. We see not just the obvious things, the bravery and courage, and I don't mean to diminish them by saying obvious. But this is what war reminds us of, of—of extraordinary acts of bravery and human courage.
But we also see tenderness and love and brotherhood and fellowship. This is a—this is a war that forever—it—it let the genie out of the bag. We were no longer gonna be able to go back to Jim Crow in the south. We weren't gonna be able to permit these things.
It was just not possible. If you existed in a—in a foxhole—with a brother, he's your brother. That's what it is. In the Battle of the Bulge, when the Germans—dropped—behind our lines wearing American uniforms, who was the most American of soldiers coming around the bend?
An African-American soldier. That's gonna completely blow your mind and change forever how you're gonna see things. So we're gonna find Jackie Robinson coming out of this thing.
We're gonna find Dr. King coming out of this, and Rosa Parks. We're gonna find women now in the marketplace and asking for new things.
We're gonna find Dr. King coming out of this, and Rosa Parks. We're gonna find women now in the marketplace and asking for new things. This war is going to change things. And I—I—I think it, in many ways—for the better. So we have—byproducts which are horrific. The worst—the worst body-count in human history. And we also have some pretty powerful positive things that we can take from this.
BRANCACCIO: A conversation that I have no doubt is going to be continued in households all across America. Ken Burns, Lynn Novick and James Forbes, thank you very much.
NOVAK: Thank you.
FORBES: Thank you.
BRANCACCIO: You can learn even more about the war and find links to NOW's sound and video archives over on our website. PBS.org is the place to start.
I want to leave you this week with a gentle reminder. If you value what you see here. And on other PBS programs including Bill Moyer's Journal and Frontline, and you want to see more programs like it, this is the time to cast your vote by giving generously to support your local Public Television station.
And that's it for NOW. From New York, I'm David Brancaccio. We'll see you next week.

The First Time Around
Jeff Zeleny wrote a series of articles profiling Obama's first year in the Senate (see related links sidebar). Also included are interviews with Barack and Michelle Obama. (Dec. 24, 2005)
Obama in Senate: Star Power, Minor Role
A 2008 New York Times article.
Pete Rouse Chief of staff to Sen. Obama
Read the full interview >
What was the thought early on about where he was going [in the Senate]?
Early in the first year we put together a plan that had basically three parts. The first was demonstrating that he was serious about being a senator for Illinois and delivering for Illinois. ... The legislative activities he did were primarily geared toward Illinois: the highway bill and environmental public works, ethanol for downstate Illinois and alternative energy. ...
The second was to fit into the Senate, to rise in the Senate and to show that he was a team player; that he was not a headline hunter; that he deserved better committee assignments; that he could help the leadership. ...
The third element, talking about his vision for the future, was to start to raise his profile; get people looking at him, maybe the elites and the press, as somebody who did have ideas and something different to say. And that was just seeding the ground for whatever happened in the future. ...
There's also a view out there that when he came to the Senate, he wasn't really too serious about it; that the way the Senate worked was not to his liking, not the way he operated. …
Whether or not he would be comfortable in the Senate, I think the jury was out on that. Any freshman in an organization like that -- any freshman with talent -- is going to be frustrated looking for an opportunity to move forward. You'll have an energy idea, and someone will say, "You can't do that because senator so-and-so has been doing it for 20 years." … There's a lot of that … and he might have even been frustrated more than others. …
I don't think he would have been a long-term senator. He's not on the path to being in the leadership, to stay three, four terms. But I think it was a little early to make the determination that he was not going to like the Senate. I think he just had the freshman blues. ...
One of the benefits of running when he ran is not having too long a record. [Former Sen. Tom] Daschle [D-S.D.] told him, "There's an open window here, and maybe it's not a bad thing not to have a long record." Explain your point of view on that.
I think that's right. ... He didn't have 20 years of votes to go back and people to pick up. They're doing a good job claiming he's a flip-flopper now, and he was only there for a couple of years. Imagine what you can do with a record, what they're doing to McCain on the tax cuts and so forth and so on. ... It's not the reason to run, and it doesn't mean, obviously, that you can't run with a record. But the Senate, half those votes are calculated to put people on the spot, to give them trouble running for re-election, never mind higher office. ...
Ben Wallace-Wells Rolling Stone
Obama arrives in Washington and he's already got this kind of sense of momentum and celebrity. In his personal life this is sort of a new thing for him. He's been [a] family man in Chicago for 15 years at this point. He's part-time in the [state] Senate in Springfield, but he's basically living a Hyde Park life, not famous, not anything like that. And suddenly he moved to Washington and there's been this kind of disjointed experience. He's in Washington three days a week; he's going back to Illinois every weekend. He's got the shower that doesn't work. So for him it's a sort of disruptive experience.
During this time he looks tired, a little worn. He's a guy who's very fit, but he looks like the whole experience of this is sort of getting to him. There was a story that one of his staffers told me. He goes in with Obama to the first meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee, which is Obama's big play. And [Sen.] Joe Biden [D-Del.] is chairing the meeting, and it's a [secretary of state] confirmation for Condoleezza Rice. The staff is extremely excited to be in the meeting with Obama. And it's the first big committee meeting. They got the sense that this guy's the next Bobby Kennedy. And so it's kind of a historic moment.
And midway through the meeting Biden is just going on and on. Obama, looking very serious, scribbles a little note on a piece of paper and passes it back to his aide. And the aide's very excited because this is the first communication from Obama. And the note says, "Shoot me now. Shoot, period. Me, period. Now, period."
Jeff Zeleny The New York Times
On the week before he was sworn into the United States Senate, he was the cover story and picture on Newsweek magazine. You saw the Newsweek of him next to the Time man of the year, who was George W. Bush at the time.
So here was a 43-year-old Illinois state senator. He hadn't even been sworn in, and he was on the cover of Newsweek magazine. It really rankled some of the senators who would be his colleagues. …
Did he have an apparatus around him then, a group that was looking into the future? Or was he doing it himself? He definitely had an apparatus around him. It was mainly the people who ran his Senate campaign, some of whom are running his presidential campaign. He had a very small group of advisers who very carefully protected and crafted his brand. At the very beginning they would have meetings and things, like, what should 2005 be for Obama? They wanted more than anything else to make him look serious.
He is a serious guy, very smart. But he also was on the cover of People magazine and things. So they wanted more than anything else to make him look like a serious senator. So from the very beginning, everything was done with that in mind. …
He gets to the Senate. Are you hearing buzz that this is a guy who's got one eye cocked for the presidency?
At the time, Obama was not thinking about -- or at least talking about -- the presidential campaign. What was being discussed was, he would likely run for governor of Illinois. He would go back to Illinois all the time and have town meetings. I think he had some 30 or 40 in all parts of the state that first year. I went back with him to many of them, and he would take questions from voters. In hindsight, it sort of looks like what his presidential campaign became, his town meetings. But at the time, he was simply trying to show people that he was the senator from Illinois. …
And presumably trying to keep his head down so that the rock star status didn't incite other Democrats. ...
Obama, in the first year of his time in the Senate, he declined all invitations to appear on Sunday morning shows from January through September. The only time he agreed to go on was after Hurricane Katrina had struck New Orleans. He said he just thought he had to go on and speak at that point. But he declined Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week, etc., specifically to keep his head down. …
[The Senate is] a seniority system. He was the last person to ask a question on every committee hearing. So he would have to sit there for at least two hours before he could be heard. There was no question that he was very much a freshman, no question at all. So even though people knew his name and other Democrats were not household names, he was very much at the bottom of the rung.
Somebody who had [potentially] the same kind of problem is Hillary Clinton. How were Hillary and Obama about each other? At the time, Clinton and Obama were very friendly to one another. She had flown to Chicago a couple times to help raise money for him in his Senate race. And he would tell one story of how he was so impressed and gratified at how helpful she had been. She had been testifying on the Hill in the summer of '04. There was a big thunderstorm and her plane was supposed to take off for Chicago. She was held up a couple hours. She was flying to do a fund-raiser for him. He was on the phone with her, as he would recount later, and said, "Hey, you don't have to come." And she's, "No, I'm going to come."
He felt that he sort of was indebted to her in some ways. They would have private meetings at the beginning. And he was going to sort of follow her plan for what she did in the Senate, in terms of working hard and keeping her head down. But he said one thing to me, I think in January, February '05. He said, "But I don't come here to the Senate with all the baggage that she came [with] as a former first lady." So he was at that moment drawing a big distinction with how he was arriving versus how she was arriving. …
There are famous moments with McCain. Tell me about that.
McCain and Obama had an unusual episode of friction. I don't think they really knew one another up until this point. They were both going to be on legislation for campaign finance reform. … [Sen.] Harry Reid [D-Nev.] had made [Obama] the [Democratic] point person, because he was viewed as this clean, upcoming upstart, if you will, who didn't have the baggage from being in Washington for a long time. … And one afternoon in the middle of the summer, Obama had written a letter to McCain. Editor's Note: Read the exchange of letters between Obama and McCain.
McCain has always had the role of ethics reform and campaign finance reform. So there was a bit of tension from the start. Obama got crossways with Sen. McCain when he came to a meeting and he said, "You know what? We're not going to do this bipartisan effort. We're just going to push the Democratic bill through." It incensed McCain. He sent a letter to the press. And then he sent it to Obama. It's how Washington works. If you want to communicate something, you write a letter, but you release it to everyone first.
And McCain called him disingenuous. … It was an internal Senate thing, which was not that big of a deal outside the Beltway. But inside Washington, it was really a precursor for things to come. It was a three- or four-day back and forth with McCain and Obama sort of taking the mantle of who was the bigger reformer. …
So at the end of that week they sort of playfully mugged for the cameras. But it showed one thing: McCain was a little aggravated by this young man, Obama. …
How was Obama through this process? …
He was very deferential to his elders in the Senate throughout. But he did not back down from this. I think it was one of the early examples of him showing people that he had a spine, had his own way to approach things, and he would stick to his guns. …
Lindsey Graham Senator (R-S.C.)
Read the full interview >
Let's talk a little bit about Barack Obama, your earliest impressions of him.
I haven't interacted with him that much. … I can only tell you about my experience with him and it was on immigration.
Now let me tell you, that's tough politics. … The immigration comprehensive bill was a big moment a couple years ago. That's where [Sen.] Ted Kennedy [D-Mass.], myself, [Sen.] Jon Kyl [R-Ariz.], and [Sen.] Ken Salazar [D-Colo.], along with Secretary [of Commerce Carlos] Gutierrez and [Secretary of Homeland Security Michael] Chertoff sit in a room for about three months going over every line of a bill. It was a bill where the senators actually get involved. We probably had 30, 40 senators coming in and out of those meetings.
Sen. Obama was one of those senators. He'd come in at times and make a contribution. He's not a regular participant, but he shows up at the end and he's got three things he wants or two things he wants. Kyl didn't want to give it to him; I did … because I know he's somebody that people pay attention to. We needed every vote we could get and we needed all the people we could to push this ball. The left hated the bill because of the labor unions. Labor unions hated the temporary worker program. … The right didn't like the path to citizenship, the ability of allowing people to come out of the shadows and have a legal status. …
So we get on the floor. You get some people doing the union bidding, trying to undo the temporary worker program. They reduce the numbers in half, but we could live with it, fix it in conference. Obama started voting in a way to undercut the temporary worker program. I went to him at least once and said: "We can't do this. This will destroy the deal." …
Finally it all blew up. Not only had he started voting the wrong way to undo the deal, he offered an amendment himself that would have sunsetted the temporary worker program after five years. What do you go tell the people on your side, the businesspeople who need access to labor? "Your program goes away after five years." …
That just made me very, very mad. … I thought instead of sticking to the deal, he gave in to pressure from the left, and the pressure from the left and right was enormous. So that did not sit well with me.
Did you talk to him about it?
I didn't talk to him until I got up and spoke against his amendment. I maybe went a little overboard, but it was a genuine reaction. I thought that Obama undercut the deal that he wanted to be part of… [and] did not live up to the spirit of what we were trying to do. And that's my experience with him. …
Inexperience? Naiveté? That's probably the first time in a genuine way that he's ever had pushback from those that have been his support network, and that he's relied upon, and that he knows he needs to go to the next level. I have been there. It's scary. The first time my name was mentioned on Rush Limbaugh in a negative way, my office freaked out. … I think it was an overwhelming experience for him.

Transcript: Chapter 6 - Common Depression
NARRATION: (TERRIE WILLIAMS IN OFFICE) Terrie Williams started out as a social worker and
NARRATION: (PHOTOS WITH EDDIE MURPHY AND MILES DAVIS) Later became public relations agent to some of Hollywood's top celebrities, including Eddie Murphy and Miles Davis.
A few years after launching her public relations business, Terrie's energy and drive began to fade. She was suffering from a mild but chronic form of depression called dsythymia.
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (OC) Here you are landing another major name, and you really just don't feel it anymore. And it was having to pretend that I was excited about signing them, and I really wasn't. Because I was really-- "I was dying inside."
NARRATION: (TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) dysthymia afflicts millions of Americans and often goes unrecognized, as was the case for Terrie.
DR. CHARLES NEMEROFF: (VO, TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) Oftentimes when we talk about depression, we're talking about very severe depression, I've had patients say to me, "I'm so depressed I can't answer the phone because the phone, seems like it weighs 100 pounds." On the other end of the extreme,
DR. CHARLES NEMEROFF: (OC) but still pathological, is a low-grade smoldering bad depression. It's not so severe that you can't work or go to school. But it's there.
NARRATION: (TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT)An estimated ten to fifteen million Americans live with dysythmia, a condition that is characterized by symptoms that persist for two years or more.
Terrie's symptoms included fatigue, trouble concentrating and compulsive overeating.
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (VO, TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) I would come home, eat junk food, all times of the night. At some point, the food wasn't enough and I would just weep. And it was-- it was frightening to me
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (OC) because during those moments, I just felt that this was the end of the world and I was having what I understood to be a nervous breakdown
NARRATION: (PHOTO OF TERRIE WILLIAMS) Terrie sought professional help, which included medication and talk therapy.
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (VO, PHOTO OF TERRIE WILLIAMS) There's power in naming it. Do you know? I remember when my when my psychiatrist said to me, "You are clinically depressed." I almost felt like
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (OC) something inside of me jumped up. It's, like [sigh], thank you. You put a name to this and it's something that's treatable.
NARRATION: (TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) For thirty years, Terrie lived with the symptoms of depression, but never fully realized the seriousness of her illness.
Terrie believes stigma, which she sees as pervasive in the African American community, played a role in the denial of her condition.
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (VO, TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) Many of us would rather tell somebody that we have
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (OC) a relative in jail or on drugs before we will ever utter mental illness.
NARRATION: (TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) Terrie believes that persistent racism contributes to feelings of hopelessness among African Americans.
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (VO, TERRIE WILLIAMS AT RESPECT EVENT) You get used to, feeling bad that you think that that's how you are supposed to feel, that you are supposed to
TERRIE WILLIAMS: (OC) carry the world on your shoulders and not complain. That's how so many black men and women have come to feel.
NARRATION: (PHILIP BURGUIERES IN ELEVATOR) Philip Burguieres can relate to Terrie's experience. He too soldiered through low grade depression, and fell prey to its stigma, which he believes is acute among corporate executives.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES IN ELEVATOR) I am in the sixth month of my tenure as CEO of a Fortune 100 company. My mind seems to have taken on a life of its own, distant from my physical body. But the effects on my body are evident.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES AT DESK) I have sleepless nights, and the smallest of things agitate me. I want out, but I am stuck, because I have never quit anything in my life.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES AT DESK) I functioned with low level depression for a couple years and, uh--
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) and functioned pretty well. You know? There's a term called fake it till you make it. You know, I kind of faked it for a long period of time.
NARRATION: (PHOTOS OF PHILIP BURGUIERES) Once the youngest CEO of a fortune 500 company, Philip twice took million dollar companies and turned them into multi-billion dollar enterprises.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHOTOS OF PHILIP BURGUIERES) "When I ran Cameron Iron Works, I had a mistress."
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) And I would actually sneak out on Sunday mornings and-- and tell my wife, I'm-- "I gotta run to the grocery store." And I'd go to work for two hours. And so my mistress that I would sneak out to was my work.
NARRATION: (SILHOUETTE OF PHILIP BURGUIERES IN WINDOWS) For sixteen long years, Philip buried himself in his work, ignoring his symptoms, until he collapsed in his office from a severe panic attack.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES LOOKING OUT OF STADIUM WINDOWS) Literally almost overnight, it was, "I can't handle it anymore." It was a
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) grade-A, level ten depression, I mean, like an atomic bomb went off. And-- And that's when I, you know, guess had the-- the sense to check myself into a mental institution 'cause I could no longer handle it.
NARRATION: (NEWSPAPER ARTICLE) The Wall Street Journal and Houston Chronicle cited stress related reasons for his abrupt departure. The public humiliation he felt and his company's plummeting stock only added to his distress.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, NEWSPAPER ARTICLE) I was 100% convinced
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) that my wife and my two children would be better off without me.
NARRATION: (PHOTO OF PHILIP BURGUIERES) Safe in a hospital, he met another patient who encouraged him to speak out.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHOTO OF PHILIP BURGUIERES) She looked me right in the eye. And she said, "Philip,
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) I'm not gonna make it." She said, "But you are." And she said, "I want you to promise me something. When you make it, I want you to promise me that you'll tell your story, because you can help other people."
NARRATION: (PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE) Philip took his story public in Houston before a group of business leaders. This action inspired executives the world over to seek his advice about their own battles with depression.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC, PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE) "Five different medication, you could almost go down the list. Every one of them caused my anxiety level to go through the roof, so I was..."
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE) My experience in uh, people that I work with, uh, executive level, et cetera,
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) it's about 50% will some time during their career suffer from a serious clinical depression.
NARRATION: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE) The consequences of untreated depression can be severe. Every year, there are approximately 650,000 reported suicide attempts in America, as Philip knows only too well.
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (VO, PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE)I got a call from a gentleman here in Houston, worked for one of the biggest companies in the world,
PHILIP BURGUIERES: (OC) he had loaded a gun and put it to his head and cocked it. And, uh, he called it(?)-- called me the next day. And of course I did everything I could to get him in a hospital that afternoon, which I did.
NARRATION: (PHILIP BURGUIERES ON PHONE) In an odd twist of fate, Philip would discover that the act of encouraging others to seek treatment would later help him in his own recovery.

Great Performances . Educational Resources . Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory . Overview | PBS
Dr. Howard Gardner, a psychologist and professor of neuroscience from Harvard University, developed the theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) in 1983. The theory challenged traditional beliefs in the fields of education and cognitive science. Unlike the established understanding of intelligence -- people are born with a uniform cognitive capacity that can be easily measured by short-answer tests -- MI reconsiders our educational practice of the last century and provides an alternative.
According to Howard Gardner, human beings have nine different kinds of intelligence that reflect different ways of interacting with the world. Each person has a unique combination, or profile. Although we each have all nine intelligences, no two individuals have them in the same exact configuration -- similar to our fingerprints. To read about the benefits of MI and for tips on implementing MI in your classroom, visit the Tips section. For additional MI resources, visit the Resources section.
For Gardner, intelligence is:
the ability to create an effective product or offer a service that is valued in a culture;
a set of skills that make it possible for a person to solve problems in life;
the potential for finding or creating solutions for problems, which involves gathering new knowledge.
HOWARD GARDNER'S NINE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES:
1. Linguistic Intelligence: the capacity to use language to express what's on your mind and to understand other people. Any kind of writer, orator, speaker, lawyer, or other person for whom language is an important stock in trade has great linguistic intelligence.
2. Logical/Mathematical Intelligence: the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system, the way a scientist or a logician does; or to manipulate numbers, quantities, and operations, the way a mathematician does.
3. Musical Rhythmic Intelligence: the capacity to think in music; to be able to hear patterns, recognize them, and perhaps manipulate them. People who have strong musical intelligence don't just remember music easily, they can't get it out of their minds, it's so omnipresent.
4. Bodily/Kinesthetic Intelligence: the capacity to use your whole body or parts of your body (your hands, your fingers, your arms) to solve a problem, make something, or put on some kind of production. The most evident examples are people in athletics or the performing arts, particularly dancing or acting.
5. Spatial Intelligence: the ability to represent the spatial world internally in your mind -- the way a sailor or airplane pilot navigates the large spatial world, or the way a chess player or sculptor represents a more circumscribed spatial world. Spatial intelligence can be used in the arts or in the sciences.
6. Naturalist Intelligence: the ability to discriminate among living things (plants, animals) and sensitivity to other features of the natural world (clouds, rock configurations). This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers; it continues to be central in such roles as botanist or chef.
7. Intrapersonal Intelligence: having an understanding of yourself; knowing who you are, what you can do, what you want to do, how you react to things, which things to avoid, and which things to gravitate toward. We are drawn to people who have a good understanding of themselves. They tend to know what they can and can't do, and to know where to go if they need help.
8. Interpersonal Intelligence: the ability to understand other people. It's an ability we all need, but is especially important for teachers, clinicians, salespersons, or politicians -- anybody who deals with other people.
9. Existential Intelligence: the ability and proclivity to pose (and ponder) questions about life, death, and ultimate realities.
