NEW ROSTER OF INDEPENDENT NON-FICTION FILMS JOIN PBS PRIMETIME LINEUP IN 2003
"Independent Lens" From ITVS Re-Launches; Expands to 29 Weeks Pasadena, CA - July 26, 2002 - Independent documentaries will be presented in a series new to the PBS primetime schedule beginning February 2003, it was announced today by Pat Mitchell, president and CEO of PBS, at the Television Critics Association Press Tour in Pasadena. INDEPENDENT LENS, a yearly 10-week fall series that premiered in 1999, will now expand to 29 primetime episodes a year and will be curated by ITVS (the Independent Television Service) and PBS. The series is designed to complement P.O.V., PBS's award-winning 14-week showcase for personal documentary. Presented on Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. (check local listings), P.O.V. and INDEPENDENT LENS will establish a consistent timeslot for independents on PBS.
"Just as FRONTLINE WORLD and WIDE ANGLE offer differing perspectives on contemporary global events, PBS will now have two series - INDEPENDENT LENS and P.O.V. - to capture more fascinating, compelling stories from the world of nonfiction," said Ms. Mitchell. "Multiple points of entry for independent producers will inevitably bring a greater diversity of voices and viewpoints to our audience." INDEPENDENT LENS is an anthology series that will present hour-long (and occasional 90-minute) documentaries that showcase the best documentary programming from the U.S. and abroad. Encompassing the full spectrum of nonfiction film, from history to animation to shorts to social-issue films, the series will broaden the scope for documentary filmmakers and allow audiences access to powerful new films. INDEPENDENT LENS is made possible by a special launch grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).
PBS is re-launching INDEPENDENT LENS with ITVS, which, since its inception over ten years ago, has funded and presented the work of some of the most creative independent producers on television. ITVS has presented more than 200 documentaries on public television in the last 10 years, accompanied by national outreach and award-winning Web sites. The series will contribute to PBS's and ITVS's missions of reaching people who rarely see themselves or their communities on television, with stories that accurately reflect their lives.
INDEPENDENT LENS will be curated by PBS and ITVS with a team consisting of Alyce Myatt, vice president, programming and Cheryl Jones, senior director, program development and independent films from PBS and Claire Aguilar, director of programming and Lois Vossen, director of broadcast distribution and communications from ITVS.
"We are very pleased to be working with PBS on INDEPENDENT LENS because it demonstrates PBS's increased commitment to independent filmmakers," ITVS Executive Director Sally Fifer said. "The series fulfills a 10-year dream on the part of ITVS and the independent community to have a consistent place for nonfiction programming on the national schedule. We look forward to re-launching a smart, creative series that will include a broad range of documentaries, from current events and historical docs to true tales that are stranger than fiction. Think reality TV with a brain." PBS, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, is a private, nonprofit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation's 349 public television stations. Serving over 100 million people each week, PBS enriches the lives of all Americans through quality programs and education services on noncommercial television, the Internet and other media.

You brought all these cops to beat me?514173508235082In His Own Words: Dissident Artist Ai WeiweiAi Weiwei, arguably one of the most well known artists and dissidents in the world, told the PBS NewsHour that he will "never be optimistic" about the new Chinese leadership announced in November.2012-12-11 11:24:00disabledhide23145767111_1TCnPwiQAtrueRelated VideoMAN: Who hit you?JEFFREY BROWN: … and then spent 81 days in prison, was beaten and made an X-ray image of the damage he suffered into an artwork, “Brain Inflation.”AI WEIWEI: For me living in today’s world, living in China, it’s very hard to do a work which does not reflects or suggest with other possibility and meanings.All the works I do which connect or reflects either to the art history or to the political situation. And only in that context, my work can have some meaning.JEFFREY BROWN: Ai lives in works in Beijing and is not allowed by the government to travel outside China. He spoke recently to a camera crew hired by the NewsHour to pose our questions.AI WEIWEI: I cannot separate myself from once as artist or as a so-called activist, only because I don’t know what I will be next.JEFFREY BROWN: Born in 1957, Ai is the son of a renowned poet. The father and his family, including the young Weiwei, were sent to be reeducated in a rural village for two years during the cultural revolution.Ai Weiwei came of age as part of a generation of young Chinese artists breaking out of past strictures.And beginning in 1981, he lived in the U.S. for 12 years. His New York photographs, many of which are in the Hirshhorn exhibition, chronicle his Bohemian life with other artists and writers, both Chinese and American.KERRY BROUGHER, Smithsonian’s HirshhornMuseum: For me, Ai Weiwei has been one of the most important artists that has emerged from this new wave of Chinese art from the ’90s and the 2000s.JEFFREY BROWN: Kerry Brougher is chief curator at the Hirshhorn.KERRY BROUGHER: There are multiple layers in Ai Weiwei’s work. You can read certain pieces very simply, as what they are, but you can also dig deeper. You can see the history of China reflected in much of the work.You can see conflicts with Western culture and Eastern culture. And you can see critiques sometimes of the Chinese government or of other governments as well, power in general.JEFFREY BROWN: Often, you can see a provocation, as in one of Ai’s most famous works, dropping a Han Dynasty run, three photographs showing exactly that, the destruction of a 2,000-year-old cultural relic.KERRY BROUGHER: One of the things I think he is saying is, sometimes, it’s necessary to destroy the old before you can move forward with the new.And, also, by destroying something that is important, it suddenly makes you have to think about the value of things. What are they worth? Who says they’re valuable?JEFFREY BROWN: Ai returned to China in 1993 and became part of the country’s cultural elite, eventually tapped by the government to collaborate with a Swiss architectural firm to design the 2008 Olympic Stadium.Photos are on the floors and walls of the exhibition. But he grew critical of the Communist Party’s attempt to control the event. His biggest confrontation with the authorities soon followed, after the earthquake in SichuanProvince, when more than 5,000 children were killed in poorly constructed schools that collapsed, leading to accusations of official corruption and a cover-up.Ai photographed the destruction and started an online campaign to collect the names, ages and other data from each victim. That became a wall-sized display and an audio recording called “Remembrance.”He also transformed tragedy into art, collecting some 38 tons of twisted steel rebar from the destruction, straightening it and arranging it as a large rolling sculpture titled “Straight.”And picking up one particularly poignant image from the rubble, he created a long serpentine work constructed of children’s backpacks.The documentary film “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry” captures some of his attempts to gain information on what had happened. Filmmaker Alison Klayman spent three years watching Ai Weiwei up close through his work as artist and activist.ALISON KLAYMAN, filmmaker: He is an artist first and foremost as a sort of overriding umbrella for all of his work, but to him, what is the definition of an artist? It’s someone who is interested in communication, who is interested in engagement, who has to be talking about things that are relevant to the world around him or her.JEFFREY BROWN: Indeed, communication and new technology, the Internet and social media, became a passion for Ai. Beginning in 2006 and lasting three years, he wrote a blog about art, life and politics, before it was shut down by the government.He now spends hours a day online and remains very active on Twitter, though it’s blocked within China.AI WEIWEI: The Internet is such a beautiful miracle for the society here, like China, because we are still living under a very restricted dictatorship. You know, we are still dealing with a very restricted control on freedom of expression.And the Internet probably is the only vehicle for people to even sense there’s another person who shares the same idea or who can offer different information about what is happening. And that is the foundation for civil society.JEFFREY BROWN: A very serious side, and still the playful side, the work of some 3,200 river crabs made of porcelain.Why? Well, the Chinese term for river crab sounds like the word for harmonious. That, in turn, has become ironic Internet slang in China referring to official censorship.Ai Weiwei continues to make museum-ready objects, such as “Cube Light,” a huge chandelier that refers to the traditions of both Chinese lanterns and Western minimalist art. He also continues to speak his mind.AI WEIWEI: I often tell young people, because they always say, oh, Mr. Ai, I feel so bad because I don’t think we can change a society like this.So, I often reply to them, I say, we are part of the society. If we can change ourselves, if we can act, so that means part of our society had changed. If more people can do so, then we can change the society.JEFFREY BROWN: After his release from prison in 2011, Ai was charged with tax evasion and hit with a multimillion-dollar fine, which his backers see as further punishment for his activism.In the meantime, the Chinese government continues to hold his passport, which made it impossible for Ai Weiwei to attend the opening of the exhibition of his own work in Washington.JUDY WOODRUFF: In our interview with Ai Weiwei, he said he will never be optimistic about China’s new leadership. Hear that, plus his views on art and censorship, on our website.We also have more from our interviews about the artist. And you can view a slide show of images from the Hirshhorn exhibit.

The Illinois Democrat resigned from Congress last November after being treated for bipolar disorder. He responded to the federal charges today, saying — quote — “I offer no excuses for my conduct and I fully accept my responsibility.”In a related case, his wife pleaded guilty to a single count of tax fraud.The people who endured long days on a disabled cruise ship were headed home today. Their ordeal in the Gulf of Mexico came to an end when the crippled craft pulled into port.Cheers erupted from Carnival Cruise’s Triumph as it finally docked in Mobile, Ala., late last night, five days after an engine room fire left the ship dead in the water. Over the next four hours, more than 3,100 weary passengers streamed ashore.WOMAN: I’m speechless. It’s just really great to finally be back in America and on land.HARI SREENIVASAN: Many took buses to New Orleans to catch flights home today, while others were bused back to Galveston, Texas, to retrieve cars left at the ship’s home port. Some stopped to tell of the drama that began last Sunday.﻿Illinois Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. ResignsKRISTINA COURSON, Passenger: People were slamming doors and freaking out. “The ship’s on fire, the ship’s on fire.” And then at that point, it kind of sunk in the reality of, this is a — you know, a very serious situation.HARI SREENIVASAN: In the days that followed, they made do with little or no power or working toilets.PARISA SAFARZADEH, Passenger; Every time the boat listed or leaned, the sewage would spill over. So, that was what became the primary problem was this terrible odor, and the sanitation was just out of control.HARI SREENIVASAN: Still, some passengers praised the ship’s employees during the crisis.WOMAN: It was bad. It was bad, but we want to be sure the crew gets some credit for all that they did.HARI SREENIVASAN: Carnival senior vice president Terry Thornton* was on hand last night offering passengers his own apology for all that happened. *Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill was incorrectly identified as Terry Thornton.GERRY CAHILL, Carnival Cruise Lines: I know the conditions on board were very poor. I know it was very difficult, and I want to apologize again for subjecting our guests to that.HARI SREENIVASAN: The company promised a full refund, transportation expenses, and a credit for a future cruise. But, for some, that won’t be enough.ADRIANA PEREZ, Passenger: Never again in my life will I even walk around a cruise ship. I’m done. I’m done. Never again. It’s not going to happen.HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, the ship was towed to a work yard, where safety investigators will take a close look at what happened and why.Starting in March, people arrested in New York City for possession of small quantities of marijuana will no longer be arrested and arraigned. Instead, they will be issued a ticket and told to appear in court. Mayor Michael Bloomberg outlined the change in policy on Thursday evening. He said it will allow the city to target police where they are needed most. Today, the mayor said he remains opposed to legalizing marijuana outright.The murder drama surrounding South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius moved to a new stage today, a courtroom in Pretoria.We have a report from Rohit Kachroo of Independent Television News.ROHIT KACHROO: The glare of the flashlights he’s used to, but not this, and it showed. Photographers rushed to capture the court appearance. Inside, Pistorius seemed confused. He buried his head in his hands at the first mention of the word murder.Occasionally, he acknowledged the magistrate, but little else. His lawyer spoke of his traumatized state of mind. Then he was led to the cells. His friends and family sat behind him, could not catch his gaze. His father offered his hand to comfort him, but their eyes never met. Both father and brother left together with other relatives, all unwilling, some unable to speak about what they just witnessed.MAN: And Oscar Pistorius, the greatest Paralympic athlete of all time, is going to take this gold medal!ROHIT KACHROO: Oscar Pistorius, double amputee, became a Paralympic star, then an Olympian, too. His girlfriend, model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp, was found dead at his home yesterday morning. Investigators recovered a .9-millimeter pistol.Talkmore Nyongani was his training partner for four years, sharing a room, traveling the world. He refuses to believe the allegations.TALKMORE NYONGANI, Former Training Partner of Oscar Pistorius: It was a shocking incident, like we heard, what happened. I tried at the moment to try to contact him, but I knew that was impossible.ROHIT KACHROO: And you don’t believe these allegations?TALKMORE NYONGANI: No, I don’t believe it at all.ROHIT KACHROO: You say they cannot be true?TALKMORE NYONGANI: Yes, cannot be true.ROHIT KACHROO: And there are many people here who refuse to believe it, South Africa’s humble hero spending a second night in a prison cell.HARI SREENIVASAN: Pistorius didn’t enter a plea at the hearing. If convicted on the murder charge, he could face life in prison.In economic news, output at U.S. auto plants fell in January, and that pushed overall manufacturing down after two months of gains. And on Wall Street today, the Dow Jones industrial average gained eight points to close at 13,981. The Nasdaq fell six points to close at 3,192. For the week, both the Dow and the Nasdaq dropped a 10th of a percent.Those are some of the day’s major stories.
