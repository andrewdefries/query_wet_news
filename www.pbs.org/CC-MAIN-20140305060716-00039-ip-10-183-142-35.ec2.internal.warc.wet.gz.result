‹‹ 3 of 5 ›› Of Symbols and Meaning: Part Two
Posted: Thu, 01/13/2011 - 5:39pm
Last week in this space, I mused about how quick we can be to over interpret events and ascribe tenuous meaning to actions that so often defy explanation.
Less than forty-eight hours after I posted that column, 19 people were gunned down in a Tucson parking lot---six died---and suddenly we were sucked into a situation in which symbolism seems all too real.
Guns. Mental illness. Overheated political speech. Personal security. Everyone flocked to their favorite theory.
We can be a nation of extremes, especially when it comes to fraught debate. Usually we manage to set aside the vitriol in times of national shock and grief. That didn’t happen after the Tucson shootings.
Perhaps our debates move too fast now, making it nearly impossible to decide what we really think before the accusations begin to fly. In such an overheated rhetorical environment, symbols morph into reality, meaning becomes subjective, and it seems that absolutely everyone stops listening to each other.
That's never good. Trapped within partisan echo chambers, politicians and pundits regularly lose sight of what ordinary shades-of-gray Americans are thinking about. Who had the most compelling story this week? Sarah Palin or Christina Taylor Green? Daniel Hernandez or the angry gun control and second amendment advocates?
The answer became crystal clear Wednesday night when President Obama cruised right past the accusations of "blood libel" that Sarah Palin had leveled earlier in the day, and denunciations of her crosshairs analogy aired earlier in the week, to appeal to Americans to “expand our moral imaginations."
It's an interesting concept that does not define what morality should be, but certainly seems to remind us that we can be better than this.
I've covered politics and Washington long enough to realize that cease fires seldom last very long. But something about the tragedy in Tucson - and the Hollywood-quality survival tale of the valiant Congresswoman and astronaut's wife -- might just calm things down a bit for awhile.
Then perhaps we can see symbols and meanings for what they are, instead of what our politics often dictates they should be.

Kevin's Reflections on Collecting Asian Smalls
Kevin Bruneau | 02/01/13 at 05:37 p.m. Kevin Bruneau joins MARKET WARRIORS with more than two decades of antiques experience. He specializes in upscale antiques and Asian arts, and also is passionate about motorcycles and vintage cars. In my opinion, Asian smalls are pieces I can hold in my
hands and, boy, have I had the pleasure of handling some wonderful pieces! Asian
smalls are those objects you find in a curio cabinet, and I personally have
collected them as a dealer and for my home. They can run the gamut from gilt
bronze figures to shapely porcelain vases.All societies in Asia have made great pieces at different
times. I'm amazed by Japanese metalwork of the 19th century. I really enjoy the
mixed metal vases made by Japanese artists. You can see in the finer hand-worked
examples the hundreds of hours that went into each piece. I think Chinese artisans made some of the finest porcelain
items imaginable. They have produced it for hundreds of years with some pieces
so fine they are called eggshell porcelain. To me, they appear so fragile, yet
so strong and hard. Also, scholars' objects have been crafted throughout Asia
for centuries; items like brush holders, water coupes, and scroll weights are
popular today, and can go for high prices. Today, when antique objects of all sizes and from all of
Asia sell for exorbitant amounts of money, for my money it's the small, fine
items that should stay at the top of the collector's list. To see more examples
of Asian smalls, check out these appraisals from ANTIQUES ROADSHOW:
18th-Century Chinese Famille Noire Vase
Miyao Mixed Metal Figure, ca. 1880
Chinese White Jade Censer, ca. 1920
