The Mariners Magical Season
I have been a baseball fan since I was a child. The Big Red Machine (Cincinnati Reds) were the team that turned me on to baseball. I grew up near Los Angeles, so I attended many Dodger / Reds games in the '70s. What a great rivalry they were. I also got to see the Dodgers of the '80's and witness "Fernando Mania". I moved to the NW in 1990 and grew to love, what now I now call my adult team, the Mariners. It was a thrill to see a city fall in love with baseball in '95, but nothing compares to the magical season of 2001.

400 Years of the Telescope | A Journey of Science, Technology and Thought
ENGLISH ESPAÑOL
Click here for a larger preview.
Panoramic visuals and engaging interviews make 400 Years of the Telescope the must-see documentary of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.
Beautifully photographed in 4K digital cinematography, the film is a visually stunning chronicle of the history of the telescope from the time of Galileo, its profound impact upon the science of astronomy, and how both shape the way we view ourselves in the midst of an infinite universe.
The film features interviews with leading astrophysicists and cosmologists from the world's renowned universities and observatories, who explain concepts ranging from Galileo's act of revealing the cosmos with a simple telescope, to the latest discoveries in space, including startling new ideas about life on other planets and dark energy — a mysterious vacuum energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
Join us on this companion website to explore this fascinating subject as you meet the film's producers and their worldwide search for the world's greatest telescopes, enjoy captivating interviews with brilliant personalities, learn about planetarium programs in your area and discover local and faraway opportunities to experience our incredible universe firsthand.

Film Description
Was it an act of honor -- or revenge for a crime never committed?
In the waning days of summer 1931, Honolulu's tropical tranquility was shattered when a young Navy wife made a drastic allegation of rape against five nonwhite islanders. What unfolded in the following days and weeks was a racially-charged murder case that would make headlines across the nation, enrage Hawai'i's native population, and galvanize the island's law enforcers and the nation's social elite.
The Massie Affair recounts the sensational true crime story that rocked 1930s Hawai'i. Written and produced by Mark Zwonitzer (Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life, Transcontinental Railroad), the documentary draws on research done by David Stannard, author of Honor Killing, a book that examines the same topic. "It's a little-known story to most Americans, but to a great extent, this ignited Hawai'i's own civil rights movement," says American
Experience executive producer Mark Samels. "The film is a powerful reminder of the injustices that are part of the tapestry of American history."
In the 1930s, Hawai'i was an American territory, and thought of by many as a paradise in the Pacific. But beneath the peaceful veneer, tensions were building. Hawaiians held a deepening resentment against the U.S. military presence. The workforce was struggling with a Depression-era job market. And racial tensions were about to erupt. The population of white mainlanders, or haoles, as they were called, was growing rapidly. The Navy bases on the island also created tension, as the military men showed little respect for locals. Many native Hawaiians were convinced that the mainlanders were taking over.
Tensions hit the boiling point on September 12, 1931, when Lieutenant Thomas Massie and his twenty-year-old wife Thalia joined a Navy crowd at the Ala Wai Inn, a Honolulu nightspot. Well known for their volatile relationship, the couple had an argument, and Thalia stormed out. Hours later she reported that she had been assaulted. But she could not identify the men who attacked her, nor the car they were driving -- it was too dark, she said.
Despite lack of evidence, five islanders were quickly rounded up and charged with the crime. The accused included two native Hawaiians, one Hawaiian-Chinese man, and two Japanese men. The driving forces behind the trumped up charges, it turned out, were high-ranking Naval officials, including the admiral in charge at Pearl Harbor, Yates Stirling.
Thalia's shocking accusation created a media frenzy. She was portrayed as a victim whose womanhood had been violated. The five defendants were painted as criminal fiends, heathens. Headlines declared "Thugs Attack Hawai'i Woman," and "Hawaiians Must Be Punished!"
While Thalia had fared well in the press, there was plenty of gossip around town about her wild behavior and liaisons with other officers. Thalia's mother, New York socialite Grace Hubbard Bell Fortescue, flew to Honolulu to support her daughter and to protect the family's reputation. But Grace would play a much larger role in the tragedy that was unraveling.
At the November trial of the five defendants, Thalia offered graphic testimony, even identifying her assailants by name. However, there was scant evidence to corroborate her story, and the jury could not agree on a verdict. Forced to declare a mistrial, the judge set the defendants free.
Grace Fortescue and Thomas Massie took matters into their own hands, setting out to force a confession from one of the suspects, Joseph Kahahawai. When coercion turned to violence, Kahahawai was shot and killed.
"A woman's honor was at stake and what a husband does in defense of his wife's honor, even if it involves murder, is justified," comments Stannard. "That became the drum beat throughout the country, on the radio, in the newspapers, in magazines." Papers across the nation eagerly carried reports of the "honor killing."
Despite a passionate defense by celebrated defense attorney Clarence Darrow, Grace and Thomas were convicted of man-slaughter, and sentenced to ten years in prison, a sentence that would not stand. Under pressure from the Hoover administration, Congress, and the Navy, Hawai'i territorial governor Lawrence Judd caved, reducing the sentence to just one hour. The people of Hawai'i were incensed. "So this is what Kahahawai's life is worth," comments historian Kanalu Young in the film. "Nothing more, nothing less than his accused and convicted killers spending an hour visiting with the governor, drinking tea, on a lovely afternoon in paradise."
"Even today, this remains a painful piece of Hawai'i's history," says producer Mark Zwonitzer. "Joe Kahahawai's murder and the aftermath shed light on the egregious institutional racism that stretched from the halls of power in the U.S. government to its outermost territory."
The Navy shipped Grace, Thomas and Thalia out on the first available boat to California, where they were met with a hero's welcome.

Lil Monk makes a Difference
Lil Monk, a playful sensitive dachshund, and I are part of a healing organization called Hand in Paw. We visit the Geriatric Psychiatric Unit at the University of Alabama Medical Center. With her tail wagging and her head held high Lil Monk knew that this visit was going to be extra special. With a hopeful heart we went over to a fragile old man, whose hands were being restrained by his son. As the younger man sat there with those sad eyes I knew we could make a difference. With a cheerful tone in my voice I inquired, "Do you like dogs?" The weathered man responded "NO", again I questioned, "You mean you never even had a hound dog?" With a triumphant response he declared, "I had me a bird dog one time." Reaching into that common ground I announced "Lil Monk likes birds." He smiled. I asked the son to let go of his hands. He said, "He might hurt your dog." With a trusting heart my voice echoed, "No he will not, for Lil Monk has been especially trained for this kind of work." I placed Lil Monk on the tray in front of the old man and as his hands reached out, somehow a transformation took place. His hands flowed over Lil Monk like water over river rocks and he smiled. I looked and the son and somehow we all had a communal healing. After a couple of minutes I told him we had to go and thanks for allowing us to visit. As I was leaving I noticed someone was walking behind me. Yes, it was the son. He looked and me and said with a tearful tone, "Thanks for coming today. You let me see my Daddy happy one more time. I just thought that would never happen." With a thankful heart, I replied, "It was our privilege, somehow Lil Monk makes a difference in other people's lives just like she does mine every day."
