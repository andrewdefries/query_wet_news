That’s beautiful. Over there.SPOKESPERSON: Oh look at that.MARGARET WARNER: Bird watching is usually thought of as a genteel and gentle hobby, and for many of the 50 million Americans who like to watch birds, it is. But for competitive birders, like those who compete to spot the greatest number of species in a single year, it can be a brutal sport.SPOKESMAN: It was amazing.MARGARET WARNER: Former newspaper reporter Mark Obmascik has written about them in a new book: “The Big Year, A tale of Man, Nature and Fowl Obsession.” We met up with Obmascik at Huntley Meadows Park in northern Virginia.MARGARET WARNER: Now what is it people love about this so much?MARK OBMASCIK: I think it’s the challenge, it keeps your brain going, you feel like a little kid on a treasure hunt. You’re poking around the trees, and looking for little hidden tidbits.MARGARET WARNER: The three central characters in Obmascik’s book, the top finishers in the 1998 Big Year competition, were clearly looking for a challenge. Tell us how the Big Year works.MARK OBMASCIK: Well, the Big Year is a contest with no referees and few rules. The idea is, who can see the most species of birds in North America in one year. So you can see them however you want. You can fly to see them, ride a bike to see them. In one case, they even took a helicopter to see them in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada.MARGARET WARNER: And they chase the birds through the canyon, as I recall.MARK OBMASCIK: They did, up and over peaks, and one guy had a horrible seasickness problem.MARGARET WARNER: Said he just hoped he could hold his breakfast together.MARK OBMASCIK: And he did, and he got the bird. What a great bonus.MARGARET WARNER: Obmascik first got turned onto the story by Sandy Comido, who years earlier had set the big-time record of 721 birds.MARK OBMASCIK: He’s a New Jersey industrial contractor who has a voice that starts about three floors below the basement, really kind of a man’s man, in one of the most macho businesses anywhere. And he started telling me about how he devoted a year of his life to chasing around fragile, delicate, beautiful birds. And I just thought what a terrific contrast, a man who employs guys who almost look like Hell’s Angels, who’s roofing a factory top in New Jersey in the summer, and he loves birds.MARGARET WARNER: In 1998, Comido decided to try to beat his own record before anyone could. He quickly found himself spending an average $10,000 a month to hopscotch all over the country chasing birds. Equally driven and financially comfortable was Al Levinton, a chemical company executive. He just retired to Aspen, Colo., after decades as a hard-charging businessman.MARK OBMASCIK: He was working 60, 70, 80 hours a week, he was traveling 100,000 miles a year, and when it came time for him to retire, his wife was ready for the two of them to hang out. But what did the road warrior want to do? He wanted to do a Big Year and chase birds, hundreds of thousands of miles chasing birds. But he had 40 years of repressed obsession to deal with, because he had worked so hard.MARGARET WARNER: Also obsessed but without the same resources was Greg Miller, a nuclear power plant software writer in Maryland. His 1998 big year began the day after his divorce became final.MARGARET WARNER: Greg was already in debt, he had to go more deeply in debt, had to keep working all the while he was doing this, unlike the other two.MARK OBMASCIK: Well, Greg would try to rack up the hours, thinking that 11 hours today can get me to Vancouver to see a Zantusis hummingbird. Greg lived for three days in the Dakotas, on nothing more than a jar of Jif peanut butter and a bag of Mr. Salty pretzels because he wanted to see the bared sparrow. It was all hand to mouth, and Greg actually ended the year as a financial wreck. He went broke. He maxed out five credit cards at age 40.MARGARET WARNER: Birding held a common fascination for these three very different men.MARK OBMASCIK: The three of these guys really worked pretty industrial jobs, if you think of it. There’s an industrial contractor, a Fortune 500 guy from a major chemical company from Philly, and a nuclear power plant worker. And you know, what better release for them to go chase rare, delicate, feathered creatures in some of the most spectacular landscape anywhere in the world?MARGARET WARNER: As you point out in the book, there are only 675 indigenous species in the U.S., Yet the record is already 721. So describe what they have to do to find these other birds.MARK OBMASCIK: What they do is turn into maniacs. They chase rarities. In 1998, they set a record that probably never will be broken, and for a few reasons, but the biggest of that is that it was the strongest El Nino on record. So there were all these freak birds that kept getting blown in by weird storms from Europe, from Asia, blown up from Latin America, and as soon as they hit North American airspace, you’re golden, you can count them, you just got to find them.MARGARET WARNER: And they get together because a word comes out on this North American rare bird alert. So they know where something’s suddenly been sighted.MARK OBMASCIK: Well, the communications revolution has just dramatically changed birding. There are rare bird alerts where people will get phone calls in the middle of the night at a cost of about $25 a call that says there’s a Zantusis hummingbird in Gibsons, B.C., get on it. And they’ll go. A rare bird, it’s almost impossible for it to land without having its every movement transmitted and broadcast on the Web.MARGARET WARNER: Some of the places they race to after an alert, like Gamble Island in the Bering Sea, seen here in Greg Miller’s home video, were pretty bleak.MARK OBMASCIK: For birders, it’s this weird paradox: The worse the weather, the better the birding. These guys would stay on this island of ice, of snow, and wait for freak winds to blow Asiatic birds into North American airspace, and they would sit on the edge of the sea with these scopes, these telescopes as long as my arm, and point them out there. And it’s ten degrees, 20-knot winds, and they’re calling out these rare birds that are flying by. Is this your idea of a $5,000 vacation? For these guys there’s nothing better.MARGARET WARNER: Part of the appeal for these bird-obsessed men, despite their competition, was the camaraderie.MARK OBMASCIK: Almost every birder has a story about how they’ve been mocked or teased over the years. Sandy Comido was teased so much that when he was in the Army he used to hide his binoculars in his five-pocket fatigues. Greg Miller was always called Miss Jane Hathaway from the “Beverly Hillbillies.” So when birders go to a place like Gamble, nobody is giving them a hard time, they’re just with 50 or 60 other people who share their same one consuming obsession.MARGARET WARNER: In the end, of course, only one of the three won the competition. Do you think the other two felt like losers?MARK OBMASCIK: No, not at all. In many ways, the Big Year cost them dearly. It cost them financially, it cost them their health, it wrung them out emotionally. But if you talk to them today, they had the time of their lives. It was really a terrific thing. I mean, how many people get to do the one thing that they really want to do and do it for a whole year? I mean, how many people get to chase their dream like that for a year? Birding may not be your dream, but for these guys it was. These guys went for it. Most people live their lives with the brakes on.MARGARET WARNER: And after a year working on this book, Obmascik’s been bitten by the bird bug too.MARK OBMASCIK: These guys got me hooked. It’s fun. You can do it almost anywhere. It doesn’t take much to pack binoculars when you go along somewhere, and it’s a different way of looking at the world.

Related Content: President Obama	Obama Slams Romney for Changing Tune on bin LadenEssential ReadsPresident Barack Obama on Monday reminded Americans that his likely Republican opponent in the November election had been lukewarm about targeting Osama bin Laden, seeking to gain political advantage from the killing of the al Qaeda leader. PBS NewsHour: Blind Dissident's Escape: an 'Opportunity' for Chinese Government?Web contentAs Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng declared his freedom in a YouTube video, President Obama declined to speak directly Monday about the delicate diplomatic situation. Gwen Ifill discusses the story's significance and how it unfolded with Susan Shirk of the University of California, San Diego and Voice of America's Sasha Gong. PBS NewsHour: Examining the Electoral Map, President Obama's Arguments for a Second TermWeb contentIn this week's Political Checklist, Political Editor Christina Bellantoni chatted with senior correspondents Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff about President Obama's latest campaign video, which reminds voters he inherited a bad economy from President George W. Bush. Gwen notes that argument only works for so long, and also pointed out that the "economy" means different things to different people when it comes to their votes. Hispanic Leaders Divided on President ObamaEssential ReadsBecause Hispanics, the fastest-growing segment of the US population, will play a big role in November's presidential election, leaders from the Hispanic community reinforced the notion that they are not a monolithic voting bloc. Two Parties Find a Way to Agree, and Disagree, on Student Loan RatesEssential ReadsAs President Obama wrapped up a barnstorming tour of college campuses in swing states on Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans agreed that they wanted to avoid a steep increase in the student loan interest rate this summer. But the chief issue remained unsettled: how to pay the cost of doing so. Warmth of Campus Spotlight Beckons Obama BackEssential ReadsThe arenas are rocking, the students are whooping and President Obama is feeling the love. “I love you back, I really do!” he calls out to thousands of young people packed to the rafters. When one shouts, “We believe in you!” he yells back, “I believe in you!” When he emphasizes a point, he calls out, “Can I get an amen?” For a president facing a tough re-election and a stubborn economy, there is no better amen corner, no more invigorating audience, than on campus. As Gas Prices Cast Cloud, Obama Calls for Scrutiny on MarketOn The RadarWith his re-election prospects influenced by the price of gasoline, President Obama on Tuesday demanded more “cops on the beat” to crack down on oil market manipulation, calling on Congress to bolster federal supervision of oil markets and to increase penalties for subverting markets.Read More Obama Push on Oil Markets Seen as More Political Than PracticalOn The RadarUnder continued attack from Republicans for high oil and gasoline prices, President Obama unveiled on Tuesday a slate of measures to crack down on financial speculation in energy-futures trading, which Democrats say helps drive up prices. But while a Rose Garden announcement gave the president a platform to be seen calling for action on fuel prices, it’s not clear whether financial speculation is even a major contributor to oil and gasoline prices—or whether the administration’s proposals could have any real impact on the price at the pump. Lead-up to Labor Day May Determine Winner of Presidential RaceOn The RadarThe intensity of the initial skirmishes in the campaign between President Obama and Mitt Romney underscores a new reality about presidential politics. What happens in the months before Labor Day and the candidates’ debates in the fall will shape the race and, if history is a guide, determine who wins in November.Read More Obama to Millionaires: Time to Pony Up!On The RadarWSJ's Laura Meckler checks in on Mean Street to discuss President Obama's plan to pressure Republicans into supporting a minimum tax on millionaires, also known as the 'Buffett Rule.' « first

Related Content: South Carolina	GOP Rifts Exposed in South CarolinaEssential ReadsThe challenges facing the Republican Party as it heads into the elections of 2014 and 2016 were on stark display here this weekend as South Carolina Republicans gathered for their annual convention, an event that revealed a party in the throes of some internal strife. Black Voters Are Key to a Colbert Busch Win in South CarolinaEssential ReadsSouth Carolina’s First Congressional District is known for the churning Port of Charleston, growing suburbs to the north, and stately homes with wrap-around porches from Beaufort to Mount Pleasant. The white, well-heeled voters who dominate the district favored Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney by 18 percentage points. PBS Newshour: Congressional Seats Go Unexpectedly Up for Grabs Soon After 2012 ElectionWeb contentDeath, resignation and high-profile jobs have resulted in an unusual number of newly competitive Senate openings. Roll Call's Shira Toeplitz and NewsHour political editor Christina Bellantoni walk through with Gwen Ifill the political cause and effect of congressional vacancies in Massachusetts, Hawaii and South Carolina. Tim Scott to Be Named for South Carolina Senate Seat, Republicans SayEssential Reads
Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina has chosen Representative Tim Scott to replace Jim DeMint in the United States Senate, according to three Republican officials. The move will make Mr. Scott the first black senator from the South since the late 19th century.
ANALYSIS: Senate's First African American Republican Tea Party Member?Essential ReadsThe announcement that Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) was resigning at the beginning of 2013, gave political junkies - and plenty of SC politicians - an unexpected early Christmas gift. GOP Race's Approaching Lull Will Test GingrichOn The RadarThe caffeinated, rapid-fire GOP presidential primary is about to ease into a slower pace and a more spread-out map, creating new challenges for Newt Gingrich. February will bring several primaries and caucuses likely to lack the intensity of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. It has only one debate, three weeks from now.
Read More Analysis: Romney is Fiery, Focused in Fla. DebateOn The RadarMitt Romney, forced to prove his resilience after a stinging loss in South Carolina, is showing why the so-called Republican establishment thinks he has the best discipline, organization and campaign smarts to challenge President Barack Obama this fall.
Read More PBS NewsHour: Florida Voters Brace for Barrage of Ads as Romney, Gingrich Battle EscalatesWeb contentJudy Woodruff reports on GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney launching an aggressive assault on South Carolina primary winner Newt Gingrich. Then, Gwen Ifill discusses the state of the Republican field ahead of Florida's primary next week with The Rothenberg Political Report's Stuart Rothenberg and USA Today's Susan Page. Romney NewteredOn The RadarSouth Carolina went “Grandiose.” Newt Gingrich, who embraced that word when it was used to describe him, won the Republican primary handily today with around 40 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney, who had been ahead by double digits in polls after the New Hampshire primary, received only 27 percent. Given Gingrich's overwhelming victory, it may be difficult for him to find a historical figure important enough to compare himself to. Like Lazarus, Gingrich Resurrected - AgainOn The RadarIn the heart of the Bible Belt, Newt Gingrich, the winner of Saturday's South Carolina primary, evoked comparisons to a familiar scriptural tale: Lazarus, the man who rose from the dead.
