The FBI declared the late Bruce Ivins was responsible for the attacks. Ivins had worked at the government's bio-defense labs. A new investigation by Frontline, Pro Publica and McClatchy Newspapers has found new inconsistencies in the government's case against Ivins.2011-07-20 12:38:00disabled2063012546zdVUgH11sLktrue This interview was conducted on July 19. The Justice Department has since submitted a list of corrections to the July 15 filing.The Justice Department contradicted previous government arguments that former Army microbiologist Bruce Ivins had created the white powder while working late nights at a bio-weapons lab. The new evidence was filed late last week as part of a Florida civil suit against the government brought by the family of the first anthrax victim, Robert Stevens.A recent article by the investigatory partnership, laid out the contradiction:The department’s legal dance stems from its two seemingly conflicting roles: backing up the FBI’s finding that Ivins, who committed suicide in July 2008, was the killer and defending an Army bio-weapons lab at Fort Detrick, Md., against allegations of negligence.In an interview with Hari Sreenivasan, FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk explained that there’s an internal struggle at the Justice Department. “If they change what they said it may make them vulnerable in the civil suit for lots of money. If they stay where they are, it makes the criminal division feel more vulnerable,” Kirk said.FRONTLINE, ProPublica, and McClatchy are continuing to follow the story and will produce a special documentary this fall.Follow FRONTLINE and Hari on Twitter.

Photojournalist Pirkle Jones, 1914-2009
by theresa | April 9th, 2009 at 4:18 PM
Photojournalist Pirkle Jones passed away on March 15, 2009 at the age of 95 in Mill Valley, California. The New York Times calls Jones “one of the most admired photographers of his generation.” One of the highlights of his career is a series of photographs that he and his wife took of Bay Area Black Panthers in 1968. Several of those images are available in a photo gallery on the POV website.
In the late 1960s, Ruth-Marion Baruch, Pirkle Jones‘s wife and collaborator, decided she wanted to create a photo essay about the Black Panthers in the Bay Area. She pitched the idea to Jack McGregor, the director of San Francisco’s de Young Museum at the time. According to the Berkeley Art Museum, Baruch wanted to present “the feeling of the people,” and McGregor agreed to show the exhibit at the museum. The couple spent the summer of 1968 attending Black Panther speeches, marches and rallies, photographing notable Panthers such as Bobby Seale, Huey Newton and Kathleen Cleaver, among others.
The Black Panther exhibit opened in December 1968 and caused such a furor that museum officials supposedly almost canceled the show in response to the outrage. After local artists and activists spoke out in support of the exhibit, the show went on and over 10,000 people visited the de Young to see the images. The photographs captured the passion, power and youthful bravado of the revolutionaries — and may even have played a part in Panther recruitment. According to former Panther, Kathleen Cleaver, “There was an attitude, a boldness, a bravado, that attracted young people from all over the country. I wanna be a Black Panther. We didn’t ever have to ‘organize’ the Black Panther Party — people organized it themselves. They saw the pictures. They saw the images and they said, I’m coming to the Bay Area. I wanna be one of those.”
Sacramento Black Panthers at the Free Huey Rally in Bobby Hutton Memorial
Park, Oakland, CA, August 25, 1968. By Pirkle Jones
A few years ago, POV broadcast a film entitled A Panther in Africa (POV 2004) by Aaron Matthews. The film told the story of Pete O’Neal, one of the last exiles from the time of Black Power. Facing gun charges in Kansas City in 1970, O’Neal fled to Algeria, where he joined other Panther exiles. Unlike the others who found their way back to America, O’Neal did not. He moved on to Tanzania, where for over 30 years he has struggled to continue his life of social activism — and to hold on to his identity as an African American.
In our planning for the companion POV website, we came across a photo exhibit that was going on at the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, in conjunction with the 2002 publication of The Black Panthers 1968: Photographs by Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones. The exhibition featured 45 gelatin prints from the original project. We asked if we might feature some of the photos that Baruch and Jones took on our site to illustrate what it was like to be a member of the Black Panthers in the late 1960s.
Jones granted us permission and Kathleen Cleaver allowed us to include audio excerpts from a lecture she delivered in April of 2004 in which she spoke about what it was like to be part of the Black Panther movement and what she personally remembered about some of Baruch and Jones’s photographs.
The images are amazing records of these compelling young rebels who advocated black pride, unity, community service and sometimes, violence. I really can’t describe them any better than Baruch and Jones did in the quote that opens their book:
“We photographed the Black Panthers intensively from July into October of 1968, during the peak of a historic period and in the Bay Area, where the Black Panther National Headquarters is located. We couldn’t possibly photograph all the aspects of this virile, rapid growing and deep rooted movement, but we can show you: this is what we saw, this is what we felt, these are the people.” — Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch, 1969

Grief and Loss, Happiness
Research on grief has focused primarily on negative emotions, such as depression, anger, anxiety, and guilt. But what about positive emotions, such as gratitude, pride, hope, and love?Following the death of a loved one, how common is it for survivors to experience positive emotions? If such emotions occur, how do they influence the coping process? During the past decade, several studies have addressed these issues. These studies have focused on many different populations, including parents who lost an infant to SIDS, widows who lost a spouse, and men who lost a partner to AIDS. This research provides clear evidence that positive emotions play a critically important part in coping with loss. What We KnowPositive emotions are surprisingly prevalent among the bereaved, even relatively soon after the loss. In one study on coping with the loss of an infant to SIDS, nearly half of the parents were experiencing positive emotions three months after the death.Positive emotions need not be intense or prolonged to produce beneficial effects. In fact, mourners with just a minimal amount of positive emotions and a great deal of negative emotion do better than those with no positive emotions at all. Positive and negative emotions are independent of one another, and co-occur along side of one another.Positive emotions play a role in regulating depression and other negative emotions that are associated with grief. Those who show more positive emotions in the first few months following the loss are likely to exhibit less grief and distress in the future. Shifting mourners’ focus from negative emotions to positive ones provides a psychological break or respite, and also allows them to replenish their resources. Positive emotions can improve the way people cope with their loss. As a result of gaining some distance from negative emotions and being restored and replenished by positive emotions, mourners are more able to focus their attention on the tasks that are most important to them and make progress on these tasks.It is more difficult to experience positive emotions following some kinds of loss than others. For example, those whose loved one dies unexpectedly are likely to show lower levels of positive emotion than those whose loved one’s death was expected.Can Positive Emotions be Enhanced?Available evidence suggests that it is indeed possible for the bereaved to enhance their positive emotions. Two approaches for enhancing positive emotions are engagement and focusing on what matters now. EngagementMany studies have shown that becoming involved in activities that engage one’s interests is quite effect in enhancing positive emotions. In fact, cognitive and behavioral interventions for depression have often relied on this approach. Being involved in an engaging activity can break the grip of negative thoughts, at least temporarily. Examples of engaging activities include going shopping, attending a sporting event with a friend, taking your dog for a walk, or going to the library. Involvement in an engaging activity will increase positive affect more than involvement in an activity that is less engaging. However, experts concur that involvement in just about any activity is better than not being involved. Because bereavement is often accompanied by a profound loss of interest in life, it may be difficult for mourners to become engaged in particular tasks. A strategy for breaking through mourners’ resistance is to encourage them to spend five minutes on a potentially engaging task, and telling them that they can stop after that. In most cases, mourners continue with the task once they are drawn into it.In some cases, people are able to make an accurate assessment of what activities will engage them. In other cases, this may not be possible. As one woman indicated following the death of her husband, “One of my coworkers invited me to go line dancing with her after work. I have never tried line dancing but I hate dancing, so my expectations were low. To my surprise, it was a lot of fun, and we are going to go again next week.” Focusing on What Matters NowThis approach for enhancing positive emotions asks mourners to consider the following question: given everything that has happened, what matters to me at this point in my life? One woman, who had lost her older son, decided that what mattered now was to be the best possible mother to her surviving son. “I arranged a sleep-over for my son, and cooked him his favorite dinner. It made me feel happy,” she said. A woman whose husband had died decided that what mattered now was staying healthy so that she could raise her children. “I had cancelled my two previously scheduled mammograms, but this time I kept my appointment. It felt good to do something for my family,” she said.To some people, what matters now is working to prevent what happened to their loved one from happening to others. Such individuals are often drawn to organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, where they are able to contribute energy and passion to the cause. It is important to note that for the bereaved person, what matters now may not be the same as what mattered then (i.e., before the loss). As one woman explained, “Before my daughter’s death I was obsessed with decorating the house. This has no importance to me now.” I hope you will give these techniques a try. Utilizing these approaches can empower mourners and help them reclaim control of their lives. The research shows that just a small increase in positive emotions can produce beneficial effects. The more one engages in these practices, the more positive emotions will continue to increase. This can result in an upward spiral of wellbeing characterized by better relationships within the family, a greater feeling of connection with extended family and friends, and a greater appreciation for what is important.
