Cook Colonial Thanksgiving Recipes from American History
November 20, 2012

Roasted Turkey with Giblet GravyTurkeys were plentiful in England before 1550, having made their way to Europe on Spanish ships transporting them from Mexico. Therefore, British colonists were already in possession of recipes for turkey before they landed in the New World, where they would find flocks of up to 5,000 wild turkeys gathered by certain rivers, making a veritable feast for starving émigrés. In addition to boiling, frying, and baking them, roasting was one of the most common means of preparing turkey in colonial times. Amelia Simmons’ recipe in American Cookery calls for stuffing the bird with bread stuffing, roasting, and basting it. In what may have set the precedent for the modern Thanksgiving, she instructs the cook to serve the turkey with “cramberry-sauce” and mashed potatoes.
From The City Tavern Cookbook: Recipes from the Birthplace of American Cuisine ©2009 by Walter StaibIngredients1 (18- to 20-pound) turkey, with gibletsSalt and freshly ground black pepper1 medium yellow onion, quartered1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme2 tablespoons dried rubbed sage2 medium shallots, finely chopped11/2 tablespoons olive oil1 cup imported Madeira1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped2 large carrots, peeled and chopped2 celery ribs, chopped1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc3 cups chicken stock11/2 tablespoons cornstarchDirectionsPreheat the oven to 325°F. Place an oven rack on the bottom level. Place a wire roasting rack in a large roasting pan and spray it with vegetable cooking spray.Remove the giblets and neck and any visible fat from the turkey cavity and reserve for the giblet stock. Discard the liver and fat. Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water and pat dry with paper towels.Sprinkle the turkey cavity with salt and pepper. Place the quartered onion in the cavity.In a small bowl, combine the parsley, thyme, sage, shallots, and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Sprinkle with salt and a generous grinding of pepper.With your fingers, separate the turkey skin from the breast meat, taking care not to tear the skin or pierce the meat. Rub the herb mixture on the meat under the skin on each side of the breastbone. Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string and twist the wing tips behind the back. Place the turkey, breast side up, in the prepared roasting pan.Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, until the breast is browned. Cover the turkey with aluminum foil and roast for 3 to 4 hours, until a meat thermometer inserted in a thigh muscle registers 185°F. Add 1/2 cup of the Madeira, and baste the turkey every 15 minutes.While the turkey roasts, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, add the coarsely chopped onion, the carrots, celery, and reserved giblets and neck, and cook, stirring frequently, for about 15 minutes, until the giblets, onion, carrots, and celery are well browned. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook for about 1 minute, until it comes to a boil. Add the stock and bring back to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pan, and simmer for 30 minutes.Strain the giblet stock through a fine sieve into a medium bowl (you should have about 2 cups). Chop the giblets and add them back into the stock. Bring to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.When the turkey is done, transfer it to a carving board, loosely cover it with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving.While the turkey rests, pour the drippings from the roasting pan through a fine sieve into a small bowl. Place the bowl in the freezer for about 20 minutes to solidify the fat.Meanwhile, set the roasting pan back on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the rest of the Madeira to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook for about 1 minute, until it comes to boil. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a medium saucepan.Skim the fat from the chilled drippings and discard. Add the drippings to the Madeira mixture in the saucepan. Add the reserved giblet stock and giblets. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water. Slowly add to the simmering Madeira mixture, whisking until the gravy thickens slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.Remove the string from the turkey and carve (see directions below). Serve with the warm Madeira gravy.Tips/TechniquesChef’s Note: Carving a Turkey - Once you learn a few basic cuts, you’ll get the carving right, every time. Using a carving knife and fork, cut between the lower part of the breast and the thigh, pushing down until the leg joint separates. Wiggle each leg to find the joint between the thigh and the drumstick and slice downward through the joint. Slice the meat off the bones. Bend each wing to find the joint, then cut straight downward to remove the wing. Make a long cut along one side of the breastbone. Carve the meat from the breast, working toward the first cut in smooth, even slices.Yield: 8-10 servings

A Sperm Whale.

The Chagos Archipelago Real Audio

Log Transcript	This is Genevieve Johnson speaking to you from the central Indian Ocean.
The Odyssey crew have been researching sperm whales in the Indian Ocean for over six months. Having already found whales off the western and southern coastlines of Western Australia and the deep ocean trenches south of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, we have just arrived inside the territorial waters of the Chagos Archipelago-a British owned territory in the center of the Indian Ocean, midway between the African continent and the great mass of islands that is Indonesia. The Chagos Archipelago is a vast array of coral reefs sheltering five small coral atolls and numerous submerged atolls-all having been formed during a period of millions of years. The atoll rims are but the tips of spectacular underwater mountains, and it is just such bathymetric features that attract the animals on which sperm whales feed, which in turn attracts the sperm whales, which has in turn attracted the Odyssey crew to this remote part of the Indian Ocean.
After a three-week passage sailing west from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, we are currently undertaking our first research leg around the southeastern reaches of the Chagos Archipelago, just below the southern most tip of the Chagos Trench - a 400 mile long, underwater canyon that ranges in depth from less than 1,000 meters below the surface to walls that plung very steeply to depths over 5,000 meters. One of the most exhilarating parts of our research is searching for and finding whales in areas where no recent research has been conducted. As with many of the places the Odyssey has visited on the Voyage to date, we have no idea what we will find here.
Townsend's charts - Global maps showing the locations of sperm whale kills that were recorded in the log books of Yankee whalers between 1761 - 1920, are sometimes our only guide to finding whales in areas such as this. These charts show that sometime in the 18th and 19th centuries, Yankee whalers did indeed pass through the Chagos archipelago, and took a few sperm whales between the months of January and May. The trouble with this information is that Townsend's charts do not give any idea of effort-i.e. whether a great many or only a few ships passed through the area and secured the modest take that is indicated on the charts. After all, a given location may have produced one, or more (or many more) sperm whales. All that is shown is the position of the ship on the day that a sperm whale, or sperm whales, was (or were) killed. So we can interpret this in two ways: either the whalers were only in the area during the months of the year when whale kills occurred, or they were here in other months-perhaps even year round-but only found whales during the months indicated on the Charts. Captain Rodrigo Olson inspects the main sail as the Odyssey circumnavigates the Chagos Archipelago.

This morning we detected two strong 'click trains' (evenly spaced echolocation clicks from sperm whales) on our acoustic array - two underwater microphones housed in an oil filled tube and towed behind Odyssey at a distance of 300 feet. We concluded from the intensity of the clicks, the distance between the whales we saw, and their sheer size, that these are probably mature male sperm whales. The clicks of females are not as loud as those of males, and females generally travel in family groups. Also, they don't grow bigger than about two-thirds of the length of a mature bull. Audio recording. - male
By the way, we are careful in determining the sex of the animals we see. There are several ways to achieve it: by entering the water and looking, or by genetic analysis, either of sloughed skin or the tiny skin samples we take from these animals with our biopsy darts.
So far, this time, we have spent four days with sperm whales. We moved on from the first two animals we were with yesterday, and today have encountered another individual also most likely an adult male. It is interesting that it is often the larger mature bulls that are the most timid, when boats approach them a few individuals sink below the surface, sometimes falling silent for two hours or more when the Odyssey sails or motors close to them. Perhaps these animals have used this trick before to evade detection, which could be the reason they are still alive today. Large males have always been the preferred target of commercial whalers-they yield far more oil than do the much smaller females.
The Odyssey will be circumnavigating the Chagos archipelago over the following month while we search vigorously for sperm whales. We're all excited at the prospect of what we may find in these waters, so stay tuned.
