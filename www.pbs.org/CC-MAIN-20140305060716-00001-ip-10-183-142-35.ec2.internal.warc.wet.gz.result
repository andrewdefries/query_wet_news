From Syria to Yemen, Uprisings Continue to Rattle Arab World Uprisings, Questions Linger in Syria, Yemen, Bahrain GWEN IFILL: Next, the crackdown on Syrian dissidents, this time in the United States.While the death toll in Syria has now climbed over 5,000, another sinister side of the struggle is playing out right here at home.Hari Sreenivasan reports.HARI SREENIVASAN: It is an anthem filled with meaning for Syrian- American virtuoso Malek Jandali. And among the words to his composition entitled “I’m My Homeland,” “Oh, my homeland, when will I see you free?”Jandali played it before hundreds protesting outside the White House this summer against the regime of Bashar al-Assad and in support of the uprising. Though he says the song intends a global message, his appearance and his performance may have almost cost his parents their lives back home in Damascus.MALEK JANDALI, Syrian-American composer and pianist: And when I performed at the White House, a few hours later, less than four days, the Syrian cops and the security forces of that regime attacked my parents. Here’s a regime who couldn’t stand a five-minute song.HARI SREENIVASAN: Did you expect them to go after your parents?MALEK JANDALI: Yes. I actually warned my parents, you know “I’m going to be performing. Watch out.”HARI SREENIVASAN: Jandali’s 73-year-old father and his 66-year-old mother were attacked in their Damascus home in late July, an assault documented with photos and video a short time later.MALEK JANDALI: Thank God they have didn’t kill them. They handcuffed his hands and they made him watch my mom being beaten.HARI SREENIVASAN: He had tape placed over his mouth, handcuffed, beaten.MALEK JANDALI: Mm-hmm. That’s my dad. That’s my mom after the attack.HARI SREENIVASAN: She’s bleeding from her eye and her head.MALEK JANDALI: Mm-hmm. You can see her neck, too.HARI SREENIVASAN: Shortly after the attack, Jandali’s parents were granted emergency visas to be with their son here in the U.S.He’s convinced it was not random thuggery or even regime loyalists, but an attack orchestrated by the security forces of Bashar al-Assad. Jandali contends that the attackers acted on information gathered here in the United States. He has feared for his own safety here, and perhaps with good reason. He’s received threatening phone calls, and his own website was hacked in mid-December by the Syrian Electronic Army, which plastered a menacing message across the page.How do you know that your parents were targeted because of what you did in Washington?MALEK JANDALI: When they were beating my mom, she was screaming: “Why are you killing me? Why are you hitting me?”And they said, “Well, we’re doing this to teach you a lesson, because your son is demonstrating against us.”I have no doubt in my mind that there’s a group of people who are surveilling, monitoring the Syrian-American community. And it’s managed by the Syrian Embassy in Washington.HARI SREENIVASAN: That’s a charge the Syrian government categorically denies. But it’s not just Syrian expatriates making that allegation. In mid-October, the FBI arrested Mohamad Soueid, a naturalized citizen from Syria and a former car salesman in Northern Virginia.Among the charges leveled in the indictment, that Soueid was acting as an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat, which is their national intelligence service. The indictment alleges he was actively spying on the expatriate community here and passing information back to Syria, where relatives of U.S.-based protesters would then be threatened or killed.Prosecutors say he had protests videotaped for delivery to Syrian agents.Neil MacBride is the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, based in Alexandria. His office is prosecuting the case.NEIL MACBRIDE, U.S. Attorney: If you go through the indictment, it lays out in detail act after act after act of Mr. Soueid engaging in conduct in which he’s clearly trying to conceal, hide and misrepresent the fact that he’s an operative for Syrian intelligence. He’s directing other people to make recordings of dissidents and protesters, and then providing that information back to the Syrian government.HARI SREENIVASAN: Part of the foundation of that case against Soueid was built on wiretapped conversations he had in Arabic with his wife and with an FBI informant. Soueid’s defenders say the government has misunderstood the tone and content of the nine conversations and mistranslated similarly harmless expressions unique to Syrian Arabic.But McBride says there are other parts of the case that link Soueid to the Assad regime.NEIL MACBRIDE: At a time of immense civil unrest in Syria, the president takes time to meet personally with Mr. Soueid. Mr. Soueid has access to the Syrian ambassador here in the United States. He has access to high-level members of the Syrian intelligence agency.HARI SREENIVASAN: His trial is set for May. He is jailed without bail now. Though Soueid freely admits he’s an Assad supporter, his family and associates say he wouldn’t risk his and his wife and children’s livelihoods here. They insist he’s innocent. Soueid expressed a desire to be interviewed by the NewsHour, but our requests were denied by the authorities who hold him. His public defender also declined to speak on the record.The Syrian Embassy in Washington, D.C., has repeatedly refused NewsHour requests for an on-camera interview with either the ambassador or a top aide on the Soueid matter and whether the Syrian government is running agents in the United States.But in a statement, they did say: “There have been concerted efforts recently by individuals and the media to spread lies and distortions regarding the Embassy of Syria. These preposterous allegations claim that the embassy is involved in targeting or intimidating Syrian expatriates in the U.S., which is absolutely untrue.”The Syrian-American community is divided between support for the uprising and for the Assad regime. At a Syrian orthodox church outside Washington, not a single parishioner wanted to talk about their riven homeland.The congregation’s pastor, Fady Abdulahad, struck a careful middle ground.REV. FADY ABDULAHAD, Saint Ephraim’s Syriac Orthodox Church: We are with those people who ask rightly for their rights. They want it in the right way, going on the streets in daylight, demonstrating peacefully, but not for those people who carry arms.HARI SREENIVASAN: Only 10 percent of Syria is Christian. And the Assad regime has allowed them to practice and even attain high rank in the Syrian government. Some Syrian Christians are cautious to take sides in the uprising. And that caution has been reinforced by the recent travails of Christians in Egypt, as Islamists come to the fore.Pastor Abdulahad says no one is without blame in Syria and every side is spreading its own misinformation.REV. FADY ABDULAHAD: Everyone is engaging in a propaganda campaign, the government and the opposition, everyone. The church even is engaged in propaganda campaign. Everyone campaigns for his political point of views and how he sees what is best for the country.HARI SREENIVASAN: Abdulahad says he has heard the rumors of the Mukhabarat’s presence in the United States, but that he believes the Syrian government when it says they have nothing to do with it.REV. FADY ABDULAHAD: I have heard it through the news. And I have went to the Syrian Embassy in D.C. And the statement posted over there that the embassy says it has nothing to do with it and it never recruited anyone to work for it who is American and who lives in the U.S.HARI SREENIVASAN: Those denials meant little at a recent meeting of the Syrian American Council outside Washington. Speaker after speaker denounced the Damascus regime, speaking and singing of a Syria without Assad.Many told the stories of family harassed, assaulted or worse, allegedly because of actions taken by their family members here in U.S.Muna is from Michigan. She didn’t want her last name used for reasons that will become apparent. Her father, who left Syria 40 years ago, was marching outside the Syrian Embassy this past spring when the ambassador invited him and others in to talk.MUNA, Syrian opposition activist: So, he gave his first name, last name, where he was from. And then same day — and I got a text from my sister in Abu Dhabi saying, isn’t this crazy? The Mukhabarat just came to my uncle’s house in Daraa and asked, what’s your brother up to over there in America?HARI SREENIVASAN: Another uncle of hers later died from a brutal beating security forces meted out when they came to arrest one of his sons. She told us that 10 cousins were also rounded up, tortured and beaten. Muna said, if she thought it would make a difference to her family’s safety, she would stop protesting.MUNA: You know, Mukhabarats are everywhere in the Syrian community. So, I’m certain that there’s surveillance. But to me, that is not going to stop. The fear — the wall of fear is down.HARI SREENIVASAN: But whether any part of that wall was ever built here will be a key issue when Mohamad Soueid is brought to trial next spring.GWEN IFILL: On our website, we want to hear from Syrian-Americans who believe they or their family members have been intimidated by agents of the Assad regime and its supporters.

Gonzales resigned in September 2007.“At a minimum, the process by which nine U.S. Attorneys were removed in 2006 was haphazard, arbitrary and unprofessional, and that the way in which the Justice Department handled those removals and the resulting public controversy was profoundly lacking,” Mukasey said in a statement.The report also said several White House officials, including President Bush’s former top political aide Karl Rove, were unwilling to be interviewed by investigators about the firings.Dannehy would have to power to subpoena witnesses such as Rove who did not cooperate with inspector general’s probe.The report singled out the removal of U.S. Attorney David Iglesias of New Mexico as the most troubling.Republican political figures in New Mexico, including Sen. Pete Domenici and Rep. Heather Wilson, had complained about Iglesias’ handling of voter fraud and public corruption cases, and that led to his firing, the report said.The report concludes that Gonzales’ chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, was the person most responsible for coming up with the plan to fire the prosecutors and said that Sampson’s comments to Congress, the White House and others were misleading.The report also found that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney in Arkansas, was forced out to make way for Timothy Griffin, who had served as Rove’s deputy in the White House political office.It also said that the dismissal of Todd Graves, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, probably resulted from pressure from the office of Republican Sen. Christopher “Kit” Bond.

400 Years of the Telescope | A Journey of Science, Technology and Thought
ENGLISH ESPAÑOL
Click here for a larger preview.
Panoramic visuals and engaging interviews make 400 Years of the Telescope the must-see documentary of the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.
Beautifully photographed in 4K digital cinematography, the film is a visually stunning chronicle of the history of the telescope from the time of Galileo, its profound impact upon the science of astronomy, and how both shape the way we view ourselves in the midst of an infinite universe.
The film features interviews with leading astrophysicists and cosmologists from the world's renowned universities and observatories, who explain concepts ranging from Galileo's act of revealing the cosmos with a simple telescope, to the latest discoveries in space, including startling new ideas about life on other planets and dark energy — a mysterious vacuum energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
Join us on this companion website to explore this fascinating subject as you meet the film's producers and their worldwide search for the world's greatest telescopes, enjoy captivating interviews with brilliant personalities, learn about planetarium programs in your area and discover local and faraway opportunities to experience our incredible universe firsthand.

National Journal Online	Monday's Starting LineupGood Monday morning. Capitol Hill reporters are taking a much-needed break after a legislative sprint. Now, it's the campaign reporters who get to have all the fun. Stick with Hotline OnCall all week for a close-up look at how members are handling their recess.
Here's today's Starting Lineup, previewing the people who will make a difference in politics today:Posted: Monday, March 29, 2010 - 4:45am PMA Keeps Earmarks Issue AliveGiven voter disgust with both Congress and federal deficits, it's remarkable how unabashedly some lawmakers have jumped in to defend the increasingly controversial budget line items known as earmarks.Sen. Thad Cochran , R-Miss., was so upset over GOP pressure to rein in earmarks that he took toPosted: Sunday, March 28, 2010 - 11:00pm True Or False: This Poll Is Out ThereLast week, I got a generous dare via Twitter from Markos Moulitsas , founder and publisher of the liberal Web site Daily Kos: "I'll do this for you, @MysteryPollster -- design a 'wingnut' poll that would be valid in your eyes, and I will run it." Read more and comment on this column at PollstPosted: Sunday, March 28, 2010 - 11:00pm Just Askin' - The Searchlight EditionThe Tea Party came to Senate Maj. Leader Harry Reid's hometown 3/27, making it clear they view him as their No. 1 target in '10. To be sure, Reid remains one of the most vulnerable Dems on the Nov. ballot. But could the movement's plan to shine a "spotlight" on Searchlight backfire?
In his bid for a sixth term, Reid is being widely portrayed as an out-of-touch pol more focused on advancing his party's nat'l agenda than catering to the kitchen-table issues of average NVans. That image, accurate or not, has made Reid into a nat'l target, not just a NV GOP one. Posted: Sunday, March 28, 2010 - 10:49am Feingold Raising Money Off Thompson ThreatSen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) is using the prospect of a strong challenger to raise money for his bid for a fourth term.
"With news that former Bush administration HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson is very likely to run against me this November, it's no surprise that the media is reporting that Thompson is now 'calling top donors.' They have also reported that 'lots of people in Washington' want the D.C. insider to run against us and that he has collected over $200,000 in pledges for his campaign," Feingold wrote in a fundraising email this morning.Posted: Saturday, March 27, 2010 - 9:48am Computer, Net Use Surges At Public LibrariesAs the nation struggled through a severe recession, use of computers and wireless Internet access at U.S. public libraries surged last year, according to a new study. The study, conducted by the University of Washington Information School and released Thursday, studied who uses library computers and Internet access and why. It found that 77 million Americans - nearly one-third of Americans age 14 and over - utilized computers and wireless Internet access available at most public libraries.Posted: Friday, March 26, 2010 - 3:12pm Rubio Leads Crist In Respected Mason-Dixon PollEx-State House Speaker Marco Rubio (R) leads Gov. Charlie Crist (R) by 11 points in a new Mason-Dixon Polling & Research survey released today in the contentious FL SEN primary, a margin smaller than other public polling has shown over the past month.
The poll was conducted Mar. 23-25 among 625 regular voters, with a margin of error of +/- 3.9%. There was an oversample of 400 likely voters in the GOP primary, with a margin of error of +/- 4.9%. Rubio and Crist were tested in general-election matchups with Rep. Kendrick Meek (D).Posted: Friday, March 26, 2010 - 2:55pm Weekend LineupHere are the scheduled guests for the Sunday public affairs shows and other weekend programs:
Meet the Press hosts Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY). The roundtable features historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Newsweek's Jon Meacham, GOP strategist Mike Murphy and Dem strategist Bob Shrum.
Face the Nation hosts Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) and DNC chair/ex-VA Gov. Tim Kaine.Posted: Friday, March 26, 2010 - 2:00pm Previewing Recess: The GOP ViewGOPers will do their best to sell new health care reforms as excessive overreaches of government, even as the party subtly shifts to an economic-centric focus, according to documents handed to members of Congress as they left town this week.
In a note to colleagues, House GOP Conference chair Mike Pence urges them to remind their constituents they voted against health care legislation while hammering Dems for failing to turn the economy around.Posted: Friday, March 26, 2010 - 12:53pm MusicFIRST, Broadcasters Battle OnThe message battle continues between broadcasters and the music industry over legislation that would require AM and FM radio stations to pay a fee to performers for playing their music on the air. The latest salvo comes over the radio industry's claim that the legislation would place a new burden on already struggling local radio stations. The performance rights legislation has been approved by the House and Senate Judiciary committees, but the leaders of those panels have urged the two sides to try to reach a compromise.Posted: Friday, March 26, 2010 - 12:52pm « first

Lured by the promise of rich, plentiful soil, thousands of settlers came to the Southern Plains, bringing farming techniques that worked well in the North and East. The farmers subsequently plowed millions of acres of grassland, only to have the rains stop in the summer of 1931. The catastrophic eight-year drought that followed led observers to rename the region “The Dust Bowl.”
Time Period: 1931-1939
Themes: The Dust Bowl, farming techniques and environmental impact, soil conservation, the Great Depression, the New Deal Before Viewing Discussion
1. Have students recall everything they think they know about the Dust Bowl. Have they ever heard of it? Who was affected? How and why? What images come to mind when they think about America in the 1930s?
2. Have students identify the five-state region known as the Dust Bowl on a map of the United States and compile information about the terrain, general weather patterns, sources of water, and economic activity (farming, ranching, etc.)
After Viewing Discussion
1. Read the following quote to your students or write it on the board:
“I felt I was becoming a slave to the land. But I held on to the thought that this land had to be stopped from blowing. Often I was so full of dust that I drove blind, unable to see even the radiator cap on my tractor or hear the roar of the engines. But I kept driving on and on, by guess and instinct. I was making my last stand in the Dust Bowl.”
If you had been part of one of these farm families during the ’30s, do you think you would have wanted to stay on your farm or leave? Why or why not? What would you lose by leaving? What would you gain?
2. At the end of the film, farmers are talking together about the future. One is hopeful that people will start taking care of the land differently. Another says, “Don’t fool yourself… It’s just not in our blood to play a safe game.” What does the farmer mean? Why do you think farmers might have been unwilling to change their farming practices once the rains returned?
3. Write a diary entry or letter from one of the following points of view: a farmer who is a member of the “Last Man Club,” a mother nursing a child sick with dust pneumonia, or a healthy child watching the adults cope with the disaster.
4. Have students research the various relief programs offered by the New Deal. What would have happened to people if relief checks and food handouts were not available? Was this an appropriate governmental response?
5. Have students further study the Dust Bowl era through a range of historical, literary, and visual sources, including Carey McWilliam’s Ill Fares the Land, John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, James Agee and Walker Evan’s You Have Seen Their Faces, Pare Lorentz’s documentaries for the Farm Security Administration The River and The Plow That Broke the Plains, and the photographs of Dorothea Lange and others. Students can further investigate how the work of Lange, Agee, Evans, Lorentz, and others reflected American conditions in the 1930s and evaluate their impact on the New Deal. (Visit the website sponsored by the National Archives featuring Depression-era artwork, interviews, etc..)
6. Compare and contrast other ways humans have affected the natural landscape for survival and economic gain. Divide students into groups and have each group study one of the following: strip mining, logging practices including clear cutting, hydroelectric dams, clearing land in the rain forest for farming and cattle ranching. Each group should research the following: what are the short-term benefits vs. the long-term consequences; who wins, who loses; in what ways has the practice changed and how did those changes come about? Have each group develop a position paper, either supporting the practice or suggesting how it could be modified, and a process for implementing any change. How can they make their proposed changes attractive to the opposition? How will they compensate for perceived losses? Is it possible to design a win-win solution?
7. To learn about some of the challenges facing farmers today, watch Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern which documents one family’s battle to save their farm during the massive foreclosures of family farms in the late ’80s. What is similar and what is different about the challenges modern farming families face and the ways they cope compared to Dust Bowl-era farmers? How does the role of government compare?
8. Agriculture involves reducing the diversity of a given ecosystem and therefore must be heavily controlled in order for the system to remain stable. A major change since the 1930s in farming has been the use of agrochemicals (chemical pesticides and fertilizers). In fact, increases in grain production over the past 40 years are attributable primarily to the use of chemical fertilizers. How have changes in farming practices, such as the rise in monocrop farming, encouraged farmers to turn to chemical fertilizers? What are the benefits? What are the costs?

The News of the World cellphone-hacking and police corruption scandal has claimed its first fatality. The AP reported today that Sean Hoare, the former News of the World and Sun reporter who leaked information regarding the tabloid’s widespread use of cellphone hacking to the press, has been found dead at his home in Watford, England. Police said they do not consider Hoare’s death to be suspicious.
Hoare worked as a reporter under Andy Coulson, former News of the World editor and communications chief to Prime Minister David Cameron, who was the first official from the paper to be arrested during the investigation.

The actor-director recounts how and why he got into travel writing and shares stories from his new memoir, The Longest Way Home.
Andrew McCarthy has two thriving careers. He's perhaps best known as an actor, whose body of work defies typecasting. Since making his on-screen debut at age 19, he's become a veteran of the stage and the big and small screens. He's also directed episodes of several TV series. His second career is as a writer, who is an editor-at-large at National Geographic Traveler and has written for various publications. In his memoir, The Longest Way Home, McCarthy uses his love of adventure to trace his journey from acting in New Jersey, where he grew up, and his early success to writing award-winning travel articles and self-discovery.	Books, Entertainment
Read the transcriptTRANSCRIPTTavis: Pleased to welcome Andrew McCarthy to this program. The star of so many notable films, including, of course, “Pretty in Pink,” “St. Elmo’s Fire,” and “Less than Zero” is now an award-winning travel writer who serves as editor-at-large for “National Geographic Traveler.” His critically acclaimed new book is called “The Longest Way Home: One Man’s Quest for the Courage to Settle Down.” Andrew, nice to have you on this program.
Andrew McCarthy: Thanks. Nice to be here.
Tavis: I would assume that you must be tickled about the reception this book is receiving.
McCarthy: I am. It’s also a huge relief, because it’s a complicated thing. It’s a bit of wait, this actor’s brought out this kind of – so it’s a relief when it’s received in a nice way, so that it can stand on its own, rise and fall on its own, as opposed to some weird baggage that it gets from being my history.
Tavis: Yeah, yeah. Were there doubts? Was there trepidation about putting a book out that is wrapped around travel, or put another way, travel is at the epicenter of it, but it really is about your life in so many respects. Any fear about being so transparent?
McCarthy: No, I guess is the short answer. I think the book turned out much more personal than I thought it would be when I began it, but I knew I didn’t want to write a travel book, per se. But travel is the form that I’ve been writing about for the last 10 years, so it was a platform that I understood and I used travel in a personal way to sort of solve dilemmas and answer questions that I have in life.
So I had a question that I needed answered, so I really just, I traveled it. Some people go to therapy, some people have tea with the girls, I travel a problem. (Laughter)
So I traveled this dilemma that I had, and so it’s a sort of internal thing that plays out in 3D on Kilimanjaro and down the Amazon and stuff. So it had to be personal if it was going to be anything, otherwise it just would have been some random, strung-together travel, which didn’t interest me.
Tavis: And the dilemma that you had, the question you were trying to answer was?
McCarthy: Well, I had been engaged for a number of years and yet I found myself unable, in a certain way, to get married. I thought – I suffered from that “I love you, I’ve got to go” syndrome. I have that paradox of where I really want to be here and yet part of me just yearns to be on my own. So it’s reconciling, I think, the need for community, commitment, intimacy, with the need for solitude, and it was a problem I haven’t seen wrestled with very much.
So I didn’t have any sort of precedent for it, so I just started trying to solve that question in myself.
Tavis: This conversation is going to get me in some trouble. I was reluctant to even have this conversation with you. (Laughter) Because it brings up my own personal drama.
McCarthy: Well, you know what I mean? Once you start talking about this stuff you realize that a lot of people have this kind of issue.
Tavis: Yeah.
McCarthy: But this whole notion that we should be together all the time and we’re not – it’s crazy in a certain way. So I find it a very common sort of ailment, and yet it’s part of the human – I suppose in days long ago men would go off to the hunt and be gone for a long time and then come back. So I need – my wife is one who likes – we have us and then I can go have me.
I’m like, I need me, and then I can have us. So we approach the same thing from polar opposites.
Tavis: How do you – and there’s a whole book, of course, where you do this, but in short, how – and there’s a passage I want to read here – but how would you explain – and I ask this, again, I was joking a moment ago; well, actually not joking, about the fact that my personal life came to me when I got a chance to read your own book.
I’ve had the most difficult time as a single man. I am not married as yet, but I’ve dated, of course, in my life, and I have never found success trying to explain to a girlfriend why it is, literally why it is that I need some time alone to travel. If I get a couple of weeks off from this TV show, then you are expected to spend that time with your girlfriend because they don’t see you enough as it is because you’re working all the time.
But to explain, okay, I’ve got three weeks off, I’m going to spend a week and a half of that with you, but I need a week and a half to just be by myself, to think, to have some solitude. That’s the most difficult thing for guys to explain to companions sometimes. How did you go about explaining that?
McCarthy: How did I sell that one at home?
Tavis: Yeah, how’d you do that? (Laughter)
McCarthy: Well, I think my wife has sort of her own vital life, and so she’s not waiting for me to have – for us. She’s living her own life, and she understands that it’s – I come back a better person for having been off doing my thing, so she wants that person.
So it’s not particularly an issue. Often when I come back she’s like, “What are you doing here? We’re just getting a rhythm without you.” (Laughter)
Tavis: Yeah.
McCarthy: So, I don’t really – men travel for work all the time. I’m traveling to write magazine articles. It happens that I’m going to exotic, fantastic places, or acting on a movie set or something. So I think it’s a natural rhythm of a relationship.
Tavis: But Andrew, in fairness, though, you weren’t just traveling for your job. That is a part of what you do. But you said in this conversation and argue in the book, of course, or lay bare in the book that for you, there is a need to be alone.
McCarthy: Yeah.
Tavis: It’s not just for work. You need to get alone, traveling by yourself, traveling solo allows you to find answers, allows you to – so it’s not just – so again I’m coming back to this because I know there are a lot of guys watching who feel the same way – who – that private solitude, that space is important to be with oneself for a while, and I’ve never begrudged a girlfriend doing that.
McCarthy: Yeah.
Tavis: Take a week, take two weeks, I’m okay with that, but it doesn’t always seem to work the same way in reverse.
McCarthy: Then you’ve got to find another woman.
Tavis: Okay, got it. (Laughter) All right, enough said.
McCarthy: I just think if I -
Tavis: Answered that question.
McCarthy: – if I’ve got nothing to bring to you, then I’ve got nothing to bring to you.
Tavis: Right.
McCarthy: So I’ve got to go – so I don’t know.
Tavis: So how did traveling on your own, how did getting out there, even in these exotic places, help you find the answer to your question, to your dilemma?
McCarthy: Well, I’d have to back up. Travel for me started, as a young actor I went to many places. I would get in the car and I’d go to a location; I’d come back and I’d sort of see things through the window.
Then I took a trip, I walked along the Camino de Santiago in Spain, that sort of old pilgrim route for 500 miles across the north of Spain, and I read a book about that once. So I suddenly found myself a week later, I said, “I’m going to do that.” I had no idea why I did that.
I’d never backpacked, I’d never hiked, I’d never done anything, but I wanted to do that, so I found myself walking across Spain, and it was miserable. I had a terrible experience. I was lonely, I had blisters, it was a terrible sort of time.
Then I had one of those moments that people talk about where it got so bad – I had a breakdown. I had a tantrum, basically, in the middle of a field of wheat, where I just sort of was on my knees suddenly, sobbing, screaming up to the heavens, “This is horrible. This isn’t fair. Why am I not appreciated? What’s going on in my life? Where’s my limousine to pick me up and take me home?”
It was a real transformative moment for me, because I had a sudden awareness, sitting there sobbing in a field of wheat, that fear which had so dominated my life up to that point, in a way that I was never even aware of its existence until that sort of moment of its first absence, suddenly was lifted from me, and I suddenly had much more space around me and in myself, because I was relieved of this kind of fear.
So I started traveling. I said, “I want more of that feeling,” so I started traveling and doing more of it, and through traveling I sort of grew up. I was a young guy doing all these kind of movies in my twenties, so there’s a certain kind of stunted something that happens, or I’m just doing that, and so the traveling allowed me to be separate from that and have my own sort of experiences. It helped me really step through fear, is the simple answer.
Tavis: What were you afraid of? Success?
McCarthy: Well, I certainly had – I’ve had a real struggle, I think, in my whole life with ambivalence. I wanted success and yet on the other hand I would pull away from it. I wanted to be intimate with you and yet I’ve got to go. So it was a constant sort of push-pull and wrangling of the two, and trying to figure that out, just – because I found that internal constant struggle is exhausting and you can’t really make substantial progress in anything if you’re like that.
But I found myself fearful of people, fearful of success, fearful of – fear just becomes a habit, and fear masquerades as many, many things. It masquerades as common sense, it masquerades as exhaustion, as anything – I’m afraid of flying. So it helped me to sort of dissolve that to a large degree in my life, or to the degree where I was not going to be ruled by it.
So I became very aware of its presence. I think – it’s one of my big soapboxes. I think America’s an amazing country, and yet I think America is a very, very fearful place, and I think we make many, many decisions based on fear, particularly political decisions.
We make them on fear without proper information. I think if Americans traveled, they would see the world differently. Mark Twain has that great line, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness.” I think that’s absolutely true. I think if Americans traveled, they’d be less fearful.
They’d realize that guy with a towel around his head is not trying to kill him, probably, and we would make less fearful decisions. So if we traveled, the world would be a much safer place, I think. My soapbox is that I’d like to change the world one trip at a time.
Tavis: I don’t disagree with you on that, and I’ve made that point any number of times on this show, citing repeatedly the statistic, how the overwhelming number of Americans do not even own a passport.
McCarthy: Yeah, I think it’s about 30 percent or something.
Tavis: Exactly, that’s the number. Doesn’t even own a passport. 70 percent of us do not own a passport, 70 percent.
McCarthy: And I think half of those have used them.
Tavis: Yeah, half of the – yeah. So the question for you, because I agree with your sentiment, why is it that we don’t? Is it arrogance, is it hubris, is it narcissism, is it nationalism? Why don’t we travel the world more?
McCarthy: Well, what’s arrogance but fear just turned on its head, and bravado? So I just think it’s fearful thinking. We’ve got everything in America, we have all these different kinds of – we’ve got everything. You can go to Hawaii, you can go to the Grand Canyon, why go anywhere else? But I think the reason to travel is for the people and the cultures and see how people are doing things differently, not to be – so I just think it’s fear.
Then people really rail against me when I say this. They go, “No, it’s money, it’s not fear.” I’m like, “Wow, that’s a really aggressive stance.” People will defend; they’ll fight for their fears full-on. I don’t think it’s money. I’ve sort of proved to friends of mine who say that, I show them I spend less money on the road than I do at home.
One of the biggest travel best sellers right now is a book called “The Kindness of Strangers,” about a guy who traveled around without a penny. So I just think it’s Americans stay home.
Tavis: How did your travel ultimately inform, impact, your acting, or your development as an actor?
McCarthy: Well, it helped me as a person, so anything that helps develop you sort of and get out of yourself as a person is going to help your acting. It helped me grow up in that way, like I say, and it helped me have more compassion and more curiosity.
As an actor you’re always interested in detail and behavior and things, so watching people, it’s fascinating. I do a lot of directing now too, so it’s interesting. In acting, you’re very subjective from the point of view. I’m just worried about the story from my perspective.
In directing, you’re much more interested in, of course, in telling the whole thing, so you’ve got a much more bird’s-eye point of view. Then the writing, it’s kind of a combination of the two. I would want to immerse myself in the story and then pull back and tell the story. So they all kind of feed each other.
I suppose that also has given me a different creative outlet so I’m not dependent on acting in a creative way. I feel like I have to be creative, for lack of a better word, every day to find myself, to locate myself. It doesn’t have to be particularly good. I just have to be in the sort of state of creating, because that’s what I do for my life. That’s how I make my living.
So in acting you’re always waiting for somebody to give you a chance to do that, and in the writing I can just do it myself and I can sort of place myself much easier. So I think they all feed.
Tavis: I want to read this passage, but I want to come right back to this point you’re making now about the freedom – that’s my word, not yours – but this freedom that you have found by not having to be tied to waiting for somebody to give you a job.
That’s an important issue I want to come back to, but I was talking about this, how your travel influenced your acting, and I found this passage fascinating in your book. It’s the new book from Andrew McCarthy called “The Longest Way Home: One Man’s Quest for the Courage to Settle Down.”
I found this fascinating: “I have often wondered why certain acting jobs come my way when they do. What’s the lesson to be learned, aside from the obvious challenge of the work? Why, for example, am I cast as a widower while I’m in the process of getting divorced, or in a silly comedy while I’m going through a particularly tough stretch personally? With travel writing, it has been the same.”
McCarthy: Yeah. Well, I love that. I love that my life is constantly reflected in my work. I’m so grateful that I have jobs that are seamless in my life. It’s not something that I go do and it’s totally divorced from who I am. I’m really grateful that I’m sort of a part of my work, and my work is a part of me and influencing me and illuminating things about myself to me.
That’s fascinating to me. I’m glad I’m not, I’m so grateful that I don’t have to just do Sprockets a hundred times, a thousand times a day. I don’t know, I would go insane. I can imagine there’s a certain freedom in that too. It’s just a detachment, I do it, it’s done, whereas mine is it’s always at work or at play in itself. But that’s how I’ve always lived, and so that’s how I feel comfortable.
Tavis: Since we’re on this subject, I’ve always believed, at least for my own life, I can’t speak for others, I’ve always believed that for my own life, freedom is really about the right to choose, and in this business so much of what happens, as you said earlier, is not about your right to choose but about being chosen by somebody else for the part, for the role, for the opportunity.
So it’s kind of like the inverse. How has this freedom to choose, to choose to act, to choose to write, to choose to travel, to choose, et cetera, to direct, how has that freedom enhanced – my word, not yours – I assume it’s enhanced your life in myriad ways?
McCarthy: Yeah, well, I resent people having power over me in any regard. So it just gave me a chance to sort of take myself back, in a certain way, and it was a huge relief when I found writing. I came to writing fairly late in life, and so in college and in school I never read, I didn’t write.
So when I found it, it was a big relief because I’m also a fairly solitary person, so it was something I could just do. I didn’t need you to bounce it off of. It didn’t exist, and then suddenly I wrote it, and now it exists, whereas acting is much more of an interpretive thing.
So it’s given me a sense of power in the good way of not power of assertion but power of self-possession that always ultimately makes me more generous and makes me a better version of myself, because if I own myself, my own power, then I’m sort of open to you as opposed to trying – if I’m desperate and need this acting job, it’s much more, I’m much more closed off to you.
Why I travel and why I sort of write, all this stuff is to try and open that and have some sort of connection with you, ultimately. So acting was the first time I found that, where I would sort of connect to something and sort of try and communicate that connection, but that’s always what I’m sort of after.
The paradox for me is that someone who’s very much a loner and keeps myself separate, ultimately, what I’m after is connection with you. Then, of course, I want to flee it, which is the whole paradox of the book. How does a loner find – so it’s a constant sort of struggle in life for – it’s a balance, and it’s sort of you’re going one direction, then I’m going the other.
So if that makes any sense, I’ve found it to be an interesting – the writing’s helped me in that regard. It’s freed me.
Tavis: I guess this doesn’t surprise me, given that nothing Hollywood does surprises me, (laughter) but it is fascinating to think, Andrew, about the way you were sold to us. You were packaged and sold to us as part of a Brat Pack. You were not sold to us as a loner, as a solitary individual, which you now confess to being.
When you look back, then, on those Brat Pack years, what do you make – were we sold a false bill of goods where you are concerned?
McCarthy: Well, it was certainly an odd thing, because in reality, of course, nothing like that ever existed. But it doesn’t matter, because it became a very zippy saying, and it’s attached. I could land on Mars now and it will say Andrew “Brat Pack” McCarthy lands on Mars. (Laughter)
That’s going to be with me my whole life, and it’s absolutely fine now. Because now it’s become this sort of iconic, friendly kind of – it’s a warm and fuzzy thing, whereas when it first started I think it was a very pejorative term that was – and the last thing as an actor you want is to be sort of lumped together and all that kind of stuff, and I found it – anything like that’s limiting.
So I hated it when I was young and I thought it was really – I ran from it. But you can’t outrun something like that. You never can. So you just – and those movies now are, I look at them, I never watched them, but I’ve been doing publicity so I see them pop up in the interviews as pieces, and I look at them and I look at myself and I think, well, the acting’s not that great in some of them, but there’s a certain look in my eye that’s very – so full of that youthful thrill of being we’re right here, this is so great. We’re here together, doing – you know what I mean?
That only youth has, so I had a certain appeal that’s very evident to me when I see it now from this distance. That whole group of movies and actors, it was interesting, because at the time they weren’t well-respected films in any way. I think “Less than Zero” was a huge bomb, didn’t make any money, it was terribly reviewed.
I think “St. Elmo’s Fire” was, one review summed it up, it said, “It’s an imitation ‘Big Chill’ a day late and a dollar short.” (Laughter) None of these movies were well-regarded films. They were just – but now they’ve taken on this kind of stature, and I think one of the reasons they did is because this was the mid-’80s, I guess, when VCR had just sort of come into people’s homes in a powerful way, and so the people that were renting movies were kids. They were going to those movies.
So suddenly instead of seeing a movie once, maybe twice, you could take us home and watch it 10, 15 times with your friends, and they took ownership of us in a way that defined their youth. So I think it was a shock to everybody in those movies that they became so iconic.
Tavis: You said when you look at these films now, when you’re forced to look at them, you see in your eyes a youthful something. Just the eyes are the window to the soul – when you look back at yourself in that time period now, were you unhappy then? You were running from the success, you were intimidated by the success, but were you unhappy?
McCarthy: No, not at all.
Tavis: Okay.
McCarthy: I was very – I was doing what I wanted to do. I was thrilled. Yet I found it, I wasn’t a Kennedy, I wasn’t bred for success. I didn’t really know how to handle it or negotiate it. There was no sort of career planning going on with me. It wasn’t like I did a movie about a mannequin, now let me do one about drug addicts.
There was no – it was whatever came next, sort of, and I was frightened by it, I suppose, to a degree, because I didn’t feel that I would be able to – that a lot was being heaped on me that I didn’t know was really appropriate or valid or who I was.
So it was just a peculiar time. (Laughter) But it so defined who I became as a man, and I’ve often wished – well, not often, but lately, when people ask me about it, I’ve thought it’d be interesting to have had a parallel life where none of that happened to see how it’s changed, how different I am because of that happening.
It’s just been my life, and so it was an interesting thing. It probably helped propel me and to travel more, (unintelligible) sort of flee and bounce away from that, and that’s been a good thing. But it also gave me a way in the world. I had no idea what I would have done had I not become an actor, and a successful actor very young.
I was kicked out of college, I wasn’t good in school, I wasn’t interested in school. I didn’t have any – I had just sort of some feeling that I wanted to do something, and it gelled very quickly. So it’s just my sort of path.
Tavis: How’s the “NatGeo” work coming along?
McCarthy: Yeah, it’s great. (Laughter) It’s an interesting thing, because in travel, that magazine, that brand, is so respected, so it was wonderful for me because when I was starting to do it, people were like, “You write for ‘National Geographic?’” It was instant respect in a way that wait, the guy from “Pretty in Pink” thinks he’s a travel writer? Oh, great. (Laughter)
So it helped eliminate that to some degree, and it helped me sort of spread out and do what I wanted to do. But I also was good – I could tell stories, which is what I brought to it.
Tavis: How did you become such – I wanted to ask that, so I’m glad you raised it – how did you become such a good storyteller?
McCarthy: Well, I don’t know that I am, except that I’ve been telling stories all the time my whole life as an actor, and I know good dialogue. I’ve said so much bad dialogue I know good dialogue when I hear it. (Laughter) So I know a good quote, and I know sort of story arc.
I just know that. That’s how I live, that’s my whole life, has been in storytelling in one form or another, so that’s what I like. My kids are like, “Dad, tell us,” my kids can’t sit still at the dinner table. It’s like, “Dad, tell us a story.” If I tell them a story, they sit and eat their food, you know what I mean?
So I just, I like stories. That’s forever, forever in the world, that’s how people communicate, is through story, and so I find it interesting.
Tavis: He is a great storyteller, whether he’s acting, whether he’s directing, or now writing a book. He’s been doing the travel stuff for a while, but now there is a book, and it’s called “The Longest Way Home: One Man’s Quest for the Courage to Settle Down.” Everybody’s talking about it.
The acclaim on this book is beyond critical. You might want to add it to your collection. Written by Andrew McCarthy. Andrew, good to have you on the program, and congrats on the book.
McCarthy: Thank you.
Tavis: Glad to have you here. That’s our show tonight. You can download our new app in the iTunes app store. I’ll see you back here next time on PBS. Until then, good night from L.A., thanks for watching, and as always, keep the faith.

“Wade Hunt:” There’s a saying that Dr. King had, and he said, “There’s always a right time to do the right thing.” I just try to live my life every day by doing the right thing. We know that we’re only about halfway to completely eliminate hunger, and we have a lot of work to do. And Walmart committed $2 billion to fighting hunger in the U.S. As we work together, we can stamp hunger out.
“Announcer:” And by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you.

The U.S.A. is a very large country with oceans, lakes, rivers, plains, mountains, hills, deserts, forest, wetland, jungles, glaciers, tundra, etc. All with no papers, national I.d., or currency changes! Where else would one travel I’ve so many different environments with such ease?

I watch your program frequently. Andrew McCarthy and you ask the question “Why don’t more people travel?” I just got my passport in preparation to travel to Europe next year. I would travel more and to more destinations if I HAD THE MONEY.
