Salt limits change, Canadians still eat too much
By Lynn Desjardins | english@rcinet.caFriday 18 October, 2013	, No Comments ↓	Listen
Canadians eat way too much salt say blood pressure experts meeting in Montreal, but they have raised the daily limit from 1,500 milligrams to 2,000 mg (about a teaspoon) of salt per day. Currently, Canadians consume between 3,400mg and 4,000mg, 77% of it coming from processed foods.

Few benefits of previous salt limit
“Over the last several years there have been many studies that have questioned the feasibility of individuals consuming 1,500 mg per day,” says Manuel Arango, Director of Health Policy, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. “As well there have been concerns expressed as to whether there are in fact any health benefits of consuming that low a level of sodium and whether there is any harm in consuming that low a level of sodium.”
Too much salt can raise blood pressure which in turn puts a strain on the heart, arteries, kidney and brain. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, dementia and kidney disease. A review of the research indicates that limiting salt intake to 2,000 mg per day can significantly improve blood pressure.
New salt limit easier to implement, experts say
The new 2,000mg limit will make it easier for groups like the Heart and Stroke Foundation and Hypertension Canada to work with government and food manufacturers to try to reduce sodium levels in food, says Arango.
“We do know that it’s not going to be easy to get down to the new level because there’s a lot of work to do,” says Arango. “The food industry has to make quite a few changes. We need government policy to change as well in order to facilitate these reductions.
To reduce salt intake Canadians should read food labels, eat out less, eat more vegetables and fruit, say experts. © CBC
Eat less processed, restaurant food, recommend experts
“Consumers and individuals have a lot of work to do as well. They need to read the nutrition facts panel (on food packages), eat less processed food, cook from home more often, eat out less and increase their intake of fruit and vegetables.”

Radio Canada International does not endorse any of the views posted. Your comments will be pre-moderated and published if they meet netiquette guidelines.
Netiquette »
When you express your personal opinion in an online forum, you must be as courteous as if you were speaking with someone face-to-face. Insults and personal attacks will not be tolerated. To disagree with an opinion, an idea or an event is one thing, but to show disrespect for other people is quite another. Great minds don’t always think alike—and that’s precisely what makes online dialogue so interesting and valuable.
Netiquette is the set of rules of conduct governing how you should behave when communicating via the Internet. Before you post a message to a blog or forum, it’s important to read and understand these rules. Otherwise, you may be banned from posting.
RCInet.ca’s online forums are not anonymous. Users must register, and give their full name and place of residence, which are displayed alongside each of their comments. RCInet.ca reserves the right not to publish comments if there is any doubt as to the identity of their author.
Assuming the identity of another person with intent to mislead or cause harm is a serious infraction that may result in the offender being banned.
RCInet.ca’s online forums are open to everyone, without regard to age, ethnic origin, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
Comments that are defamatory, hateful, racist, xenophobic, sexist, or that disparage an ethnic origin, religious affiliation or age group will not be published.
In online speak, writing in ALL CAPS is considered yelling, and may be interpreted as aggressive behaviour, which is unpleasant for the people reading. Any message containing one or more words in all caps (except for initialisms and acronyms) will be rejected, as will any message containing one or more words in bold, italic or underlined characters.
Use of vulgar, obscene or objectionable language is prohibited. Forums are public places and your comments could offend some users. People who use inappropriate language will be banned.
Mutual respect is essential among users. Insulting, threatening or harassing another user is prohibited. You can express your disagreement with an idea without attacking anyone.
Exchanging arguments and opposing views is a key component of healthy debate, but it should not turn into a dialogue or private discussion between two users who address each other without regard for the other participants. Messages of this type will not be posted.
Radio Canada International publishes contents in five languages. The language used in the forums has to be the same as the contents we publish. The usage of other languages, with the exception of some words, is forbidden. Messages that are off-topic will not be published.
Making repetitive posts disrupts the flow of discussions and will not be tolerated.
Adding images or any other type of file to comments is forbidden. Including hyperlinks to other websites is allowed, as long as they comply with netiquette. Radio Canada International is in no way responsible for the content of such sites, however.
Copying and pasting text written by someone else, even if you credit the author, is unacceptable if that text makes up the majority of your comment.
Posting any type of advertising or call to action, in any form, to Radio Canada International forums is prohibited.
All comments and other types of content are moderated before publication. Radio Canada International reserves the right to refuse any comment for publication.
Radio Canada International reserves the right to close a forum at any time, without notice.
Radio Canada International reserves the right to amend this code of conduct (netiquette) at any time, without notice.

Radio Canada International has no obligation to remove your messages from the web if one day you request it. We invite you to carefully consider your comments and the consequences of their posting.
