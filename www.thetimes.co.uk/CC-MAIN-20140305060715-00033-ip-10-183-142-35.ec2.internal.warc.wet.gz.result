‘If a white shirt will take you anywhere, I’m not going very far. I only have three shirts, two of which I’ve never worn and none of which is white’
There are many things I long ago grew tired of reading. One is that mannish clothes can look incredibly feminine. I’m sure they can if you’re Audrey Hepburn or Annie Hall, less so for the rest of us. The second is that there’s a red lipstick to suit everyone.

The President of Cyprus vowed to stick with the euro yesterday but attacked those who propped up his country’s second-largest bank with €9 billion that must now be repaid to the European Central Bank. Nicos Anastasiades claimed in a speech to civil servants that Cyprus had “secured its salvation” with the eurozone bailout that had “staved off the danger of bankruptcy”, despite warnings of massive capital flight as soon as bank restrictions are lifted. After a second calm day at bank branches which reopened on Thursday after a 12-day shutdown, Mr Anastasiades braced public servants for a restructuring that would

William Hague has warned that Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme could lead to a “new Cold War”, even deeper than that between the West and USSR. The Foreign Secretary said that “all options must remain on the table” in dealing with the Iranian regime.
“(The Iranians) are clearly continuing their nuclear weapons programme,” Mr Hague said.
“If they obtain nuclear weapons capability, then other nations across the Middle East will want to develop nuclear weapons,” he said.
“The threat of a new Cold War in the Middle East without necessarily all the safety mechanisms… that would be a
