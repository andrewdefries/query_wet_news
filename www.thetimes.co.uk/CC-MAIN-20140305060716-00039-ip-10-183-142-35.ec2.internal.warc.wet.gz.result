An Islamic school accused of enforcing a strict Muslim dress code and segregating girls is to reopen today.
Al-Madinah School in Derby, one of Michael Gove’s pioneering free schools which closed last week when inspectors arrived, has told parents it will open “as normal” for primary and secondary pupils from this morning.
Mr Gove asked Ofsted to send in inspectors after claims that children spent up to three hours a day in prayer with a further hour each of Koranic and Islamic studies. Women staff were said to be forced to wear the hijab.
The school was reported to have

Less than a fortnight after the Government admitted that colonial authorities used torture during the Mau Mau rebellion in 1950s Kenya, declassified files show that the British also resorted to brutality closer to home in Cyprus. Top-secret papers hidden for 50 years at the closed government archive in Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire, contain allegations of torture by officers from Special Branch and evidence that British forces killed people in custody then closed ranks to avoid prosecution. The documents also show how the forces, who were fighting Greek nationalists, responded to attacks with reprisals on civilians. After the wife of a British

Their names are Patience and Fortitude — just in case you didn’t already know. Whose names? Why, the lions, of course, the great stone guardians of what is now properly called the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, but is more familiarly known simply as the main branch of the New York Public Library.
Photographed by tourists year in and year out, images of their manes available on tote bags and mugs, their iconic status is testament to the high regard in which New Yorkers hold their library.
The library was founded in 1895 and is the second largest in the United States,

Kids in Dharavi:
When you take out your camera in front of children, they'll stare hard at the lens like this.

Embroidery:
Dharavi’s third largest business is clothing. There are hundreds of shops where people manufacture cloth and coloring. People also do block, wax and screen printing. In this photo, some young men are embroidering cloth. The clothes hanging on the wall belong to the workers and are probably their only clothes. Most of these men live and work in the same place and learn their work by experience. They are very skilled workers. They get paid according to the number of pieces they embroider.

Recycling oil cans:
The oil cans come from all over the city, from restaurants, hotels, private houses and street side stalls. People collect them and sell them to these factories. Here they are cleaned and repaired and the labels are removed. Cooking oil companies then come and buy the cans, refill them and stick their own labels on in order to sell them in the markets.

Goat with people:
These goats are for sacrificing for the festival (Eid). People buy goats a long time before the festival because during the festival they are very expensive.

A man in a factory manufacturing machines that grind up the recycled plastic:
Most of the workers are migrants from north India. Machines made here go all over India and some go overseas.

Cardboard kept for recycling and repairing in the 13th compound:
If the cardboard is in good condition then some goes to manufactures and some to movers and packers. If it is in bad condition they repair it, they also recycle paper.

A young boy grinding plastic:
There are many places like this in the 13th compound, the main recycling area in Dharavi. Working conditions are very poor. The clothes covering his mouth and nose will provide little protection. During the summer, the temperature in these kind of factories go up to 43/44 degrees.
