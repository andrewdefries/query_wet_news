Great Mosque under threat from Church
For hundreds of years, the Great Mosque of Córdoba has been a symbol of religious tolerance and coexistance. Built by the Caliph of Damascus in the 8th century, the inside was transformed into a cathedral in medieval times but its original features remain, making it a monument of magnificence to both the Christian and Muslim faiths. However, its religious unity has been put in danger by moves from the Roman Catholic Church to wrest the Unesco World Heritage Site from public control, provoking fears that its Islamic architecture could be at risk. The Archbishop of Córdo
Muslim schools warned over illegal adverts
Three Muslim state schools have been ordered not to discriminate against potential staff on the basis of gender.
The intervention by the Department for Education came after it was disclosed that Madani Girls’ School in Leicester and Feversham College in Bradford had been running advertisements specifying women teaching staff. Madani Boys’ School in Leicester had similarly requested male staff.
A department spokesman said: “All schools must comply with equality law. We asked Leicester City Council to raise this with the two Madani schools and the adverts have now been withdrawn. We have writte
Pope: better to retire than die on the job
Pope Francis has raised the prospect that he might one day follow his predecessor by retiring and that it could become almost routine for Popes to stand down rather than to die in office.
In a rare interview before the first anniversary of his election next week, Francis discussed the unprecedented presence of two Popes living side by side in the Vatican since Benedict XVI became the first pontiff to retire in 600 years, taking the title “Pope Emeritus”.
“The Pope Emeritus is not a statue in a museum. He’s an institution,” he told the editor of Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper. “W
Baptist church woos converts with free guns
According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus told his disciples that he “came not to bring peace but a sword”. A Baptist church in Kentucky is offering what may be an even more attractive deal to the state’s many hunting enthusiasts and backwoodsmen.
Twenty-five people who attend a steak dinner at the Lone Oak Baptist Church in Paducah today will walk away with a free handgun, shotgun, or long gun.
The service is the latest in a series of so-called Second Amendment Celebrations held in Kentucky over the past year that try to “point people to Christ” and offer the promise of salvation and the pow

The Pentagon has ordered an investigation into the personal conduct of America’s top brass after a series of scandals that has tarnished the military’s image.
Announcing the review of generals and admirals, Leon Panetta, the US Defence Secretary, said that misconduct had “the potential to erode public confidence in our leadership and in our system for the enforcement of our high ethical standards”.
In a memo to General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr Panetta said: “I expect senior officers and civilian executives to exercise sound judgment in their stewardship of government resources and in their
