Bank of Ireland plans to raise €3.4 billion in an attempt to limit the scale of state ownership.
It said yesterday that it would raise up to €1.9 billion (£1.6 billion) in a rights issue and another €500 million in a placing with institutional investors.
Ireland’s biggest bank was one of three to be rescued by its Government two years ago after the collapse of the property market. It intends to raise the remaining €1 billion by converting part of the Government’s preference shares into ordinary stock.
It said that the moves would cap the Government’s shareholding, which stands at

A saleswoman headhunted to work for Louis Vuitton at Selfridges was forced from her job within a week because of sexism and racism, she has claimed.
