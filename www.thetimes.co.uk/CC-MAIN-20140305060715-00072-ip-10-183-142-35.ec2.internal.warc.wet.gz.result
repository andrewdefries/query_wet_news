An Australian fisherman fought for 40 minutes to free himself from the jaws of a 13ft (4m) crocodile after he was attacked while fishing on the banks of a Queensland creek. Todd Bairstow, a miner for Rio Tinto, punched the croc with his fists, poked its eyes and tried to prise its jaws apart after being grabbed by the leg when the reptile lunged out of Trunding Creek outside the Albatross Bay Resort in Weipa. Mr Bairstow, 28, told how the croc kept rolling “around and around’’ in the death roll, breaking both his legs as it tried to drag

Uxbridge (second day of four): Middlesex, with six first-innings wickets in hand, are 309 runs behind Warwickshire
Warwickshire, the champions, found themselves in the relegation zone at the start of this match, but they have every chance of climbing out of it after taking the initiative yesterday. Having made their second-highest total of the season, 486 for six declared, they used the new ball superbly to take four Middlesex wickets in the first five overs, before Adam Voges and John Simpson led a bold counter-attack with an unbroken stand of 149 in 35 overs. Middlesex still need another 160 runs to save the follow-on, although Warwickshire may not want to enforce it on such a dry pitch.
