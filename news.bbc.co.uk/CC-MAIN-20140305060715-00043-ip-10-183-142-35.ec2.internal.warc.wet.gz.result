Smoking linked to clutch of cancers
A cancer warning has been issued on No Smoking Day
Anti-smoking campaigners are urging people to quit the habit by reminding them smoking is linked to 14 different types of cancer, causing about 70,000 deaths every year.
On National No Smoking Day on Wednesday, they are warning it is not just lung cancer which is smoking-related.
It comes as a report reveals thousands of people will either die or suffer a severe disability this year following a stroke linked to smoking.
Research shows smoking accounts for one in seven new cases of cancer and only 5% of patients survive more than five years after diagnosis.
We need to continue to educate smokers on the damage that tobacco smoke inflicts on their bodies in so many ways
Professor David Phillips, cancer expert Other cancers linked to smoking include pancreatic, renal, bladder, mouth, stomach, liver and cervical.
Smoking is also linked to at least eight other serious medical conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, emphysema and cataracts.
It can also lead to reduced fertility and lower infant birth weight.
Tens of thousands of women in the UK are infected every year with the sexually transmitted disease human papillomavirus (HPV) and scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suggests women with HPV who smoke are more likely to develop a precursor of cervical cancer.
Professor David Phillips from the ICR said: "Our message is stark and simple.
"We need to continue to educate smokers on the damage that tobacco smoke inflicts on their bodies in so many ways.
"Some people may not be aware that tobacco smoke which can be inhaled by non-smokers actually contains higher concentrations of identified carcinogens than the smoke inhaled directly by smokers.
"Women should know that research suggests smoking is an even greater health risk for them than it is for male smokers."
Disability
Researchers have identified more than 3,500 different chemicals in the particles of tobacco smoke.
At least 43 of these have been shown to be carcinogens capable of causing cancer.
National No Smoking Day is also being used to highlight the link between smoking and severe disability caused by strokes.
Eoin Redahan, of The Stroke Association said: "Stroke is the largest single cause of death and severe disability in this country.
"Because each stroke is different, recovery from a stroke can vary.
"Most people don't think about the risks of stroke from smoking but it is a big problem.
"This should be a good incentive for people to try to quit smoking."	Women more at risk than men
A survey published to coincide with No Smoking Day revealed that 83% of smokers said they would not smoke if they had their time again.
Clive Bates, Director of campaigning group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said: "When you strip away all the waffle and hype about smoking, most smokers know what they are dealing with and want out.
"Tobacco companies still go on about freedom of choice, but where's the freedom when so many people are miserable, disgusted or fearful about smoking?
"It's an addiction, and people are driven to smoke even if they are sick of it.
"Let's hope No Smoking Day is the day when thousands of smokers do actually exercise their free choice, and toss away the fags for good."
Ban
The British Medical Association urged the government to use No Smoking Day to take action to ban all tobacco advertising.
It said the efforts of health professionals in helping smokers to quit are being undermined by the government's failure to ban advertising for tobacco
products.
Dr Vivienne Nathanson, BMA head of science and ethics, said: "While the tobacco companies are allowed to use advertising to lull smokers into a false sense of security, the best efforts of doctors are being undermined.
"Ultimately, it is smokers who will pay the heaviest price for government inaction."
A new website has been launched to mark National No Smoking Day, www.sickofsmoking.com, is designed to give help and support to people who want to kick the habit.

Campbell clinches US Open glory
Leaderboard
Clubhouse scores
Final round photos
Spain's Sergio Garcia finished as the top European at the US Open at Pinehurst after a level-par 70 took him to a tie for third at five over.
Garcia, 25, finished five shots behind winner Michael Campbell with Sweden's Peter Hedblom a further three strokes behind in a share of 11th.
"I played well," said Garcia. "The pins were tough and I really feel like I shot the highest score I could shoot.
"I was thinking I would have to shoot 65 or 66 and I could have got it too."
Europe is without a US Open champion since England's Tony Jacklin won in 1970 and has not won a major title of any kind since Paul Lawrie at the 1999 Open.
Garcia, who won the Booz Allen Classic on the US Tour the week before the US Open, began the day eight strokes behind overnight leader Retief Goosen and went out in 35 after two birdies and two bogeys.
He dropped another shot at the 15th but hauled it back at the 16th before missing a 12-foot chance on the 17th and a 20-footer at the last for birdie.
Hedblom, 35, slipped to a final-round 75 to undo the good work of his Pinehurst US Open record 66 on day two of his US Open debut.
He only qualified for the year's second major after finishing eagle, birdie, birdie, birdie in the qualifier at Walton Heath, Surrey, earlier this month.
Hedblom was 41st on the European Order of Merit before the event and ranked 193 in the world.

Sweet Samoa hit spot
By Jim Stokes
BBC Sport in Australia
Once again Samoa showed that if they are able to purchase possession, they can be as exciting as any side on the planet.
Okay, it was only against a brave but often limited Uruguay side that their running and handling skills came to the fore.
But give them an inch, and with their pace and power, they can be so devastating.
There was a cool breeze wafting across the Subiaco Stadium in Perth on Wednesday evening, but it was soon warmed up by Brian Lima and his fellow South Sea warriors. Captain Semo Sititi set the tone Although Samoa had a modicum of possession from the tight, they had enough from the loose to kill off Uruguay in a trice as they coasted home 60-13. Unfortunately, they will not be afforded such luxuries as they received from the South Americans when they face England. If you ain't got the ball, you can't play. Uruguay played keep-ball for periods, England can keep it forever. End of story. When England finally face up to Samoa in Melbourne on 26 October, the order of Pool C will be already sorted out. With a large support in the excellent 22,020 crowd behind, Samoa must have frightened the Uruguayans with their pre-match war dance as they stormed into a 29-5 half-time lead. They ran the opposition ragged with five sweet tries in each half, two each from the powerhouse flanker Maurie Fa'asavula and Lima, who was celebrating his fourth World Cup. Report: Samoa 60-13 Uruguay
Uruguay had their moments, and scored their first try of the tournament through their excellent number eight Rodrigo Capo. But when Samoa scored their sixth try after only 45 seconds of the restart, that was that. There was a side show when the very security-conscious stadium staff jumped on a pitch interloper. It took five of them to ground him and another nine to usher him out of the stadium. In the meantime, Samoa struggled in the scrums and obviously missed Wasps hooker Trevor Leota, as the stronger Uruguayans twisted and turned the set-pieces. What would England do? Samoa also found great difficulty in stopping a powerful driving maul. Again, Clive Woodward's steamrollers will be very difficult to stop.
England will win, but Manu Samoa and their colourful fans will entertain even in defeat. E-mail this to a friend
