Somali woman executed by stoning
A woman in Somalia has been stoned to death after an Islamic Sharia law court found her guilty of adultery.
The woman was buried up to her neck and then pelted to death with stones in front of a large crowd in Kismayo.
It was the first such execution in the southern port city since Islamist insurgents captured it from government-allied forces in August.
A local Islamist leader said the woman, Aisho Ibrahim Dhuhulow, had pleaded guilty to committing adultery.
"She was asked several times to review her confession but she stressed that she wanted Sharia law and the deserved punishment to apply," said Sheikh Hayakallah.
A group of men performed the execution in one of the city's main squares in front of thousands of people, AFP news agency said.

Eminem film gets festival debut
Eminem's 8 Mile will get its first UK showing
By Neil Smith 8 Mile, the new film starring US rapper Eminem, is one of dozens of movies that will receive their UK premi�re at the 2002 London Film Festival.
Directed by LA Confidential's Curtis Hanson, 8 Mile is loosely based on Eminem's meteoric rise to hip-hop stardom. Kim Basinger plays his fictional mother.
The two-week event, which runs from 6 to 21 November, is traditionally a highlight of the UK cinema calendar and this year features more than 100 films from more than 48 countries.
Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine will be screened
Dirty Pretty Things, the new film from British director Stephen Frears, opens the London Film Festival on 6 November.
It stars Amelie's Audrey Tautou and is set among London's community of illegal immigrants.
The festival closes on 21 November with another British feature - The Heart Of Me, directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan.
Based on Rosamond Lehmann's novel The Echoing Grove, it stars Olivia Williams and Helena Bonham Carter as two sisters who fall for the same man, played by Paul Bettany.
Galas
Among this year's gala screenings are the film version of Meera Syal's Anita And Me and Shekhar Kapur's The Four Feathers starring Heath Ledger and Kate Hudson.
Roman Polanski's Holocaust drama The Pianist, winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and Peter Mullan's controversial The Magdalene Sisters, which won the Golden Lion at Venice, are also included.
Michael Moore's new documentary Bowling For Columbine and Denzel Washington's directorial debut, Antwone Fisher, are in the Film on the Square section.
Appearing in 3-D: Rita Hayworth
So is Stephen Soderbergh's Full Frontal, an experimental comedy drama starring Julia Roberts, and Punch-Drunk Love, the latest from Boogie Nights and Magnolia director Paul Thomas Anderson.
Notorious
Potential hot potatoes include The Quiet American with Brendan Fraser and Michael Caine. Based on Graham Greene's novel, the film takes a less than flattering view of US foreign policy during the early days of the Vietnam conflict.
Roger Avery's film version of Bret Easton Ellis's novel The Rules of Attraction is certain to make waves. Its poster has already been attacked in the US for showing cuddly toys engaged in sexual congress.
This year's festival will also include include interviews with Hollywood producer Robert Evans, 8 Mile director Curtis Hanson and cultural commentator Michael Moore.
Meanwhile, a rare screening of the 1953 movie Miss Sadie Thompson offers the chance to see screen siren Rita Hayworth in 3-D.

India seals off 'bird flu town'
Sales of chicken have dropped sharply
Officials in India's Maharashtra state have begun sealing off an entire town where bird flu has been discovered.
No-one will be allowed in or out of Navapur, which has a population of nearly 30,000, or 19 nearby villages.
The measures come after reports that blood samples from people in hospital have tested positive for bird flu. Health officials deny the reports.
Hundreds of thousands of birds are being culled after deadly H5N1 bird flu was found in Navapur last week.
QUICK GUIDE
Bird flu
Health Ministry officials say tests on 90 of 95 people for bird flu have proved negative. The other five samples, taken from 12 people who have been quarantined with flu-like symptoms in Maharashtra, are being tested further. Results are expected on Thursday.
"We do not rule out the possibility of humans being affected, and it is a distinct possibility," Health Secretary PK Hota told reporters in Delhi.
'Safe to eat'
Chicken and eggs are off the menu in most parts of India.
The country's poultry industry, one of the world's largest, has already been hit with massive losses.
On Wednesday, the Indian parliament banned poultry products from its cafeterias. Major airlines, the country's railway service and the army have all taken similar steps.
"We are not cooking poultry dishes but have put extra mutton and fish dishes on the menu," a parliamentary chef told the AFP news agency.
But other government officials are reassuring people that chicken and eggs are safe to eat if cooked properly.
Health officials served chicken dishes and ate them in front of the media at a scheduled news briefing on bird flu in the capital, Delhi, on Tuesday.
Slaughter
Teams of health workers have killed hundreds of thousands of birds around the town of Navapur.
Reports say the focus has now shifted to cleaning up the area after the mass slaughter.
But poultry traders and farmers say they are struggling after a sharp drop in sales.
One trader in the city of Mumbai (Bombay) distributed 2,000 chickens for free on Wednesday in an attempt to dispel fear.
Poultry exporters say they have already suffered more than $45m in losses and say exports have been badly hit, particularly to the Middle East.
The H5N1 virus does not pose a large-scale threat to humans, as it cannot pass easily from one person to another.
Experts, however, fear the virus could mutate to gain this ability, and in its new form trigger a flu pandemic, potentially putting millions of human lives at risk.

Scientists create 'perfect' toast
The secret to toast heaven
Food scientists at the UK's University of Leeds have developed a formula for making the perfect piece of toast.
The equation - which details butter and toast temperature - took three months and cost �10,000 to develop.
Researchers' found that people think the perfect piece of toast should have partly melted butter patches on it, improving its taste and texture.
For this to work, the butter should be applied at fridge temperature of five degrees Celsius, the equation shows.
The formula was developed following research commissioned by the butter brand Lurpak made by Leeds-based Arla Foods.
They wanted to know how the properties of melting butter affects the taste of toast.
Spreading the word
The equation relates to the critical amount of butter, applied at fridge temperature (approximately five degrees Celsius or 41F), required to produce this effect.
H represents thickness, Cp the specific heat, P density, T the initial temperature of the toast, w the weight, and subscript a and b toast and butter respectively.
The Leeds University food scientist Professor Bronek Wedzicha translated the equation into practical terms for toast lovers.
The amount of butter should be about one-seventeenth the thickness of the bread
Professor Bronek Wedzicha
"To produce the patches of butter most people said they preferred, the bread needs to be heated to at least 120�C, and the butter should be used straight from the fridge, applied unevenly within two minutes of the bread coming out of the toaster. "The amount of butter should be about one-seventeenth the thickness of the bread," he said.

Historic houses to close
Gosfield Hall, Essex, was built in 1545
Scores of elderly people are to lose their homes and 149 workers are being made redundant because the country houses where they live and work are being sold. The Country Houses' Association (CHA) has announced it is closing down its residential business and selling the eight Grade I and II listed buildings it owns.
Now the 159 elderly residents, some in their 80s and 90s, have been told they have six months to find new homes.
The staff who look after them have been told they will be made redundant when the residents move out.
My mother is 99 this week and this is worst news she could have had for her birthday
Diana Clement, daughter of Lady Benda Milverton
Each of the properties are elegantly furnished, often with antique furniture.
The residents are mainly retired professionals who paid deposits of up to �140,000 to rent the apartments. In a statement the CHA said the historic properties in Berkshire, Devon, Essex, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Sussex and Wiltshire would close by mid 2004 because of a falling demand for the apartments. The statement said: "The decision to close was necessary due to falling demand for the particular serviced apartments offered, the increasing age-profile of the residents, the increasing regulations surrounding business and the significant level of losses that all of this has produced and is forecast to produce in the future."
Houses affected
Albury Park, Surrey
Aynhoe Park, Oxfordshire

Flete, Devon
Gosfield Hall, Essex
Great Maytham Hall, Kent
Pythouse, Wiltshire
Swallowfield Park, Berkshire
The CHA is a friendly society with a charitable status, formed to preserve the country houses in its possession for the benefit of the nation.
They said the trustees could not use charity funds to support loss-making businesses with no future prospects.
Diana Clement, whose mother Lady Benda Milverton has been at Flete House for 24 years, said: "It's a catastrophe.
"My mother is 99 this week and this is worst news she could have had for her birthday.
"These are elderly people who have planned to spend the rest of their days there."
A series of meetings are planned over the next few weeks to keep residents and staff informed about the situation.

Some Wales childcare complaints 'not fully' looked into
The owner of this Swansea nursery said providers should keep on top of the basics
Concerns have been raised after it emerged complaints against childcare providers in parts of south Wales were not fully investigated by a regulator.The Conservatives said the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) was guilty of some "fundamental failures." The CSSIW said immediate action was taken when the issue was identified. The Welsh Assembly Government said it had confidence in its ability to inspect and monitor child care. Some inspectors working in the south west area, which includes Swansea and Bridgend, did not file reports into complaints for at least a one year period, the BBC Politics Show Wales discovered. INSPECTIONS FINDINGS
One north Wales nursery did not meet staff/child ratios
Allegation another north Wales nursery supervisor was rough and bullied toddlers in her care
A Ceredigion child minder found to have three cats and four dogs in kitchen where food was prepared
Nursery in Gwent area told to give staff criminal record checks, a basic requirement
From CSSIW inspection reports, 2008-2009
The failings came to light after a series of Freedom of Information requests from the programme revealed a number of investigation reports were missing. These included one case in which a childminder's husband, who was not a registered child carer, was found to be looking after children. Inspectors are obliged to investigate complaints against childcare providers and make their reports publicly available. Conservative social affairs spokesperson, Andrew RT Davies AM, said he would be calling on the assembly government to intervene. "We must make sure that people have confidence in childcare - that they can put their children in safe custody and ultimately have a safe environment to live and to learn," he said. "Clearly this is failing in this instance and we need action." These reports...indicate a complete breakdown in the ability to enforce sanction on people who have broken various protocols which should be there to safeguard children
Andrew RT Davies AM, Conservative social affairs spokesman
Deputy Social Services Minister Gwenda Thomas AM said CSSIW inspectors work extremely hard to ensure children are protected. "I am confident in CSSIW's abilities in registering, inspecting and monitoring care and social services in Wales and I believe it has the tools required to achieve this," she said. The CSSIW said the matter had now been remedied. The Politics Show Wales also requested copies of all CSSIW investigations into childcare providers for 2008-9 initiated in response to complaints from the public. One nursery in north Wales was found not to be complying with the legal ratios of staff to children. In one room, a member of staff was looking after eight children, including five under three years old. The legal maximum is six children under eight, half of which can be under three. The same nursery also faced a complaint that lunchtime food portions were too small and that there was mould on the ceiling in the baby room. Another nursery, also in north Wales, was asked to retrain staff after allegations a toddler room supervisor bullied, shouted at and was rough with children. The CSSIW also investigated an allegation that a member of staff at a nursery was under the influence of cocaine while looking after children. 'Proportionate'The manager was asked to interview the person in question on her return to work and inform CSSIW of its outcome. The CSSIW said they received a report from the provider detailing the action they had taken to address the issues raised. Mr Davies said the CSSIW's response to the complaints was insufficient. "These reports, and they are widespread reports, indicate a complete breakdown in the ability to enforce sanction on people who have broken various protocols which should be there to safeguard children," he said. "Frankly a lot of the recommendations I see here are self-assessment recommendations." In a statement, the CSSIW defended its enforcement policies. "Where action was required, CSSIW issued compliance notifications requiring prompt action to be taken by the service provider to take remedial actions to ensure improvement," it said. "There have also been two prosecutions brought against childminders as a result of the investigations made by CSSIW staff in 2008 and 2009." However, CSSIW said they intended to change the way it regulates childcare provision in future. "We are working on a review of regulation that will result in more citizen focussed, proportionate, consistent, modern and compliant system," it said. Ms Thomas said care providers, councils and the CSSIW must take appropriate action. "I have been briefed fully by the chief inspector in relation to issues raised about the number of complaints last year and the action taken to investigate them," she said.

Brasil: condones en la escuela
Mensaje para el carnaval 2003: el gobierno quiere llegar a los j�venes.
Brasil lanz� una nueva y pol�mica arma en la lucha contra el SIDA: la distribuci�n de preservativos entre alumnos mayores de 14 a�os en los colegios p�blicos. M�s de 100.000 alumnos tendr�n a partir de este martes acceso gratuito a preservativos. En total, unos 3,4 millones de condones ser�n distribuidos hasta julio del pr�ximo a�o. El sistema de salud p�blica atendi� 210.946 partos y 219.834 abortos de j�venes entre 10 y 19 a�os en el per�odo de 1999 hasta abril de este a�o
Seg�n el Ministerio de Salud, "uno de los motivos que llev� a garantizar el acceso a preservativos a la poblaci�n escolar es el alto n�mero de embarazos en la adolescencia y el aumento del SIDA en el grupo de edad de 13 a 19 a�os".
BBC Mundo habl� con el Dr. Paulo Teixeira, director del programa contra el SIDA de la Organizaci�n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) en Ginebra, y hasta hace poco director del programa nacional contra el SIDA de Brasil.
�C�mo lleg� Brasil a esta decisi�n de dar condones a los adolescentes?
Es una visi�n pragm�tica: los adolescentes tienen una vida sexual bastante activa y lo que debemos hacer es proveer las informaciones y condiciones necesarias para que esa actividad se de en forma protegida para prevenir las enfermedades de transmisi�n sexual y el embarazo no deseado.
Teixeira: visi�n pragm�tica.
El segundo punto es que la concentraci�n de j�venes -su local de aprendizaje- es la escuela. Estamos hablando de un problema que est� relacionado con la salud sexual de estos j�venes.
El mejor lugar para tratar eso es la escuela y as�, con este modo de pensar, llegamos a un acuerdo con las autoridades del sector educaci�n para que las escuelas y la secretar�a de salud se hicieran cargo de las actividades relacionadas con la prevenci�n y concretamente, con la provisi�n de los medios. O sea, adem�s de informaci�n, de servicios, esto incluye la distribuci�n de preservativos.
Este tipo de medidas ha levantado la resistencia, por ejemplo de la Iglesia y parece impensable en otros pa�ses de la regi�n.
�Cu�l ha sido la respuesta en Brasil a las inquietudes de la Iglesia? Es necesario aclarar que la Iglesia, y particularmente la Iglesida Cat�lica en Brasil ha sido un socio muy importante en la lucha contra el SIDA.
A pesar de que hay unas autoridades que a veces se manifiestan de forma m�s conservadora, el conjunto de la Iglesia, particularmente las personas que est�n en contacto con la poblaci�n, han tenido una postura mucho m�s abierta, considerando que antes de todo, es necesario preservar la vida
Paulo Teixeira, director del programa contra el SIDA de la OMS
A pesar de que hay unas autoridades que a veces se manifiestan de forma m�s conservadora, el conjunto de la Iglesia, particularmente las personas que est�n en contacto con la poblaci�n, han tenido una postura mucho m�s abierta, considerando que antes de todo, es necesario preservar la vida, y que las cuestiones relacionadas con la propuesta moral y �tica de la Iglesia van a seguir siendo ofrecidas, pero no pueden significar un riesgo adicional, particularmente para los j�venes.
El gobierno respeta las proposiciones �ticas y morales, pero por otra parte cuenta con la comprensi�n de la Iglesia de que este es un proceso que lleva tiempo y el riesgo que se presenta inmediatamente debe ser evitado, y esto se hace con el cond�n.
Algunos argumentan que al distribuir condones a chicos de 14 a�os se invita a los j�venes a la promiscuidad. Est� probado cient�ficamente que distribuir preservativos y dar informaciones no lleva, no estimula a la actividad sexual
Paulo Teixeira, director del programa contra el SIDA de la OMS
Es necesario tener presente que todas las investigaciones han mostrado lo contrario, que cuando se involucra a los j�venes en un proceso de educaci�n sexual se les provee los medios de hacerlo con tranquilidad, con seguridad, claramente, sin miedo, sin esconderse, la actividad sexual tiende a ser menos frecuente y a ocurrir m�s tard�amente.
Est� probado cient�ficamente que distribuir preservativos y dar informaciones no lleva, no estimula a la actividad sexual. Un trabajo realizado adecuadametne tendr� como resultado no s�lo la prevenci�n de enfermedades sino que en la mayor parte de los casos estimula a los j�venes a postergar el inicio de la relaci�n sexual o hacerla de una forma mucho m�s saludable.
Brasil es un ejemplo para muchos pa�ses en la lucha contra el SIDA.
En 20 a�os redujo a la mitad la previsi�n de 1,2 millones de casos que anticipaba el Banco Mundial. Adem�s, distribuye gratuitamente medicamentos antiretrovirales y, de todos los enfermos que reciben tratamiento en el mundo, un tercio est�n en Brasil. �Cree usted que estos logros son resultado de una visi�n m�s pragm�tica que el resto de la regi�n? A Brasil le preocupa el aumento de SIDA entre j�venes de 13 a 19 a�os.
Son varios puntos. Uno ha sido la intervenci�n temprana. Son 20 a�os desde que Brasil comenz� a trabajar contra el SIDA. En segundo lugar, un enfoque m�s claro y realista ha sido fundamental para los �xitos.
Pero hay otros componentes muy marcados que yo dir�a son los mayores responsables: principalemente el involucramiento y la movilizaci�n de la sociedad, en particular de las ONGs e instituciones que est�n directamente vinculadas con el problema.
Esto hizo que la lucha contra el SIDA se transformara en una causa nacional, para todas las instituciones, la opini�n p�blica, la Iglesia, las escuelas y esto es la gran explicaci�n para lo que se ha logrado.

ICC World Twenty20 day six as it happened
LIVE TEXT COMMENTARY (all times BST)
By Sam Sheringham
SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY 59 RUNS
0110: That's it from me. Thanks for joining me on my live cricket debut and for sharing in the mayhem of that Afghanistan innings. The formidable Mark Mitchener will return tomorrow to steer you through England's first Super Eight contest against Pakistan. That one gets underway at 1430 BST. Goodnight. 0055: Afghanistan will have learnt a lot from their adventure and their bowling display in Barbados hinted at great things to come. The South Africans may be a little concerned by the form of one or two of their star batsmen, but with Steyn and Morkel in that form, noone should write them off for the big prize.0050: That was good fun. A truly awesome bowling display from Steyn and Morkel, followed by some lusty hitting from Ashraf and Hassan to stave off embarrassment.16th over: WICKET Hassan c Kallis b Langeveldt 22, Afghanistan 80 all out, South Africa win by 59 runs
Hassan somehow gets his bat on a bouncer and the ball arrows away for four but moments later it's all over. Another short ball, and this time a top edge flies into the air to be caught by Kallis as he back-peddles from slip. 15th over: Afghan 76-9Van der Merwe drops one short and Hassan is onto it straight away, blasting another six well over the rope at long-on. A single off the last ball means Hassan keeps the strike. 14th over: Afghan 67-9Zadran wafts and almost edges his first ball but Langeveldt has slightly lost his line and drags a couple of wides down the leg side. Zadran blocks a straighter one off the final ball and we're into over 15. 14th over: WICKET Ashraf b Langeveldt 23, Afghan 65-9
Langeveldt spoils the party as Ashraf plays all around a straight one and is bowled middle stump. 13th over: Afghan 64-8Can someone please tell me why this guy is batting at number nine? Ashraf's adrenaline is really pumping now as he bends his knees and hoiks another maximum over long-on. 12th over: Afghan 57-8Ashraf also fancies a piece of Albie Morkel. First he clouts a four through mid-on and then clubs an absolutely huge six over the Garfield Sobers pavilion. The legend himself would have been proud of that one and the crowd are loving this. 11th over: Afghan 44-8I have rediscovered how to breathe after an amazing three-over spell without a wicket. Ashraf and Hassan happy to pick off a couple of singles with van der Merwe posing little threat. 10th over: Afghan 41-8Shot of the day contender from Hamid Hassan. Albie Morkel puts one right in the slot and Hassan lofts it straight over long-off for a sixer. Lovely check finish too. A couple of singles and suddenly life is good again for the Afghans. 9th over: Afghan 33-8An over of spin provides a blessed relief for the Afghan batsmen as Ashraf plays out six balls from van der Merwe, with just a wide to trouble the scorers. 8th over: WICKET Shenwari run out 8, Afghan 32-8
Afghanistan have clearly never faced bowling as fast and hostile as this and it's a bit of a mis-match really. Morkel sympathetically throws down another no-ball but this time Shenwari can't connect with the free hit. A couple of runs and a leg bye and suddenly it's starting to look easy, but disaster strikes as Ashraf dabs down and calls a quick single. De Villiers is sharp and his precise throw flattens the stumps with the diving Shenwari a good couple of yards short. 7th over: WICKET Stanikzai c Steyn b Langeveldt 3, Afghan 25-7
We won't be here much longer. Stanikzai commits to a pull shot, then thinks twice about it but leaves his bat in the air. The ball catches the blade and balloons to Steyn at square leg. 6th over: Afghan 23-6At last there's something to cheer for Afghanistan as a no-ball from Morkel earns them a free-hit. Shenwari rocks back and carves the ball high over long-on for six. I don't think anyone saw that coming! 6th over: WICKET Nabi c Boucher b M Morkel 0, Afghan 14-6
Morkel is straight back in the groove with another brutal delivery which rises and catches Nabi on the glove and is easily caught by Duminy. Ridiculous. 5th over: Afghan 14-5Ah, a bit of calm. No wickets and no runs off the bat but a wide and a leg bye keep the scoreboard ticking over. Ahmadzai is currently the top scorer with four. 4th over: WICKET Ahmadzai c Boucher b M Morkel 4, Afghan 12-5
A slash outside off stump for four provides very brief respite and it's business as usual from the next ball. Ahmadzai gets a massive top edge and Boucher snaffles a good catch on the run. Three wickets in an over for Morkel. 4th over: WICKET Sadiq c de Villiers b M Morkel 2, Afghan 8-4
Dear oh dear. We may not be here much longer. It's shorter and straighter from Morkel and Sadiq gloves it straight into the air, gifting a simple catch to De Villiers. 4th over: WICKET Mangal c Kallis b Morkel 1, Afghan 7-3
Morkel claims a wicket with his very first ball as Mangal can't resist wafting his bat outside the off stump and Kallis claims a regulation catch at first slip. 3rd over: Afghan 7-2Skipper Nowroz Mangal comes to the crease with Afghanistan desperate for a partnership. He gets off the mark with a single down to third man. 3rd over: WICKET Shahzad c Boucher b Steyn 2, Afghan 5-2
Same routine does for Shahzad as a good length delivery bounces and catches the edge, feeding Boucher another straightforward catch. 2nd over: Afghan 5-1Karim Sadiq top-edges a pull but the ball lands safe and he scampers a couple. Great piece of fielding from De Villiers as he prevents a boundary with a diving stop and almost runs the Sadiq out with a fine shy at the stumps. 1st over: Afghan 3-1Shahzad clips one through midwicket for two to get off the mark. The last ball has wicket written all over it as Boucher claims the catch behind but Simon Taufel says not out. Clearly the wrong decision but a good one for the neutral. 1st over: WICKET Noor Ali c Boucher b Steyn 0, Afghan 1-1
Steyn is right on the money from the off with a ball which is quick, straight and tears past the outside edge. The next ball is almost identical and the third swings slightly less, catching the edge and powering into Boucher's gloves. World-class bowling. 2335: So can they do this? It's a tall order but perhaps not quite as tall as we were expecting beforehand. Shahzad and Nabi both have a penchant for big shots, while South Africa have been known to buckle when the pressure is on. Don't go anywhere.2321: Great effort from Afghanistan that. It was looking ominous at 77-2 halfway through, but every bowler played his part and Hamid Hassan was superb. Upset on the cards? We'll be off again in about 10 minutes or so.20th over: South Africa 139-7Steyn drills his first ball to long-off for a single and van der Merwe gets one from the final ball as South Africa finish one short of the 140 mark. 20th over: WICKET Morkel c Mangal b Zadran 23 South Africa 137-7
Roelof van der Merwe gets off the mark from his fifth delivery with a single. Morkel launches himself into the next ball but cracks it straight up in the air and the skipper Mangal claims the catch at the second attempt. 19th over: South Africa 135-6Hassan finishes his superb spell with a dot ball right into the blockhole. He struts off with a richly-deserved 3-21 from his four overs. 19th over: WICKET: Duminy c Mangal b Hassan 25 South Africa 133-6
Duminy smashes a full delivery right out of the middle and the skipper Mangal clings on to a fine catch low down at mid-off. 18th over: South Africa 132-5Duminy finally gets in on the act with a brutal straight six. The last ball of the over also gets the treatment, sailing over long-off's head for another maximum. 17th over: South Africa 116-5Morkel hoists a short ball to the tape and snaffles a single as a straight drive falls just short of long on. The last ball is yorker-length on off-stump but Morkel jabs his ball down and it flies like a rocket to the rope. 16th over: South Africa 106-5Nabi back into the attack as the batsmen continue to work the singles. Morkel mis-hits a full toss back to the bowler and looks annoyed with himself, but he makes amends as the next ball is pummelled into oblivion. 15th over: South Africa 96-5Seriously impressive bowling from Afghanistan. Quick and hostile from Hassan as Duminy fends one off his body to pick up three. Three more singles complete the over. 15th over: WICKET Boucher lbw b Hassan 4, SA 90-5
Boucher beaten for pace by a full-length skidder which traps him right in front. 14th over: South Africa 90-4Intriguing game this. Bowlers on top for a good six overs now. Only three runs from that one as Duminy and Boucher look to play themselves in against some more neat and tidy spin from Mangal. 13th over: South Africa 87-4Enter Boucher with a punch to mid-off for one. But Hassan has his man cramped with a couple of tasty yorkers that almost find their way through. 13th over: WICKET Kallis c Shahzad b Hassan 34
That thing I just said about Kallis being there until the end, please disregard it. The batsman flicks at one down the leg side and it's well-taken by Shahzad. Game on. 12th over: South Africa 84-3Kallis squirts one through the infield for a couple as Mangal is a little slow getting to the ground. You can tell the big man wants to see this one through right to the end. 12th over: South Africa 84-3Kallis squirts one through the infield for a couple as Mangal is a little slow getting to the ground. You can tell the big man wants to see this one through right to the end. 11th over: South Africa 79-3Kallis and Duminy each scamper a single but it's another fine over from Mangal. 11th over: WICKET De Villiers st Shahzad b Mangal 17 South Africa 77-3
De Villiers is dropped by the wicketkeeper off the first ball before slamming a four through the leg side. Next ball he goes for another big one and is easily stumped by the keeper. 10th over: South Africa 73-2More good turn from Shenwari in another economical over, which yields just two runs. He's making Kallis look ordinary, which takes some doing. 9th over: South Africa 71-2Skipper Nowroz Mangal throws down a wide first up down the leg side, before De Villiers explodes into action with a huge maximum which almost lands in the press box. Told you he would let fly. 8th over: South Africa 59-2Shenwari beats Kallis all ends up with a big leg-breaker. Five singles are taken in another tight over - great work from the two tweakers. A dozen dot balls in four overs between them. 7th over: South Africa 54-2Kallis dabbles a couple down to third man and gets another run with the same shot. De Villiers still to let fly but it will happen. 6th over: South Africa 49-2De Villiers takes a single of the first ball but it's all a bit slower now as South Africa get used to the turning ball. Only two from the over - good work from the Afghans. 5th over: South Africa 47-2A single apiece for Kallis and new batsman AB de Villiers see out the over but spin has done the trick. 4th over: WICKET Smith c Mangal b Nabi 27 South Africa 45-2
Spinner Mohammad Nabi comes into the act and strikes with his second ball as Smith mis-times an on-drive and lofts a simple one straight to mid-on.4th over: South Africa 45-1Ashraf finds a good length to draw an edge from Smith but the ball runs safe. Kallis charges down the track and heaves one over square leg as if he were swatting a fly. The next ball is dispatched straight over the bowler's head into the stands. Fierce. 3rd over: South Africa 31-1A rising snorter from the seriously quick Zadran has Kallis flailing. Smith gets a thick edge on a wide one and get four before slashing at the last ball of the over and getting lucky as the ball flies over his head for six.2nd over: South Africa 17-1Kallis and Smith paddle a couple of singles before a misfield gifts them two off the last ball of the over.2nd over: WICKET Bosman run out 0 South Africa 13-1
A delivery down the leg side brushes Bosman's pads and the batsmen push for two. But a sharp throw from fine leg leaves Bosman a yard short.1st over: South Africa 12-0Absolute pearler first up from Zadran has Smith groping at thin air but the skipper smacks the next couple to the boundary. Zadran recovers well with two dots before Smith leans into a cover drive and finds the rope once again. Ominous.2159: So, Smith and Bosman up first for the Proteas. Shapoor Zadran has the new ball in his hands.2155: About five minutes to go until the start of play in the final qualifying game before the Super Eights start tomorrow. I'm going to stick my neck out and say an Afghanistan victory would be the biggest shock in cricket history. Anyone care to disagree? Let me know via email or text - details above.2149: TEAM NEWS: South Africa call up swing king Charl Langevelt in place of Rory Kleinveldt. The Afghans make one change, bringing in Mirwais Ashraf for fellow seamer Dawlat Ahmadzai. 2145: Both sides lost to India in their opening game. By the way, please manually refresh to acquire a link to the scorecard above as we're having some technical problems with the usual one on the right. About 15 mins til we're underway. 2141: It's a winner-takes-all scenario with the victor progressing to the Super Eights. Could be fireworks later on when Dale Steyn bowls under the lights at the Kensington Oval.2138: So it's the mighty South Africa against plucky Afghanistan, who in case you need reminding were playing in Division Five of the World Cricket League only two years ago.2134: Afghanistan have won the toss and will bowl first. Graeme Smith says he would have batted so everyone's happy.2123: Please refresh to see a) the new scorecard top right and b) proof that the name of the writer has changed.
By Tom Fordyce
2123: Apologies for the delay in updates - have been off for a quick bite to eat. Will pick things up again once we have word of the toss in the second match between South Africa and Afghanistan. Sam Sheringham will be your host.2053: So Australia and Pakistan are the two teams to go through from Group A; Bangladesh go home. Easy in the end, although those early Aussie wickets threatened so much. England to play Pakistan on Thursday at 1430.19th over: WICKET Mortaza b Harris 6, Bangla 114 all out - AUSTRALIA WIN BY 27 RUNSHarris for the penultimate. Single driven down the ground; mis-field brings two more off the next. Fielding's been very good all innings, to be fair. Full, straight - Mortaza plays all round it, and it's all over.18th over: Bangla 110-932 runs needed off 11 balls if Bangladesh are to progress. Dot ball at the start from Tait - that makes it harder. As does the next ball, another speared-in dotter. And repeat. And repeat. And again - five balls, not a single run. Make that a maiden.17th over: WICKET Jahurul Islam c Clarke b Nannes 18, Bangla 106-9
Nannes returns - crash! Jahurul Islam batters him through the covers for a resilient four. The bearded one-time Dutchman grins and sends down a shorter one - skied, pouched at mid-off. 16th over: WICKET Shafiul Islam b Smith 16, Bangla 100-8
Smith gets another go, and Shafiul greets him with a mighty mow over wide long-off for the 100th six of the tourney. But he's got him now, an inside edge as he charges down the track, the off-stump left leaning.15th over: Bangla 92-7Harris to Shafiul Islam, and that's a super shot - authentic lusty drive between mid-off and extra cover for a eye-pleasing four. Dinker over the in-field for two more.14th over: Bangla 83-7Nearly another for Hussey D, diving to his right and getting fingers to the drive. 59 needed to win off 36 balls, 29 to go through.14th over: WICKET Rahim c M Hussey b D Hussey 24, Bangla 81-7
Slow from one Hussey, big slog, fast to the other Hussey for a steepler just in front of the rope at deep square leg. Decent knock, but that's your lot.13th over: Bangla 81-6Smith follows that catch up with some gentle spin - new-man Jahurul Islam drives into the covers for two, takes a deep breath and cross-bats a shorter one over long-on for the 99th six of the tournament so far. Woeful wide up next, followed by a flat faster one flayed square for two more.12th over: WICKET Naeem Islam c Smith b D Hussey 7, Bangla 70-6
David Hussey thrown the ball now, and that's slow and loopy - battered over the midwicket fence by Naeem Islam. He's gone now, though, aiming another to the same direction and coming up short to give Steven Smith a simple pouch. 11th over: WICKET Al Hasan c M Hussey b Smith 28, Bangla 63-5
Oh, what a snag that is - the batsman heaved out to the deep midwicket fence, and Huss M backpedals at pace before diving up and across to hold on with both hands. And that's why they call him Mr Cricket.10th over: Bangla 61-4Ryan Harris for his second over - nothing frightening from the big man, who's got a chest on him like a seaman's trunk. Crash - Rahim creams a full one straight back down the ground for a startling six. There's a short wide one up next, and that's jabbed delightfully over the stretching fingertips of gully for four more. 81 needed to win the match off 60 balls; 53 to go through to the Super Eights.9th over: Bangla 50-4Steven Smith for his first trundley tweak of the day. He almost bags his first scalp with the wrong 'un, but Al Hasan drags him away leg-side for a brace of twos. 8th over: Bangla 43-4More sensible this from the Bangla pair, taking the singles where they can rather than looking to smash everything out of the park. News from England's opening match of the women's tournament in St Kitts. England, the defending champions, all out for 104 against their big rivals, Australia. Sarah Taylor led the scoring with 46 from 45 balls but Charlotte Edwards's team lost their last four wickets without scoring a run. Advantage Australia... 7th over: Bangla 40-4Skipper Clarke brings himself on for some cheeky tweak. Single down the ground, cunning two dabbed into a glaring gap on the leg-side. Oh, shot of the innings from Shakib Al Hasan - short-arm crackeroo over the midwicket fence for the first six of the reply. He looks to go again next ball, but David Warner dives on the ropes to make a super save. 102 needed from 76 balls to win, from 69 balls to go through at Pakistan's expense.6th over: Bangla 27-4Nannes to continue with his left-arm over, and that's smart line - angled across, no width to go flaying after. Only two rapid singles, and this game is falling as flat as a mis-tossed pancake.5th over: Bangla 25-4Classic Taito this - eye-watering pace, head-shaking width. Wide, single, wide, single. Two slips in, and they're left with hands on hip as a thick outside edge from Mushfiqur Rahim flies straight over their heads.4th over: WICKET Mahmudullah c M Hussey b Nannes 2, Bangla 15-4
Too much bounce, not enough composure - weird wristy flick straight into the air, identical take. Pack up your picnic basket - we're going home.4th over: WICKET Aftab Ahmed c Warner b Nannes 1, Bangla 13-3
Dear oh dear - the sort of slog to make a purist choke on his chicken and rice. Top edge, right into the pouch of gully. As you were, upset-fans.3rd over: Bangla 13-2Slinger Tait continues, and that's the man all over - wide speared outside off, another rattling down leg. Shakib Al Hasan clunks two through midwicket and then almost dislocates his shoulder with an almighty heave that gets nowhere near connecting. Dabber from Aftab off the pads for one.2nd over: Bangla 7-2Singles off the remainder, but the wind's gone out of the Tigers' sails. A big ask just got bigger.2nd over: WICKET Ashraful c Tait b Nannes 0, Bangla 4-2
Dirk Nannes now, and he's not short of pace - left-arm over, angled up and over - straight down the throat of the diving Tait at third man. Calamitous start.1st over: WICKET Kayes c D Hussey b Tait 0, Bangla 4-1
Imrul Kayes to face Shaun Tai... ooof, that's an absolute brute, rattling past the batsman's snout at a fearsome pace. Thick edge off the hips for four leg byes past the diving gloves of Haddin - but he's gone next ball, fooled completely by a slower one and lofting straight to mid-on.1932: Right. Get this: if Bangladesh are going to go through, they need to knock these runs off in less than 19 overs. If they do it in 14.4 overs or less, Australia go out; if they do it in between 14.5 and 18.5, Pakistan go out. All clear?AUSTRALIA INNINGS20th over: Aus 141-7Harris in for one ball - two, sprinted and taken by a fraction. Fine recovery, led by Hussey M's 47 off 29. Game very much on...20th over: WICKET Smith run out 27, Aus 140-7
Now then - last set of six... wide, dunked off the toe-end for a single. Smith scuffs another down the ground and Hussey repeats as Shafiul Islam keeps it steady Eddie Hemmings. Full, tight, just one more off the fourth. Panicky sprinted two off the penultimate, and then - wide called, but Smith is run out as he dashes through for a frantic pointless bonus.19th over: Aus 132-6Smith in the groove now, marmalising Razzak over deep midwicket for six - single, single, and then a mighty repeater to the same spot. Brutal short-arm stuff, and it's a target again.From William, Chatteris, in the TMS inbox: "Alright Tom? Seems like it's all gone quiet on the correspondence front, but I have two things to type: a) most of us were laughing at whoever decided to seed Australia only 8th for this tournament, but so far they're living up to their billing with aplomb. b) where else apart from on commentary can you hear the word 'aplomb' being used?" 18th over: Aus 118-6The bowling's suddenly looking ragged under the Hussonslaught - full toss again, reverse-pulled for four more. Single to leg, and now Smith has a slap - lofted with quick feet over extra cover for another four. Singles scampered as the partnership rattles past 50, and the Aussies are right back in this. 17th over: Aus 106-6Mortaza now - ach, full bunger on leg stump, and Hussey will time that with wristy ruthlessness over the midwicket fence for the sweetest of sixes. Another in the same slot a few balls later, and he'll take four off that. Sloppy. Oh, lovely shot - late wristy cut off the front foot for four more - add in the singles, and that's 17 off the over.16th over: Aus 89-6Classy drive from Hussey M for two, but he misses out next ball as a sweet tempting length leaves him wafting at warm Caribbean air. Two more authentic off-drives, but both find diligent fielders. Heave-ho from Smith off a slower one - two more, but the damage is far from fatal.15th over: Aus 82-6There's the boundary, at long last - touch short, and Hussey M steps back to pull with flashing wrists behind square. Smith not hitting his straps or anything else so far though, and the brakes remain on. Five overs on the clock - what's left to happen?14th over: Aus 74-6Only been four boundaries in the innings so far, and none at all in the last 10 overs. Remarkable, as Sir Richie of B would say. Hussey M playing authentic shots, driving into the covers, but it's still only singles and twos. 13th over: WICKET White b Al Hasan 8, Aus 65-6
Now then - what can White do - nothing from back in the pavilion, that's what. Splendid flight, and he's done him like a ripe kipper. You don't think...12th over: Aus 64-5Ashraful to continue, with Hussey M the new man at the crease. Singles stroked away, and there's plenty of time for this pair to see themselves in - no need to go slap-happy just yet. 11th over: WICKET D Hussey c Rahim b Mortaza 9, Aus 57-5
Whisper it quietly, but Australia look rattled out there - Hussey called through by White for a desperate single. Next ball - horrible swipe - ball spiralling high, high, high - bagged! 10th over: Aus 54-4Horrible shot from Clarke. Here comes new-man Cameron White, but it's Hussey D on strike after the batsmen crossed. Hold on - it's like déjà-vu - same slog down the ground, same man under it... he's dropped it! Right down his throat, and he juggled it onto the turf...10th over: WICKET Clarke c Jahurul Islam b Mohammad Ashraful 16, Aus 52-4
Tempting loop - Clarke's nowhere near the pitch - holed out at long-off!9th over: Aus 49-3Shakib Al Hasan to continue the off-break onslaught -milked down the ground by Clarke for a two and single, before Hussey D gets a loopy outside edge just shy of a deep gully. 8th over: Aus 45-3Mohammad Ashraful now, and he's causing all sorts of issues too - zippy tweak, and only a mis-field at midwicket for two allows the scoreboard to tick over. Run-rate less than six an over, and Bangladesh will be all over that.7th over: Aus 39-3Excited chatter in the crowd - they sense something might be on here. David Hussey comes in, but there's only singles on offer. Aussie in need of a decent partnership, and that deep, deep batting might be called on to make it happen.7th over: WICKET Haddin c Shafiul b Razzak 6, Aus 37-3
Ugly swipe from Stumper Haddin - skied, this must be out - it is!6th over: Aus 35-2Two singles and a leg bye off the first three balls as Shafiul keeps it tight like Clyde Stubblefield. Lord alive - Aftab has a glorious chance to run out Clarke, but his double-hand underarm throw misses by about three sets of stumps. Golden opportunity.5th over: Aus 30-2We'll have some more tweak, this time from Abdur Razzak - there's something in this track for the spinners too, and Clarke and new-man Haddin can only scamper a trio of singles. Intriguing start.4th over: Aus 27-2Al Hasan looks to have Clarke foxed with his twirl, tucking him up with lovely flight - only for the one-time Pup to skip down the track to the final ball and loft with easy elegance high over the ropes.4th over: WICKET Warner c Aftab Ahmed b Al Hasan 16, Aus 21-2
Horrible slog from Leftie - bagged by that man AA again, strolling in off the square leg boundary. Bangladesh will be delighted with this...3rd over: Aus 21-1The batsmen crossed, and Warner leans back to slap a brutal square cut in front of square for four. Single to mid-off brings Skipper Clarke on strike, and a little extra bounce surprises him.3rd over: WICKET Watson c Aftab Ahmed b Mortaza 4, Aus 16-1
Short, top-edged hook - pouched, with a tumble, at deep square leg.2nd over: Aus 16-0Shafiul Islam from the other end - Watson aims a hefty hoick but clunks a bunt straight to short midwicket. That's a wide next up, says umpire Billy Doctrove, and Watson then looks to go aerial over mid-on - two, nowhere near the middle. Dasher of a single, and that gets Warner on strike for a mighty mow over long-off for the first six of the day. Kaboom - flatter this time, over mid-on instead, and that's four more. Blue touch paper lit.1st over: Aus 2-0Leftie Warner blinks down the track - cheeky lifter first up, jabbed down into the ground, and some bend on the second for another dot. That's too strayful - single timed off the pads to deep square leg - but there's pace and lift in the track at this early stage, and Shane Watson almost flicks a nick behind. Single angled off the back foot, and a dot follows to conclude a spicy opening over.1756: Sunny up top, a touch of bluster in the breeze. Watson and Warner to open for the Aussies, and Mortaza to take the new pearl.1749: Jahurul Islam and Aftab Ahmed in for Bangladesh, Ryan Harris for Australia. 11 minutes til we're off. Hold onto them there horses.1746: Team news: Mitchell Johnson out for the Aussies, Tamim Iqbal and Suhrawadi Shuvo missing for Bangladesh. Big blow for the underdogs, that loss of Iqbal...1740: State of play: if Australia win, they're through. If Bangladesh win, it comes down to run-rates. Massively complicated run-rates.1735: News from the toss: Michael Clarke has won it and opted to bat. Fever pitch.1730: Don't tell me you're not excited - Bangladesh v Australia, in the tournament that's gripping the sporting world, for a place in the Super Eights?

Gordon is a Nascar and Indy Racing star in the USA
Robby Gordon won the first stage of the Dakar Rally, a 6km super special, on the Castelldefels beach near Barcelona.
The first win by an American in the car category, the Volkswagen driver clocked four minutes 20.2 seconds to beat Japan's Hiroshi Masuoka by 2.7secs.
Britain's Colin McRae, driving a Nissan in his second Dakar Rally, was eighth.
David Fretigne, on a Yamaha, won the motorbike race, clocking 4min 11.6sec to edge out KTM rider and fellow Frenchman Cyril Despres by 8.1sec.
"It wasnt easy because the sand was really soft after the jumps," said Gordon, a former Nascar and Champ Car driver in the United States driving in his first Dakar Rally.
McRae and co-driver Tina Thorner in their Nissan "I was really excited at the start especially with such a crowd. I feel lucky to be here."
The first woman to cross the line was Jutta Kleinschmidt of Germany, sixth in her Volkswagen, with former rally driver Ari Vatanen seventh and last year's winner Stephane Peterhansel in ninth.
Following this special stage, the competitors must complete a 17km untimed section back to Barcelona from where they will start Saturday's 920km, second stage to Granada in the south. In total, 686 vehicles, with 463 racing and 223 support vehicles, are officially taking part in this 27th edition of the rally.
There are 164 cars, 230 motorbikes, including six quads and a side-car, and 69 lorries competing.
