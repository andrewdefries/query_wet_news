Zimbabwe votes: Midlands
By Zerubabel Mudzingwa
13oo GMT, 13 March, Gweru
President Robert Mugabe has won convincing majorities in 11 of the province's 16 constituencies, according to official results.
The remaining five constituencies - all urban areas - were carried by Mr Mugabe's rival, Morgan Tsvangirai.
Regional result:Mugabe - 258,780Tsvangirai - 151,355Main towns: Gweru, Kwekwe
Many heavy industries based here
11/16 MPs from Zanu-PF,
Ethnicity: Shona, Ndebele
Registered voters: 724,659
More background Supporters of Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change view the official results with suspicion, and say privately that the election was rigged.
But there is no public show of discontent, following Tuesday's large deployment of police across the province.
As I a drove through Chegutu and Kadoma, I witnessed wild celebrations by Zanu-PF youths.
12 March
Thousands of heavily-armed police officers and soldiers have been deployed in cities, villages and at strategic installations in the Midlands province as the government anticipates an outbreak of political violence when the election results are announced.
This is expected to be either later on Tuesday or Wednesday. High-density suburbs in Gweru, Redcliff and Kwekwe have been sealed off and soldiers have imposed a curfew which started at 1800 local time (1600 GMT).
Residents have been warned against venturing outside during the night or moving in large groups.
The results of the poll are expected to be announced later today as polling officers started counting shortly after 1300.
Polling officers have been busy all morning with the verification of the ballot material.
Meanwhile, police in Mvuma arrested 60 MDC polling agents early this morning following an outbreak of violence in the small mining town, 80 kilometres north-east of Gweru.
They were later released without being charged.
MDC district chairman for Mvuma, Michael Dzingisa, described the arrests as Zanu-PF's last attempt to stifle opposition politics ahead of the announcement of the results of the weekend poll.
11 March
A tense atmosphere prevails across the Midlands province today, following the vote and opposition allegations that the authorities are trying to rig the elections.
The police are out in force, especially near polling stations and there has been one outbreak of violence.
There are no demands that voting be extended for a third day, as in Harare, as almost everyone who wanted to, managed to vote over the weekend.
Most shops, banks and business are open as usual but schools remain closed until Wednesday.
Ballot boxes were taken from polling stations at around 1430 local time (1230 GMT) and transported to the provincial command centre, where counting is expected to start tomorrow at 0700.
Gweru's high density suburb of Mkoba saw clashes this afternoon between MDC and Zanu-PF youths.
A group of ruling party militants began marching through the streets. When they threatened to attack a house belonging to an MDC activist, violence broke out, leaving 9 people in hospital with serious injuries - 7 from Zanu-PF and 2 from the MDC.
Riot police intervened and arrested 7 Zanu-PF youths.
In Mberengwa, only the speedy action of the riot police prevented more fighting at the notorious Mataga growth point.
10 March
As on Saturday, voting has been very quiet, especially in the rural areas. There were very short queues at polling stations, most of which had closed by midday.
There are 724,000 registered voters in Midlands province, and only 240,000 were reported to have voted by midday (1000GMT) on Sunday. Most people were just going about their ordinary business, and you would not have thought there was any election going on.
Sunday was very hot in all parts of the province, unlike Saturday, when the weather was very cold and cloudy. In urban areas, there were many more people going to vote and queuing outside polling stations, especially in Gweru. Some polling stations had remained open late into Saturday evening. I received a report that the Zanu-PF MP for Shurugwi, Francis Nhema, went to a mobile polling station around noon on Saturday.
He took six ballot books away and no one knows exactly where he took them.
What was surprising is that he was not even a member of the Electoral Supervisory Commission, or the election directorate. This issue has been raised by the MDC in Midlands province, but so far there has been no response from the election directorate. 1600 9 March, Gweru
Voting is much slower in rural areas of the Midlands, than in urban centres.
Some polling stations I visited in rural Mberengwa and Shurugwi were empty by 1400 local time (1200 GMT), with just 2-300 people having cast their ballots.
In sharp contrast, polling stations in urban Zvishavane, Gweru, Kwekwe and Redcliff have long queues outside - some up to 2km.
The actual process of voting is very slow, as all voters are being asked to show their identity cards and their names are checked off against the list of registered voters.
In most of the urban polling stations I visited, an average of around 700 people had voted by 1400.
Some prospective voters were turned away because they did not have the correct identity documents but they were not very many.
Despite the queues, the atmosphere was generally peaceful and calm, helped by the wet, cloudy weather.
However, MDC officials say that one of their polling agents in Gokwe was kidnapped this morning by men driving a white land rover.
There were representatives of both main parties in every polling station I visited but I did not see many observers.
By 1700, I had only encountered two international observers and not a single representative of Zimbabwean non-governmental organisations who had requested to be allowed to observe the vote.
However civil servants monitoring the poll were out in force.
0430 9 March
Two groups of MDC polling agents were attacked last night, as they travelled to their respective polling stations.
In Kwekwe, suspected Zanu-PF activists threw stones at a car belonging to local MDC MP, Abednigo Malinga. The occupants were forced to flee and the car was set ablaze. In Lower Gweru, a truck belonging to another MDC MP, Renson Gasela was attacked, again by suspected Zanu-PF activists.
Because of these attacks, several MDC polling agents were late taking up their positions at their polling stations but they did manage to arrive before voting started this morning.
8 March
The political atmosphere remained generally calm today throughout the Midlands province ahead of the weekend's vote.
There were, however, isolated cases of violence and intimidation in Gweru, Kadoma and Lalapansi on Thursday night and this afternoon.
I would rather spend the whole day waiting in the queue and restock my supplies so that I devote the next two days to polling
Margaret Mapfumo In Lalapansi, a mob of about 150 Zanu-PF youths pulled down campaign posters for the MDC candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai and threatened to attack a hotel owned by MDC activist Patrick Kombayi.
The group only dispersed after being repelled by MDC youths in the small-mining town.
In a separate incident this afternoon, another group of suspected Zanu-PF supporters were repelled by MDC activists in Gweru after they threatened to attack a house belonging to MDC national executive member, Stella Matibenga.
Long and winding queues have started forming at major supermarkets in Gweru as residents sought to augment their supplies of maize-meal, sugar and bread ahead of the weekend poll.
Maize-meal is the staple food of the country. A failure of this year's crop due to the shortage of rain and the loss of production on commercial farms due to the land invasions has left most staples in short supply. "I would rather spend the whole day waiting in the queue and restock my supplies so that I devote the next two days to polling," said 54-year-old Margaret Mapfumo.

Background
Thousands of villagers in the Midlands province are on the verge of starvation as their food stocks have long dried up, while government officials have shifted their focus towards the presidential election campaign. Although both Zanu-PF and MDC presidential candidates, Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, have used campaign rallies to pledge drought relief, villagers cannot wait until after the election. Tsvangirai promises to distribute food as soon as possible if he wins
Mr Mugabe said his government would ensure that no-one starved to death while Mr Tsvangirai said his government would distribute food soon after being voted into power next month. About 700,000 villagers had registered for food aid three months ago, but the figure is likely to rise sharply because most crops this year have been rendered a write-off due to the scorching sun. The government recently passed legislation barring political parties and non-governmental organisations from distributing maize-meal in their individual capacities. The state-owned Grain Marketing Board, the country's sole buyer and distributor of maize, now relies on maize imports from South Africa after its stocks were exhausted late last year. Maize-meal is the main staple food in Zimbabwe. The most affected areas are Gokwe, Mberengwa, Zvishavane, Chiwundura and Kwekwe where some families have reportedly gone for days on end without food. Some families have resorted to eating wild fruits and berries. In urban centres, long and winding queues for scarce maize-meal have become the order of the day as poverty has reached alarming levels.

UK slump 'is worst for 28 years'
The downturn has hit a number of retailers
The UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the last three months of 2008, its worst performance in 28 years, a think tank has concluded.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) also warned the economic downturn was worsening.
Its estimation comes two weeks ahead of the release of official statistics that will show if the UK is in recession.
The think tank also said the government's estimates for growth this year and next were too optimistic.
Official data showed the economy shrank 0.6% between July and September.
The UK will formally be in recession if the figures released by the Office of National Statistics show this contraction continuing in the fourth quarter.
Increased unemployment
(The chancellor's) forecast of a return to a reasonable rate of growth in 2010 looks too optimistic
NIESR economist Simon Kirby
The NIESR said: "Since 1955, when quarterly figures were first produced, there have been only five quarters in which output has fallen more sharply, with the lowest figure of -2.6% in 1958."
The think tank said its track record in producing early estimates of UK gross domestic product suggested its figure for October to December would only be between 0.1 and 0.2% different to the first official estimate.
It said bank lending - or the lack of it - lies at the heart of the current malaise and the government may have to consider other ways of getting money to consumers and companies.
NIESR economist Simon Kirby said the chancellor's prediction that the economy would shrink by 1% this year was "overly optimistic" and normal growth was unlikely even by 2010.
"I think it's certainly the case that the chancellor's forecast published in November are not consistent with the numbers we have released," he said.
"Certainly his forecast for 2009 does look overly optimistic. In actual fact his forecast of a return to a reasonable rate of growth in 2010 also looks too optimistic."
There are growing signs on the High Street that the economic downturn is worsening.
While shops such as Woolworths, Zavvi, Whittards, Viyella, and The Officers Club have gone into administration, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday that UK manufacturing output was falling at its fastest pace since 1981.
Meanwhile, the number of people out of work in the UK rose by 137,000 to 1.86 million in the three months to October - the highest level since 1997.
However, at the same time, supermarket chains Waitrose and Sainsbury's have both said they have just seen their busiest Christmas trading periods.

Karadzic wife denies helping husband
By Nick Hawton
BBC, Pale
The wife of Europe's most wanted man does not give many interviews. But the welcome was warm as I climbed the stairs of her four-storey house. Zelen-Karadzic says her husband can cope with being on the run
Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic is not a tall lady but her handshake is firm and you sense a steely determination in her voice.
The interview took place in a big, pink house in Pale, a mountain town just a few kilometres from capital Sarajevo.
This is now home for the wife of the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.
Charged with genocide by the UN War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, he has been on the run for the past eight years.
"I would love to know where Radovan is," says Mrs Zelen-Karadzic, presenting me with a slice of home-made cake.
Clearly... we would do everything to protect him. But we are not in a position to give him any protection
Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic
"I really don't know because in that way he and his guards, and we - his family - are protected. "It is better that we do not know." Wearing a black dress and bright red jacket, she sits at the lounge table and reaches for a cigarette.
"The last time I saw him was almost four years ago," she says.
"It was a short meeting. And since then we haven't seen each other at all."
Nato peacekeepers in Bosnia have made several attempts to arrest her husband. Each one has failed.
Suing Nato
In January, the biggest operation for 18 months was carried out in Pale and the big pink house was one of the targets. "When you have 40 completely unknown soldiers and civilians coming into the house at the same time, taking and searching through your intimate things, your private correspondence, your private documents, then of course it is not pleasant but we try not to let it dictate our lives," says Mrs Zelen-Karadzic. Karadzic has last seen family four years ago, according to his wife
The family is suing Nato for the alleged $15,000 of damage caused during the operation.
Ljiljana Zelen-Karadic, 58, is - like her husband - a psychiatrist and runs a small clinic in the town. She is helped by her daughter, Sonja, who ran her father's press centre during the war. These days Sonja practises Chinese medicine. Both have been accused of protecting their husband and father and have recently had their bank accounts frozen and been banned from travelling to the United States and the European Union. "Clearly, as members of the family, we would do everything to protect him," says Mrs Zelen-Karadzic.
"But we are not in a position to give him any protection. We didn't have any special accounts. The Karadzic home was target of a Nato operation in January
"They haven't disrupted the work that we do at the clinic. But there was no reason to deny us visas for travelling. "But we are reconciled with that."
The family insists they have been betrayed by the West. They say the US envoy Richard Holbrooke made an agreement with Radovan Karadzic in 1996 allowing Mr Karadzic to remain free if withdrew from public life and resigned from his political positions. Richard Holbrooke has denied any such deal.
But Mrs Zelen-Karadzic insists her husband can cope with being on the run.
"He has always been an optimist. A cheerful person," she says.
"He is a psychiatrist by profession and that means when he is in a crisis he knows how to help himself." E-mail this to a friend

Scientists predict acceptance of mental illness
Mentally ill people face much discrimination
Genetic advances will reduce the stigma of mental illness, predict scientists.
They say the more the public understands about the science of specific mental health problems, the more they will accept those affected.
Although experts say as many as one in four people are affected by mental illness, many face discrimination, isolation and even attacks from members of the public.
They say the media spotlight on community care killings has contributed to general fear of the mentally ill.
Research shows that they have the highest unemployment rates of any disabled group.
Unemployment rates for the disabled generally are 21%, compared with 37% for the mentally ill.
Alzheimer's disease
Writing in the British Medical Journal, Peter McGuffin, from the Institute of Psychiatry, and Neilson Martin, from the University of Wales College of Medicine, say they believe medical advances will help to put better treatments on the market and will make discrimination a thing of the past.
They cite the example of Alzheimer's disease where they say medical advances have led to greater public acceptance of the disorder.
Although they acknowledge that mental illness is not only affected by genetics but also by environmental factors, they say scientific advances such as DNA testing may be able to help predict how a person will respond to a particular treatment.
For example, it may show whether they are likely to develop certain side effects.
They say research on identical twins and people who have been adopted will help enable scientists to work out which traits are due to shared genes and which are due to shared environment or a combination of both.
Research already conducted suggests responses to certain antipsychotic drugs may be influenced by genes, they say.
However, they admit that the genetic basis of many common mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, may be too complex for a general predictor test to be developed.
However, they say children who have a schizophrenic parent have been shown to be 10 times more at risk of developing the condition themselves than a member of the general public.
Those who have a schizophrenic sibling are 16 times more at risk. If both parents have schizophrenia the risk increases to 40 times the average.
Risk factors
The scientists believe that, as genetic testing becomes more accurate, it will be possible to screen families where there is a higher than average risk.
"This could have obvious benefits in advising relatives on avoiding risk factors," they say.
"Such as the recreational use of cannabis in the case of schizophrenia, or more controversially in attempting prevention with a low dose antipsychotic agent."
However, mental health charity Mind is cautious about the scientists' predictions.
It believes that evidence on genetic effects on mental health is inconclusive and that environmental factors play a big role.
"Our concern is if someone thinks genetics are the only answer to mental health problems," said a spokeswoman.

By Chris Bockman
Bugarach, France
A village in southern France is thought by some to be the one place where it may be possible to survive the end of the world - an event they expect on 21 December 2012.Bugarach, a tiny ancient village on the French side of the Pyrenees is extremely hard to find and you have to make a special effort to get there.
Groups that could be called sects are heading to the mountain top and taking part in strange rituals
And that is apparently just what a variety of esoteric groups, "new-agers" and doomsday cults are doing or planning to do. According to an ancient Mayan calendar, at some point towards the end of 2012, the world will come to an end. It is not clear how that will happen, but apparently humanity does not stand a chance - except for those who seek shelter in the area surrounding Bugarach. Just 200 people live there all year round, but doomsday believers and spiritual groups are convinced the village has magical powers, thanks to the local mountain - the Pic de Bugarach. For years, rumours have circulated on the internet that extra-terrestrials live in the mountain, and come the apocalypse, the top will open and they will emerge with spaceships, and rescue the local inhabitants. UFOsSounds ridiculous, right? But the French authorities say it is no joke.
This grafitti in Bugarach depicts UFOs picking a human off a mountain top
A special parliamentary committee has warned that sects may be considering mass suicides in 2012, on French territory. It has pointed the finger at some of the people spending time around Bugarach and elsewhere in the Pyrenees. The authorities say some individuals have bought land in the mountains, with the intention of building bunkers, where they can survive the end of the world surrounded by their acolytes, or even die together. I have to admit while I was in Bugarach I saw no spaceships or mysterious priest-like figures. Just a painting on a wall depicting UFOs picking a human off a mountain top, and some sleepy dogs basking in the sun rather fed up at being woken up by yet another foreign journalist. A four-man crew from German television was also wandering through the village, looking for signs of the near end of the world. They too came away empty-handed, and rather puzzled by all the fuss. 'Strange rituals'It has to be said that the local population is not exactly thrilled to see the media stomping through the village and most are not talking.
Misfits and hippies have been attracted to the region for years
Their shutters are tightly shut to keep out both the searing heat, and pesky reporters asking questions about UFOs. One who was willing to talk was Valerie Austin, a retired British schoolteacher who came here 10 years ago to get away from it all. She said she believed she had a rational mind, and just could not see how anyone could take seriously the idea that the mountain might be some sort of underground, UFO car park. But the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, told me groups that could be called sects are heading to the mountain top and taking part in strange rituals. Others, dressed in white outfits, have also been seen holding furtive gatherings in the forest near the village. He says it is frightening his constituents and he also shakes his head in disbelief. He said, with ghoulish humour, if it really is the end of the world next year, he has no desire to be left on his own in the village. It will not be much fun - he would rather die with the rest of civilisation. And at the nearest estate agency, about 10 miles (16km) from the village, Jacques Fargier says he has sold some big properties to some strange types that could be characterised as sects. In fact, teasingly, he said that there would be no point in anyone heading to the village looking for a property safe haven, because there was not much on the market and building permission was very hard to obtain in this stunning part of the world. Mystical 'energy'Doomsday or not, there is no question that the countryside around Bugarach has a very powerful hold on many visitors with esoteric inclinations.
In the next valley there is another tiny village, Rennes le Chateau, that has been swamped by tourists for several years, after the hugely successful writer, Dan Brown, revealed in The Da Vinci Code an ancient rumour that the local priest became rich overnight. According to the legend, he found proof that Mary Magdalene and Christ may have been lovers. He was bought off by the Catholic Church to keep the truth secret, and then buried his wealth near the village. Every year, spiritual travellers come to soak in the energy they say comes from the mountain. They are convinced something very strange happened here. This arid and remote region has a rich history. Brutal religious wars and border conflicts between France and Spain have marked the land. Ransacked castles dot the landscape. A low cost of living, artisan economy, and air of mysticism lingering over the mountainous terrain, has attracted misfits and a large community of hippies to the region for years. For the local restaurants and bed-and-breakfast owners, there is no doubt the strange tales and magic energy said to be inside the mountains are extremely good for tourism. But they admit too many visitors in white tunics holding secret gatherings at night is not the kind of business they are keen on.How to listen to From Our Own CorrespondentBBC Radio 4: A 30-minute programme on Saturdays, 1130.

Is Armstrong's dream still alive?
(SELF) ANALYSIS
By Pallab Ghosh
BBC science correspondent
What could we do now that would have the same impact?
When I saw Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon all things seemed possible, the very stars seemed within our grasp.I imagined that when I grew up I would be living on the Moon with my family. Space travel would be the norm. As someone who lived through the Apollo missions, I remember having my spirits and expectations of humanity's potential raised by those epic adventures. But of course by 1972, the public got bored with the Moon missions, the TV ratings went down and the 60s sparkle went flat.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. 1994: Neil Armstrong says he still believes in the Moon dream
And as the Apollo era ended - so too ended the era of doing great things. Of course Apollo was replaced by the shuttle and we watched adventures on Skylab, Mir and more recently the International Space Station. But somehow the missions that followed in Earth's orbit didn't stir the blood in the same way. With the end of Apollo came the oil crisis, Watergate, industrial unrest and ailing economic times. Instead of a new dawn, we entered an age of cynicism. I remember wondering whatever happened to the "Armstrong dream"? Without it, we were suddenly left much smaller Many of my generation have this feeling of loss. But, uniquely, I was lucky enough to have shared it with Neil Armstrong himself. I met him 15 years ago as a young reporter working out of the BBC's Cambridge office for the regional Look East Programme. Armstrong was guest of honour at Cranfield University's 50th anniversary commemoration ceremony. I spotted him having his picture taken after he'd received an honorary degree. I walked toward him and asked him some of the burning questions that Look East viewers wanted answers to..
These days, Armstrong makes rare public appearances
Moon astronauts urge Mars mission
Understanding Neil Armstrong
My first question was: "Dr Armstrong - your reaction to being at Cranfield today?" I was so nervous and excited that his answer washed over me. When he finished, I was caught unawares and didn't know what to ask him next so I ungrammatically stuttered out: "It's very rare of you to attend public engagements - what made you come all the way to Cranfield?" "Arrrrrgh!" I thought to myself. "Here I am speaking to the first man on the Moon and all I can think of asking him are his impressions of Cranfield University!". I knew that I could only ask one more question. "Don't waste it", I thought as he finished answering my second question. "When you set foot on the Moon all things seemed possible. The very stars seemed within our grasp. But now that dream has gone. Whatever happened to the Armstrong dream? And he gazed down toward me - his kindly presence filled my vision as if I was being spoken to by a god. He said: "The dream remains! The reality has faded a bit, but it will come back, in time." And with that reassurance, he set my world straight again. My cynicism had evaporated, my smallness was no more and I could dream about the possibility of exploring the stars once again.

More help for Cambridge students
Vice-chancellor Alison Richard wants a wider range of undergraduates
Cambridge University says about a third of its 12,000 undergraduates could benefit from an upgrading of its bursary scheme from 2006. Some 1,200 from the poorest families would get an extra �4,000 a year from the university.
The means-tested support would taper out at a family income of about �35,000, Cambridge said. The scheme depends on the government's controversial plans for higher tuition fees in England going through. Those plans are the most contentious in the raft of legislation announced in Wednesday's Queen's Speech. 'Poverty gap'
HAVE YOUR SAY
No one will want to go to university if it means they are going to be paying off a huge debt.
John Livingston, England
Top-up fees: Your views
As of Thursday lunchtime, 128 Labour backbenchers had their names on a rebel motion proposing that the government publish alternative models of funding higher education for debate.
The government hopes that the use of bursaries by universities will blunt people's concerns about debt putting off poorer students.
It is not yet clear whether its legislation - which might be published as early as next week - will involve any nationwide scheme. The more elite universities have made clear their opposition to being forced to divert any extra income from higher fees into subsidising students at other institutions. Its concern is to bridge the "poverty trap". This is the difference at the lowest end between the grant it is providing from next year, �1,000, plus the �1,125 fee remission, and the maximum "top-up" of �3,000 - a gap of �875. If bursaries were offered to the poorest to cover that, ministers could say the poorest students would be no worse off under its plans even if they wanted to pursue the most expensive courses. 'Open to all'
Cambridge said that about one in 10 undergraduates would get bursary help equivalent to basic living costs - estimated at between �5,000 and �6,000 per year. Eventually, the university said, it hoped to finance the �7.9m-a-year scheme "through a major fundraising drive". The vice-chancellor, Professor Alison Richard, said: "I believe passionately that this university must be open to all outstanding students, regardless of background. "Higher fees are only acceptable if we can be confident of this, and when I began my term as vice-chancellor in October, I wanted to be assured that we could create a comprehensive and navigable bursary scheme. "I am confident that we have a proposal for such a scheme in hand."
It should "widen the pool of qualified students who will apply to Cambridge". The plan has brought the university off the fence in favour of top-up fees. Like other universities it argues that it needs the extra money. Facts and figures
It says it is underfunded by �24m a year for undergraduate teaching. Overall it had a deficit last year of �4m. "Only endowments and relatively low salaries have allowed Cambridge to maintain quality so far," it said. Endowments of about �500m, built up over 800 years, generate annual income of about �49m, or 10% of its total. But these are dwarfed by those of its US competitors and salaries are "steadily losing ground".
"More investment is needed in staff, students and facilities to sustain world-class performance."
The government's proposals to let it charge �3,000 fees would increase its income by about �20m. The university's existing bursary scheme offers �1,000 a year to those in receipt of fee remission - government support which means the poorest do not pay the present flat-rate fee, �1,125 this year. It says this is already the largest programme of UK undergraduate support, totalling �1.5m per year.

By Sam Lyon
1810: So Man City right back in the title race with arguably their performance of the season. Which makes it Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City, Tottenham and... Bolton in the mix, then, yes? What a season this is shaping up to be. For highlights on what has been a rip-roaring weekend, don't miss Match of the Day 2 at 2230 on BBC One and online. Otherwise, join Jonathan Stevenson
tomorrow for Sunderland-Everton
and I'll be back on Tuesday and Wednesday for the Champions League footy. Happy days. Night all.1805: Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini: "We hope Diego Maradona can come again if this is the result! If you lose you are a stupid manager, if you win you are a top manager." KloseButNoCigar on 606:
"Painful day for Fulham. We need to get some decent points on the board soon or face a difficult season at the end of the table we don't deserve to be."1759: FULHAM 1-4 MAN CITY
Sam Sheringham reports: "Man City, settled by an early goal, played with confidence and fluency on a miserable afternoon for their former boss Mark Hughes."Farrell via text: "Some Fulham fans chanting at the ref 'you don't know what you're doing'. I think it should be aimed at the manager. Same story pretty much every week, too many chances created against us." MCFC_TID on 606:
"Very impressive performance from City today. The vultures surrounding Mancini will be disappointed, but City have been outstanding."
1752: FULL-TIME Fulham 1-4 Man CityCity move back into the top four, Fulham stay bottom four.1749: Fulham want a penalty when Zoltan Gera goes down under a challenge from Nigel de Jong in the box clutching his face, but Lee Mason is having none of it. Replays show the Manchester City midfielder did catch the Hungarian in the face with his shoulder. Was it deliberate? Hhmm. 1749: We'll have three minutes of added time.1747: James Milner is going to get a couple of minutes, David Silva the man replaced.1745: Looks like referee Lee Mason doesn't want to delay matters any further either, the referee failing to give a free-kick when it looked like a clear charge on Andrew Johnson by the left touchline by Pablo Zabaleta. Not that anyone, with the score as it is, is too bothered mind.1743: Decent free-kick position here for Fulham, 22 yards out to the right of the Man City goal, but Zoltan Gera spoons his effort way off-target. This match very much crawling to a conclusion at the moment.1740: Gareth Barry, who is reported to be struggling with tightness in both calves, is replaced by Manchester City substitute Patrick Vieira.
1737: Referee Lee Mason is getting a bit card happy now, this time Andy Johnson having his name taken for a foul on Vincent Kompany chasing back.1735: Carlos Tevez is finally dragged from the field, Adam Johnson his replacement. A deserved ovation from the away supporters for their two-goal hero. Kolo Toure takes over the captaincy.
1734: Booking for Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta for a foul on Diomansy Kamara.1731: Looks like Manchester City are contemplating replacing Carlos Tevez here, but the Argentine is having none of it. He can smell a hat-trick.
Fulham goal: There's some reward for Fulham, Zoltan Gera getting on the end of Jo's poor clearance from a corner and side-footing into the net via a deflection off Yaya Toure.1728: GOALFLASH Fulham 1-4 Man City (Gera)1727: Attack it is, Simon Davies seeing his snap-shot from 20 yards deflected narrowly over.1725: Fulham caught between a rock and a hard place here. Attack and leave themselves open, or defend a 4-0 defeat and show a lack of ambition.1722: With Fulham looking utterly deflated, Mark Hughes brings Diomansy Kamara on for Dickson Etuhu.1721: A fine David Silva corner almost creeps in under Mark Schwarzer's bar, but the Fulham keeper recovers to punch away from goal. 1717: Aleksandar Kolarov wants a piece of the action now, the full-back cutting in from the right and swinging a left-foot curler inches past the far upright. Fulham staring down the barrel.
Man City goal: Well it is 4-0 now. From the resulting corner the ball falls to Pablo Zabaleta, whose low shot is flicked in rather fortuitously by Carlos Tevez in front of keeper Mark Schwarzer. Sucker-punch after Fulham's bright start to the half.1714: GOALFLASH Fulham 0-4 Man City (Tevez)1713: It should be 4-0. Carlos Tevez is set clean through by Pablo Zabaleta's pass but he has too much time to think about it and he can only shoot straight at Mark Schwarzer.1711: This is a really bright start to the half from Fulham as it happens, and Joe Hart pulls off a fine save when Zoltan Gera heads a Carlos Salcido cross goalwards... although a foul is given against Gera in the end for a push in the back.
1710: Dickson Etuhu receives the match's first booking, but it's a bit harsh if you ask me - it was a nothing tackle on Nigel de Jong. Maybe it was for repeat offending.
KopOfTheLeague on 606:
"RE PaulJ123: I think there are a fair number of Liverpool fans who would happily give you him back. As for me, I'm reserving judgement until a more appropriate time (ie the end of the season)."1706: And now Andy Johnson breaks down the right, his low cross well held by Joe Hart. Fulham showing a bit of fight in the early stages of this half.1705: Fulham get themselves a corner nice and early, but Chris Baird can only head it harmlessly over.1703: Back up and running at the Cottage.1702: And here come the players now. Fulham are making a change, Zoltan Gera coming on for Damien Duff. Does the Hungarian have four goals in him?1701: Roberto Mancini is already out and about at Craven Cottage, signing autographs. I guess there's not a great deal for him to have said at half-time his Man City team have been terrific.
PaulJ123 on Twitter:
"How Fulham miss Roy Hodgson. Basically the same team as last year with same style and we're 3-0 down at HT. Sort it out!"
BBC Sport's Jonathan Stevenson on Twitter:
"RE: 1550 - Is he still there? I'm literally on my way, don't let him leave. Wonder if he's on the cusp of a shock return to football?"As Fulham's guest, the poor fella's currently biting his tongue mate
1651: HALF-TIME FULHAM 0-3 MAN CITYSam Sheringham's HT snap-shot: "Boring City? Hardly. Perhaps inspired by the watching Maradona, Mancini's men are tearing Fulham apart."Si, London via text: "The fat lady who lost her voice at the Emirates at half-time yesterday may have just found it again at the Cottage. Fulham just don't have the firepower." 1647: Respite for Fulham, there's the half-time whistle.1644: A rare touch of the ball for Fulham in the City box, but Simon Davies's attempt to help on a free-kick from deep is tame and Joe Hart awakes from his slumber to collect easily.1642: Fulham have forgotten what's it like to have to have a touch of the football in this match while City are stroking it around at will. The Cottagers praying for half-time now.1639: According to Andy Gray on Sky, by the way, there were 24 uninterrupted passes in the build up to that third City goal. Roberto Mancini's men showing a real command of the football here.
manfrombelmonty on 606:
"This is the type of performance everyone's been looking for from City this season. Crisp incisive passing making it all look so easy. If they play like this more often they should be very real title contenders."
Man City goal: Roberto Mancini's men threatening to run riot here. It's a cracking football goal too, David Silva, Jo and Carlos Tevez all involved before the latter feeds Yaya Toure to take a touch and slide a fine finish into the far corner.1634: GOALFLASH Fulham 0-3 Man City (Yaya Toure)1634: "Boring boring City," cry the away fans. Ironically, obviously.
Man City goal: I tell you what, City fans will want Diego Maradona at all their games. After Carlos Tevez's opener, another Argentine in Pablo Zabaleta crashes home an unstoppable drive from 22 yards to double City's lead. Deserved too.1632: GOALFLASH Fulham 0-2 Man City (Zabaleta)1629: Manchester City really into their rhythm now, playing some nice one-touch football and generally building happily and patiently in the final third. Fulham looking to hang on a bit at times.1626: David Silva cuts in from the right for Manchester City, but his attempted left-foot shot is so wayward it goes off for a throw-in. Seen a few of those today.
ganjerson on 606:
"Good save, but Kolarov has got to take that further."1622: Nicely worked free-kick from Fulham as Danny Murphy squares to Simon Davies, but the Welshman's poor shot only allows Manchester City to break and Aleksandar Kolarov gets one-on-one, his early effort kept out to his left low down by home keeper Mark Schwarzer. Good save.1619: Nearly 20 minutes gone in this match and still Tevez's goal remains the only shot on target in this match. City more than comfortable with that.1616: A few of you asking if that Carlos Tevez goal was offside - no chance. Chris Baird at right-back was clearly playing him on, level, when Gareth Barry laid his pass into the box.1614: Carlos Salcido lines one up from range but the Fulham defender's effort is horribly off target.
InfostradaLive on Twitter:
"Carlos Tevez joins Andy Carroll and Johan Elmander as this season's Premier League top scorer on eight goals."1611: City bossing possession since that early goal - I imagine Fulham's gameplan was to keep things tight and get in and about City early on; that will need changing.
ChrisDear11 on Twitter:
"Let's just remember Craven Cottage is a very difficult place to go to. Fulham never accept defeat. Score draw."1608: And that officially makes it not a single goalless draw this weekend in England, Scotland, Wales or Ireland I believe. Wow.
Man City goal: One chance, one goal. It's a top strike, too, Carlos Tevez - onside - muscling Carlos Salcido off the ball on the edge of the box to receive Gareth Barry's pass, take a touch, and slam into the corner.1606: GOALFLASH Fulham 0-1 Manchester City (Tevez)1605: Fulham putting the early pressure on the City backline, with Clint Dempsey showing some nice touches in and around the area. There's no penetrating the visitors' defence on this occasion, though, and City will bounce forward.1602: Couple of tackles flying in early, Dickson Etuhu getting away with a clip on Yaya Toure's ankles but Nigel de Jong penalised for a foul on Clint Dempsey.1600: And we're up and running at Craven Cottage.1558: Big chance for Manchester City to press their claims at the top of the table, and a big opportunity for Fulham to pull their way up to mid-table security. Let's get ready to rumble.Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini: "I think it will be a difficult game today because Fulham are a very strong team. Jo is a good player and he has a big chance. If we have another striker nearer Carlos maybe it's better but if the whole team play well we won't have a problem."1555: Here come the players. It's pretty blooming nippy out there, I tell ya.
Khumbs_maverick on Twitter: "City must win if they're to make the rest of the Premier League sit up and take notice of them as genuine title contenders."
bluedefence on 606:
"Fair play to them both Mark Hughes and Craig Bellamy showing a lot of dignity on Sky. They keep getting prompted to rubbish City but point blank refuse to."Couldn't agree more with that, both showing a lot of class.1550: So, back to events at the Cottage. And who's there? Only Argentina legend Maradona. No-one tell Stevo,
he'll tear his hamstrings trying to hot-foot it down to London asap and no mistake.1547: BLACKBURN 2-0 ASTON VILLA
Paul Fletcher
reports: "It wasn't pretty but Blackburn can certainly roll their sleeves up. For all Villa's talented youngsters it was a lesson in the harsh realities of life in the Premier League."1545: Right, before we turn our attentions fully to events at Craven Cottage, let's remind ourselves of events at Ewood Park briefly...
tommythetank on 606:
"Fulham will be scratching around for points today."1540: FULHAM V MAN CITYSam Sheringham reports: "Fulham boss Mark Hughes is a man with a point to prove against the club that got rid of him last December. His Manchester City successor Roberto Mancini has exactly the same record as Hughes did after 13 games last season, but nine fewer goals. After 0-0 draws in his past two games, and plenty of rumours of player unrest, Mancini is under pressure to shed his defensive-minded approach against the league's draw specialists."Alec (Everton fan) in Reigate via text: "RE: Nigel Adderley on Twitter (below) - yeah, and he should have got the winner for Everton!"1535: A little addition to that team news - there are five Mark Hughes signings in today's Manchester City line-up, and in Fulham's? Just the one. Carlos Salcido. Does that mean Hughes can't lose?
chazzer96 on Twitter: "City have an outrageously good bench."
MCFC_TID on 606:
"I'm groaning at the City team, if this is going to be another torrid draw then Mancini, you've lost my support."1530: FULHAM V MAN CITYSam Sheringham reports: "Roberto Mancini's answer to Manchester City's lack of goals is to give Brazilian striker Jo his first Premier League start for the club in more than two years. Joe Hart returns in goal after missing England's friendly with France through injury and Gareth Barry is restored in midfield. James Milner and Adam Johnson have to be content with places on the bench. Fulham welcome back Carlos Salcido and Chris Baird from injury at the back, while Dickson Etuhu comes in to shore up the midfield in place of injured striker Moussa Dembele."
BBC Five Live's Nigel Adderley on Twitter:
"Jo's last Premier League start was 12 Dec last year. Chelsea 3 Everton 3."
pauljomo on 606:
"Hmmm Jo up front for City? Must be shop window time for the January sales."1524: FULHAM v MAN CITYFulham: Schwarzer, Baird, Hangeland, Hughes, Salcido, Davies, Murphy, Etuhu, Duff, Dempsey, Andrew Johnson. Subs: Stockdale, Kelly, Pantsil, Gera, Kamara, Dikgacoi, Greening.Man City: Hart, Zabaleta, Toure, Kompany, Kolarov, Toure Yaya, De Jong, Barry, Jo, Tevez, Silva. Subs: Given, Milner, Wright-Phillips, Adebayor, Adam Johnson, Vieira, Boyata.Referee: Lee Mason (Lancashire)
1523: FULL-TIME Blackburn 2-0 Aston Villa1519: Four minutes of time added on at Ewood Park.1518: One minute of normal time remaining, and Blackburn are firmly on their way to three valuable points.1515: BREAKING TEAM NEWSJoe Hart returns in goal for Manchester City, who start with Jo up front. Carlos Salcido is back from injury for Fulham.1514: Blackburn controlling possession maturely here, Villa struggling to stage a late rally.1511: Half a penalty appeal from Villa when the ball strikes Phil Jones on the arm in the box, but it was clearly a case of ball-to-hand and nothing is given.1509: Youngster Chris Herd, seconds after coming on to replace Jonathan Hogg for Aston Villa, almost makes the dream introduction as he throws himself at a Stewart Downing corner, but his header is charged down well by Michel Salgado.
genericToon on 606:
"As an Ireland and Newcastle fan, I am sick to the teeth of him, but is Pedersen finally back to his breathtaking best?"1507: Another throw of the dice from Villa boss Gerard Houllier, Nathan Delfouneso coming on to replace Gabriel Agbonlahor.1505: Blackburn looking to soak-and-counter now, understandably, and Villa are running out of ideas of how to pick the Rovers lock. Robert Pires has been fairly anonymous so far, to be fair.1502: Good save, that, Paul Robinson beating away a stinging left-foot long-ranger from Stewart Downing. Villa fast running out of time to get back into this.1500: It should be game over. El Hadji Diouf, completely unmarked, is picked out by a doozy of a Michel Salgado cross but the Senegalese heads over six yards out. Ouch. Herold Goulon on for Morten Gamst Pedersen for Blackburn, meanwhile.1459: Robert Pires, by the way, has stationed himself out on the left wing. I don't think he's touched it yet. I'm reliably informed the Frenchman was once voted Arsenal's sixth-best player of all time. Never knew that.1458: Bit of nice build-up from Blackburn there, but from Jason Roberts's neat lay-off Phil Jones skies his effort miles over the Villa bar.1457: Here he comes, then, Robert Pires brought on to replace Stephen Ireland in the Aston Villa midfield. What's the 37-year-old got left in the tank?
Blackburn goal: Breathing space for Rovers. Aston Villa again fail to deal with a corner and after Mame Diouf's initial shot is blocked, Ryan Nelsen slams goalwards and Morten Gamst Pedersen deflects the ball in.1454: GOALFLASH Blackburn 2-0 Aston Villa (Pedersen)1453: Mame Diouf comes on to replace Junior Hoilett for Blackburn.1451: Super tackle, and Richard Dunne keeps Villa in it. El Hadji Diouf is released clear on goal but the Rovers forward dallies too long and Dunne sprints across to get in the saving challenge 12 yards out.1450: And from the resulting free-kick another ripping effort from Morten Gamst Pedersen looks like creeping past the melee of players in the box and into the net - but Brad Friedel gets down to hold.
1449: First booking of the game as Ciaran Clark has his name taken for a blatant pull on the shirt of Jason Roberts.
AndySzpuk on Twitter:
"How long before Villa resort to a bit of Pires magic to turn this game around?"1447: Villa get a free-kick of their own wide on the left, but Ashley Young's driven free-kick doesn't even beat the wall - further up the pitch Morten Gamst Pedersen scoffs in his general direction.1444: Villa knocking it about lovely now, with Stephen Ireland and Barry Bannan pulling the strings - but Blackburn, to their credit, are holding firm and Paul Robinson hasn't yet been too busy this half.1441: Villa look to have switched to a more orthodox 4-4-2 with Ashley Young up front alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor - and they look a lot more comfortable as a result.1440: Bit better this time from Blackburn - well, the shot is at least on target - but Phil Jones's low 20-yard snap-shot is straight down the throat of Villa keeper Brad Friedel. 1439: Jason Roberts undoes a lot of good work with another dire finish, firing way off target on the back of a decent run in from the left.
1437: Just as in the first half, Villa have flown out of the traps since the break - and Ashley Young is so close to a leveller. First he cuts in from the left and spanks a fierce effort goalwards that Paul Robinson beats away, and then the forward rises to meet a Stewart Downing cross only to see his header thump against the bar. 1435: Just the one change to tell you about, Gael Givet replaced by Pascal Chimbonda for Blackburn. Apparently Givet is ill, which might explain his poor first-half performance.1434: We're back under way at Ewood Park.1430: So far so good for the new Venky's-run Blackburn Rovers, then. And while we've got a moment during the half-time break, by the way, why not check out Matt Slater's blog on the Rao-family's takeover of the club?
It's immediate impact might not just surround Rovers by the sound of things, but maybe even the Indian sub-continent as a whole. As Matt says: "The passing of the Walker era, and the security it provided, is undoubtedly a time for reflection at Ewood Park, but what happens next will not be boring." James in Shrewsbury via text: "That caps a torrid first half for Friedel, who has flapped like a fish out of water at most crosses into the box."Merlin via text: "Peck that one out!"
1420: HALF-TIME Blackburn 1-0 Aston Villa
Paul Fletcher's
HT snap-shot: "Difficult to say that either side really deserves to be in front after a largely uninspiring if very competitive half."1418: And it's right on the stroke of half-time, too. Blackburn goal: He scored a beauty for Norway against Republic of Ireland in the week and it's another fine free-kick from Morten Gamst Pedersen, this time from wide on the right. Brad Friedel should do a whole lot better, though, the American allowing the winger's whipped effort through his grip and into the net.1417: GOALFLASH Blackburn 1-0 Aston Villa (Pedersen)1414: We'll have a break in play as Stephen Warnock receives some treatment after a clash of heads with El Hadji Diouf, who is receiving some rather stern words from the Villa players as a result. Unfortunately, not quite worthy of my 'handbags' graphic. Shame.1412: I do hope my commentary graphics don't spend the whole afternoon on the sidelines. They're all looking rather redundant.1410: El Hadji Diouf's header at the back post causes Brad Friedel, who has certainly had his fair share of work to do so far, a few more problems but the American keeper grabs at the second attempt.1406: It's a decent break down the right there, though, Luke Young releasing Gabriel Agbonlahor, whose cross is well shepherded out by Michael Salgado under pressure in the box from Ashley Young.1405: Villa just knocked off their stride in the last 10 or so minutes under the sheer weight of Blackburn set-piece routines. That will suit Sam Allardyce just fine.1401: You have to wonder if Villa can afford to keep giving set-pieces away as they are right now. This time Morten Gamst Pedersen's delivery from the right touchline is flicked on by Jason Roberts and it is only inches past the post. Blackburn's approach under Sam Allardyce might not be particularly subtle, but it's coming pretty close to bearing fruit here.1359: Another Blackburn free-kick, more trouble caused in the Villa box. Once again, though, the finishing is worse than poor and El Hadji Diouf's attempted scissors kick is utterly wayward.1355: Villa might be the more attractive on the ball so far, but Blackburn are still looking a real threat from set-pieces - this time Junior Hoilett should do a lot better on the volley when the ball falls to him unmarked from a corner, but he slices it high over the bar.1352: Blackburn's Gael Givet is not having the best of days so far, and he's just spooned an effort 18 yards out high, wide and not very handsome.1350: Lovely build-up again from Villa, but Gabriel Agbonlahor mis-reads Stephen Ireland's pass and it allows Chris Samba to get back and clear. Poor movement from Agbonlahor.1348: It's taken a fabulous tackle inside the area from Stephen Warnock on Jason Roberts to prevent what would have been a top chance for the hosts there, though. Roberts would've been through 12 yards out without it.1347: Villa that much sharper to every ball at the moment, positive start from the visitors.1344: I tell you what, that's a cracking save. After referee Michael Oliver collides with Blackburn's Gael Givet, Aston Villa break and Ashley Young brilliantly works some space inside the Blackburn box, only for Paul Robinson to get down excellently to palm the winger's snap-shot away. The closest we've come to an opener.1341: First real glimpse of Scotland new-boy Barry Bannan in an attacking sense at Ewood (not Villa, obviously, ahem) Park... the midfielder cutting in from the right and zipping a low shot narrowly wide of Paul Robinson's upright.1338: Morten Gamst Pedersen launches a long throw into the box and Michel Salgado does his best to get on the end of a rebound on the edge of the box, the Spaniard succeeding only in kicking Stephen Ireland, though.
Dan on 606:
"Good start at Ewood Park. But we mustn't count our... never mind."1335: Nice, open start at Ewood Park with both teams looking to get on the front foot nice and early.1333: Villa bounce up the field and Stephen Ireland's through-ball is a delicious one, setting Stewart Downing through on goal on the right but the winger seeing his effort kept out low by Paul Robinson. Good chance, that.1332: Erm... right. Morten Gamst Pedersen lays it off for Chris Samba to have a crack - it's so wide, though, it nearly takes out the corner flag.1332: Blackburn straight on to the offensive and they have a free-kick, centre of goal, 25 yards out...1330: Up and running in the Blackburn-Villa match.1329: A quick introduction to the Ewood Park crowd for new owners Indian businessmen Balaji Rao and Venkatesh Rao - nice reception for those boys - and we're ready for kick-off. 1327: There's just time to bring you the Euro Club Index
mathematics behind today's fixtures. According to the super-computer, the win chances for today's games - with the club's ECI ranking in brackets - are...Blackburn (61) 41% v Aston Villa (36) 29%Fulham (53) 39% v Man City (25) 30%And if you fancy less mathematical approach... check out Lawro's Predictions.
This week, he's up against Olly Murs. Yes, seriously.1324: Right then, let's focus on all things Ewood Park shall we? The players are in the tunnel and we're minutes away from kick-off.
dominic on 606:
"Who wants the title? Clearly Bolton. Hat's off to Owen Coyle who, on one of the league's more modest budgets, has got them up there with the big boys and playing better football then most of them too."
philw1958 on Twitter:
"I'm with you on that Sam, I could listen to Ian Holloway all day breath of fresh air straight off the Irish sea ha!"1319: BLACKBURN v ASTON VILLA
Paul Fletcher reports: "This fixture marks the dawn of a new era for Blackburn after their £43m takeover by the Rao family on Friday. I wouldn't say the arrival of former Arsenal wide man Robert Pires at Aston Villa this week exactly heralds the start of a new era for the Birmingham club but it will be interesting to see how the 37-year-old shapes up if he makes an appearance from the substitute's bench."JonnoSilentD via text: "I agree with Josh (1311) about no more chicken jokes. Seriously, an oeuf is an oeuf..."
Imveggieiam on 606:
"All this fuss about yesterdays goals & controversy... has nobody picked up on the fact that the Kidderminster Harriers are now up to sixth in the table?! woo!"Mate, it's all I can think about. Ahem.1315: And while I'm briefly off-topic, our chief football writer Phil McNulty has only gone and blogged on Tottenham's stunning come-from-behind win over Arsenal
yesterday. Spurs boss Harry Redknapp reckons it underlines his side's title credentials this year - I wonder what Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal think about that? And, more to the point, what about Manchester City fans? This is surely shaping up to be the most open title race for years... who wants it?1311: If I can go very briefly off-topic by the way, did anyone see Blackpool boss Ian Holloway's reaction to Prince William's attendance at Bloomfield Road
yesterday? I could listen to Ollie all day long, I love him... "The future king of England was watching us today. It's just fantastic, isn't it? I never though I'd be watched by royalty. I found out before the match that he was coming and had the privilege of going to meet him before kick off. I told him how proud I am of him and his brother. I also told him how proud his mother would have been. They are both cracking lads. Then I told him to leave our women alone if he goes out tonight! That was a joke. I just said be careful where you go!" What a hero that man is. Josh via text: "No more yolks about chickens please..."1307: BLACKBURN v ASTON VILLA
Paul Fletcher reports: "So Blackburn make three changes from the team that lost 4-2 at Tottenham, with David Dunn, El-Hadji Diouf and Jason Roberts coming in for Pascal Chimbonda, Brett Emerton and Nikola Kalinic. Aston Villa's new signing Robert Pires is on the bench, while Ciaran Clark and Stephen Ireland replace James Collins and Marc Albrighton from the side that drew with Manchester United."
eric the mighty on 606:
"Let's hope it's a goal fest, a controversy fest or at least a streaker to enhance the interest."Ooh, you're a poet and you don't know it.
blake2108 on Twitter: "Marc Albrighton is a huge loss for Villa today. He's been magnificent for Villa this season."1301: BLACKBURN v ASTON VILLABlackburn: Robinson, Salgado, Samba, Nelsen, Givet, Dunn, Jones, Pedersen, Hoilett, Roberts, El-Hadji Diouf. Subs: Bunn, Kalinic, Goulon, Hanley, Morris, Chimbonda, Mame Diouf.Aston Villa: Friedel, Luke Young, Dunne, Clark, Warnock, Downing, Ireland, Hogg, Bannan, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor.

Jedd on 606:
"Going to be a good day for the Football. Fulham will beat City in a thrilling encounter, scraping by. Aston Villa will pick off Blackburn after Blackburn take the lead early on."1258: So, on that Robert Pires bombshell, I want you to get your best chat and banter going for me. Tweet me @sampatricklyon,
text me via 81111 (UK) or +44 7786200666 (worldwide) or join the chat over on her majesty's 606.
This is your time to shine.1255: BREAKING TEAM NEWSRobert Pires starts on the bench for Aston Villa.1254: Before that, though, we've got Blackburn v Aston Villa.
In the week that Rovers were finally taken over by the Rao family-run chicken business Venky's London Limited
for the bargain price of £43m, we will see what affect the resolution of their off-field issues will have on the field for the Ewood Park faithful. Let's hope there's no fowl play or a poultry lack of action and that there's plenty of egg-citement with a happy hen-ding. I'll stop now. As for Villa, all eyes could be on 37-year-old free signing Robert Pires who may well be in line for a new-look defensive midfield role. Yep, interesting.1251: Just joking Manchester City fans! In fact, this afternoon's later game at Craven Cottage between Fulham and Manchester City
could well be a barn-stormer. Few could argue that Fulham have not been a better than some of their results this season, while City today have the opportunity to reignite their title challenge following defeats yesterday for Chelsea
and Arsenal.
And then there's the fascinating subtext involving the managers. Mark Hughes knows just what's it like to
feel the pressure at City,
and now it's Roberto Mancini's turn. What odds on the discard outshining his replacement
today?1249: Saying that, Manchester City are playing.1248: Well luckily for you lot, I don't believe in all that rubbish. I say you make your own luck. I say I am the goal king and I say today we're in for a treat. Who's with me? 1245: Now then people, Saturday's Premier League action
produced 23 goals, three red cards, six penalties and more incident than you could wave a very large stick at. Anyone think we might be in for a couple of right royal borefests today?

Button losing grip on F1 title race
Highlights - Hungarian Grand Prix
By Mark Hughes
BBC F1 commentary box producer
Only three races ago, after dominating the Turkish Grand Prix, Jenson Button described his Brawn as "a monster of a car, perfect, outrageous, the best I have ever driven".You may have heard him on the radio during Sunday's Hungarian race, bewildered, saying: "How did this car get so bad?" Give or take a few development parts, this is the same car he is talking about. Whatever has gone wrong? It is a question the team need to answer quickly. Three races ago Button was waltzing his way to the world championship having lost only one of the first seven events. Now, as he points out: "I've lost an average of five points a race to Mark Webber in the last three. At that rate he'll be in front of me in another four races - and there are seven still to go."
No smoke without fire? Brawn's tyre troubles could ruin their season
What is very clear is that the issue is to do with how the Brawn BGP001 uses its tyres. The lack of performance in the previous two races, at Silverstone and the Nurburgring, was put down to the track characteristics and the cold weather combining with the car's characteristics to give sub-optimum tyre temperatures. But the Hungarian race was held on a circuit with lots of long twisting turns, requiring lots of braking and - on a generally hot day - conditions that should ensure plenty of tyre heat. Yet the team could see from their data systems that the tyres rarely got beyond 60C during Sunday's race, this being about 20C lower than they need to be in order to work properly. There were moments during the race where the track temperature crept beyond 40C and at these moments Button would suddenly find grip and go quite quickly.
606: DEBATE
I think this year the title will go down to the wire... again!
Basil Brushzenberger
His best lap, set during one of these extra-hot spells, was only 0.2 seconds slower than the fastest set by the race winner Lewis Hamilton. But usually the temperature of the surface would hover in the high 30s and in these conditions Button's tyre temperatures would fall back below the critical minimum and he would again be slow as the rear tyres grained. The correlation was almost switch-like. "We saw it also on Friday," stated Button after Sunday's grand prix. "The track was 10-deg hotter than during the race and we were in really good shape with the tyres. "We had grip and we were getting fewer problems with the tyres than any other car.
Car 'is not what it was' - Button
"There was nothing different between Friday's car and today's. All that has changed is the weather." The car is not loading its tyres hard enough to generate the necessary temperatures but the puzzling thing is how this tendency has been accentuated sometime in between the Istanbul race and the Hungarian one so that it is now apparent, even in conditions that did not bring it out before. Team principal Ross Brawn added: "We have to unravel what we have done to the car in the last couple of races and understand if we've done something that has exacerbated the problem. "It seems to have changed from where we were three or four races ago. At Monaco and Turkey we didn't have a tyre problem."
Back to the drawing board for Brawn (UK users only)
The forensic work of tracing all the updates and changes to the car and relating them to the tyre temperature problem is now hindered by the fact that F1 faces a mandatory two-week summer factory shutdown, this a measure introduced this year as a cost-saving measure. "Yes, but I believe you're still allowed to think about F1," said Button mischievously. It's good that he can retain his sense of humour about it all because whatever thoughts the team members can collectively come up during that vacation period could well determine the outcome of the world championship. Mark Hughes has been an F1 journalist for 10 years and is an award-winning author of several books

Three points for a drop-goal
A drop-goal is scored when a player kicks the ball from hand through the opposition's goal posts. The ball is dropped to the ground and is kicked just after it has bounced - it can be a tricky skill to master. If a team is awarded a free-kick, a drop-goal cannot be scored until the ball next becomes dead
an opponent has played or touched it
an opponent has tackled the ball-carrier
This restriction applies also to a scrum taken instead of a free-kick.
A team will usually have a specialist drop-goal kicker and certain set plays they can call on to set up the best chance of a drop-goal.
It can be a very useful weapon to employ near the end of a game when the scores are tight.
Jonny Wilkinson scored in this way when England beat Australia in the World Cup final in 2003. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?
