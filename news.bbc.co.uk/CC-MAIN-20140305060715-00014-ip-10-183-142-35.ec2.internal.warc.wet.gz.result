Childhood cancer hope
Blood from umbilical cords is a rich source of stem cells
Scientists say stem cells from a baby's umbilical cord can be stored frozen for at least 15 years.
It offers potential for treating cancer or certain other diseases a child might develop in future life.
However, many doctors urge caution before opting for cord blood storage - as pre-cancerous cells may be present there even at birth.
Cord blood can be cryopreserved for at least 15 years
Hal Broxmeyer, Indiana University The umbilical cords of babies are a rich source of stem cells, the "master cells" of the body. More than 100,000 samples of frozen cord blood are stored in tissue banks around the world.
It has not been clear, however, for how long they can be successfully stored. The longest they have been kept before being used for human transplant operations is five years.
However, experiments on rodents suggest the stem cells could last much longer - for up to 15 years.
Human transplants
Scientists in the United States say mouse stem cells survived thawing and were able to grow and divide after 15 years in storage.
The research is published in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
A team led by Hal Broxmeyer, of the Indiana University of Medicine in Indianapolis, said: "Our results demonstrate that cord blood haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells can be cryopreserved for at least 15 years, and efficiently retrieved in functionally competent form." They add that human studies must be carried out before there is final proof of the finding.

Armstrong ahead of the pack
Etxebarria wins the stage, but Armstrong is still in the lead
Lance Armstrong moved another step closer to sewing up a Tour de France victory on Wednesday, finishing the final climb with his lead intact.
ONCE's David Etxebarria won a sprint for the line to claim his second stage triumph - having also won the 12th leg last week.
Etxebarria came home in 5hr 17min 07sec edging out Carlos Contreras, Alberto Elli, Alexandre Vinikourov and Jose-Luis Arrieta in a five-man dash for the line.
Armstrong, who was up with the chasing pack throughout alongside his rivals for the overall crown, maintained his solid lead over Kelme's Fernando Escartin of Spain, who could only eat up 4sec of the deficit with Armstrong 6min 15sec clear by the end.
The BBC's Simon Brotherton reportsBanesto's Alex Zulle is still third overall, 7min 28sec off the pace.
Armstrong and Zulle were both in the second group which crossed the line 20sec behind Etxebarria and company.
Around a dozen riders were targeting the stage win over the final few kilometres after Mapei's Pavel Tonkov, Alberto Elli of Telekom and David Etxebarria of ONCE were reined in having detached themselves from the pack after 50km.
Etxebarria finally put on a spurt to force his way home by a hair's breadth.
Controversy
There was controversy earlier in the day when Armstrong's first-day doping test showed up traces of corticoids.
Lance Armstrong: Cleared over drug allegationsCycling's world governing body the International Cycling Union (UCI) said Armstrong was in the clear as he had a medical certificate allowing him to use an ointment which contained the hormones.
In a statement the UCI said: "The rider was tested on July 3 after the prologue and the result was negative with no trace of corticosteroids. "The rider was tested again on July 4 and then minute traces showed up."
The caravan left the Pyrenees after battling humid, overcast conditions as well as three first category and one non-categorised climbs before Pau welcomed the Tour for the 55th time.
Beltran retires
Before the stage, Banesto's Manuel Beltran of Spain, who fell in the previous stage, retired with shoulder trouble to trim the field to 142.
Lance Armstrong reacts to the drug taking allegationsHis withdrawal was a blow for teammate Zulle, whom he had been assigned to help through the mountains.
Only Telekom and Lotto now have a full contingent left in the race.
Sebastian Demarbaix of Lotto launched the day's first attack after 14km and held the lead through the first sprint at Sarrancolin after 16.5km.
Telekom's Erik Zabel of Germany boosted his hopes of taking the green jersey points competition by picking up useful sprint points just ahead of Australian rival Stuart O'Grady of Credit Agricole, whom he led by 10 points at the start of the day.
With Armstrong and Escartin happy to stay with the pack, King of the Mountains leader Richard Virenque of Polti and Zulle, respectively fifth and third overall, made a move towards the front.
The first climbing points went to Mariano Piccoli of Lampre but Virenque was right behind him on the opening climb to ensure Piccoli made only the tiniest of inroads into his 69-point category lead.
Virenque can now look forward to a fifth crown in his favourite category.
After 15 stages, no French rider has managed a stage win.
The last - and only - time France drew a blank throughout the race was in 1926.

Next stage
Thursday provides welcome relief after the tough climbs of the past week-and-a-half, with a flat run into Bordeaux.
This is one for the sprinters - with a win here almost as important to them as next Sunday's victory on the Champs Elysees in Paris.
Armtrong just has to make sure he does not fall off as he conserves strength for Saturday's time trial.

Lead stripped from 12 church roofs in Derbyshire
All Saints in Brailford is one of the churches hit by lead thieves
Thieves have stripped lead from 12 churches in an area of Derbyshire in the past few weeks.The churches in the Derbyshire Dales will have to pay most of the replacement costs as insurance claims for lead theft are limited to Â£5,000. Christopher Cunliffe, archdeacon for Derby Diocese, said people needed to keep an eye out for bogus workmen. "People can do a lot in terms of being vigilant but many of our churches are very isolated," he said. Sensors smashed"We encourage churches to use a product called Smartwater that can be put on roofs to trace the lead if it is taken away and discovered elsewhere. "Some churches also use CCTV and other alarm systems." The Reverend Paul Taylor, who looks after five churches in the area, including All Saints Church in Brailsford which was also targeted several years ago, said the churches had been stripped again in the past few weeks. "We have raised money to install an alarm but the thieves went on the roof and smashed all the sensors." Insurance companies have put a Â£5,000 cap on claims, but the damage caused by a theft two years ago was put at Â£25,000. Mr Taylor said lead thefts could damage church roofs, causing rain to ruin the interior - which is another cost, along with damaged stonework. Police are visiting scrap yards to encourage owners to report anyone they suspect of trying to sell stolen metal.
