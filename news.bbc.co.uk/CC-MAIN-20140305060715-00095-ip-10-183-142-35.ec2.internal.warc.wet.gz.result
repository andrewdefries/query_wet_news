Racism conference undermined by division
Mary Robinson wants the conference to heal old wounds
By diplomatic correspondent Barnaby Mason
Bitter arguments marked the preparations for the UN World Conference Against Racism in the South African city of Durban.
An event designed to come to terms with deep rooted prejudices and resentments seems in danger of merely exacerbating them.
The most difficult issues to resolve are slavery and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The conference has been beset by problems The search for a form of words that everyone could agree to put in the final declaration led to threats by the US and Israel to boycott the meeting entirely - they did not attend two previous conferences 1978 and 1983.
The Durban conference is supposed to be a landmark in the struggle against racism. Deep hurt
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who is in charge of the proceedings, says there is a deep hurt felt in many parts of the world at the lack of recognition of the impact of mass slavery and the exploitation of colonialism.
She has called for language that solemnly recognises this, saying it is nearly impossible to shape a new future if old wounds are still open. The discussions in two preparatory meetings have made it abundantly clear they still are.
Would I get compensation for slavery, or would I pay it?
Colin Powell
The most obvious and topical wound has been reopened by the violence of the last few months between Israelis and Palestinians. Israel's response to the second Palestinian uprising, in particular to the latest wave of suicide bomb attacks, has returned the Middle East atmosphere to something reminiscent of the 1970s.
It was then that the UN General Assembly passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism, which was only overturned in 1991. Pressing for condemnation
Arab countries and others at first tried to get the same language into the Durban declaration.
That has been dropped - but Islamic states have proposed a text referring to the "racist practices of the occupying power" and "racial discrimination against the Palestinians". The Arab League is pressing for a similar condemnation.
Anything that singles out Israel in this way is rejected by the Americans as well as the Israelis. American Secretary of State Colin Powell is not going to Durban, mainly because what Washington calls offensive language about Israel.
There have been attempts to equate Zionism with racism
Britain's Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, says he is boycotting the conference in protest at draft texts that denigrate the Holocaust and spotlight Israel as guilty of crimes against humanity.
The European Union has not made its position clear, but British officials say the conference should avoid language on any subject that points the finger at a particular state.
Informal discussions are still going on. One way out, according to a Western official who did not want to be identified, might be to include a condemnation of both anti-Semitism and Islamaphobia - that would presumably satisfy nobody.
Slave reparations
The argument over slavery seems equally hard to resolve.
Everyone is happy to condemn it and the appalling suffering inflicted over the centuries on Africans in particular. But African governments and human rights campaigners want to go much further.
Powell has decided not to attend
They are demanding an apology for the historic injustice of the slave trade, which they say should be recognised as a crime against humanity. Some also want reparations - financial compensation - though this is more controversial.
The President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, says the idea is absurd and insulting to African people. The former Secretary-General of Amnesty International, Pierre San�, concedes that a cheque cannot compensate for spilled blood.
But Mr San� argues that if African countries are expected to honour financial debts accumulated by previous governments, then states which engaged in slavery should answer for acts committed by their predecessors.
Complex issue
The demands for compensation have probably been encouraged by the moves of recent years to pay reparations to victims of Nazi persecution and their families, even 50 years after the event.
But British officials said money should be allocated to help developing countries on the basis of need now, not on historical criteria related to slavery or other injustice. As for an apology, the officials asked who would sign up - every member of the United Nations?
They pointed to a comment by Colin Powell, the highest ranking American of black African descent ever to serve in a US government. "Would I get compensation for slavery," he asked, "or would I pay it?"
India is keen to keep its caste system out of the debate
The modern world is complex: the British Foreign Office Minister attending the conference, Valerie Amos, is another descendant of slaves.
The European Union as a whole, many of whose members are former colonial powers, is ready to accept a strongly worded condemnation of slavery, together with a statement of profound regret. But issuing a formal apology is more problematic.
Discrimination debate
Slavery and the Arab-Israeli conflict are not the only issues causing trouble. In fact, one human rights campaigner said many governments were going to the conference not with an agenda but with an anti-agenda - things that they wanted kept off the table.
India has worked hard to prevent conference documents referring specifically to discrimination on the grounds of caste, which condemns tens of millions of people to menial jobs and abuse in south Asia. The Indian Government says it is an internal matter and is trying to argue that the caste system has nothing to do with racism.
China is determined to stop its rule in Tibet being linked with racism. Gypsies singled out
And a number of countries in Europe with big Roma communities are not looking forward to discussion in Durban of intractable discrimination against gypsies and travellers, as they are still often called.
Mary Robinson has singled them out as a group whose plight has not had much attention at previous international conferences - along with asylum seekers, victims of traffickers and those of African descent in Latin America and the Caribbean.
She believes the Durban conference can bring racism into the open and "start a deeper conversation about it," in her phrase. But the visible face of the event is likely to be a week's wrangling over wording, the lowest common denominator of everyone's expectations.

Powell rises above his critics
Powell had George Bush's support in his stance on Iraq
By Jon Leyne
BBC correspondent in Washington
US Secretary of State Colin Powell has faced criticism from both left and right in recent months. But his quiet diplomacy on Iraq appears to be paying off, and silencing the doubters.
One of Colin Powell's golden rules is never to personalise policy. It is even listed as number 3 of 13 rules in his autobiography: "Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, you ego goes with it."
But even Mr Powell allowed himself a glimmer of a smile when the United Nations Security Council passed its resolution on Iraq unanimously last week. "O ye of little faith," was the gentle message.
Critics on both sides
And there have certainly been plenty of doubters of Mr Powell in the last few weeks, indeed throughout the 22 months he has been US Secretary of State. That last bastion of American liberalism, the New York Times, even chided him for not threatening to resign when he seemed not to be getting his way over the summer. Powell persuaded Bush to involve the UN in the campaign against Iraq
In fact Mr Powell joked at a recent dinner in New York about being criticised from both the left and the right. He said he had discussed it with President Bush in the Oval Office.
"I said, 'Mr President I don't know how to handle it. It's so hard. The New York Times wants me to quit, the Washington Times wants you to fire me'."
The Washington Times is as right wing as the New York Times is left wing.
"And he said, 'Colin, that's right where I want you to be.'" Presidential approval
The audience in New York liked that. But recently the secretary of state has been having the last laugh.
In fact the reason Mr Powell could be so jocular at such a critical moment is now becoming apparent. Because just at the moment he seemed to be losing the battle within this deeply divided administration, Colin Powell actually had the president on his side.
The right wingers are circling, waiting to make sure the UN does not go soft on Iraq According to sources in Washington, it was as early as 5 August that Mr Powell persuaded President Bush of the need to engage the UN in the campaign against Iraq. To the dismay of those accompanying the Secretary of State on a round the world trip, he cancelled a final stopover in Hawaii. What the journalists with him did not realise is that he had been summoned to a private dinner at the White House the following night. And despite just returning from such a gruelling trip, Mr Powell used that occasion to persuade Mr Bush of the merits of working with the UN.
Battles to come
It was not until last Friday that the benefits of that decision finally became apparent. The US has won international, and domestic, support for its policy on Iraq, without sacrificing any significant freedom of manoeuvre. The UN resolution says Saddam must comply with the weapons inspectors
But if there is one lesson in this administration, it is that ceasefire lines in the ideological battle do not hold for long. The right wingers, Vice-President Dick Cheney, Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz, are circling, waiting to make sure the UN does not go soft on Iraq. They could still be proved right. It could yet be that Saddam Hussein succeeds in subtly dividing a wedge between the members of the Security Council, delaying or perhaps even preventing the war the administration ideologues seem to yearn for. The next big test will be Iraq's declaration on 8 December. By that date, the Security Council has demanded that Saddam Hussein make a full inventory of his weapons of mass destruction. It is time to come clean. If he doesn't, the Americans could well move, straight away, to declare Iraq in material breach of its obligations - and that's a short step from war. But for the moment Colin Powell is in the ascendant. And that means that if and when the time comes for war, there will be one more round of coalition building, with the secretary of state at the head. Full coverage

Regions and territories: Aruba
A tourist magnet and a fuel exporter, Aruba is an autonomous territory of the Netherlands. It lies off South America's Caribbean coast. Away from the beaches, hotels and casinos, much of the island is desert-like. A strong indigenous heritage, colonisation and Latin America's influence have given it a distinctive social and linguistic character. Overview
Overview
Facts
Leaders
Media
Aruba is one of the most prosperous territories in the Caribbean. A gold rush in the 1820s triggered an economic boom and mining went on for almost a century until reserves were exhausted. In the 1920s a petroleum refinery was opened at the port of San Nicolaas. Tourism is Aruba's economic mainstay
The money generated by the refinery raised living standards, but its temporary closure in 1985 - amid a global petroleum glut - sparked an economic crisis. Aruba has since invested in tourism, which has become its economic mainstay. Lying close to the South American mainland, Aruba is susceptible to drug smuggling and illegal immigration. The territory has passed laws to combat money-laundering. Independence has been widely debated, and the idea was endorsed by voters in 1977. In 1986 Aruba pulled out of the Netherlands Antilles - a federation of Dutch Caribbean territories - and obtained separate status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Plans for full independence by 1996 were shelved at a meeting in The Hague in 1994. The Dutch government controls defence and foreign affairs and the island's government handles local matters. Colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century, Aruba was controlled by the British for a short time during the Napoleonic Wars. Facts

Awards honour interactive music
Robbie Williams was among the award winners
Robbie Williams and Westlife were among artists to win awards celebrating the best in interactive music.
Organisers of the Interactive Music Awards said 2003 saw the industry "wake up" to new ways of accessing music.
The awards celebrate the best use of interactivity in artist websites, online radio, downloads, interactive shows or use of mobile devices.
Other winners included U2 (Best Music DVD), Abs (Best Pop Artist) and Dizzee Rascal (Best Use of Mobile).
Ben Drury, head of music at BT, said 2003 had seen an "incredible momentum" build around music and interactive media.
"The launch of iTunes in the US, EMI's announcement that it would put almost its entire catalogue online and a re-launched, legal, Napster are just some of the highlights," he said.
Mobile phones have become the frontline for music fans, Mr Drury said.
Dizzee Rascal: Honoured for best use of mobile technology
Ring tones often outsell the singles they are taken from, mobile services can tell users the name of a song playing in the background, and the UK's first music download service for mobiles has recently been launched.
UK acts Hell is for Heroes and Robbie Williams were the first in the world to create interactive music videos.
Mr Drury added: "There's a lot of cynicism about the time it's taken the industry to wake up to new media but that doesn't change the fact that right now the UK music scene is leading the way when it comes to interactive music...".
The awards are now in their second year.

Fears remain over cancer-causing food
Chips and other staple food are under the spotlight
International experts have called for urgent research to examine whether staple foods like bread, chips and crisps cause cancer. The scientists were speaking at the end of a three-day emergency summit organised by the United Nations and World Health Organisation to examine claims that some food items include cancer-causing substances. It followed a study in Sweden which found high quantities of acrylamide in a wide variety of food. That finding was backed up by similar research in the UK and Norway. We need to do research quite urgently
Dieter Arnold, summit chairman
Acrylamide is known to cause cancer in animals and there are concerns that it could have the same effect in humans. At the end of the summit, which was closed to the public and the media, the scientists said it was still too soon to draw firm conclusions on the issue or to make recommendations on eating habits. Further research
The scientists called for an international network of laboratories to be set up to pool information from governments, regulatory authorities and industry on the possible risks. They also urged food manufacturers to carry out studies.
Dieter Arnold, of the German Federal
Institute for Health Protection of Consumers who chaired the meeting, said: "On the information we have at the moment, we cannot give consumers very specific advice such as to avoid eating chips of this or that brand." But he added: "We need to do research quite urgently in order to be able
to reduce the levels (of acrylamide) in food."
Jorgen Schlundt, the UN's food safety programme coordinator, said: "We know we get a lot of cancers from food, some of it might
come, or it is very likely that it does come, from acrylamide.
"If we can modify the ways we produce food, so that we get less
acrylamide, we will have less cases of cancer." Food scare
Researchers from Stockholm University and Sweden's National Food Administration found acrylamide was formed when carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes, rice or cereals were heated. The study said that an ordinary bag of crisps may contain up to 500 times more of the substance than the top level allowed in drinking water by the WHO. It also showed that the chemical is found in high carbohydrate foods like bread and potato products which are common in many people's diets. Tests on rats in Sweden showed that when deep fried potato and starchy foods cooked at high temperatures were fed to the animals, many of them developed cancer.
Acrylamide induces gene mutations and has been found in animal tests to cause benign and malignant stomach tumours. It is also known to cause damage to the central and peripheral nervous system. So far there is no proof that the foods would have the same harmful effects on humans. See also:

School Report: Help for teachers new to the project
Teachers offer colleagues advice on how to run a School Report News Day
Teachers from several schools that took part in School Report in previous years share their advice on how to deliver the project.
Why should I do School Report?
Which students should take part?
Which media should we choose?
What kind of news should we report?
How should we use the resources on the website?
How should we use our BBC mentor?
Who else should I involve?
How do we prepare for the News Day?
What do I do when things go wrong?
How can we maximise credit for our work?
WHY SHOULD I DO SCHOOL REPORT?
Improving English and ICT, developing citizenship and even stopping bullying were all among the reasons why schools have chosen to take part in School Report.
Learning about the skills of journalism has boosted literacy and confidence levels among the students
Teacher Vesna Klein
Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said his school chose to participate "because it was a chance to extend and enrich our media curriculum in a way that the students would also see as being relevant to the real world". He added: "Having the kudos of the BBC brand and support behind it made it a genuine work-experience type affair for the students, who actually got to do real journalism with a real concrete outcome. It wasn't just a dry classroom-based simulation." Teacher Lisa Plowman, from Longsands College in Cambridgeshire, said: "School Report has encouraged staff to use interactive whiteboards, of which some teachers were previously wary, and to download material, which they would not have otherwise done. "It has been really beneficial in terms of staff CPD (Continuing Professional Development)." Teacher Vesna Klein, from Brentside High School in Ealing, London, said that learning journalistic skills has helped many pupils boost their literacy and confidence levels, while Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "We are always looking for different ways to enrich the curriculum and this, with its basis in communication and writing skills, seemed ideal." Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "It built students' confidence and self-esteem, improved their communication skills and widened their horizons." Sherrill Townsend from Brentside High School said there was an "added benefit from School Report because of the whole issue of verbal bullying in our school". Pupils felt more confident in expressing their opinions Back to top
WHICH STUDENTS SHOULD TAKE PART?
School Report aims to involved students between the ages of 11-16.The BBC would like as many students as possible from each school to take part, but it is down to each school to run the project in whichever way suits them best. Many teachers, who have been involved for more than a year, choose to work with increasingly larger groups as they become increasingly familiar with the project. Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "A large number and range of students were involved. A handful came on the recommendation of the English department but others were selected because of the benefits it would give them."
We wanted to engage the middle band of students. The children loved working together and fed off each other
Teacher Annabel Gibbs
Teacher Annabel Gibbs, from Guildford County School in Surrey, said: "24 pupils took part. They were picked from four top and middle sets. "The students who took part in School Report were of mixed ability. We wanted to engage the middle band of students. "The mixture of pupils in the group worked really well. The children loved working together and fed off each other." Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said their group was "self-selecting". "All students in the year group were invited to apply to be part of the team," he said. "They had to submit a story idea and a list of potential interviewees and questions that covered all sides of the piece. The best, most original, interesting or thoroughly planned ones were picked." BBC journalist Nell Gordon, who mentored the students at William Howard School in Cumbria, said: "Students who wanted to be involved wrote to the teacher explaining why they would like to be given the opportunity to take part." Back to top
WHAT MEDIA SHOULD WE CHOOSE?
Schools taking part in School Report in the past have chosen to use a range of media. Many specialised in one area, several combined two media, while some made video, audio and text-based news reports.
We focused on TV news because it excites and captivates students
Teacher Alim Shaikh
Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "We chose online because of the technological restraints at the school. "Also, during the practice sessions for teachers, it became apparent that the recording or broadcasting equipment provided another layer of potential problems and got in the way of the real task at hand - originating and writing decent stories." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "We used radio: this was suggested by our BBC mentor whose particular area this is. "The children are used to writing newspaper articles but have not had the same exposure to radio bulletins. "They were all keen to be newsreaders and really loved going round the school recording vox pops with other pupils and members of staff. There is an immediacy about radio that is appealing to pupils." Ealing City Learning Centre manager Alim Shaikh said: "We focused on TV news because it excites and captivates students." Andy Wallis, a teacher at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire, said his school chose to make radio reports because they were working with BBC Radio Gloucestershire. He added: "We also felt that the equipment would be easier for students to deal with, allowing them to focus on the actual reporting." Students at Coombeshead College in Devon used four media: print, text-based web pages, video and audio. Teacher Sue White, said: "It was great for the students to see BBC news crews in action and to experience the real 'buzz' of live interviews." Back to top
WHO ELSE SHOULD I INVOLVE?
Across the UK, ICT staff, head teachers, City Learning Centres, nearby schools, parents and older pupils have helped teachers deliver School Report.Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "The school's technical support manager helped put the documents on the webpage on the News Day itself." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "I involved a small group of Year 9 pupils in writing the webpage, and a Year 10 pupil won the competition for composing the best jingle. "On the day, we had the benefit of the help of a parent/journalist - he was a great asset in helping pupils to edit their scripts as they tended to be too wordy." Rednock High School in Gloucestershire involved other members of staff including the Head of Year 8 and the Head of Student Support. Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "We involved technicians as well as teachers." The school also included the humanities team of teachers and some sixth formers. Back to top
HOW SHOULD WE USE THE RESOURCES ON THE WEBSITE?
A series of six printable lesson plans form the core resource on this website. Teachers taking part in School Report adapted the plans to suit their classes.
We chose to distill the six lesson plans on the website into a one-day workshop for a small group of students
Teacher Will Halsey
Sylvia Simmonds, at Elmfield School for Deaf Children in Bristol, said School Report can suit any child's needs. She encouraged her students to use mind maps and spider diagrams to plan their news topics and questions. Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "All students were given access to the lessons during our regular media unit teaching time." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "I used the lesson plans in a series of six after-school sessions in the lead up to News Day, allowing pupils to become familiar with the project and to hone their skills." Andy Wallis, a teacher at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire, said: "We ran after-school sessions on Wednesdays where we went through many of the resources and lesson plans." Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "English teachers used the lesson plans. The plans and the resources on the website were useful. Especially useful was the Huw Edwards DVD." Teacher Will Halsey, from Acton High School in Ealing, London, said: "We chose to distil the six lesson plans into a one-day workshop for a small group of students. They found, gathered and wrote their news scripts during the first half of the day and assembled, edited and delivered them in the afternoon." Additional resources can be accessed by through the Useful links
page on this site. Further resources can be found by typing "School Report" and a key word into the search engine in the top right corner of BBC News web pages. Back to top
HOW SHOULD WE USE THE BBC MENTOR?
The BBC will deploy journalists and other members of as many schools as possible. However, due to the number of participating schools, not every school can expect a mentor.Coombeshead College in Devon made use of their mentor during the run-up to a previous News Day. Teacher Sue White said: "They arranged a visit to a press conference with Torquay United and a trip to Royal Marine Base Chivenor.
Our BBC mentor was vital to the success of News Day
Teacher Annabel Gibbs
"They really related to the students and the students gained a great deal from working with real journalists." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "Our BBC mentor was vital to the success of News Day. "Her experience was invaluable and she gave everyone the confidence to produce some excellent work. She and I worked very closely together in the months leading up to the day which I think was an important factor in making it the success it was." Teacher Will Halsey, from Acton High School in Ealing, London, said: "In order to improve the relationship with the mentor, it is good to have some contact before they come into school. "A phone call, to run through the programme and to discuss what will be going on in the session is really useful." Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "Our mentor was a local radio engineer, who was very enthusiastic and had some expertise to share. "We used him to 'plug' the original application process during year group assemblies, and then as an 'expert' on hand to look at how the stories were shaping up in the weeks leading up to the News Day, and on the day itself." Andy Wallis at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire said: "The mentors initially talked to the students about their jobs and how radio news worked. They also helped us with equipment and on-the-day technical support. They were fantastic!" Back to top
HOW DO WE PREPARE FOR THE NEWS DAY?
Schools can held practice News Days or ran additional classes to help prepare for School Report News Day.Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "From January onwards, we had at least one 45-minute out-of-school-time session with the team every week. "We used the session to prepare the timeless stories to go on the website on the News Day and to learn how to set up guests and write the copy." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School said: "We did lots of planning and anticipating possible problems! It was important that everyone knew what their role was and was well-prepared. "We also had some recordings from our practice News Day which we knew we could use if need be." Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "We had visits from our mentors and held staff planning meetings. The students also had some lunchtime 'news conferences'." Back to top
WHAT KIND OF NEWS SHOULD WE REPORT?
Students and teachers chose school-based, local, national, international, sport, entertainment and other genres of news for their bulletins.
The students selected their own news from a mixture of current national and international news, from newspapers, TV and radio
Teacher Andy Wallis
Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said his students made school-based, local, national, international sport and weather reports; all with a local angle. Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School said: "We covered a mixture of school-based, local, national, international news and weather. One of the exciting aspects of the day was allowing pupils the freedom to choose their own stories and then hearing or seeing the same stories reported elsewhere." Andy Wallis, a teacher at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire, said: "The students selected their own news from a mixture of current national and international news, from newspapers, TV and radio. They also decided to include more local news with a focus on our new school build." BBC journalist Alex Robertson who worked with Shawlands Academy in Glasgow on a past News Day, said: "Students produced an explosive piece of original journalism about asylum seekers, featuring the experience of a pupil at the school. "It was amazing to see them researching a story from within the school about subject which is a huge issue in Scotland. "Their report was featured by BBC Scotland and Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, published an article about it on the School Report website after speaking to one of the students on the phone." Back to top
WHAT DO I DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONG?
No matter how well prepared you are, there are always unexpected problems. Here's some examples of what teachers who have taken part in School Report in the past found troublesome.
There were one or two minor technical hitches but they were resolved by students working with staff
Teacher Sue White
Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "The only real problems on the day were down to poor organisation and planning on behalf of the students. Sometimes they assumed that interviewees would be on hand and available to talk at their beck and call, and so some stories didn't get published because interviewing was left to the last minute." Andy Wallis, a teacher at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire, said parts of interviews were accidentally recorded over. Students also had problems with editing software. "We resolved most of these problems with compromise and ultimately, by doing it again," he said. Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "There were one or two minor technical hitches but they were resolved by students working with staff. "Our students worked from 7.15am to 7.30pm so were pretty tired at the end of the day, but a working breakfast of croissants, and lunchtime sandwiches and fruit, supplied by our canteen, kept them going and helped to stop tempers fraying!" Back to top
HOW CAN WE MAXIMISE CREDIT FOR OUR WORK?
Local papers, radio and television stations were some ways teachers promoted School Report. Others chose assemblies, displays and newsletters.Teacher Lisa Plowman, from Longsands College in Cambridgeshire, said: "We were keen that other students should be able to see what had gone on so we held an assembly during which we showed the students' work, accessing it via the link on the BBC website."
Park High Specialist Sports College in Birkenhead held an awards ceremony to congratulate pupils, who debated live on BBC Radio Liverpool
Robert Baldock, a teacher at the Reading School in Berkshire, said: "We had help in getting one of our stories on to Matthew Bannister's BBC Radio 5 live programme. "We did a live radio-car link up on the morning of the event, and then the programme did a follow-up piece the next week. Inside the school, there was a lot of publicity in assemblies, newsletters and emails, and a display of the work has been put up in the Learning Resource Centre. "Our School Report web page was accessible from the school's intranet home page and the external school website too." Annabel Gibbs, a teacher at Guildford County School, said: "I arranged for a photographer from the local paper to come in and we also had a plug on BBC Southern Counties Radio." Andy Wallis, a teacher at Rednock High School in Gloucestershire, said: "We had numerous local papers in during the day. Our mentor organised access to local radio." Sue White, a teacher at Coombeshead College in Devon, said: "We contacted all the local press which gave a big boost to the students involved and to the college as a whole." Back to top

Teacher training salaries extended
Teachers of construction courses could benefit
The paying of �6,000 "training salaries" to encourage students into teacher training is to be extended, as the government says the scheme is boosting recruitment.
The recruitment incentives are now to be paid to trainee teachers for vocational subjects in further education colleges, the Lifelong Learning Minister, Malcolm Wicks, has announced.
Mr Wicks said that there had been a 24% increase in applications for teaching courses since the training salary was offered and as such would now be made more widely available.
"It is vital that there is a larger pool of teachers in the further education sector as well," said Mr Wicks.
Teachers from industry
The training salary, part of the government's drive to tackle the teacher shortage, was first made available to postgraduate trainee teachers for secondary schools.
These were intended to encourage applications from would-be teachers who were reluctant to study for an extra year without an income and with increasing debt.
The salaries were later extended to postgraduate students training for primary schools and sixth-form and further education colleges.
The payments are now to be made available from September for full-time Certificate in Education students training to teach non-academic craft subjects.
"Training salaries in further education will boost the number of skilled teachers coming into our colleges. They will enable people with industrial or commercial experience and skills to draw a salary as they learn to become FE teachers," said Mr Wicks.

Erosion battle reaches High Court
Peter Boggis has compacted clay specially delivered
A retired engineer whose Suffolk home is under threat from coastal erosion has started a High Court battle for the right to protect it.
Natural England wants fossil-bearing cliffs near Southwold to be allowed to wear away, raising the prospect that homes could fall into the North Sea.
But Peter Boggis, 77, has installed his own defences near his Easton Bavents home and is fighting to maintain them.
He claims Natural England is acting beyond its powers and cannot stop him.
Natural England declared the area a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 2006, with the intention of preventing Mr Boggis from maintaining his sea defence barrier.
Mr Boggis has argued that Natural England has no legal right to stop him saving his home.
Compacted clay
Opening the two-day hearing, Gregory Jones, appearing for Mr Boggis, told Mr Justice Blair the purpose of SSSIs was normally to "conserve or preserve" flora, fauna or geological features.
But Natural England wanted to let the sea erode the Easton Bavents cliffs in order to expose the sediment and fossils so that they could be studied, he said.
Mr Jones argued that Natural England had no power to extend the scope of SSSIs "in order to study the destruction of the cliffs".
The intention of the law allowing SSSIs to be created or extended was "the preservation of physical features - not their destruction".
Mr Boggis's so-called "soft sea defences" consist of 250,000 tonnes of compacted clay soils he had specially delivered.
The controversial barrier has to be renewed as the sea washes it away.
Mr Jones told the judge: "These barriers do actually work and have had the effect of slowing the erosion of the cliffs."

Korea coach rues lack of quality
South Korea coach Dick Advocaat admitted his side lacked the quality to overcome Switzerland in their decisive 2-0 defeat in Hanover.
A Philippe Senderos header and Alex Frei's controversial late strike was enough to put the South Koreans out. But Advocaat said: "We deserved more in the second half but we were just not good enough in the end.
"We knew beforehand that on set pieces they would be dangerous and they were, they controlled the first half."
The Dutchman also felt aggreived at referee Horacio Elizondo who ignored his assistant's offside flag, allowing Frei to net Switzerland's second.
The second goal was nonsense
South Korea's Lee Chun-soo
He added: "Most of the decisions didn't go our way and some were not to our liking."
Lee Chun-soo echoed his manager's comments.
He said: "The second goal was nonsense. We played so hard today but still have so much to learn."
Advocaat also revealed that his decision to employ an attacking formation may have cost his side dear.
He said: "We started with four strikers, and at the international level, that's quite dangerous. "That allowed them to play how they did and they kept attacking on counters."

ATP approve seven-week Tour break from 2012
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Tennis set for extended off-season
The men's tennis calendar will be shortened by two weeks from 2012 giving the players a seven-week off-season.With events running from January to late November many players have argued for more rest time to prevent injury. "We've been trying for a few years to make clear that it's too short an off-season," Andy Murray told BBC Sport. "I hope this will make a difference." "There's a consensus that the players need a longer break," said ATP Tour chief Adam Helfant in a statement. The players claim that the current month-long break is not adequate, though the new schedule will not allow any break between the Paris Masters and ATP World Tour Finals, pushing back the start of the London event to a Monday. It also means qualifying for the 2012 London tournament, which will start on 5 November that year, could still be in the balance up until the Paris final the day before. "I'm happy to say that these new calendars and the expanded off season reflect the broad consensus among our members that the players, and really the sport as a whole, needed a longer break," said Helfant. "It didn't take long to find that consensus.
ANDY MURRAY COLUMN
With seven weeks you can take a break at the end of the year and that should help the longevity of everyone's careers
"Our players do not have adequate time to rest, work on their fitness and work on their game during our off season." The players have long argued that the current month-long break exposes players to injury and burnout. World number two Roger Federer backed the changes, saying: "I think it's good to have a longer off-season. I definitely think it's a step in the right direction. "But only time will tell. Will we have less or more injuries because the calendar is more packed? I don't know." The women's tour ended last month with their season-ending WTA Championships taking place in the final week of October. The Davis Cup, however, is still scheduled to be played after the ATP finals.
