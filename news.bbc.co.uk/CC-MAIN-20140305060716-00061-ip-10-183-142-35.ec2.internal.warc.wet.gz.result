US drone 'kills Filipino militant Abdul Basit Usman'
The US state department describes Mr Usman as a bomb-making expert A Filipino militant wanted by the US is believed to have been killed by an American drone aircraft near the Afghan border, Pakistani officials said.Abdul Basit Usman was reported killed on 14 January along with several others on the border of South and North Waziristan tribal regions, they said. The US state department has offered a $1m reward for information leading to the militant's capture. Authorities in Philippines said they were investigating the report. "If the reports are true then it is good news for us because the killing of Basit Usman means one less terrorist on the street," the AFP news agency quoted Lt-Gen Benjamin Dolorfino, military commander in south-western Philippines, as saying. But, he added: "We still have to verify the reports." 'Bomb expert'Mr Dolorfino said he was involved in many deadly bombings in the southern Philippines' Mindanao region, where Muslim insurgents have waged a decades-old separatist rebellion, the AFP reported. Correspondents say that if it is confirmed, the death of Abdul Basit Usman would represent a major success for the US authorities. The US state department describes him as a bomb-making expert with links to the Abu Sayyaf militant organisation in the Philippines. Basit is believed to have orchestrated several bombings that have killed, injured, and maimed many innocent civilians

It says he has links to Jemaah Islamiah, a South-east Asian Islamic extremist group linked to al-Qaeda. "US authorities consider Basit to be a threat to US and Filipino citizens and interests. Basit is believed to have orchestrated several bombings that have killed, injured, and maimed many innocent civilians," the state department website says. According to earlier report, the 14 January drone attack had targeted Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud. A Taliban spokesman said Mehsud had been in the area but left before the attack.

Girls 'born with fear of spiders'
Women's fear of spiders has now been linked to the behavioural traits of our hunter-gatherer ancestors
A new study in the US suggests that women have a genetic aversion to dangerous animals, such as spiders.The research, published in the New Scientist, says women are born with character traits that were ingrained in our hunter-gatherer ancestors. As child protectors, they have to shun animals that threaten them or their young off-spring, researchers said. Previous research suggested women were actually up to four times more likely to be afraid of creatures like spiders. The new research was headed up by developmental psychologist, Dr David Rakison, from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 10 baby girls, and 10 baby boys were subjected to a number of pictures of spiders to gauge their reactions. First the babies were shown a picture of a spider with a fearful human face, followed by images of a spider paired with a happy face - alongside an image of a flower twinned with a fearful face. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The results showed that the girls - some as young as 11 months old - looked longer at the picture of the happy face with a spider than the boys, who looked at both images for an equal time. The researchers concluded that the young girls were confused as to why someone would be happy to be twinned with a spider, and were quick to associate pictures of arachnids with fear. The boys, it seems, remained totally indifferent emotionally. 'Ancestral behaviour'Mr Rakison attributes this genetic predisposition to behavioural traits inherent in our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Men, he purports, were the greater natural risk takers, the ones who took greater risks were more successful when going out to hunt for food. With women, in their role as natural child protectors, it made sense for them to be more cautious of animals such as snakes or spiders, Mr Rakison adds. By contrast, the research concludes that modern phobias such as the fear of hospitals - or that of flying - show no differences between the sexes. Previous research has shown that almost 6% of people have a phobia of snakes, with nearly 4% scared of spiders. However, of that percentage, four times are likely to be women than men.

Irish 'need new EU treaty vote'
Mr Roche says the Irish people still see the EU project as "vital"
The Irish Republic may need to hold a second referendum on the EU's Lisbon Treaty, despite its rejection by voters in June, an Irish minister says.
Irish Europe Minister Dick Roche said that "because we've already had a referendum on this issue I think the people will have to be consulted".
He told the Irish broadcaster RTE that this was his "personal view".
The other 26 EU member states will probably all have ratified the reform treaty by Christmas, he said.
Previously Irish ministers have insisted it is too early to say how best to proceed with treaty ratification, following the No vote - by a margin of 7% - in the 12 June referendum.
Mr Roche said that before a possible second referendum "there's a lot of work to be done," in the RTE interview on Monday.
"The government is involved in detailed research to isolate the specific matters that were most sensitive in the minds of voters as we went to the polls on 12 June� those matters then have to be addressed," he said.
Last month Italy became the 23rd EU member state to approve the reform treaty, which is aimed at improving decision-making in the enlarged EU.
EU summit briefing
The Irish government will present a "position report" to an EU summit in October, Mr Roche said, which would not be a final roadmap.
"Towards the end of the year we'll have to decide what our timetable is," he added.
EU leaders signed up to the treaty but ratification has been slow "We cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people again," he said.
He argued that there was no appetite for renegotiating the treaty in Europe and that it was "the product of many years of hard work".
He said work must be done to "disengage Ireland" from Eurosceptics such as the UK Independence Party and others "who regard the European project as anathema".
The treaty has to be ratified by all 27 member states in order to take effect.
The treaty was originally meant to be in place in January 2009 - well ahead of the European Parliament elections in June 2009.
The Irish Republic was the only EU member state to hold a referendum on the treaty. The other countries that have not yet ratified it are the Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden.
Critics see the treaty as further evidence of a federalist, pro-integration agenda at work in the EU. They say the treaty is just a modified version of the EU constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005.

Iran press defiant on nuclear issue
Iran has said it is ready for "serious talks" with six world powers over its nuclear programme. The Iranian press has been debating the country's response to the package of incentives proposed by the UN Security Council's five permanent members plus Germany to suspend uranium enrichment.
One paper argues that US hostility towards Iran is not limited to the nuclear programme. Another urges Iran to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). RESALAT [conservative]
In its response, Iran has left all the doors open for talks. If the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and the Security Council do not want to step through these doors, that is their problem... When [supreme leader] Ayatollah Khamenei said that Iran will continue its course with strength on the nuclear energy issue, he was in fact speaking on behalf of 70 million Iranians.
KEYHAN [hardline; pro-Khamenei]
The past three years' experience has not left the slightest doubt that America and its allies are trying to use extortion against Iran to deprive our country of peaceful nuclear technology. The only option is to withdraw from the effectively annulled NPT and to end this ridiculous game.
IRAN DAILY [English-language; conservative]
The duration of suspending uranium enrichment is an important consideration. If this duration had been specified in the package, then it could have positively influenced the decision of expert committees.
HAMBASTEGI [reformist]
It would seem that eliminating the suspension precondition for starting the talks in exchange for accepting to discuss suspension in the talks can prove helpful and create a new opportunity. This would also rob America of a pretext for seeking to make up for its defeat in Lebanon.
HAMSHAHRI [conservative]
Some people may say that the resolution of this problem and preventing the fulfilment of America's fierce threats can be realised through the acceptance of suspension. The answer to this suspicion is clear. Tehran earlier succumbed to voluntary acceptance [of the suspension of its nuclear activities] for two and a half years with the aim of neutralising any pretexts, but what did it gain and how was it rewarded for this confidence-building?
AL-VEFAGH [Arabic-language; published by IRNA news agency]
The Iranian answer, which is based on legal and technical studies, is positive. American hostility [towards Iran] goes far beyond the nuclear issue.
KARGOZARAN [reformist]
If Iran and the West arrive at the impression that the other side is not prepared to show any flexibility, the technical and political tug-of-war over the Iranian nuclear issue will turn into a tug-of-war over pride... then everyone loses control over the situation.

Andhra Pradesh chief takes office
Mr Reddy has yet to finalise his line up of state ministers
The new chief minister of India's Andhra Pradesh state, YS Rajashekhar Reddy, has been sworn into office in the state capital, Hyderabad.
Mr Reddy, of the Congress party, crushed the incumbent Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam.
Mr Reddy immediately announced he would grant free electricity to small farmers and poor families.
His state election victory, declared on Tuesday, was echoed in a massive swing to Congress in the general election.
'People friendly'
An estimated 30,000 supporters came from all over the state to witness Mr Reddy take the oath of office at the sprawling Lal Bahadur stadium.
For people who could not make it inside the stadium, organisers installed giant screens outside.
Chandrababu Naidu, a BJP ally, was regarded as an IT guru
The BBC's Omer Farooq in Hyderabad says the oath was taken at exactly 1339 local time (0909 GMT) - an auspicious time directed by astrologers.
Mr Reddy took the oath alone as his ministers cannot be finalised until the central Congress leadership decides its post-election strategy.
Mr Reddy immediately ordered free electricity for small farmers and families below the poverty line - a pledge other politicians in the past have made but failed to implement because of a lack of funding.
Mr Reddy said all his policies would have "a people-friendly orientation".
Mr Naidu, an ally of the outgoing Bharatiya Janata Party, was regarded as an IT guru who turned Hyderabad into a cyber centre.
But Congress concentrated on the poor farming community, for whom droughts and subsequent debts have sparked hundreds of suicides.

AOL wins instant messaging case
AOL has added new patent to its armoury
AOL has been granted a patent on instant messaging systems which means it could potentially sue rivals Microsoft and Yahoo.
Instant messaging has become a popular way of chatting online, allowing internet users' instant communication with their friends and colleagues.
AOL originally filed the patent for the technology, invented by its subsidiary company ICQ, in 1997.
The patent covers anything resembling a network that lets multiple instant messaging (IM) users see when other people are present and then communicate with them.
Legal action unlikely
AOL is not proven to be the type of company that fights its battles using patent litigation
Dylan Brooks, Jupiter Research
The fact it has been granted means that rivals with similar systems, most notably Microsoft and Yahoo, are potentially infringing the patent.
An AOL spokesman did not rule out the possibility of legal action in the future but said there were no immediate plans.
"We have no plans at this stage about what we will do with it. We have hundreds of patents," he said.
Jupiter Research analyst Dylan Brooks said it unlikely that AOL will take the IM battle for market share to court.
"AOL is not proven to be the type of company that fights its battles using patent litigation," he said.
"They could have stopped the march of Internet Explorer with Netscape patents but chose not to," he added.
Bitter rivalry
Instant messaging is a lucrative market, with 200 billion messages sent globally each month - 63 billion of these come from AOL software.
Both Yahoo and Microsoft have gained market share in recent years and there is also a greater demand for secure instant messaging service for businesses.
Interestingly the original inventor of IM, ICQ, has fallen off the map in terms of usage, largely due to the fact it does not have the distribution power of Microsoft and Yahoo.
There has been a bitter row between AOL and its rivals over opening up the systems so that they can all work together.
It is in this area that Mr Brooks can see AOL using its new-found patent power.
"It could come into play as part of ongoing efforts to prevent interoperability," he said.
New standards are expected to be worked out to allow people to send and receive IMs from and to their mobile phones.

UK troops in Afghanistan to come under US command
By Jonathan Beale
BBC defence correspondent
Most UK troops on Afghan operations are based in Helmand province
UK troops in Helmand are to come under the command of a US general as part of a major restructuring of Nato forces in Afghanistan due to be announced.UK forces currently take their orders from British Major General Nick Carter, in charge of operations in the south. But the region is to be split in two to make it more manageable. Gen Carter will oversee Kandahar and a US major general will command forces in Helmand. Most UK troops on Afghan operations are based in Helmand province. An announcement on the changes is expected within days. With the recent influx of American forces, there are now too many troops in too large a geographical area for just one command, making it unwieldy. Under the plans agreed between Nato members, Regional Command (RC) South will be divided into RC South-West and RC South (East). The new RC South-West will take in Helmand where both UK and US forces have been involved in Operation Moshtarak, which aims to clear Taliban forces from Marjah and Nad Ali, in Helmand. Kandahar focusBritish Forces say they have made significant progress in Nad Ali over the past few months. That progress has been measured by fewer attacks from insurgents, and greater participation by locals in governing the region. US Marines in Southern Helmand have also moved into Marjah - though they are still meeting resistance. Perhaps the surprise is that a British general will be in command of operations being conducted by US and Canadian troops, while an American general will take charge of British forces
But the next big military objective is focused on Kandahar - in the new RC South (East). Kandahar has become the insurgents' stronghold, which is another reason to split the regional command. Nato says what happens in Kandahar over the coming months will be of critical significance to Afghanistan's future. Kandahar's problems are more acute - there is little governance, but plenty of corruption and crime. The immediate task for US troops, alongside Canadian forces, is to bring order to one of Afghanistan's most lawless provinces. Perhaps the surprise is that a British general will be in command of operations being conducted by US and Canadian troops, while an American general will take charge of British forces. While Gen Carter will continue to oversee operations in Kandahar, he will hand over control of Helmand to a US Marine - expected to be Maj Gen Richard Mills. For British troops the move will mean relatively little, for the moment. UK forces will remain in their current area of operation in Central Helmand, while all that changes is the man at the top. Canadian exit planSome may interpret the move as the Americans taking over a so-called British sector - and the UK Ministry of Defence will be very anxious to avoid any headlines that suggest the Americans are having to bail out the British. But Professor Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank, said the split makes military and administrative sense. He noted that in many ways the bigger deal was that the Americans were willing for a British general to oversee their forces in Kandahar. But the move may signal bigger, and more significant changes ahead. There has been a debate among Nato commanders as to whether British troops should move to Kandahar when the Canadians leave. Canada has said it is pulling out its troops for good in the summer of 2011. Transferring British forces from Helmand to Kandahar would prove more controversial - a much tougher decision than changing the line of command. It raises the emotive question of sacrifice and cost - why would British troops hand over Helmand to the Americans when they have expended so much blood and treasure? In a recent interview on BBC Radio 4 the new Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, said that Nato countries should not be "precious" about where their forces are deployed. It was more important, he said, to ensure a nation's forces were placed where they would have the greatest effect. Gen Stanley McChrystal, the head of Isaf forces, has also said he is "nation-blind". But there are questions over whether that would be the view of the British soldiers and their families who have already sacrificed so much in the province.

Profile: Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob
Ms Yaqoob became politically active after 11 September 2001
Salma Yaqoob is leader of the anti-war Respect party and has been a councillor in Birmingham since 2006.She has witnessed a turbulent split in her party, which nonetheless still boasts the affiliation of MP George Galloway. The mother of three young children has become a familiar figure in the press and on TV commenting on issues surrounding multiculturalism and speaking out against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Described by the Birmingham Post as a "doughty fighter for Birmingham inner city communities", she is preparing to fight her first general election as leader. 'Traditional conservatism'Ms Yaqoob's parents emigrated to the UK from Pakistan in the 1960s, and her father worked in a mill before joining the Royal Mail. Born in 1971, at university she studied biochemistry and psychology and she met her husband, Aqil, at the age of 24.
We united people around a progressive message of anti-racism and social justice
Salma Yaqoob
Working part-time as a psychotherapist, she become politically active two weeks after the attacks on New York on 11 September 2001, when a man spat at her in the street. She became active in the anti-war movement and joined Respect. She would later postpone a PhD so she could devote more time to her political career and her extended family. In the 2005 general election she stood for Respect in Birmingham Sparkbrook & Small Heath, earning 10,498 votes and beating the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives to second place. A year later she won a seat on Birmingham City Council and received the Asian Jewel Award for Public Service Excellence. Writing in the Guardian, she said her election victory "challenged the traditional conservatism that denies leading public positions to women, and challenged the old order, which treats our communities as silent voting fodder". She added: "And it was only possible because we united people around a progressive message of anti-racism and social justice." Between 2004 and 2007 Respect enjoyed a degree of success, picking up councillors in local elections in Newham and Tower Hamlets as well as Birmingham. In 2005 the party was bolstered by the election of Mr Galloway as MP for the east London seat of Bethnal Green and Bow. But it was - in the best tradition of left-wing parties - to suffer a damaging split. One faction - centred around the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) - said it wanted to stay true to Respect's left-wing roots. The other half - to which Ms Yaqoob and Mr Galloway stayed loyal - said it did not want to see the party to be controlled so much by the demands of the SWP. The SWP faction left, taking with it many of the party's activists. Ms Yaqoob leads the surviving Respect party, which was left with six councillors on Tower Hamlets council, three councillors in the London Borough of Newham and three councillors on Birmingham City Council. As well as her work with the anti-war movement, she is an active pro-Palestinian campaigner. In 2009 she called on Birmingham Council to boycott Israeli goods in response to its actions in Gaza. She has spoken out against a proposal by the UK Independence Party to ban the burka, arguing that there was a need to protect "freedom of speech, freedom of worship". Ms Yaqoob said she had received death threats after speaking out against a demonstration by the English Defence League in Birmingham.

Tories' crackdown on MP's father
Peter Davies believes the Welsh assembly should be abolished
Conservatives are trying to remove the father of an AM and MP from a list of assembly election candidates - after he called for the body to be scrapped.
Tory assembly leader Nick Bourne has asked officials to block Peter Davies as a candidate after he publicly advocated abolishing the assembly.
Mr Davies is a Newport councillor and father of Monmouth MP/AM David Davies. Tory policy is to support the assembly but its manifesto for the 2005 election pledged to offer a chance to scrap it.
Peter Davies said in a letter to the Western Mail: "Since only 24.7% of the Welsh people voted for an assembly and now after eight years we know that it doesn't work, the best way to save money would be to abolish the assembly and all its members!" Mr Bourne said Mr Davies's letter "hadn't gone unnoticed" and that Welsh party's chairman Lyndon Jones and director, Matthew Lane have been asked to remove him from the list "urgently". David Davies said his father has a right to his opinion
Mr Davies is on the approved list of candidates but has yet to be selected for a particular seat or region.
He wrote that abolition would save money and "give us better government in Wales including reduced hospital waiting lists, a higher standard of education, and local government without interference from the Welsh Assembly Government. "The abolition of the national assembly would also have the additional advantage of preventing Britain being broken up into regions by the European Union so that the commissioners in Brussels can run our country in their undemocratic, inefficient, self-serving fashion," he added.
David Davies said his father had a right to his opinion and that plenty of politicians stand for or are elected to serve in institutions with which they disagree. He said they see their role as holding that institution to account, despite wanting to abolish its legislative power over the region or country they represent. The Welsh Tories are now "looking at the letter and checking the rules". They admit that Peter Davies would have the right to a legal challenge if he is removed from the approved list of candidates.

Drug habits see a 'major shift'
By Jim Reed & Izzy Fairbairn
Newsbeat reporters Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Youth drug treatment hits record
A record number of young people were treated for a drugs and alcohol problem last year.Counsellors in England alone saw 52,294 people aged 13-24, a rise of 12% in two years, according to data from the National Treatment Agency (NTA). There's been a sharp drop in those addicted to 'hard' drugs like heroin. Instead under-25s are now more likely to have a problem with a cocktail of 'party' drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy, often mixed with alcohol. Campaigners say treatment services aimed at young adults need to change quickly to deal with what some are calling the biggest shift in drug habits in a generation. 'Taken it all'Newsbeat went to a drug treatment scheme in Stockport to speak to 24-year-old Steve, not his real name, from Liverpool. "It first started when I was 15," he said. Steve started mixing illegal drugs with alcohol while at school "Cannabis led to whizz, Es, pills and coke. Alcohol and drugs were a major part of my life for five years. "When you're young you hate to be the one left out and most my friends at school were alcohol and drug users. "I was taking whatever I could get my hands on and mixing them with alcohol. We would come back at one or two in the morning every night and my mum and dad would be fuming." Have your say: Is drug use in the UK changing?
Treatment risesOfficials from the NTA say the overall rise in treatment over the last three years does not necessarily mean a record number of young people are abusing drugs and alcohol. They claim at least part of the increase can be explained by the growth in treatment services. Young people picked up by the police are also more likely to be drug tested and referred to a treatment centre. But the figures do show a major change in the kind of drugs young people are getting treated for. Counsellors are seeing a dramatic shift away from heroin and crack use, the two 'problem drugs' typically linked to serious abuse. 18,597 people aged 13-24 were treated for an addiction to those two drugs last year, down 19% in just two years.

At the same time, more young people are having a problem with booze mixed with 'softer' party drugs, a phenomenon nicknamed ACCE (pronounced 'ace') by drug workers, short for Alcohol plus Cocaine, Cannabis and Ecstasy. The number of under-25s getting treatment for one or more of those drugs has gone up 44% from 21,744 in 2005/6 to 31,401 in 2007/8. "Alcohol is cheaper and more available, cannabis is far stronger, cocaine is half the price it used to be and you can get half a dozen ecstasy tablets for £10," according to Howard Parker, Professor Emeritus at Manchester University, who coined the term 'ACCE' last year. "Put those three together and you've got just as serious a problem for health, family life and society as heroin." Work carried out by Parker and researchers at Liverpool John Moores University shows the average age of a heroin user in treatment in North West England has risen to 36. The average age of someone with an ACCE problem is just 22. Alcohol is cheaper... cannabis is far stronger... you can get half a dozen ecstasy tablets for £10
Professor Howard Parker
But while youth services aimed at under-18s can be effective at dealing with an ACCE-type problem, when users hit their 18th birthday they are often forced to switch to an adult-only drug treatment service. "Those [adult] services are there to deal with heroin and crack users," said Parker. "The real issue is why there are hardly any services for ACCErs when they get to 18. It's just pot luck; it's a postcode lottery." Adult drug projects are paid twice as much for treating a heroin and crack user as someone with a powder cocaine or ecstasy problem. As a result, those services tend to focus on medical treatment like methadone replacement, a drug used to wean heroin users off their addiction. But there are no 'replacement' drugs to treat a cocaine or cannabis problem. Instead months or even years of therapy and support are needed to get users to manage their drug problem and eventually quit. Alcohol plus drugsThe man in charge of young people's drug policy for the National Treatment Agency, Tom Aldridge, told Newsbeat that adult services focus on heroin and crack users for a reason. "There are very clear links between acquisitive crime and problematic [heroin and crack] drug use," he said. Adult treatment services mainly focus on hard drugs
"We want to prioritise those drugs because they have more of an impact on society in terms of criminal activity and public health. "But we are very clear that people should be given a service depending on their need, not depending on their age. "If you have a 20 or 21-year-old that requires treatment best given by an under-18 service then they should go to that service." All under-18 services in England combine alcohol and drug treatment so young people can get detox and therapy for both problems at the same time. But almost all adult services split alcohol and drugs into two completely separate programmes in different locations with different counsellors and critics say that can often mean young people drop out. Tom Aldridge accepts that there may be an argument for combining alcohol and drug treatment for over-18s in England, as they have recently decided to do in Northern Ireland. "We have no responsibility for the alcohol agenda," he said. "If that were the case, there may well be lots in advantages in that. But it's not the case at the moment." The Stockport solutionBut in some parts of the country a handful of treatment services are already changing the way they work to deal with the ACCE phenomenon. Heidi Shaw says the Mosaic centre has altered its approach Newsbeat went to see a council-run drug scheme for young people in Stockport that has increased the age range of its patients from 18 all the way up to 25. Heidi Shaw, who runs the centre called Mosaic, said that decision was a direct result of seeing more young people with recreational drug problems come through the doors. "We knew those young people would not get help elsewhere," she said. "Their lives are still being devastated by drugs. They are still having problems with crime, housing, training and employment. "The same profile of substance misuse is coming through. It's cannabis, alcohol and then cocaine." Mosaic also runs a service to support parents and family members of people in treatment and carries out drug prevention work in Stockport's 14 schools. Steve has been getting treatment for his alcohol and drug problems there for four years. My life's changed because I'm off alcohol completely and I'm working on the drugs
Steve, recovering drug user
"I feel more comfortable because they seem to understand more about you," he said. "They contact you virtually every day to see how you are doing. "I went through detox. They put you in a dry house for a week and give you medication to counteract the effects of alcohol and the cravings. "Since then I've not touched a drop and I've got Mosaic to thank for that. "My life's changed because I'm off alcohol completely and I'm working on the drugs. Hopefully this time next year, I will be off them as well."

Dalglish respects Ferguson's managerial record
Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish said Sunday's Premier League match against fierce rivals Manchester United is the "highest category of game you can get".The teams have won 18 league titles each, although in recent seasons the Anfield outfit have been unable to match United's trophy haul. "Everybody plays football to play at the highest level they possibly can," said Dalglish. "Anybody that's playing football would love to play in these games." Dalglish is in his second stint as Reds boss after taking over the reins when Roy Hodgson was sacked earlier this season - and the Scot's first game back in charge was the 1-0 FA Cup third round defeat at Old Trafford. The 60-year-old said he did not have much time to prepare for that game in January, having stepped off a long-haul flight only 24 hours before the day of the fixture.

"I never had any time [ahead of the FA Cup meeting]. I was in transit but the lads had been well prepared here," continued Dalglish, whose team are sixth in the table but 21 points behind United. "But obviously that went out the window a little bit in the first minute when they got a penalty and Steven [Gerrard] got sent off. "You can prepare as much as you want but you can't prepare for things like that." Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said he will not allow his side's recent 2-1 defeat against Chelsea to dwell on the mind of his players. United remain four points clear of Arsenal but have played a game more - and the Gunners can close the gap when they play Sunderland on Saturday. "You remind the players of their responsibilities, that's all part of the process," said Ferguson. "We can't let a defeat pass without reacting ourselves as staff. That's not our style. "The players have to understand that we suffer as much as they do. It's our job too, we've all prepared hard for the games, put in a lot of time and effort into preparing for matches. "That happens for every game. It's not just Manchester City, Liverpool or Chelsea - we did the same for Crawley. All the video analysis, the coaching, the medical staff - regardless of the result the staff give every effort to their jobs. "So it's part of the entire club to be geared to win. That helps at this stage of the season."

Villeneuve thinks he is on his way out of F1
Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve says it is "strange" he is unlikely to get an F1 drive next year.
The 35-year-old 1997 champion, who drives for BMW Sauber, is enjoying his best season in years after a disappointing time with BAR.
"Being quicker than my team-mate now, having won the world championship and raced for pole positions, seems to be a negative to get a contract," he said.
BMW look set to pair Nick Heidfeld with test driver Robert Kubica next season.
Heidfeld, 29, is under contract with the German manufacturer until the end of 2007.
Kubica, a 21-year-old Pole, has starred in free practice sessions this year, although he blotted his copybook with a heavy crash during Monaco practice on Thursday.
Villeneuve currently lies 13th in the drivers' world championship with six points.
When asked if he wanted to stay in Formula One next year he said: "Yes, but who with? Right now (I have) no idea.
"It's going well here (at BMW), but no one has yet told me that this means they would like to keep me for next year. It would be a shame if it did not carry on."
Villeneuve ruled out a return to North America - where he won the Indycar title and Indy 500 in 1995 - and said he will not race full-time when he is finishes in F1 .
He also hinted that one-off endurance races, like the Le Mans 24 hours in France, appealed to him.
"After F1, if you want to do something different, it has to be something other than open wheel racing," he said.
"It's (F1) above the rest by a big margin. I live in Europe now. I can't imagine moving back to America.
"As for Le Mans, why not? But that's only one race a year. It wouldn't be a career. If I did it, it would be for fun."
