Letter From America UK UK Politics Business Sci/Tech Health Education Entertainment Talking Point In Depth AudioVideo The BBC's Dominic Hughes"Mr Kalejs has always denied involvement in wartime atrocities" real 56k Tuesday, 29 May, 2001, 21:30 GMT 22:30 UK
Nazi suspect can be extradited
Kalejs has attended court in a wheelchair
An Australian court has ruled that 87-year-old Konrad Kalejs can be extradited to Latvia where he is wanted on charges of war crimes and genocide. I am satisfied that Konrad Alfreds Kalejs is eligible for
surrender to the Republic of Latvia in relation to the offences
for which extradition is sought
Melbourne magistrate Lisa Hannan
The charges against Mr Kalejs relate to his role as a commander at the Salapils labour camp near Riga in 1942-43.
His lawyers immediately issued a statement saying they were appealing against what they called the "inhumane
and unjust" ruling.
The decision has been welcomed by both officials and Jewish groups in Latvia.
"The Australian court ruling is a positive thing as it
should provide the opportunity to prosecute and investigate all circumstances linked to charges brought against Konrads Kalejs," Prosecutor General Janis Maizitis was quoted as saying.
Granted bail
Earlier, Mr Kalejs was granted bail and released after two hours in custody. Kalejs would be the first person prosecuted for Nazi war crimes in Latvia
He was ordered to remain at a Latvian nursing home in Melbourne, surrender his passport and not travel to any points from which he might leave Australia.
His lawyers said their client had dementia and prostate cancer, was blind and nearly deaf, and could not follow proceedings nor remember the past. "It is therefore impossible for him to get a fair trial," the statement said. But Grigory Krupnikov, chairman of the Riga Jewish Community, said claims by Mr Kalejs' lawyers that he was too sick to stand trial should not be considered during his appeal. "Age and health should not be a reason not to stand trial when we're talking about genocide and war crimes," he said.
Mr Kalejs fled Britain last year to avoid deportation to Latvia. He had earlier been deported from Canada and the United States for lying about his wartime past. Wheelchair
Mr Kalejs, who became an Australian citizen in 1957, denies any involvement in the alleged crimes. He attended Tuesday's hearing at a Melbourne court in a wheelchair, accompanied by a nurse, but his wife, who had been present at earlier hearings, was not with him. Kalejs' journey
1950: Arrives in Australia
1957: Australian citizenship 1994: Deported from US
1997: Forced from Canada
2000: Flees Britain
2001: Extradited to Latvia?
Prosecutors say that while Mr Kalejs was at the Salapils camp, thousands of Jews and other prisoners were shot, tortured and humiliated.
His defence team had argued that the Latvian and Australian authorities have not followed the correct procedures for extradition. The Melbourne magistrate was not required to judge Mr Kalejs' guilt or innocence, but only assess whether his alleged actions would constitute crimes under Australian law at the time the extradition request was received last December. Mr Kalejs arrived in Australia at the start of 2000, after being tracked down to the Catthorpe Manor retirement home in Leicestershire by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, which hunts perpetrators of the Holocaust.

Idol rule change draws criticism
The show has spawned successful careers for lots of contestants
Critics are dismayed by a rule change introduced to hit talent show American Idol, which gives judges the power to save an act from public elimination.
Some TV insiders have called the move, which can be performed just once during the series and must be agreed by all four judges, "un-American".
The show, now in its seventh year, is the most popular programme in the US.
Pioneered by Simon Fuller, the show has launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Jennifer Hudson.
Traditionally, contestants have been selected or eliminated by public vote alone.
The 'Judges Save', announced earlier this week, is seen as a radical departure from the successful viewer-driven format of previous years.
"To the extent that Idol sells itself as an exercise in democracy, in which you choose your next pop star, it needs to be pure," wrote James Poniewozik of Time.com.
Ratings dip
Producers said the rule change was intended to avoid situations such as the early departure of contestant Jennifer Hudson, who went on win the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in the film of the musical Dreamgirls.
Ratings for the current eighth series have dipped, despite a host of changes to the format, announced in December.
They included the reintroduction of "wild card" finalists - handpicked by the judges - and a fourth judge, singer-songwriter Kara Dioguardi.
Dioguardi joined regular judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.
Ratings for Idol are down about nine percent at the midway point, compared to last year - with an average of 24-25 million viewers compared to 28.1 million.

Emigres discuss 'change' in Baghdad
Saddam's recent overtures have been dismissed as a ploy
By Kim Ghattas
BBC correspondent in Baghdad
A group of Iraqi opposition figures is in Iraq for talks with the government about the possibility of change and a new constitution. Saddam's son Qusay (R) rumoured to be planning an inclusive government
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1979. But members of the little-known Iraqi National Alliance are now in Baghdad - the first dissidents to respond to a call by the Iraqi president for exiles to return. The opposition figures have met Iraq's number two, Ezzat Ibrahim, and are hoping to meet with President Saddam. 'Promise for change' Abdul Jabbar el-Qubaysi, chairman of the group, said they had been promised that a new constitution would be drawn and that new political parties would be allowed as well as independent newspapers. Mr el-Qubaysi fled Iraq in 1976. His two brothers were executed in the early 1980s. He said he was not afraid to return because he believed the government's promise for real change. There have been rumours that the Iraqi president's son, Qusay, was planning to form a new government that would include independent and opposition figures. But Mr el-Qubaysi said he and his colleagues would not agree to participate in any government and would remain in the opposition. Saddam Hussein's recent political overtures have been denounced abroad as a ploy. Iraqi dissidents say the Iraqi leadership is trying to enlist support from opposition figures in exile.
The opposition figures now in Baghdad have maintained some ties with the Iraqi regime over the years and would therefore be willing to return to Iraq and show support for the Iraqi president at this crucial time.

Cross-border split on police pay
Officers in Scotland will have their pay deal backdated Scotland's 16,500 police officers will receive a larger pay rise than their colleagues in England and Wales.
It is the first time that officers on different sides of the border have received a different pay settlement.
The Scottish Government has agreed to backdate the 2.5% rise to 1 September, as recommended by the Police Arbitration Tribunal.
However, the Home Office said it would implement the award for officers south of the border from 1 December.
Scotland's justice secretary said the government was "duty bound" to deliver the deal which had been reached.
Kenny MacAskill told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "All these monies have been accounted for and are within the budget.
I have a responsibility to ensure pay settlements are affordable and consistent with government pay policy
Jacqui SmithHome Secretary
"It appears to us that if an award is made, if that is what arbitration feels our police officers are entitled to, it is duty bound upon a government who signed up for arbitration to deliver the outcome in the terms of the arbitrated deal."
UK Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she had considered the Police Arbitration Tribunal recommendations "very carefully".
"I am accepting their recommendation for a 2.5% increase to the pay of police officers," she said.
"However, I also have a responsibility to ensure pay settlements are affordable and consistent with government pay policy, including the maintenance of low inflation.
"I have therefore decided that the award should be implemented on 1 December, rather than 1 September."
Arbitration scheme
The Police Federation of England and Wales claimed that implementing the award from that date would result in a below-inflation pay rise of 1.9%.
Mr MacAskill agreed with that estimate but would not comment on what may be happening south of the border.
"It's for the UK Government to settle with their police officers and the Scottish Government to settle with our police officers," he said.
"All I'm saying is that we believe when you enter into an arbitration scheme, if it comes out with something then unless there's good reason you should implement it."
What it has done is restore a bit of trust and faith in the negotiating process here in Scotland that doesn't exist elsewhere in the UK
Joe GrantScottish Police Federation
Joe Grant, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, welcomed the Scottish Government's decision.
He said it would not make a huge difference to the Scottish Government's efforts to increase officer retention.
However, he added: "What it has done is restore a bit of trust and faith in the negotiating process here in Scotland that doesn't exist elsewhere in the UK."
He hoped the decision would help his colleagues in England and Wales in their efforts to have the same "sense of justice" applied south of the border.
Earlier this year, nurses in Scotland were granted their pay rise in full.
That too was ahead of colleagues south of the border, who received their pay rises in stages.
