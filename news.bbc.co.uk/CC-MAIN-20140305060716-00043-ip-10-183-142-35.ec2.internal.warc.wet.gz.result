France watches Chad-Sudan border
French military aircraft have been patrolling the Chad-Sudan border to ensure there has been no interference in the fighting around N'Djamena.
France's defence minister said it wanted to monitor "any self-styled foreign intervention" in the fighting between Chad's government and rebels.
The government has accused Sudan of giving the rebel groups rear bases in Darfur, a charge which Khartoum denies.
Thousands have fled N'Djamena since the rebels launched an assault on Saturday.
Up to 20,000 people have crossed the river border with Cameroon in the past four days and arrived in the town of Kousseri, placing heavy strain on essential supplies and accommodation, the UN refugee agency has said.
[The rebels] don't exist any more - with whom would we sign a ceasefire?... We've got them under control
Delwa Kassire CoumakoyeChadian Prime Minister
More than 3,000 other refugees have fled to Nigeria.
Earlier, the leader of the main UFDD rebel group said it was prepared to have a ceasefire in return for the promise of negotiations with the government, but the government dismissed the offer, saying it had already beaten the rebels. A mediation mission from Libya and Congo-Brazzaville, appointed by the African Union with a brief to meet both sides, is due to arrive soon in the Chadian capital.
Reconnaissance
Speaking about the role of his country's 1,400 troops based in Chad, French Defence Minister Herve Morin stressed that the UN declaration on Monday calling on all countries to support the government had not changed the terms of engagement. "What it does do is give international community support to the actions of France," he told Radio France Internationale. "It is also support for [President] Idriss Deby."
What we might well find out in the days ahead is just what the involvement of the Sudanese actually is
Herve MorinFrench Defence Minister
French diplomatic tight-rope
"It is international community support for the integrity of Chad and support for the actions of France, actions that we've been carrying out for several days."
Mr Morin said that France did have a military agreement with Chad which provides for logistical, medical and training support, but "in no way is it a defence agreement... that would oblige France to intervene to protect the sovereignty of the country involved".
The French military could intervene if it was authorised to do so by a UN resolution, he added.
However, Mr Morin admitted that French fighter jets and reconnaissance planes had been flying over the border with Sudan over the past 36 hours in line with a request from President Nicolas Sarkozy to ensure there are no foreign incursions.
Q&A: Rebellion in ChadProfile: Idriss Deby
"It enables us to monitor and verify any self-styled foreign interventions and to date we've seen nothing," he said.
"What is certain is that these rebel forces were over by the Sudanese border," he added. "What we might well find out in the days ahead is just what the involvement of the Sudanese actually is."
The violence in the western Sudanese region of Darfur and the cross-border fighting between Chad and Sudan has in recent years sent at least 400,000 people fleeing to refugee camps in eastern Chad. A French-dominated European Union peacekeeping force had been due to start deploying to eastern Chad last week to give the refugees and aid workers there a measure of protection, but the latest rebel offensive began at the same time. BBC world affairs correspondent Mark Doyle says one theory is that Sudan encouraged the rebels to attack in order to stop the EU opening a window on Khartoum's activities in Darfur, where it has been accused of genocide.
Ceasefire 'offer'
Mr Morin's comments came as the leader of the largest rebel group, the United Force for Democracy and Development, told the BBC that it was prepared to agree to a ceasefire in return for the promise of talks with the government.
I telephoned my friend in N'Djamena and he told me that my mother, my father and my fiancee had all been shot - I don't know whether to cry or kill myself
"Mohammed", refugee
Refugee's gruelling escape
Mahamat Nouri said the ceasefire offer had been made by the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, and the government of Burkina Faso.
But the Chadian Prime Minister, Nouradine Delwa Kassire Coumakoye, was dismissive of the offer. "Why a ceasefire?" he told French TV station France 24. "They don't exist any more. With whom would we sign a ceasefire?... We've got them under control." The lull in the fighting around N'Djamena following the tripartite rebel alliance's recent withdrawal has prompted tens of thousands of Chadians to flee the country.
THE REBEL COALITION
Unified Military Command includes:
Union of Forces for Democracy (UFDD) led by Mahamat Nouri
Rally of Forces for Change (RFC) led by Timane Erdimi
UFDD-Fundamental led by Abdelwahid Aboud Mackaye
On Tuesday, "frightened people were still crossing in a continuous flow" from Chad into neighbouring Cameroon, said the UN's refugee agency in a news release. Thousands have deluged Kousseri in Cameroon, the UNHCR said. While some have found refuge with relatives, in schools or hotels, it said, between 6,000 and 7,000 were staying out in the open at a transit centre near the bridge. The UNHCR said it planned to move these people to an old campsite some 30km away which could hold up to 100,000 people and was equipped with wells.

Democratic Convention diary
Meet our convention reporters
Democratic Party super-delegate Connie Borde joins the BBC's Max Deveson and Jennifer Copestake to report on the drama, tension and razzmatazz of this week's Democratic Convention.
Day one: Monday 25 August
CONNIE BORDE: HILLARY DAY
27 August: 0228 local time (0828 GMT)
"No way, no how, no McCain." These words delivered in her eloquent Tuesday-night speech in Denver are perhaps the most significant in Hillary Clinton's appeal to the public to unite behind Barack Obama and elect him President of the United States on 4 November. The morning began with a Women's Caucus meeting: hundreds of Democratic Party women met in Convention Hall to praise the one who shattered the political glass ceiling
But for me, Hillary Clinton's declaration began earlier in the day. Tuesday, in fact, was unofficially Women's Day - and more precisely, Hillary day - at the Democratic National Convention.
The morning began with a Women's Caucus meeting: hundreds of Democratic Party women met in Convention Hall to praise the one who shattered the political glass ceiling and to declare their support for the roll call that would on Wednesday officially record this great moment in women's history.
Whether these women had supported Hillary or Barack in the primaries, this meeting was about something else, something deeper than politics. It was about a milestone, and it gave women the chance to express their admiration and - yes - love for the woman who made that milestone happen and who has fought on their behalf for decades.

Send us your questions
A few hours later, Emily's List, the largest, wealthiest and most dynamic source of support for women in politics met before a sold-out, standing-room-only group of supporters. This powerful organisation has helped countless women succeed in obtaining political office, and among them on the stage today were Barbara Mikulski the rough-and-tumble, much-loved senator from Maryland and Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the House. And two others graced the stage with their presence: Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama.
The room resounded with ovations as each one spoke, and from what they said, and the reaction of the audience, it was obvious to all that the empowerment of women could continue only with Barack Obama in the White House.
So when Senator Clinton walked onto the stage later that night, the parameters had already been drawn and the belief of a divide between the two primary sparring partners had been dispelled, mutually supported and shared by women themselves. Clinton and Obama concur on most issues, if not all. It is John McCain who does not share their ideas, and the task that lies ahead for us is to assure a Democratic victory in November.
JENNIFER COPESTAKE: SPIKE'S VIEW
27 August: 0525
I've just finished watching Hillary's speech (with Gabby Keys, a very upbeat delegate from Nevada) and we ran straight into director Spike Lee who was also feeling energized:

Spike Lee: Clinton gave a great, great, great speech
MAX DEVESON: TIME FOR RED MEAT
26 August: 2030
There have been some grumbles from Clinton supporters like James Carville and Paul Begala that the Democrats wasted the first night of their convention.
They were unhappy that the big speeches from Michelle Obama and Edward Kennedy were full of soft-focus positive messages - and no-one was attacking John McCain or tying him to President George W Bush.
If last night was a time for candyfloss, then tonight has been a time for red meat.
As the audience waited for the big speech from Hillary Clinton, speaker after speaker tore into Mr McCain. His multiple homes were a favourite subject for jokes.
Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, paraphrasing another famous Kansas girl, said that if Mr McCain had come from her state, he would have said that "there's no place like home... and home... and home..."
Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey managed to whip up the crowd by accusing Mr McCain of being "a Bush sidekick, not a maverick".
The keynote speaker of the night was ex-Virginia Governor Mark Warner, in the slot that first brought Barack Obama to national prominence four years ago.
Mr Warner's rhetoric was not quite as high-flown as Obama's in 2004, but his speech was well-received.
And, unlike the preceding speakers, he chose not to lay into the Republicans, instead making a plea for bipartisanship.
"If an idea works, it really doesn't matter if it has an "R" or "D" next to it," he said.
All of these speeches may have been forgotten by the time Hillary Clinton makes her way to the podium, but - Mr Warner aside - they give an indication of the way in which the party intends to fight the rest of the campaign.
That is, by painting Mr McCain as a privileged multi-millionaire who will carry on the policies of George W Bush.
MAX DEVESON: HARRY TRUMAN'S HEIR?
26 August: 1500
The Republicans have been comparing Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.
Today, at a panel discussion on national security, the Democratic hopeful was compared to a very different historical figure: President Harry S Truman.
The panel - organised by The Truman National Security Project - featured a couple of former defence officials from the Clinton administration (former Defence Secretary William Perry and former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig), both of whom have been acting as advisers to the Obama campaign.
So it seemed like a good place to learn about the future direction of US foreign policy if Mr Obama wins in November - after all, these men could be at the heart of the administration in a few months' time.
The key change will temperamental, they said. Unlike George W Bush and John McCain, they argued, Mr Obama will approach foreign policy questions dispassionately. He will listen more, and seek the advice of people who may disagree with him.
Strategically, Mr Danzig suggested that Mr Obama would - like Harry Truman - change the foreign policy climate by aiming for a more multilateral approach, and by asking local actors to take on more of the military burden in ongoing conflicts.
And, perhaps most importantly, Mr Obama would focus more on the political side of international conflicts, rather than reaching immediately for military options.
But when asked about specific actions an Obama administration might adopt in response to the situation in Georgia, the speakers revealed little of substance. Showing "more respect" to Russia in the hope that it would behave less provocatively seemed to be their chief tactic.
Mr Truman managed to win an election on the basis of his national security credentials. The speakers and audience at today's event clearly hope that in this respect Mr Obama will also be his heir.
CONNIE BORDE: THE MOST POPULAR FOLKS IN TOWN
26 August: 0940
Remember the days when "liberal" was a dirty word, referred to as the "L-word", and the worst slur a Republican could throw out at a Democrat was to call her or him one?
Well, it might be all in a name, but the new Liberals are Progressives, and this week in Denver, they're among the most popular folks in town. The last Democratic Congress took on a more lib... I mean, progressive agenda and fought for bills protecting working families, minimum wage, and medical care benefits (remember Ted Kennedy leaving his hospital to vote on a bill that would prevent a 10.6% cut to physicians who treat Medicare patients?)
The Progressive Caucus is the biggest one in the House of Representatives today, and their ideas are not only catching on, but winning big approval ratings with the public. Names like Nancy Pelosi, Ted Kennedy, Barney Frank, Barbara Lee, Denis Kucinich (who's run for president a couple of times) are no longer associated with way-out left-wing crazy ideas. Eight years of Bush/Republican politics have helped change attitudes.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, addressed the ADA here and warned that progs better get ready for a return to majority power, and know what they want when they get there. (ADA stands for American's for Democratic Action, a think tank and lobby group for liberal causes.)
Here are the four points he laid out for a progressive agenda: universal healthcare (cf Senator Kennedy's rousing speech on the Convention floor); employee free choice; reform of the tax code; and get out of Iraq. Who could disagree?
JENNIFER COPESTAKE: CLINTONS FOR MCCAIN
26 August: 0030
A few hours ago, as I was walking through the baking hot streets of Denver, I ran into a very noisy group of protesters. Who could they be? Anarchists? An anti-immigration pressure group?
When they got closer, I noticed the group was smaller than it had first appeared - its ranks swelled by a large police bicycle escort. And they weren't anarchists.

Clinton supporters explain their opposition to Barack Obama
After meeting these people, I did wonder about how the Obama message is being disseminated around town and how keenly it will stick once the delegates are gone.
The same thoughts returned much later, when I picked up some food at the Lone Star Steakhouse. Sitting at an empty bar were two men, talking about the minimum wage and the value of hard work. A baseball game played on five TV screens over the bar and country music blared from a speaker somewhere. I could imagine the scene repeated across the US.
The men were talking about how as children they had spoken to their fathers - how everything was "Yes Sir!" - and how they never expected any handouts. They were not excited by Obama. Far from it, they were shouting their support to the empty room for the Republicans and John McCain.
JENNIFER COPESTAKE: MEETING CONNIE
Another meeting I had yesterday, after walking through a maze of blocked-off streets near the convention centre, was with our super-delegate diarist, Connie. She told me about the group she represents at the convention, Democrats Abroad, and the growing of numbers of registered Democrats outside the US.

OUR DIARISTS
Connie Borde is a super-delegate representing Democrats Abroad. She has lived in France for some 40 years, and lectured for half of this period at the prestigious Sciences Po institute in Paris. She has authored or co-authored books on American cooking, American politics, and English grammar - and is currently translating Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex. "I always supported Barack Obama," she says. "But I waited to give my super-delegate vote until February 2008 when Democrats Abroad France (my constituency) voted in his favour by 71%." She has a French husband, and six children.
Max Deveson, 30, is the BBC News website's Washington reporter. He joined the BBC in 2001 to work as a political analyst in Westminster, later moving to the online world news team. He has an obsessive interest in the US and its politics and was particularly excited to land an interview with Ted Kennedy on his first assignment in Washington this year. When not obsessing about US politics, Max enjoys attempting to play Iron and Wine songs on the guitar.
Jennifer Copestake, 25, is an online video producer for World News America. She's been with the programme since its first broadcast in October 2007. After the conventions she'll be video-blogging from a BBC election bus on a 38-day road trip across the country. Jennifer was born in Canada and has reported for the CBC, the Hill Times, the Observer and More 4 News. She's been in Washington since early summer, but will return one day to London, where she lives with her fiance and two cats.
The BBC News website will also publish a diary of the Republican Convention, featuring Louisiana delegate Mike Bayham.

Job cuts planned at airline BMI
The cuts are part of a reorganisation of BMI's operations
The Midlands-based airline BMI has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs.The plans are part of a restructuring plan involving a reduction in the number of aircraft and the suspension of loss-making routes. The cuts are expected to be made in all areas of the business, the airline said, although compulsory job losses would be avoided wherever possible. BMI blamed the impact of the recession and a downturn in demand for air travel for its decision. Routes suspendedFlights from Heathrow to Brussels, Tel Aviv and Kiev will be among those suspended from January, while the Heathrow to Amsterdam route will be suspended in March. Germany's Lufthansa Group highlighted the need for restructuring at BMI following its takeover of the carrier in July this year. BMI said it hoped to expand the business again "when the economic environment improves and the market demand justifies it". The airline is the second largest operator at Heathrow and currently employs more than 4,400 people.

Figo can rule the world
Portugal have been inspired by Figo's play
Luis Figo can emulate Brazilian star Rivaldo and become World Footballer of the Year, says Portugal team-mate Abel Xavier.
The Everton midfielder has been dazzled by Figo's performances in Euro 2000, which have helped steer Portugal to the semi-finals.
"Figo is just unbelievable," said Xavier. "I have played with him for 15 years and I know how good he is.
"Now he is playing in a successful Portugal side and everyone can see how good he is - he will win Footballer of the Year.
Trophies
"He always plays well for Barcelona, but to be voted the world's player of the year most players have to do well for their national team and win trophies.
I have played with him for 15 years and I know how good he is
Abel Xavier
"He can still improve because he's only 27, and there is no limit to how good he can be."
Figo created both goals for Nuno Gomes in the 2-0 victory over Turkey in the quarter-finals and is now bidding to fire the Portuguese into their first-ever final.
Xavier, fighting to get back into a winning side after an injury early in the tournament, doesn't under-estimate Figo's importance in a team packed with individual flair.
Impossible
"Quality players are difficult to stop," he said. "Before we played England we said we wanted to stop the crosses from Beckham but we realised that it's almost impossible.
"It's difficult to stop Figo. Teams don't know where he will be, they can't predict where he is going to play."
Xavier: admires team-mate Figo
Xavier added: "I think we've surprised 12 million people in Portugal.
"We were under pressure from the media who saw players winning trophies with Europe's top clubs and they ask why we don't win for Portugal.
"For many years we have been criticised because we would play well but not score. People said we did not have a goalscorer but now we are the best goalscorers.
Crucial
"It was not because we didn't have a striker that we didn't score. Teams must have the facility to score in the side and we have that.
One of our main assets is the atmosphere in the dressing room
Abel Xavier
"The players are not surprised by how we've played but the way we got the result against England was crucial. We took confidence from that game.
"One of our main assets is the atmosphere in the dressing room. We have no problems. Everybody knows each other and we have been friends for 15 years.
"We can play with our eyes closed because we all know where the other player will be."

Emotive appeals before Swiss abortion vote
Swiss laws on abortion are among the strictest in Europe
By Emma Jane Kirby
BBC Geneva Correspondent
The wide eyed, smiling baby in the poster by Geneva's train station has been photographed to look as if he's about to crawl into the arms of the onlooker.
Walking past the billboard, you feel a strange sense that you really ought to put out your hands to catch him. The maxim underneath the poster reads simply, "Thank you, Mummy, for voting for me."
It is the latest campaign of the Mother and Child initiative - backed by religious and Pro-Life groups and some politicians - to stop the Swiss people approving a government proposal in this weekend's referendum on decriminalising abortions carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Behind the times
"Under our constitution it is illegal to take another's life and to kill, " says Christoph Keel from Swiss Aid for Mother and Child, the largest Swiss Pro-Life Group.
"This is true of the unborn child. To kill an unborn child is to deny the child its human right to life. So abortion must be illegal."
Although Switzerland is in so many ways one of Europe's most forward-thinking countries - its drug addicts are given heroin on prescription and those with terminal illnesses are given the right to die - the Swiss policy on abortion lags way behind the majority of its European counterparts. We haven't convicted any woman for having an abortion for at least 14 years
Adrienne Lotz, Swiss Ministry for Justice Some 12,000 abortions are legally carried out in Switzerland, but according to the Ministry of Justice, the real figure could be as high as 130,000.
In spite of this it is still officially illegal to terminate a pregnancy unless the mother's health or life is at risk. A woman who performs her own abortion or lets it be performed, is subject to up to five years' imprisonment and a heavy fine. In 1950, there were nearly 670 convictions, but today, because abortion is known to be widely practised, there are no known cases of arrest.
"The Swiss situation is that this enforcement law is no longer applied - we haven't convicted any woman for having an abortion for at least 14 years," argues Adrienne Lotz from the Swiss Ministry for Justice. "We are not proposing that abortion should be legalised - we are asking that it should be decriminalised for the first 12 weeks - and even then a woman must make a written request and agree to counselling and medical advice on all other options available to her."
Strict ban
But because Switzerland is divided into 26 cantons, or states, all of which have judicial powers and health care systems of their own, the law has very different interpretations around the country.
Many cantons opt for a broad interpretation of the law, allowing a woman to have an abortion not just if her health is at risk, but also if her social or economic situation is unstable.
In the Roman Catholic cantons though, in central Switzerland, the law is upheld very firmly and a strict ban on pregnancy termination remains in force. Polls suggest abortion will be decriminalised
"We are convinced that doctors are there to serve life and not to destroy it," says Christoph Keel. "The punishment for doctors who perform abortions should be to lose their licence to practise. "No doctor would want to risk his licence so if no doctors would agree to do abortions, there would be far fewer abortions." The latest polls suggest that Switzerland will vote in favour of decriminalising abortion, with an estimated 63% of voters approving the softening of the law. But Adrienne Lotz, from the Ministry of Justice says even if the decriminalisation law does go through, it shouldn't be taken as an indication that the Swiss Government or the Swiss people are absolutely pro-abortion.
"No-one is in favour of abortions in themselves - the Swiss Government is committed to reducing the numbers of terminations and we want to work further on developing our family policy aims to get this message across."

Flu pandemic?
On Sunday 16 October 2005 Andrew Marr interviewed Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical Officer
Please note "BBC Sunday AM" must be credited if any part of this transcript is used. Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical Officer ANDREW MARR: Now, bird flu has been, obviously, a matter of great concern in the Far East for more than a year but it is now on our doorstep and we're getting seriously worried. As we've been hearing, the government is putting in place a comprehensive, indeed quite a startling emergency plan to deal with the health issues. Now the government's Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, is here. Sir Liam, can I start by just looking at the science of it, as we understand it. I'm right in saying that the crucial breakthrough, if you like, that the virus hasn't yet made, is direct human to human infection? LIAM DONALDSON: That's right. This virus has been around in the bird population for about five or six years at least and - mainly in the Far East - and we've seen a lot of chickens and ducks and geese slaughtered or dying from it. We've seen a small number of cases from either poultry workers or people living in close proximity but we've no firm evidence yet of person to person spread. So bird flu is actually quite difficult for someone to catch but where, what it's significance - ANDREW MARR:
Sorry - I was going to say, I mean given that, a lot of people will say so what's all this stuff in the papers about the pandemic? LIAM DONALDSON: Well the significance of it is isn't that there will be a pandemic of bird flu itself. The significance of it is that at some point, and we go by the lessons of history, the bird flu virus will combine with a human flu virus and then it will become easily transmissible. Why is that inevitable? Well because it's happened before. It happened in 1918, it happened in 1958 and it happened in 1968/9. So these things come in natural cycles, once in a while, every ten to 40 years, the flu virus mutates into a strain which we haven't got natural immunity to. ANDREW MARR:
So it really is when not if.
LIAM DONALDSON: It is when, yes, but there's a lot we can do to prepare. If we look back to the last pandemic in 1968/9, we didn't have some of the measures that we now have, like anti-viral drugs. ANDREW MARR:
Well let's turn to those, anti-viral drugs first of all. We've got something which may work and you're trying to accumulate, I think, 14 million doses of it. LIAM DONALDSON: Yes. ANDREW MARR:
How many have we got so far? LIAM DONALDSON: We've got two and a half million so far and they're coming in at the rate of about 800,000 a month. ANDREW MARR:
So not nearly enough. LIAM DONALDSON: Well, not yet - but we're one of the few countries to have embarked on this stockpiling at a very early stage so we feel that - ANDREW MARR:
I thought the French and others were way ahead of us on this. LIAM DONALDSON: The French have a stockpile, the US at the moment have about 1/25th of what we've got and some other countries have a stockpile but up until now we've been one of the countries which has been in the lead on this and it's part of a comprehensive plan - we can't make this pandemic go away, because it is a natural phenomenon, it will come, but what we can do is to limit its impact, and that's the whole basis of the contingency plan that we're releasing on Thursday. ANDREW MARR:
But the earlier it comes for us, if it came this winter for instance, the worse, because we haven't got the stockpiles we might need. LIAM DONALDSON: Well no we've got some drugs so far and those would obviously be deployed but give us a little bit more time and we'll be even better prepared. ANDREW MARR:
Well yes, of course, that's what a virus can't do necessarily. LIAM DONALDSON: No. ANDREW MARR:
How many people are going to die? LIAM DONALDSON: Well in a normal winter flu year, people might be surprised, flu we tend to think of as a, as a friendly companion that's around all the time, but it actually kills in excess of 12,000 people every winter with the normal winter flu. But if we had a pandemic, the problem would be that our existing vaccines don't work against it, we would have to develop a new vaccine and people don't have natural immunity because it hasn't been around before. So the estimate we're working to in the number of deaths is around 50,000 excess deaths from flu, but it could be a lot higher than that it very much depends whether this mutated strain is a mild one or a more serious one. ANDREW MARR:
The top end, we read in the papers, about 750,000 people dying, which would be a national catastrophe obviously. LIAM DONALDSON: Yes it would and if that happened it would be an international catastrophe and I think we have to, we have to say that if we're making comparisons with the Spanish flu in 1918/19, where 40 million people worldwide died, 250 million in the UK, we are living
ANDREW MARR:
Two hundred and 50 thousand - LIAM DONALDSON: Yes - 250,000 in the UK - we are living in very different times - those were in the days before proper hospital facilities, before intensive care, before antibiotics, so we're not planned - we obviously have to be flexible in our plans and prepare for everything - but at the moment our estimate is that we expect around 50 - 55,000 but it could be higher - ANDREW MARR:
Three - three quarters of a million is not unrealistic. LIAM DONALDSON: It's not impossible but I think it's more realistic that the figure will be a lot lower than that. ANDREW MARR:
If this pandemic arrives, what else does the government do? Do you close schools, airports; do you close public buildings; do you encourage people to stay at home? LIAM DONALDSON: Well I think the two most important measures, apart from obviously having good surveillance so that we're aware when it's coming, is to immediately get that virus from wherever it occurs - and the most likely is it will still be in the Far East - into the laboratories in Britain and start characterising it and then manufacturing a vaccine. ANDREW MARR:
As quickly as possible. LIAM DONALDSON: As quickly as possible. And we have some of the top scientists in the world in Britain, we're very proud of the work that they do and we're in very close contact with them. Secondly, deploy the anti-virals - the anti-virals won't cure flu but they will reduce the severity of an attack if given in the first 24, 48 hours, and they will stop some people from dying from it. I think measures such as controlling movement of populations are not as important because flu transmits extremely quickly, it's not like Sars, so that might slow its impact and it might be necessary, if we're at the absolute peak of a pandemic in this country, but it's not the prime intervention that we need to use. ANDREW MARR:
But to be clear, you have a plan, you have an emergency strategy, if it gets that bad, and presumably places like airports, where people are moving internationally, would be closed. LIAM DONALDSON: It would not, I think, come to that. What would be more sensible and more realistic is that we would look to reducing the amount of movement of people. We'd be saying well unless your travel is absolutely essential do you need to go up to the north east this weekend or do you need to go to that particular social gathering. It would be things like that. But all of those things would slow the pandemic and that of course gives us time to catch up with the vaccine, which would take a few months to prepare. ANDREW MARR:
Schools, public buildings, public places? LIAM DONALDSON: There might be the need to do that but initially I think the main measures would be the deployment of the anti-virals and then getting that vaccine into the - getting that virus in the laboratories and getting the vaccine production started. ANDREW MARR:
Now inevitably there's not going to be enough vaccine for everybody when you get going. How do you decide who gets it first? LIAM DONALDSON: Well we would decide firstly to give it to essential workers. So front-line NHS staff, that we want to keep our hospitals running obviously, we want to care for the patients that would become ill. The next group would be people who are known to be in the higher risk groups. Now with the normal winter flu that's elderly people and people with chronic diseases, but we would have to watch the pattern of this flu very carefully - this new flu whenever it came out - and it may be that different groups would be affected. For example in the Spanish flu, it was mainly adults, 20 to 40 years old, who were the high risk group. So if we saw a new pattern emerging then we would reprioritise the risk groups. ANDREW MARR:
Right. In your - this may be an impossible question to answer so I apologise in advance - but what is your best guess about this, is it going to come this winter? LIAM DONALDSON: I think it's less likely that it will come this winter. The attention at the moment is focused in Europe because of these outbreaks, that doesn't mean that the pandemic flu is creeping closer to the UK, it simply means that the bird flu is occurring in other parts of the world, as it has over the last five to six years. I think the likelihood is still that we will see the epicentre of this pandemic and flu, this mutation, in the Far East. For example in China, one and a half billion chickens live in close proximity to people in China and that's where we've so far - ANDREW MARR:
That's where ... LIAM DONALDSON: - think the greatest, it could happen in Europe, but most likely in the Far East. ANDREW MARR:
Now despite all the things you've been talking about, the opposition parties, in particular, have accused the government of being very slow off the mark so there isn't enough vaccine being stockpiled, there aren't enough arrangements being made in case things turn very difficult indeed this winter. LIAM DONALDSON: Well we have been quick off the mark, we have started stockpiling the anti-virals - many other countries haven't - we've also ordered two and a half million doses of the H5N1 vaccine just as a contingency. It may not the be right vaccine because we don't know what the strain is going to be, but we've done that as a contingency. So I think we are, we are in a strong position - the World Health Organisation has commended our plan - but funnily enough, you may be surprised that people like me actually quite like criticism because once in a while - ANDREW MARR:
Because it raises the subject - LIAM DONALDSON: Well it raises the awareness but once in a while people come up with an idea that we haven't thought of, so we're always willing to listen to criticism and comment. ANDREW MARR:
And what about the birds themselves? Should people be worried about chickens roaming free range, should they be worried about wild fowl, is there anything that people can do to help stop this spreading in the avian form, the bird form? LIAM DONALDSON: Well at this stage we haven't got bird flu in this country and I know that the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs is increasing bio-security around farms, but until we get it in this country I don't think there are any special precautions that people need to take - and in any case - ANDREW MARR:
There's not much we can do, frankly, individually. LIAM DONALDSON: No. If it happened, it would mainly be a threat for people working in the poultry industry and those in close contact with birds. It's this mutation which would occur between the bird strain and the human strain we really need to be worried about. ANDREW MARR:
Sir Liam Donaldson, thank you very much indeed for that. INTERVIEW ENDS NB: this transcript was typed from a recording and not copied from an original script.

What is Catch-22? And why does the book matter?
BBC News Online users voted to read Catch-22 for World Book Day 2002. What is Catch-22? What is the book about? And why has it become such a modern classic? Owen Booth writes.
Join our Reading Group here
"Catch-22 n. 1. a situation in which a person is frustrated by a paradoxical rule or set of circumstances that preclude any attempt to escape from them. 2. a situation in which any move that a person can make will lead to trouble [C20: from the title of a novel (1961) by J. Heller]" [Collins]
Regular surveys of the most significant novels of the 20th Century, whether chosen by literary critics or the book buying public, tend to produce the same set of titles.
Joyce's Ulysses, Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, 100 years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. But only one of the titles regularly appearing in those critics and readers' top tens introduced a phrase to the English language that would go on to have a life of its own, and which sums up a concept that seems to have been around forever.
Heller: Died in 1999
Joseph Heller began work on Catch-22, the story of a US airman's attempts to survive the madness of the Second World War, shortly after returning from the conflict himself.
The son of Russian Jewish immigrants to the United States, Heller had joined the US Air Force in 1942 at the age of 19, going on to fly 60 bombing missions against enemy targets over Southern Europe. After the war, while working as an advertising copywriter, he spent seven years writing a novel that reflected his experience, and what he saw as the insanity of military life. The book - which was originally titled Catch-18 - tells the story of Captain Joseph Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa. Yossarian is convinced that the military is trying to get him killed, and that those around him are insane, and he spends the book trying to get out of flying any more seemingly suicidal missions. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.
Joseph Heller, defining Catch-22 Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else, the newly promoted Major Major, who spends most of the war trying to hide from his men, and the profiteer Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a pure capitalist whose only ambition is to make money out of the war, and who ends up charging a commission on every military engagement. Using satire, black humour and seemingly undefeatable logic, the book argues that war is insane, that the military is insane, and that, quite probably, modern life itself is insane too. Truth and fiction
At a time when, as Philip Roth complained, ''the American writer in the middle of the 20th Century has his hands full in trying to understand, and then describe, and then make credible much of the American reality - the actuality is continually outdoing our talents'', Heller was one of the first to find a way to deal with the apparent madness of the modern world.
As Yossarian struggles against the self-serving bureaucracy at the heart of the military machine, Heller argues that the individual will always struggle against the vested interests (such as Minderbinder's rapacious capitalism) that control the world. And, perhaps, that madness is an entirely relevant reaction to this.
Norman Mailer: Grittily realistic
Yossarian's dilemma is summed up by "Catch-22" of the air force's code of practice, "which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind".
What this means, as the book's Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian of another flyer's situation, is that "Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to".
Yossarian Lives
Anti-Vietnam War slogan
In other words, the only sane reaction to war is to recognise its madness. But in doing so, and proving his sanity, Yossarian makes himself eligible to fight. As Yossarian puts it: "That's some catch, that Catch-22". The doctor, whose job is to save lives only so that they can be put in danger again, can only agree that "it's the best there is".
When Catch-22 was first published in 1961, it received mixed reviews. American readers and critics alike were more used to grittily realistic World War II novels by writers like Norman Mailer, Irwin Shaw and James Jones. They didn't seem to know what to make of Heller's highly original take on the conflict (although the book was a minor hit on its release, six months later, in Britain).
Public imagination
As the US's involvement in Vietnam grew, however, Heller's exploration of the insanities of both war and the "military-industrial complex" gradually caught the public imagination, and the book became a word of mouth success. Stickers declaring "Yossarian Lives" started to appear among other anti-war slogans. A new generation of Americans - many of them facing the prospect of being forced to fight a war they didn't understand - found themselves identifying with Yossarian's situation and the phrase "Catch-22" soon became a part of the popular consciousness.
Speaking about the nerve he had touched, Heller would later say "a large part of the public sentiment was my own. They saw an absurd quality, a mendacious quality in many of our political leaders and business leaders".
Summing up his intentions in writing the book - which has now sold more than 10 million copies - he pointed out that "everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts - and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?" Join our Reading Group here

College unions reject pay offer
College staff unions in England have rejected a pay offer of 2% from August plus 0.5% from next January.
The unions UCU, GMB, T&G, Unison, ACM and ATL want a "significant" increase. They said the offer by the Association of Colleges fell short of the 2.5% rise this year to school teachers - whose unions are also now arguing for more.
Consumer price inflation was 2.8% last month and the Retail Prices Index was 4.5%. The government wants public sector pay rises kept under 2%.
The college unions are due to meet the employers again on 26 June and have called for a revised offer. The employers' side has also offered talks on a national guideline agreement on workloads. 'Underwhelmed'
Joint union negotiator Barry Lovejoy of the University and College Union, said: "I am pleased we seem to be making some progress on the non-pay issues of workloads and staff development but a pay offer of this level is clearly unacceptable. "This does not help to close the pay gap with school teachers." Unison's Christine Lewis said support staff would be "underwhelmed" by a small percentage offer which made very little difference to those on low pay. "The employers promised to return to their employment committee to consider a new offer with a combination of lump sum and percentage to underpin the lower points of the national scale. "We hope that a sense of fair play in pay will prevail."
The deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges, Sue Dutton, said colleges were reviewing their funding allocations for next year. "We look forward to re-engaging with unions in June and continuing the process." E-mail this to a friend

Hundreds attend anti-terror rally
Nine-year-old Mohamed Souidi took part in the rally
About 1,500 people have taken part in a rally against terrorism in Glasgow, organised by mosques and Islamic groups.
It comes a week after a car burst into flames after being driven into the terminal building at Glasgow airport.
Organisers said: "The eyes of the world will be on a Scotland sending out the message that all our communities are united against terrorism." Police also said thousands took part in the city's County Grand Orange Parade.
Orange Lodge parades took place across the city, before marchers joined the main procession at Blythswood Square.
'Community cohesion'
Meanwhile, the "Scotland United Against Terror" event was held in George Square.
Organisers said the day was doubly significant as it was the second anniversary of the London Tube bombings and one week after the Glasgow attack.
Faith leaders, churches and trade unionists were among those at the event, and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke to the crowd.
The views of people who attended the anti-terror march
In pictures Osama Saeed, one of the organisers, said: "We've been staggered by the messages of support we've been getting this week from the four corners of the globe. "We thought on a local level we'd get together and do this to allow the grassroots to display their anger at the attacks, little realising nothing like this had ever been done before anywhere else before.
"The eyes of the world will be on a Scotland sending out the message that all our communities are united against terrorism. "The Muslim community have called this event, but what's touching is how the rest of the country has responded to us."

The Lords Chief Whip, Lord Bassam of Brighton, told Peers that emergency legislation would be brought to the House of Lords to ensure the freezing of assets of terror suspects.The business statement was made following a ruling by the Supreme Court on 27 January that ruled that they were unlawful as they had not been voted on by Parliament. The government says that new emergency legislation is needed to ensure the assets do not become unfrozen. Lord Bassam told Peers that all stages would be debated on 9 February to ensure that the bill receives royal assent by the half-term recess.

Hartlepool 2-2 Swindon
Hartlepool 2 - 2 Swindon
Two quick-fire second-half goals saw Swindon Town earn a draw against Hartlepool United.Pools took an early two-goal lead, Adam Boyd tapping home from eight yards and Antony Sweeney pouncing on Lescinel Jean-Francois' poor headed backpass. The Robins pulled one back through substitute Thomas Dossevi, who lashed a first-time strike past Scott Flinders. Two minutes later, striker Charlie Austin levelled, finding the net after a Hartlepool defensive mix-up. Swindon manager Danny Wilson told BBC Wiltshire: "Giving the two goals away that we gave away were absolutely abysmal and that's cost us.

Arsenal 1 - 1 Liverpool
Kuyt kept his cool to slot in for Liverpool from the spot
By Mandeep Sanghera
Arsenal's title hopes were left hanging by a thread after they conceded a late penalty in an extraordinary finish against Liverpool at the Emirates.The Gunners thought they had earned a vital win when Robin van Persie slotted in a 98th minute penalty after Jay Spearing brought down Cesc Fabregas. But four minutes later Emmanuel Eboue fouled Lucas Leiva to allow Dirk Kuyt to grab a Reds equaliser from the spot. The Gunners are now six points behind Manchester United with six games left. Kuyt converted his penalty in the 102nd minute, with the extended amount of added time being down to an injury to Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher during the second half. And the dramatic equaliser from the Reds is a bodyblow to an Arsenal side who briefly thought they had revived their chances of catching Premier League leaders Manchester United.

The latest setback for the Gunners is likely to be too much for them to recover from, and it adds to the recent agonies of being beaten in the Carling Cup final and suffering a Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona. The prospect of the Gunners ending a sixth season without any silverware is looming large, with Wenger's strategy of relying on talent groomed through the club rather than bringing in expensive reinforcements from the transfer market set to be called into question once again. Up until Van Persie's penalty, it was also a game in which the home side had only provided more weight to criticism that they are pretty without being penetrative, as they had been repelled by an under-strength but resilient Liverpool outfit. There had been a period of silence ahead of the kick-off as the two clubs paid their respects to Arsenal director Danny Fiszman after his death earlier in the week, as well marking the 15 April anniversary of the death of 96 Liverpool fans in the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989. When play did get under way, Arsenal's need for a win to maintain their title challenge put the emphasis on them to attack, while Liverpool tried to soak up the pressure and catch their rivals on the counter-attack. Liverpool's tactics were almost ruined as early as the fourth minute when Abou Diaby beat Reds striker Andy Carroll to a Samir Nasri free-kick but glanced his header narrowly wide.
Striker Van Persie's celebrations were shortlived
Carroll's impact was not going to be in defence though, as he had the task of testing how the Gunners back-line would deal with the kind of physical threat the home side have previously struggled against. And, after Arsenal centre-back Johan Djourou escaped giving away a penalty for a foul on Spearing, Carroll got his head to a number of balls, only to fail to test Gunners keeper Wojciech Szczesny. His aerial prowess did serve as a warning for the home side, especially considering the England international had already scored at the Emirates this season with a header from a diagonal free-kick when his former club Newcastle won 1-0. To Arsenal's credit they managed to limit his threat but, despite dominating possession, they failed to find a way through a Liverpool rearguard which had seen 17-year-old Jack Robinson replace the injured Fabio Aurelio after 21 minutes. Robinson became Liverpool's youngest ever player when he came on against Hull City in the final game of 2009-10 season aged 16 years and 250 days and he joined 18-year-old John Flanagan in the Reds defence. For all of Arsenal's passing and probing they almost went ahead from set piece, when a Van Persie corner was headed against the crossbar by Laurent Koscielny. Wenger's side had a shout for a penalty when Theo Walcott was quickest to the loose ball and claimed his follow-up shot struck the arm of Kuyt, although referee Andre Marriner disagreed.

Arsenal's intricacy was being repelled by Liverpool's resilience, with Martin Skrtel having to block an angled shot by overlapping Gunners right-back Eboue on the stroke of half-time. Carragher's head injury after a clash with team-mate Flanagan brought a halt to proceedings before Luis Suarez nearly punished the home side for their lack of cutting edge. The Uruguayan has earned plenty of plaudits since his arrival in January and, even though he had endured a frustrating time, he sent a strike just wide after the Gunners defence backed off. Arsenal responded with Van Persie chipping a shot over the on-rushing Reina but too high, then heading wide at the near post and finally having a shot saved when one-on-one with the Reds keeper. The Dutch forward thought he had atoned for his misses when he confidently slotted in, only for Eboue's mistake at the other end to prove costly. Eboue clattered into the back of Leiva as both players attempted to retrieve the loose ball after a Suarez free-kick hit the wall. Kuyt kept his cool in a cauldron of noise to slot in the equaliser with the last kick of the match as the Reds, who have 18 top-flight titles along with Manchester United, ironically helped their rivals to move ahead of them.

Swallow cleared for Athens
Britain's Olympic contenders
Jodie Swallow's place in the British triathlon team for the Athens Olympics has been confirmed.
The 23-year-old was selected in May even though she had not competed in a triathlon this year due to injury.
Her hopes of proving her fitness had been dented when she crashed out during the bicycle ride in the Triathlon World Cup event in Salford last month.
But the selectors decided not to call up Andrea Whitcombe as reserve, despite her win in Sunday's London triathlon.
Whitcombe challenged her initial omission from the three-woman team in May via the Sports Dispute Resolution Panel.
Academy: Watch Swallow's triathlon masterclass
But, following a fitness review of all three female triathletes and talks involving the British Triathlon Association, British Olympic Association and International Olympic Committee, Swallow has been given the green light.
Swallow was picked largely on the strength of her World Cup form last season, which included a silver medal at the Olympic test event in Athens.
The other two female triathletes in the team are Michelle Dillon and Julie Dibens.

Mendez: The right man?
Mendez gets the nod over Tais for right-back
By Tim Vickery
BBC Sport Online
Most teams have a problem position, a place on the field where the coach has reason to be unhappy with the resources at his disposal.
In Uruguay's case it is at right-back. The have plenty of options in other positions, enabling coach Victor Pua to leave out players of the calibre of Giacomazzi and Perez in midfield, Chevanton, Alonso, Zelayeta and Pandiani up front.
But resources are scarce at right-back. So it is surprising that only one specialist in the position has been named in the World Cup squad, and equally surprising that Gustavo Mendez is the lucky man.
Now at the veteran stage, Mendez has given good service both to Uruguay and to the Italian league. But he has seen better days. Last year Victor Pua seemed to think so; Mendez was discarded after Uruguay lost to Venezuela. An awful performance from Mendez was capped when he received the red card. Tais: Unlucky to miss out
Finding himself surplus to requirements at Torino, Mendez moved back home in a late effort to force his way in to Uruguay's World Cup team. Astonishingly, he seems to have succeeded, despite hardly figuring in Nacional's first XI. Mendez has been on the bench for most of the campaign. It is hard not to feel sorry for Washington Tais, the man who missed out. He was Uruguay's right-back on the run in towards qualification. His performances were not entirely convincing, but at the time he was not getting a game with Betis in the Spanish league. Competition in attack
By the end of the season he had won back his club place, but now finds himself cast aside by his country. It is a decision that not all in Uruguay agree with. Recently club side Penarol played a big game in the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League. Defender Robert Lima scored - and celebrated by removing his Penarol top to reveal a Uruguay shirt with the number two and the name Tais printed on the back.
But in the World Cup that shirt will belong to Mendez. An alternative is the versatile Gianni Guigou, who normally figures in midfield or at left-back. Forlan's Man Utd move pays dividends
Guigou has not played at right-back for his country, but he has done so for Roma, so he should be able to fill in without too many problems. All the same, Pua may regret leaving himself short of options. By the end of the campaign he may feel that he exagerrated by selecting four players for the same centre forward position.
Dario Silva and Sebastian Abreu are competing for a place in the starting line-up. Then there is the gangling Richard Morales, the hero of the play-off against Australia. Plus Diego Forlan, who did not feature in qualification but whose profile has been raised by the move to Manchester United.
Leaving out one of the quartet would not have been easy. But it would have freed an extra space for Pua to give himself more cover at right-back. INTERNET LINKS
