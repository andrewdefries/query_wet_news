Bernanke says US economy to slow
Bernanke's warning
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke has warned that the US economy will slow noticeably before the end of the year.
He blamed the slowdown on the credit crisis, which has made it harder for banks and individuals to borrow money.
He said that there was likely to be more "financial restraint on economic growth as credit becomes more expensive and difficult to obtain".
In the longer term, he said that the greater premium attached to risk may lead to a healthier financial system.
"Investors have also become more cautious and are demanding greater compensation for bearing risk," he said.
Bernanke is in a box and it is getting smaller
Christopher Low, FTN Financial
The credit crisis, caused by an abundance of debt of questionable value, has made banks more reluctant to lend money.
Mr Bernanke acknowledged that this was causing particular problems to homeowners who wanted to refinance their mortgages to offset the end of special offer rates.
'Sluggish growth'
Some analysts say that the comments make it more likely that there will be another interest rate cut before the end of the year.
"In particular, it's his comment that the FOMC (the rate-setting committee) expects growth to slow noticeably in the fourth quarter and expects sluggish growth in early 2008," said Dustin Reid from ABN Amro in Chicago.
"It's perhaps a warning that the Fed may be looking to downgrade its growth outlook," he added.
But others say that it is just confirmation of how bad the outlook is for the economy.
"They are worried about the economy. They are worried about inflation," said Christopher Low at FTN Financial in New York.
"Bernanke is in a box and it is getting smaller," he added.
Mr Bernanke was addressing the Congress' Joint Economic Committee.

Katsav avoids ceremonial duties
Mr Katsav could be impeached if found to have acted improperly
Israeli police have grilled President Moshe Katsav for a fifth time over allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of his position.
Meanwhile, parliament granted his request to step down temporarily in the light of the investigation. This means Mr Katsav will not preside over the ceremony to swear in Israel's first female chief justice of the Supreme Court on Thursday.
Dorit Beinish will be to be sworn in by Knesset speaker Dalia Itzik instead.
Mr Katsav had asked for the day-long suspension of his duties in order to prevent the controversy surrounding him overshadowing the ceremony.
The 61-year-old father-of-five faces accusations that he abused his position of authority by forcing two female employees to have sex with him.
There are also allegations that he issued presidential pardons - one of the few powers of his office - illegally. Mr Katsav denies all the allegations. If charged, Mr Katsav would be immune from prosecution. However, he can be impeached by parliament if it feels he acted inappropriately. Mr Katsav is a veteran member of the right-wing Likud party, serving as transport minister in the late 1980s and in 1996 as minister of tourism and deputy prime minister. He has held the office of president, a largely ceremonial role, since 2000.

Hospital infection 'took months to recover from'
Martina Dennis developed an infection after a caesarean section Martina Dennis took months to recover from a serious infection she developed days after giving birth at Basildon University Hospital in May."After my caesarean section I caught an infection which led to necrotizsng fasciitis - the flesh-eating superbug, as they call it. When I was re-admitted into the maternity unit the general housekeeping standards were very questionable at the time. General things - I had to ask for my bed linen to be changed, I had to ask for the toilet attached to the room to be cleaned. There were various things going on. I was very ill so there were lots of things I probably missed as well. In relation to what was said in the report, I can confirm there was blood on the curtains and it wasn't mine.
My mother-in-law had to move in with me to look after me and my children for months
Hospital kit 'covered in blood'
When staff came in to take the lids of my cannula it was left on the table. Dressing wrapping was left on the breakfast trolley. General housekeeping standards were questionable without a doubt. On one occasion there was blood on the floor - it was my blood from a cannula change, and it was changed in the afternoon. My husband came in later on that evening, at about 8pm or 9pm. He actually had to go out and find a hospital cleaner to come in and clean the blood off the floor. 'Relieved'I am so relieved that someone has actually brought this to the forefront - and I hope that people will come forward if they have had the same or a similar experience, so that things can improve and that nobody has to go through what I went through. I was in hospital for a month. Then when I was released I was sent home with a vacuum therapy pack. I was only discharged from the district nursing team in September, so it was a long recovery from May. At the end of the day it didn't just impact on me and my husband and my family, but on the wider family. My mother-in-law had to move in with me to look after me and my children for months. I am just relieved. If this is brought to light and corrected then nobody will have to go through that." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Solway Harvester: The crew
These are the men who went down with the Solway Harvester in bad weather off the Isle of Man.
Skipper Craig Mills, 29, a qualified seaman, had been in charge of the Solway Harvester for just under two years.
He had fished in the Irish Sea all his working life.
His brother, Robin, 33, was married to Karen who is expecting their second baby in March.
He had only been called in because of crew illness.
David Mills, 18, was Craig and Robin's cousin.
David Lyons, 17, lived with his parents and sister in Whithorn.
He had been helping out on the Solway Harvester for 18 months.
Wesley Jolly, who turned 17 just last month, was a lifelong friend of David Lyons.
He followed David onto the boats last summer.
John Murphy, 22, had been on fishing boats for several years.
Martin Milligan, 26, pictured with girlfriend Allison McIlwraith.
Described by relatives as a real "family guy" who liked to drink, enjoyed putting on a bet and worshipped Rangers Football Club.

Superman will be screened at Jersey's Val de la Mar
Superman the movie will be shown as part of Branchage
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it's a man in tights projected on to a dam in St Ouen.The original Superman movie will be screened at a special 'drive in' event as part of the Branchage Jersey film festival on Saturday 25 September. The film will be shown at the Val de la Mar reservoir with the film projected on to the dam and sound broadcast to your car radio. This is just one of more than 60 events at the Branchage festival. The classic sci-fi flick Superman will be shown in celebration of the late, great Christopher Reeve, the original movie Superman. The film will be shown on what would have been his 58th birthday. The scene of the Hoover Dam exploding is going to look spectacular on the real dam itself.
Chris Bell, Branchage Festival
There are a limited number of tickets available for this event. You buy tickets per car and not per person and drivers will be given a special radio frequency to tune to when they arrive. Given the setting the iconic scene in the film showing Superman's daring rescue of Lois Lane from the Hoover Dam as it's destroyed by his nemesis Lex Luther is one to watch out for. Authentic drive in treats such like hot dogs, popcorn and marshmallow-topped hot chocolate will be on sale to keep the film fans toasty. Chris Bell, press officer and programming assistant for Branchage Film Festival, said: "Superman is a really great, fun, exciting family film and for cinema-goers, this is a really unique opportunity. "The scene of the Hoover Dam exploding is going to look spectacular on the real dam itself, and it's a really good value for money evening out that you can take your kids to or even your date!"

1962: First US rocket lands on Moon
The American Moon rocket Ranger IV has landed on the far side of the moon but has failed to send back pictures due to a technical fault.
It is the first time an American spacecraft has successfully reached the Moon - the Russians achieved the first ever lunar impact in 1959.
However, the main aim of the mission - to take television pictures of the lunar surface - was not achieved after all internal power on board the spacecraft failed two hours after launch.
The Ranger IV Atlas-Agena rocket, which took off from Cape Canaveral on 23 April, is one of the most sophisticated space machines ever developed.
Crash-land
It was specifically designed to crash-land on the Moon after capturing a series of images of the lunar surface on its approach.
The television pictures on board were designed to begin operating when the rocket came within 2,500 miles (4,023km) of the lunar surface - 40 minutes before impact - and then send an image of the Moon back to Earth every 13 seconds.
After the loss of internal power the spacecraft could only be tracked using the tiny radio transmitter in the lunar capsule. This is how scientists confirmed it had actually reached the Moon.
The latest mission was identical to that of Ranger III, which launched on 26 January this year.
But the expected pictures from that mission were not produced because the rocket missed the Moon by 22,862 miles (36,793km).
Nasa scientists will be hugely disappointed by this latest failure as a successful mission would have given them the first ever close-up images of the mysterious lunar surface.
Ranger IV was also equipped with a seismometer and radio transmitter, designed to be released in a small capsule from the rocket before impact and land on the Moon in sufficiently good condition to measure the frequency of natural earthquakes in the body of the Moon.
Images from this would have been sent back to Earth for up to 30 days for vital research.

In Context
The Ranger rockets marked a new phase in space exploration and were a significant part of America's attempt to be the first to put a man on the Moon.
The first six Rangers failed, some of them missing the moon entirely. Finally, on 31 July 1964, Ranger VII sent back more than 4,000 images before crashing into the Moon's Mare Cognitum (Known Sea).
The closest images, taken only seconds before impact, showed features as small as a few feet across. Ranger VIII repeated the feat in February 1965, while Ranger IX brought a successful end to the programme in March 1965. Altogether, these three Rangers gave scientists a new understanding of the lunar surface and helped pave the way for the Apollo astronauts.

FOURTH ONE-DAY INTERNATIONAL, Colombo: England 212-5 bt Sri Lanka 211-9 by five wickets
By Sam Lyon
England last won a one-day series in the Asian subcontinent in 1987
England produced a fantastic display with both bat and ball to ease to a five-wicket win in Colombo and seal a first one-day series win in Sri Lanka.
James Anderson and Ryan Sidebottom were the heroes with the ball, taking three wickets apiece as Sri Lanka made 211-9.
Even a 126-run stand between Chamara Silva and Kumar Sangakkara (69) could not disguise a superb bowling effort.
And Kevin Pietersen (63no) and Alastair Cook (80) then dug deep with the bat to help England home with 19 balls left.
Interview: England captain Paul Collingwood
Interview: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene
It put the tourists 3-1 up with one to play in the five-match series, sealing a second successive one-day international series win following their home defeat of India in September.
The result rarely looked in doubt after England shook off the disappointment of losing the toss to take crucial early wickets.
606: DEBATE
Who would have thought, a series win in Sri Lanka?
SK
Anderson and Sidebottom have found good rhythm in the opening overs throughout the series, and the pair did not disappoint skipper Paul Collingwood again in Colombo.
Sidebottom (3-27) led the way and he had conceded just one run off the bat when he had Upul Tharanga caught at slip by Owais Shah in just his second over.
But, despite being flicked for four off his very first delivery, it was Anderson (3-33) that snared the key wickets of Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene.
Jayasuriya fell looping a slower ball straight to Kevin Pietersen at mid-off, before Jayawardene lashed an attempted cut high to third man, where Stuart Broad took a good catch on the run.
They were Anderson's first wickets of the series and when he and Sidebottom had completed 13 overs between them, Sri Lanka were limping along at 25-3.
The replacement bowlers fared almost as well in the early stages, Broad, Collingwood and Graeme Swann restricting Sri Lanka's scoring with persistent line, length and some turn.
Sangakkara dug in to make his first real contribution of the series
But, despite being another slow wicket, pre-match suspicions that the pitch would yield runs to the better batsmen rang true as Sangakkara and Silva settled.
The pair dug in impressively, nudging and nurdling for ones and twos and only occasionally opening their shoulders for a boundary shot, as the hosts slowly edged towards 200.
The stand was not without scares, with Sangakkara lofting a leading edge safe off Swann.
And Ravi Bopara, in his first bowl of the series, was frustrated three times in his efforts to remove Silva - once when Phil Mustard shelled a thin edge standing up to the stumps and then when two confident lbw appeals were turned down by Rudi Koertzen.
However, just as the duo began to cut loose, Silva top-edged a wide bouncing delivery from Broad down to third man to leave the hosts 146-4 with 10 overs remaining.
The new Nottinghamshire man struck again 12 balls later when Sangakkara pulled straight to Bopara to end his 102-ball stand and Collingwood brought himself back on to remove Kaushal Lokuarachchi plumb lbw for nine.
Dilshan and Mubarak racked up a stand of 23 off three overs, before the former was bowled by Anderson, and Sidebottom wrapped up the tail to keep England's noses in front.
Chasing under lights has proved troublesome throughout this series, but a typical top-order burst from Phil Mustard suggested the pitch was better than the Sri Lankan batsmen had made it look.
The Durham keeper once again failed to capitalise on a good start, driving four boundaries before dollying a return catch to Lasith Malinga, but Cook and Ian Bell rotated the strike nicely to keep the scoreboard ticking over.
Cook top-scored with 80 to see England to an historic series victory
Bell was left cursing his choice of shot in the 20th over when he lobbed Lokuarachchi to mid-on, but after that England cruised.
Pietersen, averaging just nine on this tour before his innings, looked determined to make a score and he and Cook refused to take chances on a slow pitch.
It made for turgid viewing at times, and a short rain delay slowed the outfield even more to ensure it barely got better in the latter stages.
However, there was no denying England's application and Cook and Pietersen did what had to be done in taking the tourists to within 50 runs of victory with 11 overs remaining.
Cook had already brought up his half century by that stage - off 76 balls - and Pietersen greeted the 40th over with a welcome display of aggression, smashing the first six of the match down the ground to bring up his own 50.
He eventually registered four more boundaries with typically wristy shots in a stand of 110 with Cook, and ended unbeaten on 63 for a welcome return to form.
Even after the Essex man played on off Dilhara Fernando and was followed immediately back in the hutch by Collingwood lbw first ball, the tourists looked untroubled.
There was still time for Owais Shah to be bowled by Malinga, but Pietersen and Ravi Bopara saw England to 212-5 to secure the historic victory and send the visiting dressing room into raptures.

Martinez praise for Swansea duo
Roberto Martinez's Swansea are unbeaten in 16 games
Swansea boss Roberto Martinez praised Jason Scotland and Mark Gower for their contribution in the 1-1 FA Cup fifth round draw with Fulham.Scotland played with a hip injury but scored his 12th goal in as many games. "Not many people knew that Jason wasn't feeling well," said Martinez. "He was at 50 per cent and that shows what a quality player he is." And Martinez gave his backing to Gower who missed a hat-trick of chances to get his first goal for the club. "It's one of those situations that it seems that the ball is not going in," said the Spaniard. "But if you look at the quality of his play and the link up play, he works hard to get those chances. 606: DEBATE
At least when Swansea come to Fulham they'll have a go. You had a massive let off today
captainthunderboult
"That tells you that as long as he keeps the standards, he will score lots of goals for Swansea City. "Some of his play and movement off the ball was outstanding." Swansea now face a trip to Craven Cottage for the replay on Tuesday, 24 February. But Martinez fears his side may have missed their chance to knock their second Premier League side out of the FA Cup this season. "It was probably the best chance we had with the chances we created," said Martinez. "With the performance, we were the better side and when you do that, you need to win football games. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "We controlled the whole game and we limited Fulham to very, very little. "We conceded a poor goal. It came in a crucial moment, but the way the players reacted is probably the biggest positive that I'm going to take from the performance. "Fulham are a very good side and if you look at their record at their place, they are going to be favourites, and in that respect, it's going to be difficult for us."
