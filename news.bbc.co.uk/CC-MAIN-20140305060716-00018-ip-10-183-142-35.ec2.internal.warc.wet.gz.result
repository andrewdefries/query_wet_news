Output blow to UK manufacturing
Optimism had been increasing
The UK's struggling manufacturing sector has suffered a set-back with an unexpected fall in output in March, official figures show.
This is a major shock given recent survey evidence had suggested manufacturing was rising out of recession
Phillip Shaw, Investec economist
Analysts had expected to see a rise of 0.3% in manufacturing output in the last month, but Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed it shrank by 0.8%.
Industrial output, which includes oil, gas and utilities, was down 0.4%.
The figures will come as a blow to the manufacturing sector which had been buoyed by predictions of a rise in output, and Tuesday's Confederation of British Industry review which showed confidence rising.
'Major shock'
It will also increase the pressure on the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, which begins a two-day meeting on Wednesday, to leave interest rates at their present low of 4%.
Within manufacturing, there was a sharp monthly fall of 2.9% in the chemicals and man-made fibres industry, and 1.9% in the transport equipment industries.
The falls in chemicals and transport accounted for 70 percent of the monthly decline in manufacturing output, ONS said.
Philip Shaw, economist at Investec bank, said: "This is a major shock given recent survey evidence had suggested manufacturing was rising out of recession.
Uncertainty
"Now we are left with considerable uncertainty about whether it really is recovering and about the pace of the recovery in the economy as a whole."
The fall comes a month after manufacturing output rose for the first time since August with a month-on-month increase of 0.2% during February.
Including the current downturn, the output figure for the three-month period to the end of March is now 1.5% lower than the previous quarter.
It is also 6.5% lower than a year earlier.

IFA warning on property pensions
By Paul Lewis
BBC Radio 4's Money Box
The government said it is not a suitable investment for most people
The government is considering regulating pension schemes which people run for themselves, the BBC has learned.
But advisors fear that any change will come too late to prevent property schemes being mis-sold to naive investors.
Around 100,000 people currently have a self-invested personal pension or SIPP. They are generally wealthier people and the pension money has to go into things like unit trusts or shares which are regulated.
But from next April, the government is sweeping away most pension rules and people will then be free to put unregulated investments into SIPPs. Already adverts are promoting the tax advantages when property, wine or stamps are put into these schemes. I think some developers will use it as an excuse to get rid of property that they were having difficulty with
Robert Reid, Syndaxi
But independent financial adviser Robert Reid of Syndaxi told BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme there could be trouble ahead.
"My main concern is that companies which are not regulated such as property developers will be using SIPPs to entice people to make property purchases which may not be in their best interest long term," he said.
"I think some developers will use it as an excuse to get rid of property that they were having difficulty with already."
And he warned that people who buy will have no redress.
"It will be very difficult to raise any complaint about the advice or the position they find themselves in," he said.
"If they go to the Ombudsman he will simply say 'the product is not regulated'. I do believe if SIPPs were regulated it would tighten this up."
Cornflake regulation
The Treasury has told Money Box that it will be issuing a consultation paper this month on regulating SIPPs through the Financial Services Authority.
Ian Dawson from SIPP trustee and administrator Wolanski opposes regulation of SIPPs themselves. He wants the investments in the SIPP to be regulated.
It would still leave unregulated products out there
Ian Dawson, Wolanski
"It's putting things the wrong way round. It's like regulating the cornflakes box not the cornflakes inside. "I am not sure it would work. It would still leave unregulated products out there. "Much better to insist that property developers, for example, have to get their scheme signed off by a regulator as unit trusts do now."
He also warned that regulation would put up his costs. He would rather advisers policed the system.
"I'm very much in tune with Robert Reid's concerns. "We have seen schemes that look a bit dodgy. But I think the problem is exaggerated. There are enough professional IFAs out there to make sure there isn't a mis-selling scandal."
The Financial Services Authority told the programme that if there was a change in regulation, it could not happen until sometime in 2007.
BBC Radio 4's Money Box was broadcast on Saturday, 3 September, 2005 at 1204 BST.

What now for Sri Lanka?
By Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News, Colombo
Mahinda Rajapakse must raise what has been a low profile
The victory of Mahinda Rajapakse in Sri Lanka's presidential election is being seen as a vote in favour of a hardline approach towards resolving the country's long-running ethnic conflict.
For many it signals a key moment in the country's history, where voters have picked a candidate heading an alliance with strong views on devolution of power to the Tamil minority, on the management of tsunami aid and on economic policy.
Nationalist and Buddhist parties strongly backed Mr Rajapakse and they expect to play an influential role in his administration.
The two main candidates, Mr Rajapakse and the main opposition leader, Ranil Wickramasinghe, had radically different approaches to the peace process and to economic policy.
Mr Wickramasinghe had said he would restart stalled peace talks if elected, and also favoured greater foreign investment and privatisation.
His defeat has come as a blow to business interests, particularly as the Sri Lankan economy is in crisis.
There are some who fear that with the three-year-old ceasefire stretched to the limit, a possible return to hostilities cannot be ruled out
The key factor in the election was the virtually non-existent Tamil vote in rebel-held regions of the north and east and areas like Jaffna town where the Tamil Tiger influence is strong.
The push for a boycott apparently came from the Tamil Tiger rebels.
There are some accounts of Tamils there being prevented from coming out to vote in polling stations located in government-held areas.
Although some areas of Colombo saw a lower Tamil vote, in many other parts of the country, Tamils did vote in large numbers and Mr Wickramasinghe benefited. He also received wide backing from the Muslim community.
But with the situation in the north and east, the effect of the normally critical minority vote was diluted.
Many see it as a lost opportunity for the Tamils.
"It was the one chance for Tamils to influence the incoming president and have a stake in future events," says SI Keethaponcalan, a Tamil lecturer at Colombo University.
"Now there is every danger of them being ignored in future election campaigns."
Peace platform
Analysts are divided on why the rebels pushed for a boycott, especially as Mr Wickramasinghe had campaigned on a peace platform.
Mr Rajapakse's allies will be sure to want a big say in government
Some say the rebels are frustrated at what they believe is the failure of successive governments to press on with the peace process.
Many Tamils living in the north and east genuinely believe that the Sinhalese-Buddhist majority will never allow them to enter into a power-sharing agreement.
But others question the rebels' commitment to the peace process.
They believe that by effectively sealing Mr Wickramasinghe's chances and helping usher in a hardline presidency, the rebels have laid the ground for confrontation.
For the past few months there has been a smattering of violent incidents in the north, and shadow fighting in the east.
There are some who fear that with the three-year-old ceasefire stretched to the limit, a possible return to hostilities cannot be ruled out.
Sri Lanka's new president is a popular politician with strong grassroots support in the Sinhalese-dominated south.
But Mr Rajapakse has never really played a leading role in Sri Lankan politics - even as prime minister he was overshadowed by the charismatic and controversial Chandrika Kumaratunga.
But as executive president, he now has a chance to come out of the shadows and play a decisive role in shaping his country's future.

Sad day for Indian cricket By Chris Morris
BBC News, Delhi
The first tournament was a hit in India (Photos: Indian Express) In the end the Indian government decided it simply could not take the risk.
Holding the second season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the same time as the country's general elections was too complicated and too risky. Over the course of a month, tens of thousands of paramilitary and police personnel have to be on duty for the elections - a massive logistical exercise. And in the aftermath of the attack of the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore, no-one could afford to take security for the IPL for granted. However awkward this decision seems to be, the potential alternative could have been worse. If there had been an attack on an IPL match - and if security was shown to be deficient - that would have been even more damaging for India's image abroad. Locally, it could have cost the government the general elections. Potential pitfalls
So with time running out, the Indian cricket authorities have decided that they have no option but to move the Twenty20 tournament abroad - lock, stock and barrel. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Cricket fans in India reflect on IPL's move abroad for the season
South Africa and England have emerged as the most likely destinations, but discussions on the details could take a few days. There are potential pitfalls everywhere: the weather, the availability of suitable grounds, the cost of moving the entire tournament, and of course security again - all will be factors in the decision. But the IPL will want to settle on a new destination as quickly as possible. The tournament is due to begin in less than three weeks' time. The main thing the IPL wants to ensure is that the schedule remains exactly the same. So matches will begin in the same prime time slots for the huge television audiences the IPL attracts in India. Tens of millions of pounds of television, sponsorship and advertising money are at stake. Commonwealth Games
During the tournament's inaugural season last year, the IPL swept the ratings in India.
The attack in Lahore showed the potential security risk
Other programmes were blown away as audiences turned in droves to what proved to be an intoxicating mix of cricket, Bollywood, drama and razzmatazz. Now the IPL faces the enormous task of recreating the same sense of excitement - from abroad. On TV, perhaps, it can be done. But franchises like the Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders, which would have been hoping to build brand loyalty among their local audiences, will be bitterly disappointed. That will now have to wait for another year. The IPL is determined that this move is only a temporary one, and the organisers want to retain a strong sense that this is an "Indian" event. Next year, the Commonwealth Games will be held here in Delhi. There will be no general election, and Indian and Commonwealth officials have already been stressing over the last few days that there is absolutely no question of moving the games. But this is a sad day for Indian sport. And it is obviously a serious blow to the Indian cricket authorities, not least financially, however brave a face they try to put on it.

Homes teeter on seaside land slip
One family has been told to move out of their home by insurers
Thousands of tonnes of earth have slipped away in front of homes on the Yorkshire coast leaving properties precariously balanced on a cliff edge.
Gardens and patios at Knipe Point are now in a heap 100ft (30.4m) below the homes on National Trust land at Cayton Bay, between Scarborough and Filey. Insurers have told one family to move out, while other locals wait for news.
A trust spokesman said the slip had been caused by water and it was impossible to predict the next one.
Michael Turner of the Residents' Association said there was growing concern in the area.
"People are very worried because at the moment they don't know what's going to happen, whether there will be any more slippage. "One family has been told to move out by their insurance company.
"We're just waiting for the results of investigations into what caused the land slip, but at the moment we're in limbo."
'Fits and starts'
National Trust property manager Bob Dicker said: "We know that this land is slipping, we know it's very active at the present time, but to put a scale on it at this stage would be unwise. We don't have enough information.
"What we're finding out, in some respects it's very obvious, we're finding out it is a land slip and we should be very careful to remember that - it isn't coastal erosion.
"The land slip itself is caused by water for the most part, there may be other causative agents, but mainly water. "
Homes are now perilously close to the edge of the cliffs
Mr Dicker said engineers were trying to find the source of the water that caused the slip.
"What we don't know is where is the water coming from and what sources there are in the immediate area. "
He said the land slippage had been happening in "fits and starts" and there had been quite a bit of activity for the last two or three months.
"Prior to that it had been very stable, if I can use that word, for quite some time.
"But it would be very foolish of me or anybody else to predict at the present time just what will happen either today or in ten years time. "We do hope to have more information fairly soon."

Census shows drop in Gaelic speakers
Gaelic-medium education is becoming more popular
The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland has reached an all-time low, according to new figures.
Numbers from the 2001 census, released on Thursday morning, confirmed the language is still in decline. The number of Gaelic speakers fell by 11% over 10 years to a figure of 58,650.
This is the first time that the number has fallen below 60,000, bringing Gaelic close to the figure at which it is thought a language can no longer survive. Older speakers
John Randall, the Registrar General for Scotland, said: "The decline was not unexpected but it was less rapid than between 1981 and 1991."
There are signs that the future of Gaelic is far from bleak.
The decline in numbers reflects the death of many older speakers but it does not take into account the recent boom in Gaelic medium education.
The primary school in Glasgow where all subjects are taught through Gaelic needs larger premises.
Religion
And in Edinburgh, the city council has just started a series of informal drop-in parent and toddler sessions targeted at non-Gaelic speaking families. Ministers say schemes like these suggest Gaelic's decline may have been arrested. Census results also showed that 42% of Scots regard themselves as being members of the Church of Scotland, compared to 16% who said they were Roman Catholics.
More than a quarter said they had no religion.

Burton Albion 3 - 0 Grimsby
Burton 3-0 Grimsby
Grimsby have been relegated from the Football League after falling to a final-day defeat away at Burton.The Mariners could have held on to their League Two status if they had won and Barnet had failed to beat Rochdale. But Grimsby were thoroughly outplayed at the Pirelli Stadium, and the Bees snatched a last-minute victory anyway. Greg Pearson fired into the top corner to put Burton ahead, Shaun Harrad made it 2-0 from close range and he sealed the win with a superb free-kick. Relegation to the Blue Square Premier ends Grimsby's 99-year stay in the Football League despite a brave battle after once being seven points adrift of safety. Victory over fellow strugglers Barnet last weekend set up a potentially miraculous escape, but their hopes were hit as early as the 10th minute when Pearson smashed in the opener from 20 yards. Grimsby had their chances in the first half with veteran goalkeeper Kevin Poole twice denying Town's Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro with superb saves. But as they piled on the pressure, the visitors were hit by a sucker punch when Burton top scorer Harrad bundled home his 21st goal of the season from Pearson's deflected cross. Poole continued to thwart the visitors with saves from Michael Coulson and Jamie Devitt in the opening minutes of the second half. But Albion's strikers were proving deadly and Harrad made it 3-0 with a superbly-struck 25-yard free-kick in the 58th minute. There was still time for Poole to produce an incredible one-handed stop to keep out Lee Peacock's effort, but by then it was all over for Grimsby anyway as Barnet secured a last-gasp win over Rochdale. Burton manager Paul Peschisolido told BBC Radio Derby:
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "It was brilliant. I told people my lads want to win every game and you saw it today. "Even when we were 3-0 up they were still going and still going. "It was difficult circumstances, playing against a team fighting for their lives, but we had that gritty determination."

Ted Durcan salutes the Epsom crowd after his win on Light Shift
Light Shift gave Henry Cecil a famous eighth Oaks win after holding off the challenge of Peeping Fawn in the closing stages at Epsom.
Ridden by Ted Durcan, the 13-2 shot made a decisive move to the top of the field with three furlongs to go.
The Cheshire Oaks winner first shrugged off the challenge of leader All My Loving, ridden by Christophe Soumillon.
Although Peeping Fawn put in a strong run, Light Shift found another gear late on to take the win.
Reaction: Cecil choked after 'fairytale' win
It was an emotional victory for former champion trainer Cecil, who also trained the pre-race favourite Passage of Time, who finished down the field.
Since his last Classic success, Love Divine in the 2000 Oaks, he has found success difficult to come by but he has been in resurgent form this season and Light Shift's win was greeted by loud cheers from the Epsom crowd. He told BBC Sport: "That reception was fantastic. I thought they would go very close. I don't know what happened to the other filly [Passage Of Time] yet. I thought there wouldn't be much between them.
"It's lovely for Ted. He's a marvellous jockey and a great friend. It's also marvellous for the staff. They have been a great support to me.
"This means a lot. I'd like to say thank you to everybody. It's lovely to be back again. The reception is quite embarrassing really. Thank you all so much."
606: DEBATE
I've rarely seen such emotion in a flat race - well done to Henry Cecil FM
The runners were taken through the early stages by Sues Surprise and Kayah, with Richard Hughes sitting pretty just behind the leaders on Passage Of Time.
However, coming round Tattenham Corner Hughes slightly lost his position on his charge as Mick Kinane moved the gambled-on All My Loving to the front.
But Durcan was alert and Light Shift soon shot three lengths clear for a famous victory.
Durcan added: "It's unbelievable. She's brave and she stays with you.
"I looked to switch in and I just angled out behind the Aga Khan's horse (Four Sins). Once I lit her up she picked up better than I expected and I probably went a bit early on her.
"I was hoping for something to lead me to the furlong and a half marker, but the one near me was stopping so I tried to hug the rail and squeeze her along.
"Once the second horse (Peeping Fawn) arrived she picked up again up the hill.
"She's improved. Henry's a master and it's an honour to win it for him."
