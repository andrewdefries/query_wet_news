Hindus jailed over Gujarat riots
The riots were some of the bloodiest in Indian history
A court in India's Gujarat state has sentenced eight people to life in jail for murder and other crimes committed during religious riots in 2002.
The men, all Hindus, were found guilty of burning seven Muslims to death. Three were also found guilty of rape.
Three others were convicted of lesser crimes and jailed for three years each.
At least 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in the riots, which were among India's bloodiest since partition in 1947.
Hard-liners
Those found guilty by the sessions court in the western city of Godhra included leaders of the hard-line movement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, Hindu World Council).
Chandradeep Parmar, a member of the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was also convicted.
There were 40 defendants - 29 were acquitted by the court.
The trial related to an attack on the family of a Muslim man, Sheikh Firoz Bhai, in the village of Eral in Panchmahal district on 2 March 2002.
Firoz Bhai, who works as a driver, survived as he was not at home when the attack took place.
The attackers burnt alive his wife, daughter, niece, parents and maternal grandparents.
Firoz Bhai told the BBC the court's punishment was inadequate and he would appeal.
The Gujarat government, led by BJP, was heavily criticised for failing to protect the state's Muslims during the rioting.
Violence broke out after 59 Hindus died in a blaze on a train at Godhra, allegedly after it was attacked by a Muslim mob. Although official figures put deaths during the rioting at more than 1,000, independent groups place the number closer to 2,000.

Gay row 'may cause Church split'
Dr Michael Nazir-Ali wants to uphold traditional teachings of the Bible
A traditionalist Anglican group has warned the issue of homosexuality could split the Church of England the way the Episcopal Church has done in the US.The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans will be launched in the UK on Monday. The group has campaigned against active homosexuality in the Anglican Communion after being established last year. One supporter, the Bishop of Rochester, the Right Reverend Michael Nazir-Ali, told the Sunday Telegraph homosexuals should "repent and be changed". Powerful lobbyThe fellowship was set up at a conference of conservative Anglican bishops and leaders in Jerusalem in the wake of the ordination of an openly gay bishop in New Hampshire, and includes a breakaway Anglican Church in the US. It promotes a traditionalist reading of the Bible which outlaws active homosexuality. The Bible's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman
The Right Reverend Michael Nazir-AliBishop of Rochester
BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott says the group constitutes a powerful lobby inside the communion to campaign against both the ordination of gay clergy and the blessing of same-sex relationships in church. The fellowship has already helped to unite traditionalist American congregations who left the Episcopal Church into a small separate Church. The group has warned that if what they claim is the Church of England's liberal drift continues it is likely to face a similar split. The breakaway Church in the US began as traditionalist congregations invited bishops from outside the country to oversee them. It is a step English traditionalists have warned they might also be prepared to take. 'Sexual nature'Ahead of the group's UK launch, Dr Nazir-Ali told the Sunday Telegraph: "We want to uphold the traditional teaching of the Bible. We believe that God has revealed his purpose about how we are made. "People who depart from this don't share the same faith. They are acting in a way that is not normative according to what God has revealed in the Bible. "The Bible's teaching shows that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is the way to express our sexual nature. "We welcome homosexuals, we don't want to exclude people, but we want them to repent and be changed."

Why people want peace in N. Ireland
By Dave Howard
Newsbeat politics reporter
Thousands of people in Northern Ireland have protested at the recent violence
These days, there's a whole generation of people who don't really remember serious violence in Northern Ireland.To some people, it can feel more like a history lesson than real life. There was concern that the killings of two soldiers and a policeman in March could re-ignite a bitter and bloody conflict that goes back decades - and is rooted in centuries of resentment. Tension in the province seemed to calm over the next few months but rose again in July at the beginning of the annual marching season. Twenty-one police officers were injured in violence in Belfast after rioting broke out in the north of the city before a parade was set to pass through. Earlier historyBritish involvement in Ireland goes way back - to the 12th century, when an English king invaded with an army. Five hundred years later, there was another big invasion - which led to decades of intense negotiation and bitter fighting. The English repeatedly quashed Irish attempts to get back their independence.
'Patrick' Azimkar and Mark Quinsey were shot dead in March
In the 1920s it turned into another war. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) were effectively fighting against their British rulers for independence. Ireland ended up getting split into two parts. It became British-run Northern Ireland as we know it, and a separate independent Irish state that we now call the Republic. 'The Troubles'In the late 1960s, decades of unrest in Northern Ireland bubbled over and fighting flared up again. Just like nowadays, there was a sizeable minority of Roman Catholics living there. But they held almost no political power. So they began to protest. It led to rioting and violence. Armed groups were formed to fight back against the IRA. They saw themselves as loyal to Britain - so they were called "loyalist" fighters. An IRA bomb killed five people at a Brighton hotel in 1984
British troops were sent to Ireland to keep the peace. But they were seen as yet more invaders, so they quickly got drawn into the conflict. The Catholic population were angry because they thought history was repeating itself. After that, there were 30 years of vicious bursts of fighting between the IRA and the British army. It affected the rest of the UK, with bombings on the British mainland, and loyalist groups would often retaliate whenever there were IRA attacks. Perhaps the best known violent episode came on 30 January 1972 - when British soldiers opened fire on a civil rights march. Fourteen people ended up dead and it became known as "Bloody Sunday". In 1984 an IRA bomb went off at a hotel in Brighton. The Conservative Party conference was going on at the time and many top politicians, including the then Prime Minister, were staying in the hotel. PM Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaped but five people were killed In total, during this whole period, over 3,000 people died. Good Friday AgreementIt's difficult to pick a point when Northern Irish peace started to be achieved. But if you had to choose, it might be 10 April 1998. Politicians from all sides got together to sign a document setting out how Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain would deal with each other. It was called The Good Friday Agreement. There were so many bitter arguments that people thought it was a miracle there was any agreement at all. The Good Friday agreement freed prisoners on both sides It meant that armed groups like the IRA and the loyalist fighters were supposed to put down their weapons. Prisoners from those groups were also meant to be released from jail. There were fears that the police force in Northern Ireland - called the RUC - was unfair to the country's Catholic community, and there were calls for it to be changed. It also meant politicians from all sides of the argument were elected to sit in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was seen as a massive step forward - even though a series of problems meant the Assembly's powers were repeatedly taken away. As the months and years have worn on, the gaps between the violence have seemed longer and people have become more optimistic about a lasting peace.

Pearson to put Hull finances in order
New Hull City chairman Adam Pearson has called in auditors as he bids to get the club's finances in order.The Tigers faced a fine from Companies House after publishing their 2008 figures, which revealed huge losses, several months late. Pearson told BBC Look North: "There is a requirement for funding over and above the income of the club but that is under control for us." The last accounts revealed a shortfall approaching £16m. Pearson added: "What is a more to medium to long-term problem is bringing the wages down in relation to the turnover. "We are working diligently to bring in extra finances but the short-term is fine it's just the medium and long-term that needs attention." Pearson has also confirmed that Caleb Folan will return from his loan spell with Middlesbrough. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

BBC SPORT | Tennis | Davydenko anger at 'ATP motives'
HomeNewsSportRadioTVWeatherLanguages
Low graphics|Help
By Simon Austin
Davydenko is unhappy about his treatment by the ATP
Nikolay Davydenko claims he is being victimised by the ATP because they want him out of the world's top 10.
The Russian's defeat by Argentine Martin Vassallo Arguello at the Sopot Open last August is being investigated by the governing body of men's tennis.
He told BBC Sport: "Maybe they just found one tennis player who they want to remove from the world's top 10?
"Maybe there is someone below me in the rankings who is more popular and they want to increase his popularity?"
He added: "Maybe I am just not that popular being number four in the world? Someone is trying to increase someone else's popularity."
But Etienne de Villiers, the chief executive of the ATP, described the Russian's claims as "fanciful".
I can understand his frustration (but) our only agenda is to protect the integrity of tennis
Etienne de VilliersATP chief executive
Report: ATP to fight corruption
"We are not investigating either player - we've never ever said this is about Davydenko or Arguello," De Villiers told BBC Sport.
"We said this is about an irregular betting pattern and we need to get to the bottom of it."
Gambling company Betfair voided all wagers on Davydenko's second-round match against Arguello in Poland last August because of irregular betting patterns.
The Russian was ranked four in the world as opposed to his opponent's 87, yet his odds started to lengthen considerably after he won the first set 6-2.
He lost the second set 6-3 and was trailing 2-1 in the third when he withdrew with a foot injury.
BBC Sport has been told that nine Russian account holders with Betfair stood to make about �750,000 from an Arguello victory.
Davydenko vigorously denies all allegations of wrongdoing. He told BBC Sport: "People think that just because I am rated number five in the world then I can't lose to someone who is rated 100.
If you are hurt, you withdraw, but I do not know how to not play in a match
Nikolay Davydenko
"Anything can happen to me. I can just have a bad match or I can be injured and lose the match. "When I see a player who is tired or in pain or maybe just doesn't want to play, I can understand that - he is not a robot. "I understand that he can't play in the match, he can withdraw. That's his business. If he is tired he withdraws this week and will try to do better the next. "I do not think that any of this has anything to do with betting. If you take all the matches I played and lost to those rated 100 and below, should this also be suspicious? "I have already lost to these players before while being in top five or top four. It happened last year and the year before."
The 26-year-old says he is angry about his treatment at the hands of the ATP since Sopot.
606: DEBATE
Is tennis doing enough to combat corruption?
In September, he was fined for not trying during a match against Marin Cilic at the St Petersburg Open, but this was subsequently overturned on appeal.
Davydenko is also frustrated that the ATP investigation into the match against Arguello is still ongoing.
"It makes me angry, because it takes so long," he said. "I can't understand what they want from me - I have given them everything, all the information. "When will this end? I do not have any trust in the ATP."
The ATP requested Davydenko's phone records when he was playing at the US Open last Autumn.
He initially refused to hand them over, because "I was playing at a very important tournament and they only gave me a week to do it", but did comply in early December. Now ATP investigators have requested the phone records of Davydenko's wife, Irina, and his brother and coach Eduard.
The duo have been given a deadline of 15 business days after Davydenko's last match at this month's Australian Open.
Davydenko faces betting inquiry
Davydenko is reported to be determined to dig his heels in and resist the latest request, saying: "If we allowed that to happen, they would be taking data from my grandmother".
ATP chief De Villiers said the reluctance of Davydenko and his entourage to hand over phone records allied with the Russian's complaints that the investigation was taking too long amounted to "a paradox".
"If you want to get to understand what happened, you use all the information you could possibly have," De Villiers said.
"Obtaining the records of players and their entourage is written into our rules.
"I can understand his frustration (but) our only agenda is to protect the integrity of tennis.
"It would be irresponsible of us not to be thorough, comprehensive and fair. That's the only thing we're trying to do here."
The world number four insists he would not even know how to throw a match.
"I have never done it and I do not know how to," he said.
"I know that if you are hurt, you withdraw, but I do not know how to not play in a match.
"It wouldn't be easy, because being the fifth in the world it is not easy to lose to someone who is ranked 100th."
