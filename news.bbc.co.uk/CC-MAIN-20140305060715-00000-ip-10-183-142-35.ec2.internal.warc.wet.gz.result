Profile: Yukio Hatoyama
Mr Hatoyama had wanted "a horizontal society bound by human ties"
Yukio Hatoyama, who resigned as Japan's prime minister in June 2010, was brought down by political funding scandals and his failure to fulfil an election pledge over US bases in the country.When he came to office in 2009 he was, at first glance, not unlike the man he ousted. Both he and his predecessor Taro Aso come from the political and industrial elite. Both had a prime minister for a grandfather. Mr Hatoyama's family founded tyre giant Bridgestone, Mr Aso's owned a leading mining company. Both men graduated from an elite university and spent time studying in the US, before joining the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But there their paths diverged. While Mr Aso climbed the LDP ranks, Mr Hatoyama left to form a new party. Just a year after Mr Aso became prime minister, he suffered a convincing election defeat at the hands of Mr Hatoyama and his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) - only the second time the LDP had been beaten since World War II, leaving the quiet, unassuming Mr Hatoyama at the reins of the world's second biggest economy. Largely unknown outside Japan, he was nicknamed the "alien" by his fellow party members, because of his somewhat quirky appearance and his reputation for being rather bland and inexpressive. Miyuki Hatoyama claims to have been on an alien spaceship to Venus
In fact much of the attention in the wake of the election victory focused on Mr Hatoyama's wife rather than the new prime minister himself. Miyuki Hatoyama, a former actress, claims she once visited Venus in an extraterrestrial adventure and met Tom Cruise in a past life. Mr Hatoyama and his wife have one son, an engineering scholar living in Russia. Party founderYukio Hatoyama walked away from the LDP in 1993. With a small group of lawmakers, he founded New Party Sakigake. The party was part of a reformist coalition that ousted the LDP in elections later that year. Mr Hatoyama served as deputy chief cabinet secretary under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa - but a funding scandal felled the government only eight months later and the LDP was soon back in power. Mr Hatoyama went on to co-found the Democratic Party of Japan. Initially a minor party, it merged with three others in 1998 and steadily increased in popularity. In 2002 he was forced to stand down as DPJ leader following strong criticism of his plan for a merger with more opposition groups. But he returned seven years later after the resignation of leader Ichiro Ozawa in another funding scandal. Policies will be determined by politicians rather than by bureaucrats
Yukio Hatoyama, 23 February 2009
By then the DPJ was in a position of strength. It had rebounded after a drubbing in the 2005 polls, mostly because of a succession of LDP gaffes, policy mix-ups and prime ministerial resignations. In July 2007 voters used upper house polls to show their displeasure with the LDP, awarding control of the house to the DPJ for the first time. Voters continued to desert the LDP as the economy faltered in late 2008 and into 2009. 'End collusion'In his manifesto ahead of the August general election, Mr Hatoyama said he wanted to wrest control from the hands of Japan's powerful bureaucrats. The Futenma base is deeply unpopular with many Okinawans
"I want to create a horizontal society bound by human ties, not a vertically-connected society of vested interests," he wrote. Mr Hatoyama also said he wanted to raise spending on healthcare, child support and subsidies for farmers. But he ruled out raising taxes to do this - prompting critics to ask where the money would come from. A key part of Mr Hatoyama's election campaign was a promise to reassess agreements with Washington over the Futenma US military base on the southern island of Okinawa. The island is home to tens of thousands of US troops. Residents angered by the high foreign military presence and incidents involving US forces - including the 1995 rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl - have staged large protests against the base. Mr Hatoyama had said he was in favour of moving the base from the island completely but in May 2010, was forced to admit that was not a feasible option and that instead, troops would be moved to a less populated part of the island. The move prompted an angry reaction from Okinawans and had immediate political repercussions for Mr Hatoyama. He fired a coalition partner from the cabinet after she said she could not back his decision - her party, the Social Democrats, then pulled out of the coalition entirely. Pressure built on Mr Hatoyama to stand down, not least from his own party, who feared a resounding defeat at mid-term elections to the upper house in July if he stayed at the top. He announced his resignation on 2 June, apologising to DPJ lawmakers for "causing enormous trouble" and saying his government had "not reflected the public's wishes".

Thomas Cook cuts 2,600 jobs
Fewer people are escaping to the sun
Travel giant Thomas Cook is axing 2,600 jobs across Europe.
The company said it was grounding some charter flights and closing 100 travel agencies, after reporting a 12% fall in bookings.
It has not said how many of the jobs will go in the UK.
Voluntary redundancy schemes and cuts in working hours have already been announced in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks in the United States. Thomas Cook operates 700 high street travel shops in the UK as well as the Thomas Cook and JMC tour operators. The company employs about 30,000 people across Europe. Its operations, distribution and internet business is based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, employing 1,600 people.
Kevin Booth, editor of the Peterborough Evening Telegraph, told BBC News Online: "Anything up to 200 jobs could be lost here in Peterborough. Thomas Cook is one of the city's major employers."
'Unfortunate'
Thomas Cook said in a statement from Germany that the number of jobs across the group would be cut by 10%.
Planned capital expenditure is to be reduced by 50%. Alan Stewart, chief executive of Thomas Cook UK said: "It's very unfortunate that we are having to look at cost reduction measures across the group, but very necessary given the current trading conditions."
Thomas Cook is jointly owned by German airline Lufthansa and department store group KarstadtQuelle. The company, which is Europe's second largest travel company, said it wants to keep annual profits at last year's level of 160 million euros (�100m). 'Buoyant'
Mr Stewart said more people were travelling overseas than last year at the moment and the UK package holiday market was "buoyant".
But customers were not booking holidays for this winter and next summer.
Thomas Cook chairman Stefan Pichler said new bookings across the group for the winter season were down by 12% on last year. "At present we have no indication that this situation will change in the short term and our responsibility to our company and our employees leads us to implement certain measures to safeguard our financial position and secure our continued success," he said.

Winslet wins best actress Bafta
Kate Winslet had been nominated twice in the best actress category
British actress Kate Winslet has been named best actress for her role in The Reader at the at the British Academy Film Awards in London.
She thanked her parents, who attended the ceremony. In her acceptance speech, she said she could not look at them, because "I will burst into tears".
Slumdog Millionaire has so far scooped five awards, including best director and best adapted screenplay.
Mickey Rourke was named best actor for his role in The Wrestler.
The late Heath Ledger has won best supporting actor at the British Academy Film Awards in London.
Brad Pitt's movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has won three awards for best production design, best make up and hair and special visual effects.
Penelope Cruz said she was "really honoured and grateful" as she was named best supporting actress for her role as Maria Elena in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.
She also dedicated the Bafta to the rest of the cast.
Presenter Jonathan Ross opened the first part of the show by telling the celebrity audience he was "nervous".
During a later link he managed to use the word "salad".
The word was significant as he had asked Twitter members to choose something unusual for him to say during the show.

The Duchess scooped the prize was best costume design and I've Loved You So Long, starring Kristin Scott Thomas, won best foreign language film.
Pinewood and Shepperton Studios received the outstanding British contribution to cinema award.
The studios have a heritage dating back nearly 75 years with more than 1,500 films made there, including The African Queen, Dr Strangelove and Superman.
Actor Jason Isaacs presented the award, saying they were "two of the greatest places on the planet to make a film".
Pinewood Shepperton chief executive Ivan Dunleavy said: "It is very pleasing to have that type of recognition for the work that goes on behind the scenes."
Sharon Stone presented the award for best British film to Man On Wire.
Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie and Pitt are among the stars who braved the cold weather to attend the ceremony.
Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel, who is up for best actor, revealed he was surprised at being nominated, saying "someone slap me" on the red carpet.
Patel's movie is favourite to win the prestigious best film award.

Terry Gilliam on receiving a Bafta Fellowship
Jonathan Ross Twitter page
Actor Noel Clarke, who took home the rising star award, told the BBC as he arrived that he was backing Winslet all the way.
Referring to the comments some critics made about her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in January, he said: "I think we should stop taking the mickey out of Kate Winslet and her acceptance speeches and get behind her more more."
Speaking before the ceremony Winslet told BBC News she was not "even going to talk about speeches" when asked about what she planned to say later if she won.
The star said she was keeping her fingers crossed about taking a trophy home with her.
"I've been doing this for a long time now and I really love what I do, I care very, very much, she said.
"My mum and dad are here with me tonight and I think they're secretly hoping I take home some hardware."
Former Monty Python star Terry Gilliam will receive a Bafta Fellowship in recognition of his contribution to film.
"I'm going to get very emotional and will probably need to be carried on stage in a blubbering heap," he said.
Gilliam's latest big screen adventure, The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus, was actor Heath Ledger's final film.
Danny Boyle was grateful his father was able to watch TV at home
He said the film "turned out great" and he hopes it will be a "fitting memorial" to the late star.
Held two weeks before the Academy Awards in Los Angeles, the Baftas are one of the key events of the so-called film awards season.
All four of last year's Bafta-winning actors went on to receive the same awards on Oscar night.
Landing one of Bafta's golden masks, however, is not a cast-iron guarantee of further prizes.
Last year, Keira Knightley's Atonement was named best film at the Baftas only to be trumped at the Oscars by the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Farah targets Euro gold
By Mark Butler
BBC Sport's athletics statistician
One of my early memories of televised athletics was the wonderful finish to the 1974 European 10,000m, where Tony Simmons so nearly took a gold medal on the first night of the championships.As an excited 14-year-old, I recorded David Coleman's commentary of the finish on a C60 cassette and played it again and again. For a moment it looked as if Britain would claim it's first ever European title in that event, but after 28 minutes of running Tony fell short by three hundredths of a second. Nevertheless his silver set the team off to an excellent championships, and the team was welcomed home by a record crowd at the seminal "Coke" international meeting at Crystal Palace which brought a new level of popularity to athletics. Thirty-six years later, our men are still waiting for that first 10,000m gold and here we are again at the start of a European Championships. This time we have two contenders - Mohamed Farah and Chris Thompson - who are more than 30 seconds quicker than the rest of the field this year. One of them could make British distance running history, take gold, and lift the entire team for the week ahead. Four years ago in Gothenburg the British showing was moderate, with just one gold from the relay on the last day, which was regrettably overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Dwain Chambers on his return from a doping ban. In the intervening years Britain have fared well at championships; in Osaka 2007 they could claim three unofficial European champions - athletes who were the highest-placed Europeans in their event at the World Championships. In Beijing 2008 it was five, then in Berlin at last year's Worlds there were as many as 11 events where the first European home was British. But being the top European in the world and winning the European title are two different things. For a start there are many more Europeans in action in Barcelona, a record number in fact. 606: DEBATE
Do you agree? Make your Euro Champs predictions
Second, so many of GB's top women are injured or unavailable including the likes of Christine Ohuruogu and Mara Yamauchi, who I feel could have won clearly from the fields we have here. Finally for most athletes a European medal will mean more than a top-six placing in a world final. Motivation will be greater and certainly that is true of the host nation Spain. It is the Spanish men who will be provide biggest danger to Mo and Chris on Tuesday night, but hasn't that country already won enough in sport this month? My rough prediction is that Britain will fare batter than the 11 medals they took in Gothenburg, but not quite as well as those 11 "virtual" golds from Berlin (plus five silvers and two bronzes). Below are my picks of who I think will win gold in each event.

Watford 2 - 2 Blackpool
Gary Taylor-Fletcher scored to make it four draws from four Championship games for Blackpool.Watford led at half-time after Tommy Smith, strongly linked with a move to Reading, slotted in from 12 yards. Alex Baptiste swept in an equaliser after Scott Loach saved Jason Euell's header but Tom Cleverley restored the lead from Smith's excellent cross. Blackpool levelled nine minutes later when Taylor-Fletcher rifled home a low cross from Charlie Adam. Watford manager Malky Mackay: "It was frustrating in that we created so many chances and let the game slip with two bad goals as far as I'm concerned. "However, we dominated the game for large periods and to create the chances we created is signs for great optimism as far as the group is concerned and real confidence for the group playing with each other. "I hope that is something the public see that they're starting to actually play together and look as if their causing a lot of problems for teams." Blackpool boss Ian Holloway: "What we didn't do was attack well enough with the possession that we had. "With our two wide men and our front three, never did I bring my people back and defend with five across the middle. "If he thinks I'm going to come here and defend against Watford he's got another thing coming." Live text and stats
