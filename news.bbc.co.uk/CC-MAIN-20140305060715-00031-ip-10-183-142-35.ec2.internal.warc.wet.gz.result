Madonna takes Coward role
Madonna with daughter Lourdes: Developing her acting career
Pop star Madonna has agreed to appear in a film adaptation of Noel Coward's 1951 play Quadrille. US entertainment industry newspaper Variety reports that she will play the wife of an English aristocrat who has eloped to the south of France with the wife of an American industrialist.
Madonna's character joins the industrialist to pursue their spouses, hoping to bring them back home to avoid scandal. The two develop a close friendship, which leads to romance and filming is due to begin in London and France early next year. Madonna has just completed work on The Next Best Thing with Rupert Everett, a comedy drama about a straight woman and a gay man who decide to have a child together - but later wind up in a custody battle over their son.
Quadrille is not the only Coward work which is heading to the cinema screen.
Noel Coward: 16 December marks 100 years since his birthJulie Andrews is working on Relative Values alongside Colin Firth, Stephen Fry, Jeanne Tripplehorn and William Baldwin. Filming is currently taking place in the Isle of Man.
The story is an account of a love triangle involving English aristocrats and Hollywood celebrities in the 1950s. It marks Julie Andrews' first film role in eight years.
Hollywood's recognition of Coward comes nearly 100 years after his birth in Teddington, Middlesex.
His last play to make it to the big screen in English was Tonight At 8.30 in 1952, although he co-wrote the 1967 film A Matter of Innocence, starring Hayley Mills.
Productions of Coward's plays are being staged across the UK and US to mark his centenary year, including A Song At Twilight at London's Gielgud Theatre, starring both Vanessa and Corin Redgrave. An academic conference to discuss his work is being held at Birmingham University on 1 and 2 November.

Milosevic is 'fighting fit'
Mr Milosevic is reported to have been a model prisoner
Legal advisors to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic say he is in good form and geared up to face a tribunal next week, where he could be indicted for genocide.
He once said to me during a visit - they can lock me up, they can convict me, but they can never break my spirit Dragoslav OgnjanovicLawyer
Mr Milosevic has been awaiting his trial at The Hague in a special prison unit, where he has been able to make regular trips to the gym and even enjoy the services of a masseur.
"He is in top form. His morale is good. He is ready to confront everything that awaits him," said lawyer Dragoslav Ognjanovic after visiting Mr Milosevic at the Scheveningen detention centre.
Mr Milosevic will stand trial on Tuesday on charges which include crimes against humanity in Croatia in 1991 and Kosovo in 1999, and genocide in Bosnia during the period from 1992 to 1995. He has refused to appoint lawyers to defend him in the court, as he says he does not recognise the authority of the UN tribunal.
Unbroken
However, lawyers from Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, France, the United States and Canada have made their way to the detention centre to provide Mr Milosevic with counsel.
He also receives up to 2,000 letters a week, the majority of which offer support and good wishes, said Mr Ognjanovic.
He is being held in comfortable conditions
"He is doing very well considering the context and all the dirt that is being published about him and the psychological war being waged against him," he said.
"He once said to me during a visit: 'they can lock me up, they can convict me, but they can never break my spirit and suppress the truth'."
Canadian attorney Christopher Black also denied reports that Mr Milosevic was so depressed he might even take his own life, and insisted the former president was upbeat.
"His morale's always been good and he's never been suicidal in his whole life," said Mr Black, implying that the authorities might have sinister motives for making such suggestions.
Celine CDs
When he is not receiving counsel or reading letters, Mr Milosevic is reported to have passed the time reading novels by Ernest Hemingway and John Updike, as well as listening to the BBC World Service and Celine Dion CDs.
He is free to mix with the other detainees, playing cards with them and helping them to brush up on their English.
Inmates are allowed to wander freely around the unit for 12 hours each day.
They can cook a meal in the shared kitchen, play volleyball in the prison sports hall or browse the library, according to the prison authorities.

Afghan UK troop boost considered Gen Dannatt said the campaign was a "marathon, not a sprint" Extra British troops may be sent to Afghanistan, the head of the Army, General Sir Richard Dannatt, has said.
Sir Richard told the Times part of 12 Mechanised Brigade - who had been training for deployment to Iraq - was now "earmarked" for Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defence said there was no decision on the number or timeline. Meanwhile the US is planning to send an extra 4,000 troops to help train Afghan security forces, on top of 17,000 reinforcements already due to arrive. The extra troops are expected to arrive in June, according to US Senator Carl Levin. If we were to send another 4,000... there would be a risk of replicating the pressures on the Army that we are trying to avoid
General Sir Richard Dannatt
The Times said Downing Street had taken part in discussions about a British surge, ahead of an expected requested from the US for more troops. Gen Dannatt said there were no plans to send the whole brigade of 4,000 troops. He said the new level of troops would lie "somewhere in between" the current 8,000 and the 12,000-strong presence the UK would have if the whole brigade was sent. Gen Dannatt said sending a whole brigade would put too much strain on Army resources. "If we were to send another 4,000... there would be a risk of replicating the pressures on the Army that we are trying to avoid," he told the paper. Afghanistan was going to be a "marathon campaign, not a sprint," he added, saying that members of the forces needed time off. New strategy
This week the new UK ambassador to Afghanistan said British forces may be in the country for another five years while civilians could stay more than 20 years. Mark Sedwill, whose job will involve close liaison with the British military command, said the Afghan army and police should be strong enough in five years to take over. British workers would be there much longer helping with reconstruction and development, he added. Some of the new US troops already announced will be deployed in Helmand province, where British and Taleban forces have been involved in fierce fighting. President Barack Obama is expected to announce the latest extra commitment on Friday when he outlines his new Afghanistan strategy.

Analysis: Faith schools and quotas Some want a cap of 25% of pupils of any one faith By BBC education correspondent Mike Baker
The reports into the race riots in the north of England have highlighted the role played by schools, particularly faith schools, in keeping different ethnic communities separate from each other. Ministers have refused to back down from their commitment to allow the creation of more church and other faith-sponsored schools
One key report recommends that faith schools, and others in areas dominated by one ethnic group, should give at least 25% of their places to children from other backgrounds. The government recently committed itself to the expansion of church and faith-sponsored schools, and says it is not in favour of forcing them to take pupils of other faiths. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said: "We want to encourage faith schools to take pupils of other beliefs but we cannot oblige them to do so, nor would we want to." Bad timing
From the moment it was proposed in Labour's election manifesto, this expansion of faith-based schooling has been controversial. The Church of England subsequently announced proposals to create 100 new secondary schools. Ministers could not have anticipated the events that happened in the following few months: The riots in Oldham, Bradford and Burnley, the problems at the Holy Cross Primary school in Belfast, then the terrorist attack in New York. Privately, ministers accept the timing has been "terrible". So far, they have refused to back down from their commitment to allow the creation of more church and other faith-sponsored schools where local people want them. But they are still in negotiations over new guidance covering the creation of faith schools, due to be published in the New Year. Quotas
The report on the riots published by the Community Cohesion Review Team says "a significant problem is posed by existing and future mono-cultural schools, which can add significantly to the separation of communities". It recommends that a requirement for a minimum of 25% of youngsters from other backgrounds should apply to both state and independent schools, whether they are faith or non-faith based. But the education spokesman for the Local Government Association, Graham Lane, says this proposal "does not go far enough". He has proposed requiring new faith schools to reserve 70 to 75% of places for children from other backgrounds. Mirror to society
According to Mr Lane, schools with around a quarter of their admissions based on religious beliefs would still be able to maintain a distinct faith-based ethos. The Local Government Association - which represents local education authorities - says quotas could be introduced through new guidance on school admissions without the need for legislation. But ministers are not keen on introducing quotas. They believe segregation in schools is not the result of faith schools but of segregation in society. They argue it is better to have faith schools within the state system, where they are required to offer a broad curriculum, than in the private system. Instead of quotas, ministers would prefer the new guidance to stress the need for faith schools to form partnerships and links with other local schools. Full special report

'We are not involved in regime change'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
US President Barack Obama has defended the intervention in Libya while cautioning that overthrowing Colonel Gaddafi by force would be a mistake. Explaining the UK's position on the Today programme, Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was "not involved in regime change". "We would like him [Gaddafi] to go but militarily what we're involved in is the [UN] resolution. We will stick strictly to the [UN] resolution," he told John Humphrys. "It's for the people of Libya to determine their future." While the Secretary General of Nato told the programme
that anyone who attacked civilians, including the rebels, could face military attack, Mr Hague was more cautious. "They have not attacked civilians so I am not going to threaten them," he said. And he would not be drawn on whether the UK would fight for criminal proceedings against Gaddafi should he be forced from power, although he does want him to face justice. "I'm not going to chose Col Gaddafi's retirement home," he said. Get in touch with Today via email
