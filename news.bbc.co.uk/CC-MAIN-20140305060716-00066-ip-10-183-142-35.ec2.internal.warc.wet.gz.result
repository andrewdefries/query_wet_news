Profile: Tito the spaceman
Tito has undergone 900 hours of cosmonaut training
Forty years after Yuri Gagarin became the first man in orbit, an American businessman has become the world's first space tourist.
Tito in space
Degrees in aerospace engineering
Worked for Nasa in the 1960s
Estimated $200m fortune
Wants to become a goodwill space ambassador for George W Bush
Dennis Tito blasted off on his trip to the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday, having paid Russian space chiefs a reported $20m (�14m) for the privilege.
Tito is on board a Russian supply ship as a passenger, riding with two veteran cosmonauts. The flight makes the 60-year-old the 415th person in space - and the first as a paying traveller.
The flight is a dream come true for the Californian financier, who has been trying to join the elite club of space travellers for decades.
Hard fight
"It is not going to be a holiday (but) to me it is a life's dream and the start of a new career," Tito told journalists, during a break from training for the mission.
Tito, from Los Angeles, started his career as a space scientist, designing flight trajectories for three historic Mars missions in the 1960s.
Tito will blast off on a Soyuz rocket
He worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena for five years, before leaving to set up the finance company Wilshire Associates, through which he made his fortune.
But despite his millions, Tito has had to fight to blaze a trail for a new generation of adventure tourists.
He first looked into a space vacation in 1991, on a trip to Moscow. And when he did finally get hold of a ticket into space he suddenly found it to be null and void thanks to Russia's decision to scuttle the Mir space station before it fell uncontrollably from the sky.
Civilian history
Russian space officials later offered him a ride on a Russian rocket ship supplying the ISS. Tito's former employer - Nasa - initially objected to the trip, citing safety concerns.
Tito is a celebrity in Russia
But international space officials finally agreed that Tito could fly, subject to him signing a deal relieving all national space agencies of responsibility in the event of a tragedy.
Tito also signed a contract saying he will pay for any breakages he causes and he is banned from US segments of the ISS unescorted.
Tito may be the first to pay for a trip into in space, but he is not the first civilian to make the journey. One of Nasa's early attempts to put a non-professional in space ended in disaster when teacher Christa McAuliffe and the crew she was flying with were killed in the Challenger explosion in 1986.
Tito also follows confectionery scientist Helen Sharman, who in 1991 beat thousands to become Britain's first astronaut, a Japanese journalist and a member of the Saudi royal family, who both went to Mir.

Student goes hip-hop for science
Jonathan Chase is set to perform the rap at the Science Museum in London
A postgraduate student who uses his love of hip-hop to make science easier to understand has been commissioned by space agency NASA to write a rap.
Jonathan Chase, who is studying at the University of Glamorgan in south Wales, was asked to come up with the Astrobiology Rap for a NASA magazine.
The song and video can be seen on You Tube and Mr Chase, from Wembley, London, will visit schools in Wales.
Mr Chase said he wanted to make scientific ideas more accessible.
The song features lyrics like: "We've been on Earth for many years and we are still producing answers; as time passes, collective knowledge advances".
The 28-year-old science communication student has also been asked to perform his rap at the science museum in London on Wednesday.
I hope that I can continue to create these raps to address the various aspects of science
Jonathan Chase
He said: "Rap and hip-hop music is my passion and I had the idea of combining it with science to make basic scientific ideas more accessible.
"Being commissioned by NASA to produce the Astrobiology Rap was a great compliment and I am delighted with its success.
"I hope that I can continue to create these raps to address the various aspects of science."
Mr Chase, who holds two undergraduate degrees in aerospace engineering and science and science fiction, is now visiting schools in south Wales to engage pupils in rap and science.
Professor Mark Brake, who leads the science communication course at the University of Glamorgan, said: "Jon's approach is light-hearted, informative, and entertaining.
"It uses rap in story form. Just as science fiction narrative comments on the world through a "hard" or "soft" science lens, rap comments on the world through a "hard" or "soft" emotional lens."
Mr Chase's Astrobiology Rap will appear in the latest edition of NASA's Astrobiology Magazine European Edition.

Doncaster 0-4 Bolton
By Ian Hughes
Virtual Replay: 3D animation of Teymourian's second goal Davies set Bolton on their way to victory
Bolton strolled into the FA Cup fourth round after a clinical performance.
The Premiership side took only eight minutes to score, Kevin Davies coolly volleying into the corner from Stelios Giannakopoulos' clever, chipped pass.
Donny almost equalised but Ian Walker superbly saved Mark McCammon's header, and Andranik Teymourian made them pay when he drove home into the top corner.
Idan Tal followed up his own shot to score Bolton's third before Teymourian slid in his second after the break.
Interview: Doncaster striker Paul Heffernan
Interview: Bolton striker Kevin Davies
Playing the first FA Cup match in their new Keepmoat Stadium, Dons never managed to look anything other than a side which plays two divisions beneath Bolton.
Nervous in defence and hesitant on the ball, the hosts failed to rise to their new surroundings and the challenge of a potential giant-killing act.
606 DEBATE: Your thoughts on the match
Instead they were grateful that keeper Ben Smith was able to make fine stops from Teymourian, in particular, and a host of Bolton players, who began to form a queue to try their luck.
Unfortunately for Smith, he could do little to keep out any of Bolton's efforts - starting with Davies' sweetly-struck opener.
The same was true of Teymourian's rising drive as Bolton extended their lead, just moments after the Iranian had been denied by Smith.
And Smith must have felt everything was against him when he proved equal to Tal's shot only for the Bolton midfielder to convert the rebound.
It seemed the goal would be disallowed as the assistant referee flagged for offside against two Bolton players, but referee Dermot Gallagher overruled.
Bolton added a fourth shortly after the break when Davies squared the ball for the on-rushing Teymourian to collect, avoid a lunging challenge and then calmly stroke into the bottom corner.
From then on, Bolton selected cruise control and allowed Doncaster a little more time and space on the ball.
But whereas the visitors' finishing had been clinical, Dons failed to take advantage of a couple of promising moments despite Paul Heffernan's best efforts to snatch a consolation.
Doncaster manager Sean O'Driscoll: "We were brave in what we tried to do, but they were bigger, stronger and faster. I can't complain.
"At four-nil up they had 10 men behind the ball working hard. We can take a lot from learning how they have got where they've got. They were excellent.
"If we can learn our lessons and progress from having played against them, we'll be a better side for it."
Bolton boss Sam Allardyce:"It was a tricky tie but we have made it look easy. � "We made a lot of changes but the fluidity of the side was still good and that was very pleasing. � "I was pleased that we played in their new stadium because it would have been a bit daunting for some of our players if it had been at their old ground."

Warne to quit one-day game
Warne is preparing for his exit from the one-day stage
Shane Warne has announced he will quit playing one-day cricket immediately after the World Cup in an attempt to prolong his Test career.The 33-year-old revealed his move as the Australian squad arrived at their hotel in Sydney ahead of Thursday's VB Series clash with England."I'm going to retire from one-day international cricket when the World Cup finishes," he said.
Your say: Warne the best ever?
"The World Cup is once every four years and I thought it was a great opportunity for me to end my one-day career internationally."
The number one priority for me is to play Test cricket for as long as I can
Shane Warne
Warne has taken 288 wickets in 191 one-day internationals, but has been troubled by shoulder problems in recent years.He dislocated his shoulder in a limited-overs match against England in December and admitted he had considered retirement before deciding to carry on."I love playing cricket for Australia but the number one priority for me is to play Test cricket for as long as I can," he said.
Feature: Shane Warne
"I'm only 33 and think I've still got a lot of cricket left for Australia."Warne could return to action for the first of the best-of-three-matches finals at the SCG.Warne, man of the match in Australia's victory over Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup final, is already Australia's greatest wicket-taker in both Tests and one-dayers.
Sport Academy: Spin like Shane
He was named in Australia's World Cup squad while recuperating from the injury.In the Test arena, he has 491 wickets from 107 matches at an average of 25.71.
