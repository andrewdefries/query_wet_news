They were the only UK band to feature in the American top 10, while the UK's chart was also dominated by home-grown artists. US disco group Scissor Sisters were the only foreign act to make a dent in the UK chart, with their eponymous debut album at number nine. Amy Winehouse's 2006 album Back to Black was at number three in the chart. A long-awaited follow-up has been been hindered by her personal problems, but her record label bosses are hopeful it will appear in 2010. David Gray's White Ladder, released in 2000, made up the top 5 UK best-selling albums of the decade. In the US, boy band N'Sync's No Strings Attached was the second biggest seller of the past 10 years, followed by Norah Jones's Come Away With Me, according to Billboard. Rapper Eminem scored two top five bestsellers. The Marshall Mathers album of 2000, was at four, while the 2002 follow-up, The Eminem Show, was at five.

Unrwa head to go against his will
Peter Hansen has been the focus of Israeli criticism for a long time
Reports from the UN and Copenhagen say the outgoing head of the UN relief agency for Palestinians, Peter Hansen, is leaving his post against his will.
Interviewed by a Danish newspaper, Mr Hansen said UN chief Kofi Annan had rejected his offer to stay on.
UN officials quoted by Reuters say this was due to a long campaign against him by Israel and the United States.
Mr Hansen said it was no secret that several members of the US Congress had petitioned for his departure.
Mr Hansen, a Dane, has lead Unrwa since 1996.
He has been critical of the Israeli army's conduct in the occupied territories, and Israel has repeatedly called for his resignation.
Mr Annan told reporters on Monday that Mr Hansen was among a number of UN officials who would be leaving their posts. He remains in the job until March when his mandate expires. 'US opposes reappointment'
Reuters reports UN officials as saying that the US, the single largest donor to the agency, has argued against the reappointment of Mr Hansen on grounds he had served long enough and the agency needed new blood, the officials said.
Rocket or stretcher? Israel had to withdraw allegations against Unrwa
The US was the only member of the advisory board opposing Mr Hansen's reappointment, a UN official told Reuters.
Mr Hansen has often clashed with Israeli officials. He has criticised Israel over home demolitions, what he sees as indiscriminate fire by Israeli forces and Israeli policies that he believes contributed to economic collapse and growing hunger among about 1m refugees in Gaza. Rows In October 2004, Israel released a video tape it alleged showed militants transporting a rocket in an Unrwa ambulance. This proved to be false, and the Israeli army was forced to withdraw the allegation.
Mr Hansen accused the Israeli government of disseminating "deliberately inciteful, false and malicious propaganda".
Mr Hansen was also strongly criticised by Israel over comments he made to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in which he said his agency did not exclude Hamas members from working for it.
"Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another," Mr Hansen said.
Israel called for a UN investigation.
Unrwa was formed to relief the Palestinian refugee crisis that followed the establishment of Israel in 1948. It currently provides regular food aid to about 1.5m Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It also runs schools and clinics, and provides shelter for thousands of Palestinians made homeless by Israel's house demolition policy.

'Limbo' of anguished parents
It has been an "emotional rollercoaster" for the Dowlers
By BBC News Online's Jenny Matthews
Parents of children who go missing say it is the "not knowing" which is the most difficult thing to deal with.
Police have already described the "emotional rollercoaster" for Sally and Robert Dowler since their 13-year-old daughter Milly vanished five weeks ago.
And the Dowlers themselves said the agony was particularly intense when a body was found nearby on Wednesday - and then turned out not to be their daughter.

The National Missing Persons Helpline told BBC News Online all parents tell them it is the "not knowing" which is the worst.
"If someone you love goes missing you can't help but keep running through the worst possible scenarios in your mind," said spokesperson Jessica Prasad.
"You really don't get any peace until there is some kind of closure.
"Some people say that even if they learn their child is dead that at least gives them some kind of closure, so they can move on and go through the mourning process.
"Otherwise they can be stuck in a kind of limbo forever."
Scanning the TV
She said all parents found it extremely difficult to get on with their lives while waiting to find out what had happened to their child.
"Some parents are afraid to leave the phone or go out for too long, because that could be the hour or 10 minutes their child decides to call.

"Others say every time they watch television they're scanning the audience in case they see their relative. "Even in the streets they're constantly scanning people's faces to see if they can see them."
Some parents have to go for years not knowing what has happened to their child, she said - and every time a body was found, they would frantically think: "Is that my child?"
Eventually some people find it easier to declare their relative legally dead - which can be done after seven years.
"It's quite a final thing to do but it can provide some sort of closure for people who just can't live with this constant situation of not knowing.
"But other people would find this impossible because they're still clinging onto any shred of hope that one day the person will be found."
Media appeals
Ms Prasad said there were few things parents could do to ease the pain - although appealing for sightings and making sure they could be contacted helped.
"They can in the initial stages contact local or national media if they want to - that depends very much on the family - as an appeal to their loved one, and also as an appeal for sightings.
"Then they can register the missing person with the police and with the National Missing Persons Helpline, so that if any sightings of their relative are made, they can be contacted."
As for support, most parents in the Dowlers' situation would have a police liaison officer to talk to.
Support group call
And people registered with the National Missing Persons Helpline would have a case worker they could call to talk to, to find out if there is any information or just to get things off their chest.
Ms Prasad said two things could be done to make life slightly more bearable for parents in the Dowlers' situation.
One was the funding of a mutual support group where parents of missing children could contact and help each other.
The other was Home Office funding for a comprehensive national police database of all missing persons, to speed up the process of identification and contact.

Paisley aims to 'Trump' golf club
Donald Trump is considering buying land in County Antrim
First Minister Ian Paisley has met American billionaire Donald Trump over possible plans to develop a �1bn golf complex in Northern Ireland.
Mr Trump will decide in the next 30 days whether or not to buy a site in County Antrim.
The pair met in New York on Tuesday after Mr Paisley found out the businessman was interested in investing in Northern Ireland. The first minister said they had a good discussion.
Last week the property tycoon had proposals turned down by Aberdeenshire Council to build the resort there.
Environmental groups
However, Scottish ministers have stepped in to decide whether or not to give the site the go-ahead.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Trump Organisation's head of international development, George Sorial, said the company was not considering appealing the plans, for the Menie Estate near Balmedie. The Trump International Links scheme was to include two championship golf courses and 1,500 homes. Mr Trump claimed he needed to build the houses to pay for the development, which he wanted to construct over the next five years at the 1,400 acre site. The proposals were criticised by some environmental groups and local campaigners but, at the same time, received backing from some business figures. A Scottish government statement issued on Tuesday said: "Ministers recognise that the application raises issues of importance that require consideration at a national level. "Calling the application in allows ministers the opportunity to give full scrutiny to all aspects of this proposal before reaching a final decision." E-mail this to a friend
