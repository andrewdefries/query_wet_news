China flood death toll 'over 500'
Guangdong is seeing its worst flooding for at least 90 years
Summer floods in China have killed 567 people and forced over two million from their homes, the government has said.
Torrential rains in much of the country have left areas of southern China submerged beneath muddy waters in the deadliest early floods for a decade.
Heavy rains have come sooner than usual, leaving the city of Wuzhou, and the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong seriously affected.
President Hu Jintao has ordered officials to increase emergency relief.
"Faced with a serious fight against the floods... we must quickly step up efforts at organising construction and inspections of major dykes, reservoirs and reserve flood areas," he said at a flood prevention meeting, quoted by People's Daily newspaper.
Officials have warned of the spread of cholera and other intestinal diseases.
The Chinese Health Ministry said, quoted by China News Service, that nearly 3,400 cases of cholera, dysentery and typhoid fever had been recorded in the first six months of the year, and that the figure was still rising.
The worst flooding in recent years was in 1998, when 4,150 people died.
Rivers have burst their banks and mudslides have contributed to the death toll in the south, where 124 people died in the past week, Chinese state media said.
Central drought
Chinese officials expressed concern that the floods have yet to peak.
Some 2.45 million people have been evacuated from their homes, officials said.

In Wuzhou, a city of 300,000 people, residents were forced to construct makeshift boats and rafts as flood water approached the upper floors of houses.
Meanwhile water levels reached their highest in at least 90 years in the Pearl River, which flows past the regional business centre Guangdong.
Much of China is hit by floods every year, often spreading quickly because of deforested hillsides that trigger landslides and do not prevent flood waters from building up.
The floods, which have come early in the annual wet season, have caused an estimated 22.9bn yuan ($2.77bn) worth of damage, reports say.
Hong Kong was hit by heavy rains on Friday, causing traffic delays.
Services on the main rail line from Hong Kong to China were suspended after a landslide. The situation in the south contrasted with soaring temperatures in central and northern regions.
The central province of Anhui is enduring a record drought, while a heat wave has persisted in the Chinese capital, Beijing.

The following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far:
Yesterday was the worst flooding I have seen in my 8 years in Hong Kong, it was terrible whole streets were turned into rivers. Unfortunately I had a meeting to attend in Zhongshan (about 150km NW of HK), all the ferries were cancelled and we had to take the train to Guangzhou and then drive down to Zhongshan. The flooding was extensive although it seemed business as usual for most people. My return journey to HK took 6 hrs as opposed to the normal 1.5 hrs due to severe flooding around the Zuhai area. All of the rivers in Pearl River Delta are very swollen and moving rapidly. They forecast more rain for the next few days and I have another meeting coming Tuesday across the border! Devon Bovenlander, Hong Kong, China Never have I seen anything like this in Hong Kong. Some roads flowed like a rapid river. You can even see emergency ambulances breaking down on the streets because of the flooding.Nicholas Lee, Mei Foo, Hong Kong
Heavy rain continues to fall in Hong Kong and Southern China. Although Hong Kong's hilly terrain can deal with the storm water better than the surrounding low-lying plains of Southern China, many roads on Hong Kong island have been closed today as normally dry water courses have erupted into spectacular waterfalls, breaking retaining walls and depositing rubble, sand and mud across roads - even flowing into the ground floor entrances of apartments. There was a brief respite this afternoon when the sun shone for a while but it is back to thundery showers again now. The weather forecast predicts no let up until next Thursday at least.Dave England, Pokfulam, Hong Kong

Canberra and pigeons in firing line
By Nick AssinderBBC News Online political correspondent
Trade secretary Patricia "I'm no Blair babe" Hewitt is an Aussie and proud of it.
Unfortunately she is far from enamoured of the nation's capital and her home town, Canberra.
And, in what has all the makings of a nasty diplomatic incident, she has given the place a major thumbs down.
Earl's attack on Blair
Tony Blair has taken a lot of flak for his recent globetrotting - but few have been as vicious as the Tory Earl of Onslow.
Speaking during a debate on the army in the Lords he declared: "Mr Blair goes prancing around the Indian subcontinent, heavily disguised as Peter Sellers, without the accompaniment of Sophia Loren, with a magic carpet on his head." Just how many people can you insult in one sentence - the prime minister, his wife Cherie, large sections of the Indian people - and probably Sophia Loren and Peter Sellers' family as well. According to Ms Hewitt, Canberra is the sort of one horse town that, to quote the song, looks better looking back.
She told startled political journalists in Westminster that she grew up in the town in the 1950s, "couldn't wait to get out" and has never looked back.
When asked what she had got against the place she quoted that other well known master of diplomacy, Prince Phillip.
"Prince Phillip famously came to Canberra and said 'city with no soul' - that's what I think."
Her comments will undoubtedly dismay the local tourist board which describes the capital as Australia's most talked about city.
It lies, the board boasts, in the middle of sheep country and kangaroos can often be seen in the city centre.
It now seems likely that when Ms Hewitt returns home to visit her mother she will be about as welcome with the locals as a rattle snake in a lucky dip - as they might say.
Preying on politics
Pigeons are on the run
Inhabitants of Westminster's Portcullis House - the expensive new home for MPs - have recently been taken aback by the sight of shadowy figures darting around the "rafters" in the elaborate, glass-roofed courtyard at the heart of the building.
It is even rumoured that the sightings are usually accompanied by unearthly screeching sounds.
But the ghostbusters can stand down. These eerie sightings are entirely natural - if a little unusual.
The courtyard is such a large, dry and airy space that the local pigeon population has made it their new home.
These disgusting creatures have been pestering the inhabitants ever since the place opened. But the ever-ingenious parliamentary works department has finally come up with the answer - birds of prey.
An ideal home for pigeons
Apparently a specialist company visits the building every month or so with a Kestrel or other raptor which is let loose to do what it does best.
According to my source the birds of prey fly around the building "scaring the droppings out of the pigeons, which soon get the message".
No one will reveal how many pigeon casualties there have been - but these are times of war after all.
Setting the pace
Meanwhile, as Mr Blair appears eager to break every record going for the most countries visited in the shortest period of time, he is facing a serious challenger.
The new permanent secretary at the FCO and head of the diplomatic service Sir Michael Jay is currently beating him.
While the prime minister has notched up 22 countries since September, Sir Michael's job has seen him visiting 25 countries in 5 continents in the same period of time.
Come on Tony, stop hanging about.
Wedding bells
Charles and Sarah break the news
It's been a long time coming, but Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has finally popped the question to his long time girlfriend Sarah Gurling and the couple will wed in the summer.
Many in the party had almost given up all hope that Mr Kennedy would ever settle down and present the sort of family-friendly image apparently required of a party leader.
And there is no doubt Charles enjoyed the batchelor lifestyle to the full.
He was one of the most approachable of politicians, ready to drink and chat with his many friends and colleagues in Westminster.
And he was, and remains, guaranteed good company with a self-deprecating sense of humour and a dislike of pomposity.
It has to be said, there were times in the early mornings when the jovialities of the night before were clearly taking their toll.
But "good time Charlie" never showed signs of flagging. And his ability to enjoy himself - while remaining an essentially serious politician - has endeared him to many.
Everyone inWestminster wish him and Sarah well.
Little victories
The Tories scored a small victory last week when they staged a neat parlaimentary ambush and defeated the government in a late night vote.
The subject of the defeat is of minor interest but what has dismayed Labour backbenchers is the fact that they had been warning their whips that the Tories were planning something that day.
But Hilary Armstrong and her team - who are supposed to exert an iron grip on their cowed troops - brushed aside the warnings and let them go home.
When, at 2330, they finally realised something was up it was too late.
Aren't whips supposed to listen to their MPs as well as shout at them?

Bevan agrees Torquay loan switch
Bevan played in the 2007 FA Trophy final for Kidderminster
Torquay have signed Shrewsbury keeper Scott Bevan on a month-long loan.
Bevan's appearances have been limited with the Shrews this season after undergoing knee surgery in the summer and the loan signing of Luke Daniels.
The 29-year-old's arrival at Plainmoor will boost the Gulls' options after Michael Poke picked up a thigh injury.
Shrewsbury boss Paul Simpson told his club's website: "With us having four keepers I think the month's loan will be good for him."
