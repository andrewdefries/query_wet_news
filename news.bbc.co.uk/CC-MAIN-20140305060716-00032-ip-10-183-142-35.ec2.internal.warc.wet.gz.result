Early pregnancy problems warning
Complications are common in the first months of pregnancy
Expectant mothers who have complications early on should be supervised more closely in current and future pregnancies, a study suggests.Problems in the first three months increase the risk of premature birth and other difficulties - in that pregnancy and subsequent ones. The data from 75 studies also showed a history of miscarriages was linked to future premature births. Experts said the research would help identify those at high risk. The analysis presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting looked at several common complications of the first three months of pregnancy. It notches up our level of awareness that if someone has problems in early pregnancy, especially repeated problems, maybe we should be watching these women a bit more closely
Patrick O'Brien, obstetrician
Vaginal bleeding in the early weeks was associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, premature delivery and more than double the risk of having a low birth weight or very low birth weight baby. An accumulation of blood in the womb - intrauterine haematoma - increased these risks further. Extreme early morning sickness was associated with a three times higher risk of premature delivery and a nearly three-fold risk of low birth weight. Women who had been pregnant with twins but miscarried one baby very early in pregnancy also had increased risks of later problems. A history of one or more miscarriages nearly doubled the risk in an ongoing pregnancy of preterm premature rupture of the membrane that surrounds the baby in the womb, and increased the risk of a premature birth. If a previous pregnancy had to be terminated for any reason, premature birth was a risk in subsequent pregnancies. Although the study did not address causes of risks in future pregnancies it could be related to underlying health problems or lifestyle factors, experts said. MonitoringStudy leader Dr Robbert van Oppenraaij, from Erasmus MC University Medical Centre, in the Netherlands, said the extent of future complications was related to the severity or recurrence of the early problems. "Events and complications in early pregnancy are amongst the most common complications in women during their pregnancy and can be extremely distressing for them. "For the clinician it is important to interpret the symptoms and to understand not only the short-term consequences, but also the long-term consequences of these early pregnancy complications." Tony Rutherford, chair of the British Fertility Society, said the results suggested that some patients would benefit from closer monitoring. "It is a message that these patients need to have supervision. "The main concern is with early birth and if we can try and identify these patients we can improve the outcome." Patrick O'Brien, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the underlying reasons for some of the associations would include lifestyle factors such as smoking, nutrition and also conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. "It notches up our level of awareness that if someone has problems in early pregnancy, especially repeated problems, maybe we should be watching these women a bit more closely."

Science needs its whistleblowers
By BBC Science's Toby Murcott
Just like other areas of life, science needs its whistleblowers - people who speak out when they discover other researchers are lying about their work.
That was the conclusion of one of the best-attended sessions at the British Association's Festival of Science.
If scientists could not trust each other to report the results of their work honestly, the delegates argued, then the whole basis of research would crumble. But the theory that all research is and should be open to scrutiny is not always the case in practice. One person who did blow the whistle and report what he saw as dishonest practices was Dr Andy Millar. He was the director of clinical research with a small but growing biotechnology company called British Biotech. 'Procedures don't work'
He was worried about some clinical drug trials the company was conducting - and he said so publicly.
"I finished up being fired," he told the festival. "There was a media war for six weeks when the company attempted and succeeded to a large extent in discrediting me and rubbishing my professional reputation - certainly to start with. "The company sued me for breach of confidence and professional misconduct and in the end I won - if there is a winner in litigation."
His experience is not unique. Professor Brian Martin, of the University of Wollongong, Australia, has been researching scientific dissent for 20 years and has just completed The Whistleblowers Handbook.
"The experience we have just talking to so many whistleblowers is that they go to what you can call various official channels such as internal grievance procedures, or ombudsmen, or the courts, and it's very predictable that they just don't work"
Traditionally, anyone working for a business has been treated harshly for giving away what the organisation might see as company secrets. Research guidelines
On the other hand, universities have been seen as places where genuinely independent academic research is pursued, with no loyalties except to the truth. But Professor Steven Rose, from the Open University, UK, is worried that this is no longer the case.
"I think there is a very real problem with university research in the way private companies have entered the universities, both with direct companies in the universities and with contracts to university researchers. "The whole climate of what might be open and independent scientific research has now disappeared, so the old idea that universities are a place of independence has gone. Instead of which, one's got secrecy, one's got patents, one's' got contracts, one's got shareholders."
Many organisations now require researchers to follow specific guidelines. The UK's Medical Research Council, for example, has just published a Guide on the Principles of Good Research Practice. The overwhelming feeling at the festival debate was that scientists should be free to talk openly about any fraud and misconduct they encountered. The scientists who attended said they were deeply concerned that unless research was seen to be honest then an already sceptical public would lose faith in the value of their scientific endeavours.
