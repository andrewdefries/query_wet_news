'I have two headaches every day'
By Jane Elliott
Health reporter, BBC News
Mike Pollock says he has had cluster attacks since he was seven
Every day for the past 20 years Mike Pollock has had at least two headaches, often three.
One day he had 15 separate headaches.
There is no cure and he has been in so much pain that he has considered suicide.
"I have been suffering from cluster headaches, also known as suicide headaches, since I was seven," he said.
"Up until 20 years ago I was what is called episodic - the headaches would come for four to five months every couple of years and then they would go away. Then I went permanent and have had attacks every single day.
"I did seriously contemplate suicide.
Cluster headache is often said to be the most severe pain that humans have
Professor Peter Goadsby
"The pain is unbearable - you go round with your hand to the pain and scream."
He recalled how one morning at 4.30, as he stood in his back garden having an attack, he seriously thought about taking his own life.
"I went into the garage because I knew there was some rope there, but my son had used the rope to tie all his toys up.
"At that time it was such a bad headache I would have done it. The irony was that five minutes later the attack finished."
Battery pack
Mike, 63, from Hertfordshire, said the only thing that can alleviate the excruciating pain are injectable drugs.
But, because he can take no more than two a day, he often has to endure untreated attacks.
He was among the first patients to try a technique called occipital nerve stimulation in which a nerve in the brain is connected to a battery pack in the body that can send electrical impulses to quell the pain.
CLUSTER HEADACHES
Cluster headaches come in clusters several times a day for a number of days, weeks or months.
They may not then occur for months or years, but for some people there's no pain-free period.
Headaches can last from 15 minutes to three hours.
They affect men more than women.
"It did help a bit but I had it taken out after two years because the battery did not work for long and I didn't want to go into hospital every year for a battery change," Mike said.
He has found other methods help to ease his condition, but nothing is completely effective.
"I have also found oxygen helps, but it is slow to work.
"The injections work every time, but you can only use twice a day. I have boxes and boxes of the injections and have used them in cars, planes, trains."
Mike, a company director, said his condition affected every aspect of his life.
"I have not had a drink for 20 years as you have to avoid alcohol, which makes life boring, but you will never find a cluster headache sufferer who is either in cycle or chronic who drinks," he said.
"I always have an attack about an hour-and-a-half after going to sleep, one between 8.30am and 9am every morning and maybe one in the afternoon.
"It is depressing because driving to work every day I know I am going to get a headache.
"Every woman I have ever spoken to says the pain is worse than childbirth."
Conference hope
In May a conference run by Ouch (the Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headaches) and the Migraine Trust is set to highlight the problems of rarer headaches and tell sufferers about new treatments and research.
Peter Goadsby, professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Institute of Neurology, London, will speak at the conference.
"Cluster headache is often said to be the most severe pain that humans have," he said.
[Patients] often feel very isolated as they try to cope with the dramatic impact the condition has on their quality of life
Wendy Thomas, Migraine Trust
"I have seen just over 1,000 patients and sadly that statement seems correct.
"Patients simply do not report pains that are worse. So think of the worse thing that has ever happened pain-wise, childbirth included, and cluster headache is worse still."
Professor Goadsby said the conference was vital to highlight an under-recognised condition.
"To put it in perspective, it is about as common as multiple sclerosis," he said.
Wendy Thomas, chief executive of the Migraine Trust, said: "More than 120,000 people in the UK suffer from cluster headache and there are many others with rare types of headache.
"They often feel very isolated as they try to cope with the dramatic impact the condition has on their quality of life.
"It is a great breakthrough for us to be staging the world's first conference on rare headaches along with Ouch - another member of Headache UK - at which health professionals and sufferers will hear new research about treatment options.
"The conference is of vital importance as it will stimulate global research to get more insight into these devastating conditions."

Thai Aids 'cure' declared useless
The pills were handed out free to thousands of Aids sufferers
Public health officials in Thailand say a so-called "miracle cure" for Aids has been found to be useless - dashing the hopes of thousands of sufferers.
The V-1 Immunitor Pill was created by a Thai pharmacist, who claimed that it was the first cure for the deadly disease. It was given free in mass handouts to thousands of Aids patients.
We want to point out that V-1 is merely a food supplement and it is not harmful to take, but I want to reaffirm that it's not a drug
Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan.
But Deputy Public Health Minister Surapong Suebwonglee said that in fact the pill had no significant effect on Aids sufferers.
"From physical examinations and laboratory tests of Aids patients who have taken V-1 Immunitor, it can be concluded that the pill does not have any effect on the body's immune system, white blood cell count and amount of the virus in the blood," the minister said in a statement.
Thailand is grappling with one of the region's worst Aids
problems, with one in 60 of its population already infected.
Food supplement
The tests were carried out on 50 patients who had been taking the pill.
As a result, the government has ordered that the pill must now only be marketed as a food supplement.
"We want to point out that V-1 is merely a food supplement and it is not harmful to take, but I want to reaffirm that it's not a drug," said Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan.
One in 60 Thais is infected with Aids
But the government says it will test the patients again to verify the tests.
"Another examination and test should be conducted in the next two to four months," Mr Surapong said.
The results of the test were immediately challenged. A Thai epidemiologist, Dr Orapun Mettadilokun, told the BBC's East Asia Today programme that he had carried out an independent study and found the drug to have a positive effect.
'Inconclusive'
The Salang Bunnag Foundation, a charitable organisation that has backed the pill and distributed it to thousands of people in Bangkok and the northern city of Chiang Mai, said the ministry's findings were inconclusive.
"We take it with a grain of salt, because they said they need to study it for a few more months," a spokesman for the foundation said. "The data they received is a one-off, and it does not determine the efficacy of the product," he added.
The chairman of the foundation, former police general Salang Bunnag, also rejected the ministry's findings, saying an independent committee of government offices and his foundation should be established to test the pill.

Exploring nations asked for help
By Kim Griggs
in Wellington, New Zealand
Scott's Discovery Hut is the least damaged, but most pilfered building
The New Zealand government has urged its counterparts in Britain and Norway to help fund the restoration of huts used by Antarctica's early explorers.
The NZ-based Antarctic Heritage Trust has launched plans to safeguard huts built for expeditions led by Robert Falcon Scott and Carsten Borchgrevink.
The constructions on Ross Island and Cape Adare are slowly deteriorating. These restoration works will cost many millions of NZ dollars and the UK and Norway are being asked for donations.
"It has to be remembered that while here in New Zealand the [Antarctic Heritage] Trust and the government has taken a great interest in the subject, this is also the common history of mankind," New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said. "It is an international collaborative effort. "We have been making representations in the United Kingdom and I am optimistic of support from there. We have also mentioned the project in Norway when I visited at the beginning of June.
"So it's a question of just gathering speed."
Snow pressure
Prime Minister Clark was speaking at the launch of the restoration plans, developed by the Trust, to safeguard the two huts built on Ross Island for the expeditions led by Captain Scott, and a hut built for a British expedition led by Norwegian-born explorer Carsten Borchgrevink at Cape Adare. The Trust last year launched a similar conservation plan for the hut on Ross Island used by Ernest Shackleton in his abortive attempt to reach the South Pole.
"The significant thing about these plans is that they are the first serious look at what needs to be done to protect these places in perpetuity," says Chris Cochran, a conservation architect who worked on the plans.
"There has been very good maintenance and repair work done in the past but it's been done on a year-by-year basis. This is a long-term strategic look at the future of the huts." The Cape Evans hut is threatened by snow creeping up its south side
Despite withstanding the battering of Antarctic weather for 100 years or so, the huts are slowly but surely falling apart. At Cape Adare, the roof needs to be replaced; the hut at Cape Evans, to which Scott never returned, is threatened by snow building up on the south side of the building and by ice heave below the floor. Scott's Discovery Hut, which is close to the US base of McMurdo, is the least structurally damaged of all the historic buildings, but is the most pilfered. So far the Trust has received government funding from New Zealand and from the government of British Antarctic Territory and has raised a total of about NZ $1m from a variety of other sources. But many more millions will be needed if the Trust is going to be able to carry out the restoration plans it launched this week. 'New frontiers'
The estimate for the work to conserve the Shackleton hut alone is NZ $5m. "These early expeditions faced challenges in raising funds and ironically 100 years later we are still facing those challenges," says Nigel Watson, the Trust's executive director. But if the Trust is unable to carry out its plans, then the future for these aging repositories of heroism is grim, says the Trust. "If the attention that we are asking for is not given, they will fall over and this heritage will be destroyed," says Rob Fenwick, chairman of the AHT. "There is nothing surer than that."
"I hope interested governments, agencies and individuals around the world will help the Trust in this cause. E-mail this to a friend

Yahoo targeted in China cyber attacks
Yahoo has over 600 million users and is second in the search market
The Yahoo e-mail accounts of foreign journalists based in China and Taiwan have been hacked, according to a Beijing-based press association.Rival Google has been involved in a high-profile row with the Chinese government following similar cyber-attacks against Gmail accounts. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) has confirmed eight cases of Yahoo e-mail hacks in recent weeks. Yahoo said it condemned such cyber-attacks. But the FCCC accused Yahoo of failing to update users about the situation. "Yahoo has not answered the FCCC's questions about the attacks, nor has it told individual mail users how the accounts were accessed," a spokesman told the news agency. Yahoo said in a statement that it was "committed to protecting user security and privacy". Clifford Coonan, a reporter for the Irish Times, told the AFP news agency that he had an error message when he logged into his Yahoo account this week. "I don't know who's doing it, what happened. They (Yahoo) haven't given any information, but it seems to be happening to journalists and academics in China, so that's why it's a little suspicious," he said. Great FirewallChina censorship has hit the headlines since the high profile cyber-attacks against the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists in January. The hacks led the search giant to redirect its traffic to an uncensored site in Hong Kong earlier this month. The Chinese government reacted with anger, saying it was "totally wrong" to blame the authorities for the attacks, the source code of which originated in China. It does operate a tight control over internet content, including pornography and sensitive political material, in what is dubbed the Great Firewall of China. Earlier in the week Google blamed the great firewall for blocking its search service, although it said it did not know if it was a technical glitch or a deliberate act. The issue is now resolved, a Google spokesman said in a statement. "Interestingly our search traffic in China is now back to normal - even though we have not made any changes at our end. We will continue to monitor what is going on", he said. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Viral e-mails taught in college
This picture from Neil Hepburn was last year's viral e-mail award winner
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News education reporter
Viral e-mails - those clever or annoying pictures or video clips that spread around offices - are going to become part of college courses.
The creative skills in designing these subversive images are to be taught to art and design students.
The initiative is from Channel 4 and a website hosting a competition to find the best viral e-mails.
Rather than an "illicit diversion" viral e-mails should be seen as legitimate art, say the organisers.
Among the winners of last year's competition - called Germ - was a picture showing a fake London street sign, pointing to destinations such "traditional muggers" and "skunk". Other categories were won by viral adverts for computer games.
'Viral language'
The teaching initiative will work with students on art and design courses, at institutions including Kingston University, Central Saint Martin's College, Leeds Metropolitan University and the University of Central England.
"Star Wars Kid" was viewed 900 million times last year
Jo Addison, education co-ordinator for www.boreme.com, which is co-sponsor of the project, says "most students are already masters of viral language" - and that viral art is an ideal "live brief" which allows students to show their work in the "professional and public realm".
From being part of an underground approach to art, virals are now becoming an established arm of advertising - and this project anticipates that they will become part of degree courses. Popular e-mails can reach a huge audience very rapidly - spreading among inboxes as a kind of creative spam. Last year, a funny viral video of "Star Wars Boy", showing an over-enthusiastic youngster inspired by the movie, was viewed 900 million times.
Famous faces such as David Beckham and George Bush have been regular butts of viral e-mails. And these jokes have become increasingly sophisticated, using video, audio and animation.

British food pledge for Olympics
More than 14 million meals are due to be served during the Games
Food and drink at London's Olympics will be British "wherever possible", 2012 organisers have said.London 2012 said while 20% of food would be supplied by sponsors McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Cadbury a wide choice of food would be available. Chief executive Paul Deighton said the Games would create a "great legacy for the catering industry in this country". Concerns have been raised about the promotion of unhealthy food to children at 2012 events. Last year the National Obesity Forum said it was "very concerned" that confectionary giant Cadbury as an Olympic sponsor would increase "the promotion of unhealthy food to children". 'Affordable and sustainable'More than 14 million meals are expected to be served during the Olympics and Paralympics across 40 locations, a London 2012 spokesman said. Events, catering and hospitality firms must sign up to a food charter backing local, seasonal, healthier and sustainable food, he added. All soft drinks and mineral water will be supplied by sponsor Coca-Cola. Mr Deighton said: "We want to ensure everyone at the Games has a fantastic experience and key to that is the food and drink that's available. "We want it to be affordable, sustainable and celebrating the fantastic diversity and quality of what Britain has to offer." I am keen that there is now more work undertaken to ensure that higher standards... are mandatory rather than aspirational Rosie Boycott, London Food Board
The 15,000 Olympic athletes will be fed by the London 2012 organising committee (Locog). Olympic rowing champion James Cracknell, who is London 2012's sustainability ambassador, said: "The approach being taken for the food provision at London 2012 is the same for both athletes and spectators - responsibly sourced and ensuring a wide choice." The plan was welcomed by Rosie Boycott, chair of the mayor's London Food Board - which aims to improve access to healthy local food. She said: "I am pleased to see a range of solid commitments by Locog and the Olympic sponsors in this final report to achieving high standards of healthy, ethical and sustainable food." But she added: "I am keen that there is now more work undertaken to ensure that higher standards, particularly in relation to animal welfare and environmental standards for farming, are mandatory rather than aspirational as currently stated in the report."

Kelly plays down rift on schools
Ruth Kelly would not deny reports of a dispute
Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has tried to play down newspaper reports of a Cabinet revolt over plans for schools in England being unveiled next week.
John Prescott has clashed with Tony Blair because he fears elite schools will be created at the expense of others, according to the reports.
Ms Kelly did not deny the claims, saying there was "debate", but she insisted ministers had worked closely. She said Tuesday's White Paper aimed to raise aspirations for all pupils.
Failing schools?
Mr Prescott is said to be worried about plans to bring some of the ethos of public schools to the state sector. The Observer newspaper quotes a Whitehall source explaining Mr Prescott's fears about how expanding choice could affect working class families.
There is no suggestion whatsoever we are trying to force children to get on buses to go to schools they don't want to go to
Ruth KellyEducation Secretary
"He is scared nice schools that are doing very well will expand and do well, but will leave more and more other schools to close and on the way to closure they will have all the problems of a failing school."
Asked about Mr Prescott's concerns, Ms Kelly said: "Whenever flagship policies are developed there is going to be debate within the government.
"The important point about John and other members of the Cabinet is there have been really good, close working relationships throughout the build-up to this White Paper."
'No privilege'
Ms Kelly argued it was right for state schools to learn from private schools about instilling an ethos of "good discipline, high standards and an expectation that every single child in that school is going to succeed".
But she went on: "If you are talking about privilege, selection, unfair funding, that is something I would never want to see in our state system."
She denied newspaper reports suggesting the White Paper will propose bringing children from poor areas to schools in wealthier neighbourhoods, and vice versa.
But pupils should not be deterred from going to a better school by transport costs, she said. "It might mean saying we should make transport costs easier for you to bear," said Ms Kelly.
"There is no suggestion whatsoever that what we are trying to do is force children to get on buses to go to schools they don't want to go to.
"What we do have to do is raise aspiration and get people to think about the education that best suits them, put their parents in the driving seat, as it were, so that parents can exercise real choice."
'Farcical'
The education secretary said it was for schools to determine their own admissions policies. Local education authorities would still have a role but it would be different from their previous job, she said. Tory leadership hopeful David Cameron, the shadow education secretary, said Mr Blair had failed to deliver reforms during two terms in office. "The row between Tony Blair and John Prescott over the White Paper explains why this government will never be able to deliver higher standards and rigour in our schools," he said. Liberal Democrat education spokesman Ed Davey said government "squabbles" over education were becoming "farcical".
He said: "If the prime minister can't take his deputy and the chancellor with him in his last foray into education, people will question whether the White Paper's proposals will be implemented under a Brown government."
