Prize to honour Africa statesman
By Martin Plaut
Africa editor, BBC News
Joaquim Chissano is a frontrunner for the prize
The Mo Ibrahim Prize - the world's richest - is being presented in London to a former African head of state for the excellence of their leadership. The prize is worth $5m (�2.5m) over 10 years, and then $200,000 a year. Mobile phone millionaire Mo Ibrahim is funding the project in the hope it will help improve governments' performance.
Among 13 leaders under consideration by a panel are former Tanzania leader Benjamin Mkapa and Joaquim Chissano, who brought peace to Mozambique.
The winner of the prize will have been selected by a panel chaired by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The committee - which also includes the former Irish President, Mary Robinson, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and head of the Organisation of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim - will have assessed and reflected on the relative merits of 13 African former heads of state, all of whom left power in the past three years. The prize is the brain-child of the mobile-phone millionaire, Mo Ibrahim, who is funding the project in the hope it will improve the performance of African governments.
Ibrahim hopes the prize will increase Africa's self-dependence
The Sudanese businessman hopes it will bring a day when the continent's people no longer need to live on aid.
"We need to remove corruption, we need to improve governance, we need to be healthy and then we don't need the aid," said Mr Ibrahim.
"The day we don't need any aid, that is the most wonderful day of my life."
Among the eligible leaders are a fair number no self-respecting panel would seriously consider - men who hung onto power decade after decade, giving Africa nothing but a bad name. At least six first took power by staging coups. Some had to be pried from their posts. One - Somalia's Abdiqasim Salad Hassan - had no state to administer.
But there are some very capable leaders among them. Benjamin Mkapa went a long way to bringing prosperity to Tanzania. Albert Rene of Seychelles may have had his flaws, but he presided over a thriving island state. And Domitien Ndayizeye did much to reconcile Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis. But perhaps the most shining example is Joaquim Chissano, who brought Mozambique from a murderous civil war to peace and progress during his 19 years in office.

The Price is right
Christopher Price: Liquid News does "news with a twist"
By BBC News Online's Helen Bushby
Christopher Price, the presenter of BBC Choice's daily entertainment news show Liquid News, has hit headlines over his alleged salary of �250,000.
Described as a "little known newsreader" by The Guardian, and as an "unknown BBC man" by The Sun, Price's place in the spotlight is secured, at least for the moment, by the flurry of publicity surrounding the story.
He seems bemused by the whole incident, and refuses to comment on the claims, saying he has no idea how the story got into the newspapers.
Regardless of the charge from The Sun that he fronts an "obscure" show, Price, 33, is definitely happy with his lot, calling Liquid News "the most exciting place to work in TV".
Jenny Eclair: "Funny and intelligent"
He describes the show as covering the day's entertainment news events, but, "with a twist".
Its guests - celebrities, comedians, journalists and media personalities - take an irreverent look at the day's events, and are prompted by Price to vent their spleens.
His favourite contributors are comediennes Jenny Eclair and Julia Morris - "the funniest people we have on the show" - and Heat magazine's editor Mark Frith, who "really understands how the industry works".
No digital problems
Although viewing figures for digital channels are not in the league of the major networks, this does not bother him. "I don't have one problem with being on a digital channel - the viewing uptake will happen," he says.
Nicholas Parsons: A "disappointing guest"
The BBC is hoping the government will accept its proposals for the transformation of BBC Choice into BBC Three, which would be aimed at younger viewers.
It is expected that Liquid News would play a key part in attracting viewers.
Price's aim for Liquid News is that it stands out as a "classy show" among the new digital offerings.
But the presenter is also quick to point out that he does not just "come in and read the autocue" - he also has a hand in the scripts and the running order.
As a journalist who began his career in BBC local radio, moving to Radio 5Live, News 24 and BBC Choice, Price prides himself on the fact that the show deals only in news.
Moby's contribution
Warming to his subject, he extols the virtues of live television, and obviously enjoys the adrenaline rush of performing in a single take.
"I've worked in pre-recorded shows and it's just not the same," he says.
Although he did not set out to become an entertainment journalist, he thoroughly enjoys covering the multi-million pound industry and the antics of its stars.
He is also aware of the importance of the show's white, minimalist set and Liquid News's theme tune - by US dance star Moby.
"He just liked the show's format - it was rather different from shows in the US," Price explains, adding that Moby gave them the choice of four tracks that had not made it onto his massively successful album Play.
"He remembered the show - it must be because we're both bald-headed people in the media," he adds.
'He didn't want to play ball'
Price's own taste in entertainment is eclectic and "changes constantly".
His current film favourite is Billy Wilder's The Apartment, the tale of an insurance clerk who ends up in a sticky situation when he lets his flat to his bosses and their mistresses.
His other passions are Italian pop singer Eros Ramazotti, photographer Andy Earle and the novelist Arthur Golden, who wrote Memoirs of a Geisha.
He has rather less time for TV and radio panel game host Nicholas Parsons, who proved to be a disappointing guest on Liquid News.
"He came on the show, but he didn't want to play ball - he just wasn't interested," Price adds with a wry smile.

Motley Crue drummer hurt on stage
Lee was treated for minor burns and subsequently released
Tommy Lee, drummer for heavy metal band Motley Crue, suffered minor burns at a concert in Casper, Wyoming on Wednesday during a pyrotechnics explosion.
Lee was treated at a local hospital for the injuries to his arm and face, which occurred while he was suspended from a wire 30 feet above the stage.
The 43-year-old played one more song before the concert was cut short.
"He didn't look good so we chose to err on the side of caution," said singer Vince Neil on Thursday.
Neil was himself injured last month when he tore a calf muscle on stage during a concert in Memphis, Tennessee.
Roman candles
The accident occurred while Lee was being moved back and forth between several drum sets.
An eyewitness described the pyrotechnics involved as Roman candles.
According to the band's publicist, Lee is expected to recover fully from his injuries.
She said concerts in Bismarck, North Dakota on Friday; Rapid City, South Dakota on Saturday; and Sioux City, Iowa on Sunday would go ahead as planned.

Academies campaigner fights on
Mr MacDonald said national anti-academies protests would continue
A campaigner who lost a legal challenge to the government's academy programme has promised to carry on the fight.
On Thursday, the High Court decided that the closure of a school in Merton, south London, to make way for an academy, should be allowed to go ahead.
But Rob MacDonald, who brought the case, urged parents to contest the "privatisation" of education. He said academies were being "rail-roaded".
Schools Minister Lord Adonis said he was "delighted" by the court judgement.
Rob Macdonald, whose son attends Tamworth Manor school, which is set to be replaced by an academy, had been flawed.
He argued that parents did not have access to the "funding agreement" underpinning the deal.
'Hell bent'
This contains legal obligations on key areas such as exclusions, provision for special educational needs and admissions. But the High Court decided an academy sponsored by Lord Harris of Peckham, who already backs other academies and specialists schools, could go ahead. Another school, Mitcham Vale, is also set to be replaced under the plans.
The Department for Education and Skills and Merton Borough Council back the changes.
Mr MacDonald said: "We have been pitted against the overwhelming resources of local councillors, the MP, the local authority, the sponsors and ultimately the government, all intent upon rail-roading the scheme through whatever the cost."
He added: "The council and its political leaders have been hell bent on forcing through these academies what ever the opposition."
The government has set a target of having 200 city academies open or under construction by 2010. So far, 27 have opened. Under the scheme, private sponsors provide up to �2m towards start-up costs, giving them a say in the academy's running. The stated aim is to raise standards in deprived areas.
Mr MacDonald said: "Nationally we believe our strong campaign will have an affect and we hope that future academy proposals will now ensure that the relevant information is disclosed to those being consulted.
"We strongly urge parents, school staff, unions and the communities as a whole across the country to organise yourselves as soon as possible."
On Wednesday, Hayley Powers, whose children attend St Mary Magdalene Church of England Primary School in Islington, north London, lost her case against its proposed replacement with an academy.
She had argued the move would weaken the rights of parents and pupils.
Following Thursday's ruling, Lord Adonis said: "I'm delighted that this judgement will mean that the two academies in Merton will open as planned in September. "The independent schools adjudicator was right to approve the new academy proposals as the best solution to providing higher standards for the parents of Merton and the court has cleared any obstacle to this."

Prescott suffering from pneumonia
John Prescott was taken ill on Saturday
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott is suffering from pneumonia, his office has confirmed. The 69-year-old has been moved to a high-dependency unit, but a spokesman stressed that this was not because his condition had deteriorated.
He has been in hospital since Saturday, when he was taken ill on a train from Hull to London.
His friends have told the BBC's Nick Robinson that Mr Prescott is conscious and there is no sense of alarm.
Our political editor said the friends had told him that the deputy prime minister was sitting up, and had managed to dictate a statement about his illness.
Stepping down
It is thought he was moved to the high dependency unit - for patients needing more observation and treatment than in a general ward - owing to his age and the fact that he suffers from diabetes.
I have sent my best wishes to John and his family
Peter HainCabinet minister
Profile: John Prescott
Mr Prescott's wife, Pauline, has been at his bedside on Tuesday.
His official spokesman said: "He has been moved to a high-dependency unit, not because of a deterioration in his condition but so that his condition can be monitored more closely."
Cabinet minister Peter Hain, who supported Mr Prescott's campaign to be Labour's deputy leader in 1994, said everyone in the party was wishing him a speedy recovery.
"I have sent my best wishes to John and his family," said Mr Hain, who is one of the candidates to succeed Mr Prescott in his party role.
In May, Mr Prescott announced he would step down as Labour deputy leader and deputy prime minister on 27 June - the same time as Prime Minister Tony Blair. Medication announcement
During his 10 years as Mr Blair's deputy, Mr Prescott has been generally in good health.
However, in 2002 it was announced he had suffered from type two diabetes for a number of years, managing the condition with medication.
And he was taken to hospital on Christmas Day 2006, when he was treated for kidney stones.
Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection. Many different bacteria, viruses and even fungi can bring on the illness - although Mr Prescott's official spokesman said he did not know what had caused the pneumonia in his case.
Symptoms include difficulty in breathing, chest pain, coughing and fever. It is frequently resolved within weeks.

Ice lolly bid to save bitten ear
Wayne Morrison bit off a piece of ear in the attack
Petrol station staff used ice lollies to try to save part of a man's ear after it was bitten off by a fellow customer, a court has heard.A piece of Christopher Deans' ear was found on the floor of the Bypass Service Station in East Lothian after he was attacked by Wayne Morrison, 35. Staff thought they might be able to preserve it until the piece of ear could be reattached by surgeons. However, the plastic surgery proved to be unsuccessful. Morrison pled guilty to severely injuring and permanently scarring Mr Deans, 24, in Haddington on 23 September last year. He has to pay £2,000 in compensation to Mr Deans and was ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service. The complainer was screaming, he was in considerable pain
Fiscal depute Aidan HigginsProsecuting
Sheriff Frank Crowe described the incident, which happened at 0720 BST as the men were going to work, as "barbaric". "Your behaviour was disgraceful, you acted out of all proportion," said the sheriff. The court was told father-of-five Morrison had left his home that morning in a "raging temper" after a row with his wife. Mr Deans, a farm worker, was buying cigarettes at the service station in Bypass Road but realised he was short of money and headed back out to his car. "In leaving he brushed against the accused who was standing in the queue," said fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting. "Thinking that it was very slight contact he certainly didn't feel there was any need to apologise or mention it to the accused. "As he got to the door of the service station shop, the accused had turned round and come after him. "Just at the door the accused grabbed hold of (Mr Deans), he pushed him against the door, head-butted him in the middle of the forehead and having hold of the complainer he then bit into his left ear." He said Mr Deans was screaming and was in "considerable pain". 'Considerable stress'Morrison then rejoined the queue and paid before leaving the shop and driving off. Police traced his vehicle registration to his home in Cockburnspath and he was arrested. Mr Deans was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and later transferred to St John's Hospital in Livingston for plastic surgery, but attempts to reattach the missing piece of ear failed. Mr Higgins said that the injury had caused Mr Deans "considerable embarrassment". His outdoor job means Mr Deans also suffers pain in his ear during cold weather. Vince Belmonte, defending, said his client had acted "completely out of character at a time he was under considerable stress". Sheriff Crowe told Morrison: "You disfigured a man, that's a horrible thing. "Mr Deans has got to live with that for the rest of his life. "It would be very easy to send you to prison but that would have a devastating effect on your family."

Nottingham Forest 2-3 Leicester
Leicester reached the Carling Cup third round after scoring twice late on.

With two minutes left substitute Richard Stearman levelled and then, with extra time looming, Stephen Clemence hit the stoppage-time winner.
Nottm Forest: Smith, Chambers, Wilson, Morgan, Bennett, Clingan, Lennon (Perch 76), Cohen, Tyson (Holt 86), Agogo, Commons. Subs Not Used: Roberts, Breckin, Sinclair.
Goals: Smith 1, Tyson 64.
Leicester: Fulop, N'Gotty (Stearman 73), Kisnorbo, McAuley, Sheehan, Hume, Clemence, Wesolowski (Chambers 19), Mattock, Campbell (Fryatt 61), De Vries. Subs Not Used: Henderson, Marco Ferreira.
Booked: Chambers, Kisnorbo.
Goals: Sheehan 31, Stearman 88, Clemence 90.
Att: 15,519.
