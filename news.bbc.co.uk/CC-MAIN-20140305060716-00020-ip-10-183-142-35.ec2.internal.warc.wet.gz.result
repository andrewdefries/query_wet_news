Who are Sudan's Darfur rebels?
When conflict broke out in Darfur early in 2003, there were just two major rebel groups. Since then, the insurgents have splintered into an array of competing factions, complicating already tense peace negotiations.
JEM
The Justice and Equality Movement (Jem) was founded by Darfuris drawn mostly from among former supporters of Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi.
Jem fighters launched an attack on Khartoum in May 2008
He was a partner in President Omar al-Bashir's 1989 coup which overthrew Sadeq al-Mahdi's elected government. Jem is led by Khalil Ibrahim, a doctor who was one of the authors of "The Black Book", which documented the disproportionate power of three northern Arab tribes. Jem is currently the most significant fighting force in Darfur and in May 2008, the group launched an unprecedented attack on the Sudanese capital. Sudan's government has accused neighbouring Chad of arming Jem. Chadian President Idriss Deby is widely believed to have supported Jem because he is from the same Zaghawa ethnic group as Khalil Ibrahim. But last month Mr Deby visited Khartoum and both sides agreed to stop supporting each other's rebels. Following this - and a year of on-off negotiations in Qatar - the group is about to sign a ceasefire with Mr Bashir. According to the text of the accord, obtained by the BBC, Jem will constitute a political party after the signing of a final agreement, which Khartoum hopes will be before elections in April. Many Darfuris are said to distrust Dr Ibrahim because of his Islamist past and suspect he is focused on political power in Khartoum for his clan. Until he attacked the capital, Jem had limited support on the ground in Darfur. SLA
With Jem, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) was one of the two original Darfur rebel groups, composed mainly of Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit - the three largest non-Arab tribes of Darfur. Existing divisions along largely ethnic lines widened, pitting Fur (led by Abdel Wahid Mohamed el-Nur) against Zaghawa (led by Minni Arkou Minnawi). SLA-Abdel WahidAbdel Wahid has lived in self-imposed exile in Paris for several years. Q&A Darfur conflict
His faction controls part of the central Jebel Marra mountain area and has wide support among Fur in Darfur's massive refugee camps. But it has been losing support as a result of Abdel Wahid's refusal to return to Darfur. There has been recent infighting among commanders in the Jebel Marra, some of whom want a change of direction in the movement. Mr Wahid insists on being the only rebel interlocutor and says he wants security in Darfur, including the disarmament of the Janjaweed militias, before peace talks. SLA-Minni factionMinnawi was the only rebel leader to sign the 2006 Darfur peace agreement (DPA) and was rewarded with the largely symbolic post of special adviser to President Bashir. His group had been losing ground before the DPA, and lost more after. His presence and power on the ground in Darfur today is minimal. OTHER MOVEMENTS
Most other movements have been grouped together in two large and changeable bodies - the Tripoli group and the Addis Ababa group. The latter reportedly includes splinter SLM groups including SLM-Abdel Shafi and the United Resistance Movement of Bahar Idriss Abu Garda. He was accused of planning the killing of 12 African Union peacekeepers in 2007 and handed himself over to the International Criminal Court, but the case was dropped there was not enough evidence to proceed. According to Sudan's state news agency, the Tripoli and Addis Ababa groups have agreed to unite on the sidelines of the signing ceremony for the Jem ceasefire in Qatar, bringing together 10 Darfuri rebel movements.

Beijing drivers ignore No Car Day
Drivers in Beijing disregarded appeals to leave their cars at home
China is holding a No Car Day in more than 100 cities as it tries to reduce smog ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Cars have been banned on some central streets in Beijing and all drivers are being encouraged to leave their cars at home voluntarily. But correspondents say that in the capital National No Car Day appears to be making little impact.
Millions of vehicles are on the roads every day in Beijing, causing massive air pollution.
The BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing says that cars are coming and going as normal, and most streets in Beijing are not adhering to No Car Day.
Environmental campaigners say China must overhaul its transport system, not just with a few ad hoc No Car Days but by putting in cycle lanes, reducing the price of public transport and making it much more difficult for people to buy private cars.

Cars would be better dealt with by making them work better, not with no car days Peter Filicietti, Bangkok, Thailand Send us your comments
But China has a huge incentive - not just the health of its citizens, but the success of the Olympic Games in August next year.
The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has already warned that if the pollution is bad next summer, some endurance events - such as cycling or the marathon - may have to be postponed.

Second-hand smoke 'causes cancer'
The experts examined previous studies into smoking
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke increases the risk of developing lung cancer, international experts have said. A working group from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization, examined all of the major studies looking at smoking and cancer. After a five-day meeting in Lyons, France, this week, they suggested non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke are between 20% and 30% more likely to develop lung cancer. Passive smoking is quite clearly more than just the nuisance many
of the world's tobacco companies would have us believe
Marsha Williams, ASH
The experts also found cancers of the stomach, liver, uterus, cervix, kidney
and myeloid leukaemia could be caused in part by smoking.
The group of 29 experts from 12 countries found second-hand tobacco smoke was
carcinogenic to humans and that typical levels of passive exposure have been
shown to cause lung cancer among people who have never smoked.
This means hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide from these cancers could
now be linked to smoking.
Definite link
Dr Kurt Straif, who organised the IARC meeting, said the group examined 50 studies examining the link between passive smoking and cancer.
Speaking to BBC News Online, he added: "This is the first time that a global organisation has concluded that exposure to second hand smoke is linked to cancer."
One of the experts, Sir Richard Doll, said: "Environmental tobacco smoke that
people experience at work or at home is definitely a cause of lung cancer.
"That has been discussed for a long time but this is the first time a group
of independent scientists have reviewed all the evidence and said there is no
question it is a cause of lung cancer."
Sir Richard said the findings should have a significant influence on health
policies around the world and could strengthen arguments for a ban in this
country on smoking in workplaces.
The experts also stated that one half of all persistent cigarette smokers are eventually killed by a tobacco-related disease.
Half of these deaths occur in middle age, which means they lose an average of
20-25 years of non-smoker life expectancy.
Annually tobacco accounts for millions of cancer deaths around the world, and
it is the largest cause of preventable cancers.
However it causes a greater number of premature deaths from cardiovascular and
lung diseases and strokes than from cancer.
Apart from cigarettes, other forms of tobacco smoking such as cigars and pipes
increase the risks for cancer of the lung, head and neck.
Mounting evidence
Marsha Williams, of the anti-tobacco campaigning group ASH, said the findings
added to the mounting body of evidence of the health risks from second-hand
smoke.
She said: "Passive smoking is quite clearly more than just the nuisance many
of the world's tobacco companies would have us believe. "People are harmed and killed by it and it is time industry, government and smokers themselves woke up to this fact."

Flushing out child mental disorders
The disorders can cause psychiatric distress
Children with psychological problems that are made worse by the bacteria behind throat infections could benefit from an immune system cleansing treatment.
The announcement follows research into children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders such as Tourette's syndrome at the US National Institute of Mental Health.
They looked in particular at children suffering from PANDAS - paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections - where the OCD or tic disorder gets worse following infection with streptococcal bacteria.
They found that by swapping old immune system material for new they could reduce the effect, offering the promise of an effective treatment for children in this position.
Mistaken threat
Doctors believe that PANDAS occur as an autoimmune response - where the immune system mistakes the body's own tissue for a threat and destroys it. They suggest that when the body produces antibodies to fight off a streptococcal infection, some of them accidentally turn on the body, which in turn exacerbates the psychiatric disorder.
However, the US researchers think that their treatment has the potential to help children suffering from the disorders.
They looked at 30 children who had an OCD, a tic disorder or both. The children had all shown signs of their disorder before they hit puberty and had found that it interfered with at least two areas of their lives, such as school or home.
Twenty of the patients got replacement immune material, 10 were given a placebo.
Half of the 20 patients receiving treatment were given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the other half were given plasma exchange - both techniques effectively clean the blood of faulty antibodies.
Success
Publishing their findings in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers said: "Plasma exchange and IVIG were both effective in lessening symptom severity for children with infection-triggered OCD and tic disorders."
They followed the children for a year, and were surprised to find that not only did the treatment work, it only needed one course to produce lasting results.
Dr Susan Swedo, one of the researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health, said that although they could not be sure why the treatment worked, they had a theory why.
"It's a one-two punch - the first punch knocks out the antibodies that do the damage, the second punch restores the immune system so the Strep can't come back," she told BBC News Online.
"In these cases, it's an accidental reaction - unlike lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, where it's almost on purpose. What that means is that once the autoimmune reaction has been triggered it can't be stopped."
One-stop treatment
However, in the case of PANDAS, there was an active agent causing the body to accidentally attack its own tissue.
This raised the possibility that once the faulty antibodies were removed and new ones put in to stop the infection recurring, there would be no need for a further course of treatment.
"That was a wonderful discovery," she said.
However, further research would be needed to establish whether children outside the tight criteria applied in this study would benefit.

Islamic scholar Tahir ul-Qadri issues terrorism fatwa
By Dominic Casciani
BBC News
Dr Tahir ul-Qadri: 600-page ruling
An influential Muslim scholar has issued a global ruling against terrorism and suicide bombing.Dr Tahir ul-Qadri, from Pakistan, says his 600-page judgement, known as a fatwa, completely dismantles al-Qaeda's violent ideology. The scholar describes al-Qaeda as an "old evil with a new name" that has not been sufficiently challenged. The scholar's movement is growing in the UK and has attracted the interest of policymakers and security chiefs. In his religious ruling, delivered in London, Dr Qadri says that Islam forbids the massacre of innocent citizens and suicide bombings. Although many scholars have made similar rulings in the past, Dr Qadri argued that his massive document goes much further by omitting "ifs and buts" added by other thinkers. He said that it set out a point-by-point theological rebuttal of every argument used by al-Qaeda inspired recruiters. The populist scholar developed his document last year as a response to the increase in bombings across Pakistan by militants. 'Heroes of hellfire'The basic text has been extended to 600 pages to cover global issues, in an attempt to get its theological arguments taken up by Muslims in Western nations. It will be promoted in the UK by Dr Qadri's organisation, Minhaj ul-Quran International. Dr Qadri spoke for more than hour to an audience of Muslims, clergy, MPs, police officers and other security officials. "They [terrorists] can't claim that their suicide bombings are martyrdom operations and that they become the heroes of the Muslim Umma [global brotherhood]. No, they become heroes of hellfire, and they are leading towards hellfire," he said. "There is no place for any martyrdom and their act is never, ever to be considered jihad." Acts of vengeanceThe document is not the first to condemn terrorism and suicide bombing to be launched in the UK. MINHAJ UL-QURAN
Islamic organisation from the Sufi tradition
Active in 70 countries
5,000 members in UK
BBC Religion: Sufism explained Scholars from across the UK came together in the wake of the 7 July London attacks to denounce the bombers and urge communities to root out extremists. But some scholarly rulings in the Middle East have argued that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is an exceptional situation where "martyrdom" attacks can be justified. Dr Qadri said he rejected that view saying there were no situations under which acts of vengeance, such as attacks on market places or commuter trains, could ever be considered a justifiable act of war. Although Dr Qadri has many followers in Pakistan, Minhaj ul-Quran International remained largely unknown in the UK until relatively recently. It now has 10 mosques in cities with significant Muslim communities and says it is targeting younger generations it believes have been let down by traditional leaders. The organisation is attracting the attention of policymakers and security chiefs who are continuing to look for allies in the fight against extremists. The Department for Communities, which runs most of the government's Preventing Violent Extremism strategy, has tried building bridges with a variety of liberal-minded groups, but often found that they have limited actual influence at the grassroots.
