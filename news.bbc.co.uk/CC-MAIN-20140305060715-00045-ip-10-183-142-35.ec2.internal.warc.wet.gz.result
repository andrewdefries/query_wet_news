Small firms driving UK car industry
By Will Smale
BBC News business reporter in Somerset and Devon
The Ariel Atom was not designed with the weekly shop in mind
The UK car industry remains the most exciting in the world - no other country has anywhere near as many independently-owned sports car manufacturers.
In small workshops across the country, a host of home-grown, home-owned companies continue to make a wealth of characterful high-performance vehicles.
Free from the globalised, homogenised constraints of shared car platforms, or whether the boot can hold the weekly shopping, they focus instead simply on engineering pure driving pleasure, be it raw or encased in luxury.
Lamborghini-bashing
One such company is Ariel, based in the tiny village of North Perrott, in the middle of the rolling Somerset countryside.
Mr Saunders believes small firms need to produce something unique
Owned and run by former Aston Martin designer Simon Saunders from a workshop little bigger than a double garage, since 1999 it has made one of the most futuristic sports cars on the planet - the Atom.
For while the rural tranquillity of North Perrott appears unchanged from the 1930s, the Ariel Atom is like something from a science fiction film.
In essence, just four wheels and a two-litre engine bolted to a steel frame, it doesn't score very well on the practicality front - not only do you not get a roof or boot, you don't even get any doors.
But weighing just 500kg, less than half the weight of an average small car, what you do get is a car that will do 0-60 in under four seconds and beat a Lamborghini around a race track. All for less than �25,000.
And while perhaps not for the faint-hearted, the Atom is entirely road legal.
'Fighter jet'
"For a small company like ours to be successful there is no point is us trying to compete head to head with the big boys," says Mr Saunders.
Despite looking like a track car, the Atom is entirely road legal
"Our advantage is that unlike the big car manufacturers, we don't have to worry about practicalities - people don't buy the Atom to do their weekly shop at Tesco for example.
"Instead we focus solely upon putting a smile on the
driver's face.
"Obviously we wouldn't be someone's day car, but for sheer driving enjoyment at the weekend or around a track, it is hard to beat us."
Only making two Atoms a month, Ariel now has a waiting
list, and says its rather isolated location has not been a problem.
"Obviously we don't have any showrooms, so people have
to come to us," says Mr Saunders.
"It is a long way from pretty much anywhere to get to
us, but the way I look at it is that if you were after
a fighter jet, you'd hardly start looking on the High
Street."
Motorcycle technology
Another up and coming small-scale automotive company
in the south west is Exe-tc, a suspension specialist
that employs seven in Exeter.
Graham Gleeson models one of his suspension components
Established in 1996 by New Zealander Graham Gleeson, a
former professional motorcycle racer, he had the
brainwave of adapting motorcycle suspension systems
for sports cars.
"The car industry led by Formula One had historically
put its efforts into aerodynamics, to the detriment of
the suspension systems, which were actually a lot less
advanced than motorcycle systems," says Mr Gleeson.
"So I thought why not develop motorcycle systems for
four wheels?"
It was a brainwave that first won Exe-tc a contract
with the Jordan Grand Prix team, closely followed by
the Subaru and Citroen World Rally Championship teams.
"What flourishes in the UK is the eccentric, quirky
side. We have all these designers and engineers always
asking questions and seeing how things can be done
differently or better," says Mr
Gleeson.
Mr Saunders agrees, saying, "when it comes to sheer entrepreneurialism and British inventiveness, our small sports car producers are hard to beat."

UK considering Vauxhall support
Lord Mandelson says the UK government has not ruled out support
The UK government has "not ruled out making a financial contribution" to help secure the future of carmaker Vauxhall, Lord Mandelson has said.The comments of the UK Business Secretary came as Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation (BAIC) joined the race to buy Opel and Vauxhall. BAIC becomes the fourth bidder, joining Fiat, Canada's Magna and Belgium's RHJ. While owner General Motors will have the final say, the choice of the German government is also crucial. This is because Opel has its headquarters in Germany, and 25,000 of the firm's 50,000 workers are employed in the country. As a result, the German government is offering the most financial support for the winning bidder. The late bid by China's BAIC was confirmed by the German Economy Ministry. The two UK Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton employ 5,000 between them. German talksGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel met Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne on Tuesday to discuss his firm's bid to buy Opel and its Vauxhall brand from GM. Opel's possible buyers
Her government is now expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday evening, after which it will announce its preferred bidder. A Fiat spokesman said that Mr Marchionne and Ms Merkel had discussed the bid for an hour. Following the meeting, Mr Marchionne said Fiat was reducing the amount of state guarantees it wanted from European governments should it buy Opel from 7bn euros ($9.8bn; £6.1bn) to 6bn euros. While Fiat was talking to the German government, the RHJ and Magna consortia met employee representatives from Opel to explain their plans. As it is a German election year, the German government is likely to favour offers that limit the number of job cuts. GM debt talksThe sale of GM's European units is part of the reorganisation of the US carmaker, which is battling to avoid bankruptcy. The government's biggest concern is the future of GM's Vauxhall's plants in the UK
Martin Shankleman
Vauxhall's uncertain future
GM faces a 1 June deadline to either restructure its debt or file for bankruptcy, and some newspapers are reporting that it will take the same option as its rival Chrysler and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It is reported to want to secure the sale of Opel and Vauxhall before that date. If GM is to avoid bankruptcy, the carmaker will need to reach agreement with its bondholders. GM has set a deadline of midnight EDT on Tuesday (0400 GMT on Wednesday) for agreement from the bondholders. It has proposed giving the bondholders a 10% stake in the company while giving 50% to the US Treasury. The existing shareholders would end up with an extremely small stake in the company under the plans.
