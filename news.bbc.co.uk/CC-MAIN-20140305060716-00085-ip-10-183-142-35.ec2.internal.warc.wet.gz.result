The rocket scientists of finance

How a bank's balance sheet works
When the Mars Climate Orbiter took off from Cape Canaveral in December 1998, the engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena were undoubtedly elated.
They were managing the project for NASA. It was a textbook launch and the spaceship was on its way to break new ground in mapping the red planet.
Nine months later though, it was only their red faces that were on show. The spaceship vanished. Instead of orbiting the planet, it had burnt up as it descended too low into the Martian atmosphere.
It turned out there had been an unfortunate mishap somewhere between the guys in Pasadena and their contractors in Colorado.
One group was using imperial measures of force in its navigation programming, while the other was working in metric.
On such occasions, one inevitably finds oneself asking how such clever people can make such silly mistakes.
Predictable outcome
The answer is perhaps that only such clever people can make such silly mistakes.
Most of us down here would not have been sending space ships to Mars at all. It is when intelligent life on Earth becomes ambitious that things get complicated.
And when things get complicated, no-one on the planet is intelligent enough to avoid the occasional silly error.
If it is true of aeronautic engineering, it is equally true of financial engineering.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Evan Davis explains securitisation
The rise and fall of the financial services industry in recent years is really a story of several appealing financial innovations falling into the hands of institutions ambitious to defy the natural gravity of their business and to push profits into the stratosphere.
The rocket scientists they employed were among the cleverest people on Earth, but their technology was complicated and fragile. It was bound to end in tears.
Tricky task
You can see this pattern in the world of hedge funds and derivatives, and perhaps even more plainly in banking and the rise of securitisation.
A bank is fundamentally a rather dull old business.
It keeps a small amount of its own money - capital - ready on stand-by should anything go wrong.
But on that modest base, it builds an enormous balance sheet of two huge towers of cash: one of money borrowed, and the other of money lent or invested.
It is hard to make serious money this way. The trick is somehow to charge more for the money the bank lends than it pays for the same money it borrows.
Bankers know how to drive that vehicle into modestly profitable terrain - you make it your business to borrow short-term and lend long-term. But it is still not a terribly exciting money-spinner.
Over the generations they have found there are ways to push profits higher, but experience suggests the higher they push them, the more vulnerable their institution.

For example, they can economise on capital on stand-by. But then they have less to protect them if things go wrong. Or they can lend at higher rates to riskier people. Again, they make more money but then they stand to lose more.
You can see how anyone with a bit of nous might want to smarten the business up and find a way to build a bank that is both more profitable and more secure.
Well, that is what the technology of securitisation promised.
It allowed banks to lend in copious quantities without carrying all the risks of their loans, which they could sell off as securities. It appeared to be a magic bullet, enabling them to shed risks and make some of their lending margin.
Suffice to say banks took the magic bullet and fired it upon themselves by allowing the quality of their loans to be absurdly degraded.
Plus to cap it all, they bought securities as well as selling them, so when the loan defaults came, it was the banks who were suffering from them. They had not got rid of risk after all.
It is every bit as silly as confusing metric and imperial units. But only bankers who could see beyond the pedestrian world in which they operated would have tripped up in these ways.
Essentially, it is just one example of the way our natural human instinct to be innovative has served us very badly in finance.
It is too easy to allow optimism and self-interest to cloud the judgement and to foster confusion between the very occasional genuine advance with the more common illusions that apparently allow profits to be conjured up from nowhere by disguising the risks that are being taken.
The answer is not to ban innovation, but to be wary of it.
Interestingly, some of the Wall Street rocket scientists behind securitisation were actually real rocket scientists, from the very lab in Pasadena which had managed the Mars Climate Orbiter project.
The real lesson is not that we need to find even cleverer people to take over the world of banking. It is that we would be more likely to avoid mistakes if we could breed them a little stupider.
Evan Davis presents the three-part series The City Uncovered on BBC2. The first programme Banks and How to Break Them airs at 9pm on Wednesday 14 January.

French students flex their muscles
By Henri Astier
BBC News, Paris
Universities across France have been disrupted by blockades
Revolt is in the air in France and, as usual, students in the streets rather than politicians in parliament, are leading the charge against an embattled government.
French students are angry about a new law - pushed through parliament last month - which makes it easy for employers to sack young people.
The movement has taken the form of huge rallies joined by trade unions, with another day of marches and strikes due on Tuesday.
But students have also taken vigorous, direct action by blockading hundreds of universities and schools across France. It is in these revolutionary microcosms that the uprising is being hatched.
At Jussieu University in Paris - the focus of many past student revolts - insurrectional excitement is palpable.
"We are in our fifth week of blockade," Marie Gombeaud, a 19-year-old biology student, says proudly.
She has put aside laboratory work for the time being, and is mobilising students, administrating an internet forum on the protests and staffing checkpoints around the Jussieu campus.
Planning
The main entrance is chained and barricaded by a clutter of overturned chairs, rubbish bins and desks. At side entrances, Ms Gombeaud and other students are restricting access to a few chosen activists.
Lelio Stettin, 23, the local leader, currently exerts more authority over the campus than the vice-chancellor, who has so far refrained from calling in the security forces.
So many things need to be done
Lelio Stettin,Student leader
Mr Stettin is a busy man. His phone is ringing constantly.
"So many things need to be done: we have to prepare for another general assembly, leaflets have to be written and printed, we need placards for Tuesday's marches.
"Megaphones, sound systems and vans also have to be arranged. Excuse me, I must take this call."
University staff are also allowed into and out of the grounds - but they are not working. On Monday they were holding their own general assembly to decide whether they would also strike.
A mile away, at the heart of the Latin Quarter, the Sorbonne University too is closed.
But the students are no longer in control - police expelled them after they tried to take over the buildings more than two weeks ago.
Now the capital's flagship university is surrounded by security forces in heavy riot gear. However, Sorbonne annexes on the outskirts of the city are still controlled by striking students.
Merging movements
At one of the sites, in Clignancourt, north of Paris, preparations are going ahead for the forthcoming protests.
"We are working out how, where and when we are all going to meet," says Simon Vacheron, 23, a history student. Students say the protests have been infiltrated by trouble-makers
One big concern is over security. During previous marches demonstrators have been attacked by troublemakers. Some students have been given the task of protecting others during the rally, Mr Vacheron says.
Violence during the protests has been blamed on various groups - far-right activists, anarchists and sundry outsiders.
But the apparent involvement of some youths from the immigrant suburbs of Paris - who carried out their own uprising last November - divides the current protesters.
"It breaks my heart that thugs are trying to destroy the movement," says Mr Vacheron. "They too are the victims of economic insecurity. The protests are aimed at helping them!"
But others see the current protests and the riots that erupted in France's impoverished suburbs last year as two sides of the same coin.
"Both are revolts against economic insecurity," says Victor Vidilles, a leader of France's main student union, Unef.
"The two movements are merging, with blockades taking place in universities in immigrant suburbs."
Choice
Two-thirds of France's universities are being seriously disrupted. French student power has an impressive track record.
I want to study, but students are not being given a choice
Zhor Hocine,Secondary school student
The May 1968 uprisings helped undermine the legitimacy of General Charles de Gaulle, who stood down the following year, and subsequent government plans - notably in 1986, 1994, 1995, and 2005 - were shelved in the face of mass student protests.
This explains why demonstrators are scenting blood. The government has clearly been wrong-footed and blockades have spread to hundreds of secondary schools across the country.
The students have vowed to continue their movement until Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin withdraws the employment plan - known as the CPE.
However not all agree with the blockades.
"I am taking my final exams at the end of the year," says Zhor Hocine, a final year student at the Lycee Rabelais, a blockaded secondary school in northern Paris.
"I want to study, but students are not being given a choice."
Occupations 'illegal'
An active anti-blockade movement has been formed to try to reopen schools and universities.
Sebastien Bordmann, one of the movement's leaders, sees a bitter irony in the fact that many of the current protesters also took to the streets during the 2002 presidential election against far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen.
"They were against the fascists then. Now they are behaving just like them."
Occupations and blockades, Mr Bordmann says, are totally illegal. "Right is on our side," he adds.
For the moment, however, might and numbers are on the side of the protesters - and the anti-CPE coalition is hoping to turn Tuesday's marches and strikes into a decisive show of force.

Players prepare for Half-Life 2
Steam members can pre-load some of the code for the game
Chunks of the code for Half-Life 2 has been officially released online.
The long-awaited sequel has no official release date, but game maker Valve has started letting members of its online community get hold of encrypted copies.
When officially launched, downloaders will be able to buy codes to access the encrypted files and start playing immediately.
But Valve is facing criticism online for making the game available, but not actually letting people play it.
Waiting to play
The 500MB compressed file containing some of the encrypted game was put on machines serving Valve's Steam community on 26 August. Unpacked the file is reportedly about 1GB in size.
Steam is software that, among other things, lets players take each other on in online games, acts as an anti-cheating and online authentication system and helps people get hold of the latest updates.
Quake creators tried to protect their game too
Half-Life 2 was originally supposed to appear in September 2003 but has faced consistent delays.
Even now no fixed date has been given for its release and some gamers speculate that it may not appear until November.
Others believe that release is imminent because Valve is happy for the game software to be downloaded.
Some also speculate that the relatively small size of the files means that the encrypted version is not the full game. Many expect to have to download more code when the full and final game is released.
According to some reports, the download only includes files such as textures and audio, rather than the actual levels and programs needed to run the game. A lot of people keen to download the game are been forced to wait because the Steam servers are managing the numbers of people allowed to download it at any one time.
However, soon after being appearing on the Steam servers, copies of the download started to appear on the BitTorrent file-sharing network.
Hacked Quake
In the past when other game makers have tried similar tactics, they have gone badly wrong.
Id Software's shareware version of Quake contained the full game but only let players try out the opening levels for free.
To play the full game, players were supposed to buy a code to unlock it. Instead hacks for the protected parts of the game were found and many people bought those instead of the official codes and played the whole game without paying for it.
Many people commenting on the Half-Life 2 release on the Slashdot discussion boards criticised Valve for keeping the game locked up even though it was almost ready to play.

Edward VIII: Abdication timeline
The couple were together until Edward's death in 1972
When Edward, then Prince of Wales, first met American divorcee Wallis Simpson, she did not make much of an impression on him.
But over the next few years he fell deeply in love with her, ultimately giving up the throne to marry her. BBC News Online takes a look at some of the key events leading up to his abdication.
10 January 1931: Edward meets Wallis Simpson at a house party. Mrs Simpson is married to her second husband, Ernest, after divorcing her first husband Earl Winfield Spencer.
May 1931: Edward and Mrs Simpson meet for the second time
Key dates
10 Jan 1931: Edward and Wallis first meet
20 Jan 1936: King George V dies. Edward becomes King
27 Oct 1936: Wallis Simpson granted decree nisi
10 Dec 1936: Edward VIII signs Instrument of Abdication
January 1932: Edward dines at the Simpsons' London flat, staying until 4am. At the end of the month, the Simpsons spend their first weekend at Edward's country retreat, Fort Belvedere in Berkshire.
August 1934: Edward takes a party, including Wallis Simpson, on holiday to Biarritz, followed by a cruise along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts. Ernest Simpson is notably absent for the first time.
November 1934: Wallis Simpson attends a party at Buckingham Palace in honour of the Duke of Kent. Edward introduces her to his mother, but the King, George V, is outraged and refuses to meet her.
20 January 1936: King George V dies and Edward succeeds him as King.
May 1936: Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin meets Wallis Simpson for the first time at a dinner hosted by the King, although Ernest Simpson was also there and Baldwin did not realise the significance of her presence.
July 1936: Ernest Simpson, who had been conducting an affair of his own, moves out of the couple's home to his club.
August 1936: Wallis Simpson joins the King and other guests for a cruise along the Yugoslav, Greek and Turkish coasts. Photographs of the King and Mrs Simpson together are widely published in the American and continental press, with much speculation about their relationship.
Divorce
October 1936: Wallis Simpson installed in house rented for her by the King in Regent's Park
20 October 1936: Stanley Baldwin confronts King for the first time over his relationship with Mrs Simpson. He asks him to conduct the affair more discreetly and persuade her to put off her impending divorce proceedings against her husband, to no avail.
Stanley Baldwin played a key role in the abdication crisis
27 October 1936: The Simpsons' divorce case is heard at Ipswich Assizes and a decree nisi is granted.
16 November 1936: King sends for Baldwin. He tells him he wants to marry Mrs Simpson. Baldwin says that whoever the King married would have to become Queen, and the British public would not accept Mrs Simpson as such. The King says he is prepared to abdicate if the government opposes his marriage.
25 November 1936: King meets Baldwin again, telling him he wants a morganatic marriage to Wallis Simpson, in which he could still be King but she would not be Queen, merely his consort. This would require new legislation in both Britain and the Dominions, and although Baldwin tells the King this would not be accepted, the King authorises the prime minister to raise the proposal.
Broadcast
27 November 1936: Baldwin raises the issue of a morganatic marriage in the Cabinet, which rejects it outright. It is also then rejected by the governments of the Dominions.
2 December 1936: Baldwin tells the King none of his governments are willing to agree to a morganatic marriage, and that he now has three choices: to finish his relationship with Mrs Simpson, to marry against the advice of his ministers who would then resign, or to abdicate. The couple married in France
3 December 1936: The story breaks in the British press, which is widely disapproving of the prospect of the couple's marriage. Wallis Simpson leaves for France, to escape the furore.
The King tells Baldwin he wants to broadcast an appeal to the nation, putting his problem to them. He hopes this might sway public opinion in favour of him marrying and remaining King. Baldwin says such a broadcast would be constitutionally impossible.
9 December 1936: King informs government of irrevocable decision to abdicate.
10 December 1936: King signs Instrument of Abdication, drawn up by his close friend and adviser Sir Walter Monckton. Baldwin announces the news to the Commons.
The news is announced that the King has abdicated
11 December 1936: Abdication endorsed by Parliament. King broadcasts his decision to the nation on the BBC.
The public remember their responses to the abdication
12 December 1936: Edward's brother proclaimed King George VI. Edward, now Duke of Windsor, leaves England for Austria.
Proclamation of George VI's accession
3 May 1937: Wallis Simpson's decree absolute comes through. She is now divorced and free to remarry.
12 May 1937: Coronation of King George VI
3 June 1937: Edward and Wallis Simpson marry in France. She becomes the Duchess of Windsor.
