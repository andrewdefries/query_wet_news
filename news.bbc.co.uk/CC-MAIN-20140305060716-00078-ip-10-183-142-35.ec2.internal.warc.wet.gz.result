Full text of Nato statement
The following is the text of a statement issued by Nato Secretary-General Javier Solana following an emergency meeting of
the North Atlantic Council, Nato's top policy-making body, on Sunday.
The council condemns the massacre of Kosovar Albanians that was
carried out in the village of Racak last Friday. This represents a
flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.
The council calls on the Yugoslav authorities to co-operate fully
with the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia) in
accordance with UN resolutions, including by granting immediate
and unrestricted access to Chief Prosecutor Arbour, and
international investigators including Finnish forensic experts.
We also call on the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) authorities
to ensure the security of the ICTY personnel.
The council demands that the government of the FRY take
immediate steps to ensure that those responsible for this massacre
are brought to justice.
The names of those who participated in the killing and those who gave the orders must be divulged and they must be handed over to the ICTY for prosecution if requested.
Milosevic must comply with all his commitments to Nato and to
the OSCE which are based on UNSC Resolution 1199.
The FRY must bring VJ (Yugoslav army) and MUP (special police)
force levels and posture into compliance with its commitments to
the alliance last October.
As the signatory of this agreement, President Milosevic is responsible for ensuring that these force levels are respected. He is also personally responsible for the behavior of his security forces.
The NAC received briefings from the chairman of the Military Committee and Saceur (Supreme Allied Commander in Europe) on the
military situation and on the status of Nato planning.
It reaffirmed that the ACTORDS (activation orders) for air operations
remain in effect.
The NAC has decided to send the chairman of the Military Committee and Saceur to Belgrade to impress upon the Yugoslav authorities the gravity of the situation and their obligation to respect all their commitments to Nato, and to report back to the NAC.
The chairman of the Military Committee and Saceur will also
reaffirm Nato's support to international efforts to bring peace to
the region, including by the United Nations, OSCE and the European
Union.
The council fully supports the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission
and its head, Ambassador Walker.
It expresses its strong condemnation of the attack against two members of this mission last Friday and calls for those responsible to be brought to justice.
The council insists that the FRY authorities respect their obligations to ensure the security of the verifiers. Both sides must refrain from actions that put OSCE verifiers in danger.
Finally, Nato condemns all acts of violence. It calls on both sides to cease hostilities immediately and to begin negotiations toward a lasting political solution which provides greater autonomy for Kosovo and which preserves the territory integrity of the FRY.

Letter monopoly could end
Competition could mean an end to a national letter rate
Plans that could see the end of the Post Office's monopoly on letter deliveries are to be put before a meeting of European Union ministers in Brussels on Friday.
The European Commission wants to see a final date set for the complete deregulation of postal systems across Europe for letters over a certain weight.
But some countries, including Britain, are concerned that deregulation will mean a decline in services, especially for rural areas.
Royal Mail has a monopoly on packages up to 350g
Postal workers' unions have previously warned that competition would mean job losses in the industry.
The EC wants post offices throughout the European Union to be forced to allow competition on all letters weighing more than 50 grams.
Most letters weigh less than this and would be exempt from the proposed competition rules. Nevertheless, the move would be a significant erosion of the Royal Mail's monopoly on packages up to 350 grams. There are fears that competition might damage the Royal Mail and other European postal systems causing them to cut their services to rural areas where the cost of collecting and delivering mail can outweigh the revenue generated by stamps.
'Hypocrisy'
The fear is that if competition were given free rein, customers living in the countryside could be charged more for their post.
And the current British practice of sending a letter anywhere in the country at one price, regardless of distance, could become too costly to sustain.
At Friday's meeting, the British Trade Minister Alan Johnson and several of his European colleagues will try to delay or water down the plans, which have already been rejected as too radical by the European Parliament. But the UK Government could find itself accused of hypocrisy as Britain has pushed for deregulation across Europe in many other sectors. Search BBC News Online

Singer Andre banned from driving
Singer Peter Andre was caught speeding by Sussex Police
Singer Peter Andre has been banned from driving for six months after being caught speeding in his Mercedes car.
Andre, 32, who is to marry glamour model Katie Price in September, was caught by Sussex Police doing 49mph in a 30mph zone in Hangleton in Hove.
His lawyer told Brighton magistrates on Friday he should not be banned because he needed to drive Ms Price around after the birth of their son Junior.
The court banned him because he already had eight points on his licence.
Laser speed gun
Andre asked to speak to magistrates to ask them not to take his licence away but they imposed an immediate ban.
The court, which also fined Andre �500 and ordered him to pay �35 costs, was told police clocked him with a laser speed gun.
The earlier points on his licence were for driving without insurance.
Andre and Ms Price, who live in Maresfield Park, near Uckfield, East Sussex, met on ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here while she was still known as Jordan.

Man Utd striker signs for Swansea
Brandy has been a regular in Manchester United's reserve team
Swansea City have signed striker Febian Brandy on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season. The Manchester-born youngster, 18, has progressed through the club's ranks and became a regular in the reserves last season.
Swansea boss Roberto Martinez has been looking for a new striker after ruling out signing Cardiff's Warren Feeney on a permanent basis after his loan spell.
He said: "Febian is highly regarded and we've been following for a long time."

If this guy scores goals, then he is exactly what we need

Brandy was first spotted playing for his local team, West End Boys, at the age of nine and he was invited to train at United where he has remained.
A broken leg hindered the start of his 2005/06 campaign and further injuries throughout the season meant he was limited to only a handful of reserve outings.
But last season he broke into the reserve team on a regular basis and is now making his first move out on loan.
"It's something different to playing reserve team football and hopefully I can do well and help Swansea win promotion," said Brandy.
The move is likely to end the Swans interest in Blackpool striker Keigan Parker, and Feeney's move could be resurrected in the summer if the Swans and Cardiff can agree terms.
"We lost one number up front with Warren Feeney and it was the perfect opportunity to bring Febian in," said Martinez.
"He can bring us freshness, pace and a lot of talent into the squad."
