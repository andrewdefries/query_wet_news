Panama Canal : America's strategic artery
Around 15,000 ships use the canal every year
By Richard Lister in Washington
Perhaps more than any other engineering project, the Panama Canal has been a blunt reminder of one nation's dominance in the world. Washington helped carve the nation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 in order to gain control of the canal route. Canal fact
Each ship takes 8-10 hours to transit the canal
Eleven years later it had linked the Atlantic and the Pacific with a 50-mile canal through the heart of the jungle.
Even though it slices Panama in two, the canal has always been owned, controlled and operated by the United States. That will change at the end of the year, when the United States fulfils the treaty signed by Presidents Carter and Torrijos in 1977 and hands the waterway to Panama. Since its earliest days the US navy has seen the canal as a vital link
The 1977 treaty, drawn up as a result of increasing nationalist pressure from Panama, has never been particularly popular in the United States: in the words of one former US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer "We built it, we paid for it, we use it". But although used by some 15,000 vessels a year, it is less important than it once was. Some 10% of the world's container ships are too big to go through the canal, and railways now carry much of its cargo. Canal fact
Contrary to popular opinion the canal does not run east to west, but south-east to north-west
Nevertheless as the "belt buckle" of the Western Hemisphere, it still has considerable strategic importance. Howard Air Force Base in the Canal Zone had been the hub for US anti-drug efforts in Latin America; now that it has closed, the US is scrambling to find other bases to launch anti-narcotics missions.
Port control
But more sinister to many Republican eyes is the fact that a Hong Kong company, Hutchison Whampoa, won the right to control a port facility at each end of the canal after a somewhat murky bidding process. Canal fact
The largest ships that can use the canal are known as PANAMAX
The Clinton administration denies that the firm has links to the Chinese government, but President Clinton did nothing to calm the controversy when he commented: "I think the Chinese will in fact be bending over backward to make sure they run it in a competent able and fair manner".
The State Department later stressed that Hutchison Whampoa will not in fact be "running" the canal, just two of its ports. Admiral Moorer has warned that China could use the facilities to base missiles in Panama - something denied by the company, and the governments in Washington and Beijing. Fears have been expressed over Chinese "control" of canal ports
Opinion polls show that the majority of people in Panama are also concerned by the loss of the American presence. While sovereignty over the canal is a matter of intense national pride, the local economy is already suffering from the departure of thousands of American troops. There are fears too that without the US presence, the small country could be dragged deeper into the narco-economy of neighbouring Colombia. After almost a century of American imperialism in Panama, both sides are now looking to a new but uncertain future. Search BBC News Online

The death of the village school
By Justin Parkinson
BBC News education reporter
The children will have to change schools in the new year
The children are looking forward to Christmas.
The desk is covered in black paper and crayons as they excitedly prepare their classroom decorations.
But they know this will not happen again - not here, at least.
Their primary school, St Mary's of Hope, is to close at the end of the term.
'Snobbery'
The pupil roll has fallen to just 11 and the governors have decided it is no longer viable.
As of next year, the village of Hope-under-Dinmore, in Herefordshire, will be without its own school for the first time in almost 150 years.
According to head teacher Gail Richards, too many local people are sending their children to be educated elsewhere, for reasons of "snobbery".
She said: "They are thinking that other schools in the area have a more middle-class intake and that, if their kids go there, they will be more middle-class.
Gail Richards admits Christmas celebrations will be difficult
"It's very sad for us. The children are getting more used to it but they say they don't like it. They are scared.
"We are a good school. Inspectors have said so, but parents seem not to notice."
St Mary's of Hope has often had to fight for its existence since it was built in the 1860s.
Descendants of the self-taught 18th Century inventor and industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright gave the money for its foundation.
Living in nearby Hampton Court, a stately home, they wanted to give the children of farm labourers a basic education.
An excuse note written in 1888 by one pupil's mother shows how much things have changed.
It reads: "Sir, Will you please excuse Elizabeth for staying at home today? Her mother wants her to help her. We are having the pig killed."
Further afield
These days, parents are more likely to work in the Cadbury's chocolate plant or the Little Chef restaurant, both just along the A49.
Modern transport also means parents can look further afield for schools.
St Mary's pupil roll has dwindled. It's good being in a small school. We get to know each other better
Bethany, pupil
Four years ago it fell to 17, prompting an inquiry into its future by the county council.
A campaign by parents and staff meant it was retained. To celebrate, the school changed its name from Dinmore Primary School to St Mary's, the same as the adjoining church.
The uniform and logo changed too, but still pupil numbers declined.
The children, aged four to 11, are taught in just two class groups. Mrs Richards, the only full-time member of staff, is helped by two part-time teachers and a classroom assistant. That means plenty of one-to-one classroom attention; it also means expense.
It has long been thought the children could not develop properly with so few peers. Earlier this year, the governors decided St Mary's had to close.
'Lovely spot'
Their chairman, Neil Ramsay, said: "It was also a case of pre-empting the county council. It would have been hard to justify keeping a school open with just 11 pupils there.
"I can't see another school ever opening on the site. It might become housing, as it's on such a lovely spot overlooking the fields.
"This could mean the death of the village. There's no pub here and the village hall closed down six months ago.
"The school was all that held the place together."
As the autumn leaves fall on the grounds outside, Mrs Richards looks at the school photos from years past.
One taken in the 1970s shows 47 smiling children. The school was all that held the place together
Neil Ramsay, chairman of governors
Mrs Richards said: "If everyone in the village kept sending their kids here, we would stay open. But they think 'Why should we?'.
"We attract from the immediate locality. A lot of the parents of our children don't have cars and some don't have jobs.
"It's almost like a snobbery. People think 'We've got a car, so we can take them elsewhere'.
"As they get to choose their school, the children go elsewhere and so people living in the village don't mix."
When St Mary's closes, the pupils will go to other schools, all at least three miles away.
Taxis
Bethany, aged seven, said: "I like it here. The teachers are nice and I've got lots of friends.
"I feel sad. I feel it's good being in a small school. We get to know each other better."
Kade, also seven, said: "I'm half happy and half sad. There will be more people my age there but I like it here too."
The children have to play together, whatever their ages
St Mary's packed lunches are delivered by taxi from a secondary school in the area every day.
It is a quaint reminder of rural communities "making do" with limited resources.
In the 19th Century, part of the job description of the teacher's assistant was "church organist".
The making do is about to end, though.
Mrs Richards, who is looking for alternative employment, said: "The village won't know what it's lost until it's gone.
"It might be like the railways that were closed in the 1960s. Everyone regrets that now."
It is hoped that some former pupils will attend the final assembly and Nativity play in the Victorian building's tiny hall.
Mrs Richards said: "We are trying not to be too downbeat for the sake of the children.
"We want to give the school as good a send-off as we can. It will be Christmas after all. "We've got to go out with a rendition of Away in a Manger."

New children's guide to St Kilda
School pupils gave suggestions to how the website should look
A new website giving information about the history and wildlife of the remote islands of St Kilda has been launched for children.
The islands' owners, the National Trust for Scotland, is behind the easy to use site called the Wee Kilda Guide.
It went live on Wednesday and carries details on the archipelago's wild sheep, birds and its former residents.
It was designed by CCTechnology Glasgow with input from NTS staff and Balivanich Primary School in Benbecula.
Sue MacKenzie, NTS Highlands and Islands education officer, said the school pupils gave many ideas on what they wanted from the site.
She said: "The new pages tell what life was like in the past for the children on St Kilda and also what life is like for people who live and work on the island now."
