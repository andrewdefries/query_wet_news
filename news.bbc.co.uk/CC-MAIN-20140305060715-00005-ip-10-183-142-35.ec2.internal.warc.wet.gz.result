Sierra Leone rebels block UN troops
Kenyans were the first UN troops to arrive in Sierra Leone
Rebels in Sierra Leone have stopped a detachment of United Nations peacekeepers from entering a rebel-held town.
UN forces are in the process of being deployed across the country to disarm and demobilise former combatants.
BBC correspondent Sylvestre Rogers, who was travelling with the 450 Kenyan peacekeepers, said rebel soldiers would not let them enter the town of Makeni.
The rebels, who included members of both the Revolutionary United Front and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, said the UN troops had to show proof of clearance from rebel commanders.
The UN soldiers insisted they had authorisation. But the rebels would not listen, and the situation became more tense as a rebel colonel arrived with reinforcements.
Gunfire
The BBC correspondent said the colonel was "very discourteous" to his Kenyan counterpart, who acted diplomatically throughout the confrontation - despite "accidental" gunfire by a 14-year-old rebel fighter.
The Kenyans eventually had to return to the base from which they had come.
One rebel officer said that if Nigerian soldiers had approached the town, the rebels would have opened fire without asking questions
Nigerian troops are currently preparing to leave Sierra Leone, having led the Sierra Leonean government's fight against the rebels for the past decade. The incident near Makeni is the latest setback in a process which has already suffered delays.
In one notable success for the peacekeepers, a Ghanaian contingent has gone to Daru in eastern Sierra Leone - a diamond-producing centre formerly controlled by the rebels.

Anti-war grandmothers in US court
Cindy Sheehan was among the grandmothers' supporters A group of women who call themselves the "Granny Peace Brigade" have gone on trial in New York for their protest against the Iraq war.
The women, aged between 50 and 91, were charged with disorderly conduct after demonstrating outside a military recruitment centre.
Their supporters outside the courthouse included leading anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, whose son died in Iraq.
The 18 women, many of whom are grandmothers, have pleaded not guilty.
"Coming to this damn court is nothing compared to what is happening to people in Iraq," said Marie Runyon, aged 91 and the oldest member of the group.
'Larger purpose'
None of the women has grandchildren serving in the US military.
But Joe Wile, co-founder of the group, said that was beside the point. We should be praising these grandmothers, not prosecuting them
Norman Siegel, Defence lawyer
"We're here for a larger purpose," said the 74-year-old. "We feel extremely heartbroken for all the young kids, American and Iraqi, who are dying in this war."
The women were arrested on 17 October last year after they protested outside a US military recruitment centre in Times Square, New York.
They had wanted to enlist, but found the door locked and sat down in front of the building.
Prosecutors say this prevented people from entering or leaving the centre and obstructed pedestrian traffic. They also say the women refused to disperse as ordered.
The women have been charged on two counts of disorderly conduct.
'Patriotic protest'
Noted civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel is defending the women in court. "We should be praising these grandmothers, not prosecuting them," Mr Siegel said. He told the court that the women had not broken any laws and that their protest was "respectful, orderly, justified and patriotic".
Ms Sheehan, who was supporting the woman outside the Manhattan Criminal Court, is famous for setting up camp outside President Bush's Texas ranch to demand a meeting with him. "When lovely women like these grannies are punished for trying to save lives, our country is in a mess," she said.

Boulez crowned conductor of the year
Royal Philharmonic Society recognises Pierre Boulez
French avant garde veteran Pierre Boulez was named conductor of the year at the Royal Philharmonic Society awards.
He received the prize for his concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and work with young conductors and musicians.
A series of individuals and ensembles in contemporary classical music were rewarded for innovation and excellence at the annual awards, which took place at the Dorchester Hotel.
Sir Peter Hall gave the keynote speech at the event, at which Dame Janet Baker gave away the awards.
Two contemporary compositions won awards: Wolfgang Rhim's Jagden und Formen and Gy�rgy Ligeti's S�ppal, Dobbal, N�diheged�vel.
Multi-national
The LSO received the award for the Large Ensemble, along with its regular conductor Sir Colin Davis.

The award for Chamber Ensemble went to the Belcea Quartet, a multi-national group with members from Romania, Poland and Scotland.
A new award, created in partnership with Classic FM for audience development, went to Glyndebourne opera house for its touring programmes and opera for young people.
Musicians who received awards were pianist Piotr Anderszewski for his work at the Cheltenham 2000 festival, and singer Gerald Finlay, for his work in Mark Anthony Turnage's opera The Silver Tassie.
Winning in the category of concert series was Towards The Millennium, a 10-year project inspired by Sir Simon Rattle and the late Michael Vyner.
The Royal Philharmonic Society awards were set up in 1989 to recognise outstanding contributions in the field of music within the UK.
The Royal Philharmonic Society was founded in 1813 and is the second-oldest concert society in the world.

Williams voted off The X Factor
Williams was tearful following his exit
Asbestos worker Andy Williams is the latest contestant to be voted off ITV1 talent show The X Factor.
He lost out to teacher Beverley Trotman after three out of the four judges decided to keep her in the competition.
Williams' mentor, Dannii Minogue, apologised to him for choosing the wrong song for him to perform - Snow Patrol's Chasing Cars.
"I feel terrible," she said. Seven acts remain in the competition, including girl band Hope.
Trotman sang a rendition of James Blunt's You're Beautiful.
Meanwhile, The X Factor lost out to rival talent programme Strictly Come Dancing, according to overnight estimates. The BBC One programme was seen by an average of 9.3 million viewers, with results announced in a separate Sunday show. The first part of The X Factor scored 8.7 million, with the results show watched by 8.2 million. E-mail this to a friend

Dylan could be new sat-nav voice
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Music legend Bob Dylan is "talking to a couple of car companies" about becoming the voice of their GPS system.The singer-songwriter discussed the possibility on his BBC Radio 6 Music Sunday show which was on the theme of street maps. Renowned for his raspy, nasally tones, the 68-year-old American gave his listeners a taster of what his directions might sound like. "Left at the next street. No, right. You know what? Just go straight." He continued: "I probably shouldn't do it because whichever way I go, I always end up at one place - on Lonely Avenue. Luckily I'm not totally alone. Ray Charles beat me there." The normally reclusive Dylan, whose hits include Blowin' in the Wind and Like a Rolling Stone, admitted he does not normally like telling people what he is doing. His Theme Time Radio Hour is on Mondays at midnight. The singer is currently on hiatus, and this week's show was a repeat. His comments had not previously been reported. Comedian John Cleese is one of several celebrities who have already lent their voices to sat-nav devices. Other sat-nav voices include Susan Skipper, who appeared as Nigel Havers' posh girlfriend in the 1980s sitcom Don't Wait Up; and Eve Karpf, who voice-dubbed the famous line: "Monsieur, with these Rocher you are really spoiling us" in a chocolate commercial.

Papillon wins National thriller
Ruby Walsh celebrates as Papillon takes the win
Jockey Ruby Walsh rode to a famous victory on Irish chaser Papillon to win the Grand National at his first attempt.
After a barren 25-year patch for Irish mounts, Papillon becomes the second consecutive horse from Ireland to win, following the success of Bobbyjo last year.
I'm proud of the horse, I'm proud of the whole family and I'm proud of him [Ruby]. It's a great day to be alive
Ted Walsh, Papillon's trainer
It is also the second straight win for a father-and-son team as Rudy and trainer Ted Walsh emulated the achievements of Paul and Tommy Carberry in 1999.
The 20-year-old jockey was barely able to speak for grinning as he was cheered into the winner's enclosure.
"My fella just kept picking up and picking up and once I reached the last I never thought anything was going to get past me," said Walsh.
Papillon held off the challenge of 25-1 shot Mely Moss in a ding-dong battle over the 494-yard run-in to be first past the post.
Niki Dee, another horse at 25-1, brought up third place, with outsider Brave Highlander, at an even longer 50-1, in fourth. Fifth place was taken by veteran jumper Addington Boy.
Speaking after the win, Ted Walsh said: "It's a wonderful feeling. We had all the luck today.
Mely Moss (left) pushed to the finish
"I'm proud of the horse, I'm proud of the whole family and I'm proud of him [Ruby]. It's a great day to be alive."
The organisers will have breathed a sigh of relief as the race finished with no horse fatalities. Concerns over the safety of the course had been raised following the deaths of five mounts in the first two days of the Aintree meeting.
Papillon started the day as a 33-1 outsider, but was backed down on the day, with Dark Stranger the eventual favourite on 9-1.
Heavily backed Star Traveller led for the majority of the race, with the unfancied Esprit de Cotte, Lucky Town, Hollybank Buck and The Last Fling all appearing in the leading pack.
Five horses fell at the first
Papillon also raced prominently and took the lead three out. The nine-year-old looked to be clear as they crossed the Melling Road, but Norman Williamson produced a spurt from Mely Moss to threaten.
But Papillon had the better of the last two fences and hung on grimly to win by one and a quarter of lengths and claim the �290,000 winner's purse. The favourite, Dark Stranger, gave champion jockey Tony McCoy a heavy fall at the third to disappoint, while last year's winner Bobbyjo showed well on the first circuit, but faded badly to finish well down the field after being interfered with at Becher's second time round..
Of the maximum starting field of 40, 17 horses finished the course and of the other 23 no injuries were reported.

How to play Barbados road tennis
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
A cross between lawn tennis and table tennis, road tennis got its name because it was played on back streets and quiet roads. It originated in Barbados - probably in the early 1930s. The rules of road tennis are identical to those of table tennis. The court is like an overgrown table tennis board painted on a paved surface. The racquets are made of wood and resemble large table tennis racquets. Carmen Roberts reports on how the sport has taken off... Get in touch with Fast Track via e-mail

Johnson signals targets shake-up
Alan Johnson said targets had produced "massive improvements"
Current targets will become too narrow a measure of success as schools move towards more personalised learning, the education secretary has said.
Alan Johnson also suggested a shake-up of the system could encourage some schools to seek out bright pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.
He said reform plans for England would be announced soon.
The National Union of Teachers has welcomed his comments and called for the scrapping of league tables.
Threshold targets focus everything on a narrow time and performance window
Alan JohnsonEducation Secretary
Mr Johnson told a meeting of new head teachers in London, organised by the National College of School Leadership, that school targets had produced "massive improvements" and were "here to stay".
But he added: "They do not tell the whole story."
They conceal "tales of amazing achievement on the one hand and substantial groups of disadvantaged kids left behind on the other", he said.
"Threshold targets focus everything on a narrow time and performance window, failing to take account of potential or progress over a longer period."
Thresholds are, for example, the proportion of pupils attaining a certain level or number of qualifications - such as five good GCSEs. Mr Johnson said it was not a success if a child who was expected to obtain eight A grade GCSEs only achieved five moderate grades.
But if a pupil who was expected to achieve nothing got their English and maths GCSEs then it was an achievement worth recognising, he added.
'Open mind'
He said he had a "genuinely open mind" about how measures of a child's progression could "supplement" the existing targets system.
"Should we look at schools in terms of the overall numbers of pupils making progress at each stage? "Should we move over time to a system where all pupils are expected to progress by at least two levels, say, in each key stage in reading, writing and maths? How long might that take?"
The education secretary said �1bn was being spent to bring about pupil-centred personalised learning in England's schools - equivalent to about �135 per pupil.
The government is at last facing up to the obvious
Steve SinnottNational Union of Teachers
Mr Johnson said the funds would "maximise the chances of every pupil to progress".
So-called "value added" progress measures are already published.
From this year, the school performance tables will also reflect such "contextual" factors as pupils' ethnicity, gender, social deprivation and special educational needs. But the targets schools have do not relate to these. The general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Steve Sinnott, said personalised education was in direct contradiction to crude national targets. "But he needs to go further. League tables are not inevitable. Other countries have shown they can do without them. They should go."
'More intelligent'
The head of the Association of School and College Leaders, John Dunford, said consideration of new progress measures was long overdue.
The threshold GCSE measure "skews policy and forces schools to allocate scarce resources to particular areas", he said. "A measure based on the progress that each individual student makes from one key stage to the next represents a step towards a more intelligent accountability system, as ASCL has long advocated." Shadow education secretary David Willetts said Mr Johnson was at last admitting that some children from poor areas were getting a raw deal from their education. "But Alan Johnson failed to address the crucial point. It is tried and tested teaching methods that benefit children of all abilities." Liberal Democrat spokeswoman Sarah Teather said struggling pupils were too often left behind under the rpesent "regime". "Funding shouldn't be focused on geographical areas or classes of people, but directly on those children who are under-achieving," she said. "This 'pupil premium' would create the necessary incentive for schools to take on challenging pupils." E-mail this to a friend

PDVSA: renuncias y normalidad
La disputa en PDVSA termin� en un fin de semana de v�rtigo en Venezuela.
La directiva de Petr�leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) present� sus renuncia este domingo y el presidente Hugo Ch�vez la acept� para iniciar "la recomposici�n" de la empresa.
Gast�n Parra me trajo la renuncia colectiva de toda la junta directiva y yo le acept� la renuncia como se la acepto a todos, para abrir el camino a la recomposici�n de la junta de Petr�leos de Venezuela
Hugo Ch�vez
"El doctor Gast�n Parra (presidente del ente petrolero) me trajo la renuncia colectiva de toda la junta directiva y yo le acept� la renuncia como se la acepto a todos, para abrir el camino a la recomposici�n de la junta de Petr�leos de Venezuela", dijo Ch�vez.
Horas despu�s, PDVSA anunci� que hab�a reestablecido a niveles normales sus exportaciones de crudo y derivados en sus principales terminales petroleros. Las refiner�as, sin embargo, no volver�n a operar en su totalidad hasta que puedan descargar sus productos refinados hacia los barcos que aguardan en puerto.
Las protestas
El regreso de Ch�vez al poder puede elevar el precio del crudo.
El nombramiento de Parra fue el que gener� el malestar en el ente petrolero que desemboc� en la huelga general y la rebeli�n contra el gobierno el pasado viernes.
Los mandos medios de PDVSA acusaron al gobierno de politizar la empresa al nombrar una directiva de aliados y no de expertos en la explotaci�n del crudo.
Ch�vez regres� al poder el domingo con un tono conciliador, dispuesto a "rectificar" en sus medidas e invit� a los venezolanos a la unidad nacional.
Precio del crudo
En tanto, Venezuela intentaba calmarse tras un fin de semana de v�rtigo expertos en el mercado de petr�leo coincidieron en que el precio del crudo subir�.
"�l (Ch�vez) es muy pro OPEP (Organizaci�n de Pa�ses de Exportadores de Petr�leo), lo que significa que la producci�n de crudo no crecer�", estim� Lawrence Eagles de Investigaci�n GNI.
El crudo cerr� a US$23,50 por barril el viernes y se espera que suba a US$27 en la apertura del lunes
El petr�leo registr� una baja a US$23,50 por barril el viernes luego de que PDVSA anunciara -una vez ca�do Ch�vez- que su producci�n se regir�a de acuerdo al mercado y no seg�n las cuotas de la OPEP.
Pero los operadores del mercado esperan que vuelva a subir el lunes a un precio cercano a los US$27 en que se encontraba tras el anuncio de Irak de no vender durante el mes de abril.
El ministro de Econom�a de Espa�a, Rodrigo Rato, y el director de la influyente Asociaci�n de Combustibles de Rusia, Serguei Borisov coincidieron en que no habr� mayores cambios.
Venezuela es el cuarto exportador mundial de petr�leo y el tercer proveedor de crudo a Estados Unidos.

Serie A quartet will stand trial
Italian football heavyweights Juventus, AC Milan, Lazio and Fiorentina will all face a sports court over allegations of corruption in the game.
An Italian Football Federation (FIGC) statement said prosecutor Stefano Palazzi had charged a total of 30 "subjects" for a range of illegalities.
Twenty-six unnamed people - but no players - are also set to stand trial.
Hearings will begin next Wednesday, with those found guilty facing the prospect of fines, bans and relegation.
Italian football league president Adriano Galliani, the vice president of AC Milan, announced his resignation but in a statement, denied any wrongdoing.
"I have decided to resign from my position as president of the Italian football league, but I wish to make it clear that this can not in any way be interepreted as an admission of responsibility," he said.
"The charges against me are an injustice and I reiterate that I am a total stranger to this affair."
BBC News' Rome correspondent Christian Fraser said: "It was a bittersweet day here. Within hours of Italy making it into the last 16, the country's football federation announced which teams would be involved in the hearings next week.
"The announcement did not come out until the Stock Exchange in Milan closed, where two of the four clubs involved, Juventus and Lazio, are listed.
"If any of these teams are found guilty then they could be relegated and will not take part in the European club competitions next season."
An investigation was started following the publication in May of telephone conversations in which the then Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi was heard telling referees chief Pierluigi Pairetto which match officials he wanted assigned to certain games.
Thirteen of Italy's 23-man World Cup squad play for the four clubs that are under scrutiny.
Separate criminal prosecutions may follow the FIGC trial, which is expected to deliver its verdicts between 7 and 9 July - the weekend of the World Cup final.
The decision was announced after the close of trading at the Milan Stock Exchange because some of the teams involved in the scandal are listed.
In an eight-line press release, it was confirmed that defendants from the four clubs would receive the 108-page dossier into the investigations on Friday.
A total of 30 people are under investigation, but due to Italian privacy laws, none of the names could be released.
It has been anticipated that severe sanctions, including possible relegation from Serie A, will be imposed on clubs found guilty of attempting to fix matches.
Juventus finished top of the table ahead of second-placed AC Milan in Serie A last season, but were only awarded the title on a "provisional" basis, according to former FIGC president Franco Carraro.
Carraro resigned in May, along with Moggi and the entire Juventus board.

Danny Spiller delighted to return to Gillingham
Spiller began his career as a trainee with the Gills
Midfielder Danny Spiller says he is going to put "all his energy" into his second spell at Gillingham.The 29-year-old was a major part of the Gills first team until leaving in 2007. There was talk of a move to play for MLS side Chicago Fire but those plans are on hold after being offered a five-month deal at Priestfield. "I can play in the States at a later time in my career. I'm going to channel all my energy into Gillingham Football Club now," Spiller told BBC Radio Kent. The former Millwall man insisted that the short-term deal suits both parties at the moment. "They want to see that I'm fit and there's not going to be any hiccups along the way," he said.
606: DEBATE
If his injury problems are behind him this could work out very well. Fingers crossed as his bite in midfield will be more than handy this season.
Vambogills
"I think it suits them as much as it suits me because it keeps me chomping at the bit and I already want to go out and earn myself a new contract." Spiller also revealed that Andy Hessenthaler's return to the club persuaded him to also come back for a second spell. "You always get off to a great start with a manager when you know they want you and you're one of their players that they signed," he said. "All I want to do now is get my head down and show him that he's made the right decision. "If I can keep training and playing in the same vain that I have been in the last month or so then I'm sure it's going to turn out to be another successful reign at Gillingham."

Individual event results and times
Men's final photos
Our man in La Manga's view
Du'aine Ladejo pipped Alain Baxter and Jamie Baulch to become Superstars champion 2003But the 400m man did not have things all his own way, winning only the 100m after a desperately close sprint-out with Baulch. Consistency was key for Ladejo as he secured top three finishes in all but one event - the archery. Send us your thoughts on the final and your tributes to 2003 Superstars champion Du'aine Ladejo.What were your favourite moments from the series?And who from the world of sport do you think could give Ladejo a run for his money?
Please BBC you have to make this a yearly series! It was compelling viewing
V, London
Just finished watching the final and what a shame it didn't come down to the final event to see who won. Having said that Duaine Ladejo was awesome. I also grew up watching Superstars and its a shame that we'll never see the likes of Lennox Lewis, Beckham, Owen, Wilkinson taking part due to all the money in sport at the moment. However I do think if Henry Alongo had stayed fit he may well of been pushing Ladejo for the top place. The two surprises of the series. Steve Claridge and Annabel Croft. Bring on the next series. Well done Michael Tanner, BanburyWhy was Ladejo allowed to compete in the 100m when Searle wasn't allowed to complete in the rowing...completely unfair. Baxter was the best allrounder by miles. Darren Flaxman, ReadingI don't think Ladejo or Baulch should have been allowed to compete in the 100m. This was their home event and as professional sprinters this had an impact on the whole competition. It was a magnamimous gesture on behalf of the other ultra competitive performers but they were severely disadvantaged as a result. It would have meant for a fairer and closer finish. Tim Edwards, HarrowPlease BBC you have to make this a yearly series! It was compelling viewing, even for non-sports fans, and great to see the camaraderie and supportiveness of all of the contestants - all really good sports. V, LondonQuick note to Bob from Bath: Nobody outside of athletics will beat an Olympic standard 400 metre runner over 100 metres. The programme should have included a race over a mile or more. That would have been interesting. Glad to see they ditched the golf aswell. Rob Rowlands, Nantwich, Cheshire
I thought it was a bit unfair as they let the sprinters Jamie Baulch and Ladejo run in the 100 metres
Tim Abernethy, England
My 7 year old son and I have been glued to the whole series. They have been great, and last night was no exception. I am in awe of all of the athletes who took part, they all did so well. And a BIG, BIG Congratulations to Du'aine, he was excellent (as well as being very good looking too). I can't wait for its return, next year. P.S. Please make sure Johnny hosts it again. Zoe Kalu, LondonI thought it was a bit unfair as they let the sprinters .. Jamie Baulch and Ladejo run in the 100 metres, instead of the 800 metres. At the end of the day 400 metre guys are sprinters who move up a distance. Jamie Baulch is a 20.6 seconds 200 metre runner so who on earth in any other event is going to compete with that. I agree with Bob in that they shouldn't be able to compete at the 800 metres either as most 400 metre runners train over 600 metres and in some cases move up a distance to 800 metres internationally. Look at the Cuban 400 metre runner in the 1976 Olympics who won the 400 metres and then took the 800 metre Olympic title. Has to be fairer, although the skiers impressed me. Tim Abernethy, EnglandDu'aine Ladejo is the best ever!!!!! He deserved to win superstars and he will reign in Athletics next season steven gregg, chesterfieldMy husband & myself are both in our thirties and have not missed an episode of this series - it was great!!!! Especially seeing Brian Jacks and Hooperman & some of the faces we remember from the original programmes. You have to keep this going - it is such cult watching and one of the few things families can all watch together. Keep it going. Chris Burman (Mrs), SuffolkBeing only 20 I had not heard of superstars before but having seen some of the heats I became interested in the show. All the athletes did so well and looked like they had a Fab time - well done to Du'aine on becoming the champion and special congratulations to super Stevie who put in great effort! Ruth, Hampshire
Hopefully the success of this year's competition will mean lots more sports stars will enter next year
Peter Simmons, Reading
Why do they always rave about Brian Jacks doing dips. I seem to remember Peter Herbert destroying him in this event on record breakers Bob Thomas, LondonLooking forward to tonight's final, I think Ladejo will win just ahead of Baulch and Baxter. Hopefully the success of this year's competition will mean lots more sports stars will enter next year. Where's the darts players!!!! Peter Simmons, ReadingCome on Ladejo, It's clearly between him and Alain Baxter with Graham Bell in for 3rd. Superstars is one of the best things to come out since the summer - It has to be made a Yearly event. David Baker, SouthendLooking forward to watching tonight's final but I was disappointed to find out who hasn't won it! You see, a colleague is a close friend of one of the finalists who has already told him he only finishes second. This is a surprise but makes it all the more interesting to see who has actually won it and how he lost it. Fantastic show, looking forward to next year's competition already!!! David Fenwick, DurhamIt is fabulous to have the programme back, in its original format and with the fabulous theme tune untouched - Brilliant! My 14 yr old daughter is a huge fan and I've been constantly telling her about the Superstars God Brian Jacks and his performances in the gym tests. Please BBC, you must make this a regular series and not just a 1 off. The best programme on telly. Tyrone Dowd, Shoreham by Sea, West Sx.The only thing I can say is that its so good even the wife watches it Russell , Daventry
Why no lady hockey players last night?
DJB, Bath
Fantastic competition in true Superstars tradition. Annabel Croft was a complete surprise and who would have thought a snowboarder could have won it! That's what has always made the show so captivating to watch. More please very soon. steve mitchell, oxfordThe women's final last night was a fantastic competition and you couldn't have asked for better climax. It's a shame they couldn't have finished it with a tie-break to have clear winner. Arm-wrestling perhaps? Alan, LondonI would just like to tell you how much I am enjoying Superstars. I watched it years ago and find it as enjoyable now as I did then. The women's superstars was a great show. You should have reintorduced the obstacle course to find the winner. I hope it will return next year and every year. Andrew Barron, Stockton on TeesGreat final, put the men to shame however you talk of Brian Jacks being a legend but where was Val Robinson? she dominated the ladies in the 70s just goes to show what a tough sport hockey is. Which brings me onto another point, why no lady hockey players last night? one of the most participated female sports in the country a GB team in the world top 5 and no representatives. Great programme all the same brings those memories rolling back DJB, BathI think that the current series has been brilliant and hope that it goes on to be an annual series again. The presenters and commentators are excellent and would like to see them continue in any future series. Mark Paulus, Stevenage
The BBC must let Brian Hooper return next year if he's up for it! What a legend
Andy Lee, Mitcham
Well done The BBC. I was so very surprised to switch on the other day and hear the announcer say 'and now, Superstars'. I thought that it couldn't be the brilliant show I remember from years ago and, of course, they'll have definitely changed the tune. But no!! Fantastic!!!! Same format and the same tune. Brilliant. The presenters were fab and the show was still as thrilling as I remember it, even for a non-sports fan like me. A cross section of sports stars from a diverse range of sports all brought together to pit it out! Well done again. I'm off to live in the States in a month but it warms my heart to see that some things will live on in Blighty!! James Meehan, LondonThe BBC must let Brian Hooper return next year if he's up for it! What a legend - he very nearly qualified for the final which is amazing consdering he was a late entrant and pulled a muscle during the gym tests. He certainly put a number of the younger competitors to shame! Andy Lee, MitchamLove the programme, great to see it back on our screens, its the only programme worth the licence fee! Where can I buy a superstars t shirt from both for adults and children? Sharon Roby, DoncasterGood to see Brian Hooper on superstars last night, he hasn't changed much at all. When he was touring schools in the eighties as the superstars world champion he specifically took time out to spend with my sister who was dying of leaukemia in hospital. She couldn't meet him at the school and this gave her some enjoyment in her short life. Gerry Merrell, Taunton
I started college last year on a sports course and Brian Hooper was my group tutor
Julie, Slough
Well done it is good to see it back on bbc1 and about time to so when are we going to see more of the modern superstars no disrespect meant but the likes of owen, button, schumacher, beckham, johnstone, wilkinson etc I would like to know and jonny and suzi keep it up. steve pickaver, corbyHappy days. Great to see the show back. Hope this is not a one off series. Any chance of seeing the entire show when Stan Bowles took part? Classic. Anthony Leoni, LondonI agree with Bob from Bath, it absolutely ridiculous allowing 400m runners to do the 800m. It will be part of their training to run further than 400m at race speed. They should have a longer run, perhaps even cross-country as one of the events. Andy, ReadingSuperstars is a great programme. I started college last year on a sports course and Brian Hooper was my group tutor. No joke! He is no longer my group tutor as he left in the summer. Everyone at college watched his episode but I sill remain a strong Jamie Baulch supporter! Julie, Slough
I've told my wife I want the theme tune played at my funeral Roger Grant, Plymouth
Great to see this on air again. However, I do think contestants should be "current" sportsmen/women. I believe the fans of Rugby League are continually short-changed by the BBC and the fascination with Martin Offiah. Yes, great winger that he was, fine nickname, but he is retired, past it, and judging by last night's show, couldn't be arsed. In any future series please give consideration to the present crop of fantastic players who would at least make an effort. Kris Radlinski, Gary Connolly, Sean Long, Andy Farrell to name a few of the RL Superstars who would leave even Johny Vaughan speechless. PS Call them squat thrusts?!!! Dave Grainger, WiganGreat to see Brian Hooper on last night. In the mid-80s he did a tour of schools, including my own, with Schools Superstars. He personally watched my attempt at press ups and sit ups (!) and through his nature helped inspire me to keep trying whatever my ability. That's the kind of message the programme needs to send out more powerfully to the less talented but keen kids watching. James W, StroudAs a cricket fan myself it is great to see some flamboyant cricketers competing although they may be their to make up the numbers jimmy Adams was a very laid back and cool guy, and I was pleased and shocked as I am sure some of you are of Henry Olonga's performance, brilliant performance by him but felt sorry he could not compete in the bikes as he knew he would make it into the final better luck next year for the cricketers. Kashif Akhtar, Manchester UKLove the show, looking forward to final, should be a really close one. I have a question, not really related to show but about some of the music played on last night's (06/11) programme. What was the tune played during the swimming section? Can anyone tell me? Simon, LondonI've told my wife I want the theme tune played at my funeral Roger Grant, Plymouth
I think Ladejo was awesome last night and will be tough to beat in the final
Jack Ballard, Wymondham
I think after last nights showing Ladejo will be the man to beat. Who can do it? Baxter would be my bet with Claridge sniping at their heels. And in agreement with the other, lose Johnny Vaughan, John Inverdale would be much better, although he is more used to more muscle people. Keep Suzi Perry though. Duffo, SomersetThis weeks Superstars was fantastic. Its just a shame that more of this group couldn't go through to the final as they all looked pretty handy. Shame about the golf though! Marc, FarnboroughI think Ladejo was awesome last night and will be tough to beat in the final. Jack Ballard, WymondhamLet's face it - if he'd been allowed to do it, Chris Boardman would have won the cycling as easily as Iwan Thomas won the 800m. Ian Marlow, UKGreat to see this classic back! The new series perhaps lacks the seriousness of the original shows as well as a good old fashioned athletics stadium. However, congratulations to the BBC on bringing back a sporting great for all the family. Alan King, Lytham St. AnnesI think there should be a kids one because I would luv to come and meet you guys and some of the stars Jamie Westlake, ExeterMemories, what memories....all time fave: "and Minter's heading for the Rhododendrons!" Is it just me or did Keith Fletcher of England & Essex once win the 100m? On the subject of the garden gnome, didn't' he also narrowly miss being run off the road by a van in an international biking heat in Israel? Keep transmitting beeb we love it....especially the theme music. Dave fitton, Woking, surrey
Well done Alain Baxter. Definitely the favourite now
Matt, UK
One of the greatest ever programs returns to British TV. Well done BBC. Now just get it piped down here please. Andrew, Sydney, AusGreat programme. The only thing that spoils it is that the 400m runners are allowed to enter the 800m race. It would be more fair to the other competitors to make them drop out of this and be allowed to run the 100m event, as there are often fast sprinters among the other non-athletic competitors. Bob, BathI thought Paul Hunter would have been the surprise package, young and fit, but as usually I was wrong. Well done Alain Baxter. Definitely the favourite now. Matt, ukI personally think Johnny Vaughan helps make the programme, we mustn't let it become too serious and he is a brilliant presenter. What excellent TV, makes my Thursday night. Sam, SuffolkWhat about putting a rowing machine in instead of the 800m? John, LondonJimmy Adams' 'punishing training' schedhule really made laugh. Definitely the most entertaining heat so far!Bill, BristolMany fond memories. I recall a German weightlifter in the rowing (as they had then) being unable to get into the boat. The Dutch hockey player was an outstanding performer (Toze Kruizer). As for Brian Jacks and Brian Hooper, what legends. I suspect next year Neil back will enter and be very tough to beat. The reason why Chris Boardman can't do the mountain biking is that he competed many times in the Tour de France which includes a lot of mountain stages. I agree with those that say dump Johnny Vaughan and have less chat. Graeme, EnglandFantastic. At last a truly great show returns. What memories. Only criticism is that it is a bit light hearted, we don't really need Johnny Vaughan and his false voice and bad gags. Bring back David Vine, and a get a real competitive edge to the competition. How about the Beeb organises merchandising, T-shirts, Sweat Bands and even ring tones for the classic theme tune. I think you will find a demand. Please re-commission the show, this is what I pay a licence fee for. James C, Felpham
Excellent - but La Manga is too fancy. It was better in the wet at some dodgy stadium
Ben, Tonbridge
After last night's programme I think Steve Claridge Will win this year's Superstars Ryan Wybrow, EssexExcellent - but La Manga is too fancy. It was better in the wet at some dodgy stadium. Ben, TonbridgeCome on the BBC. Sort this dropping of your own event out please. Iwan Thomas should not have been allowed in the 800 metres. Sprinters OK but not anything over 200m should be allowed. This has happened in both weeks really and does spoil the competition. Still great to have it back, last night was much more competitive than the first week and as such was much more enjoyable. Great Stuff. Daren Gipson, UpminsterGreat show, do agree they should show more of the events and give Johnny Vaughan less camera time, the viewers tune in to watch the events not him. Also people whinging about who was or wasn't allowed to participate in some events are missing the point. They have to pull everyone out of one event so the mountain biking was easily the most obvious one for Boardman and Thomas was bound to win either the 100 or the 800 so they couldn't pull him out of both! Even if that gave him an advantage he didn't win so what's the problem? Roy, LiverpoolThanks for showing the clip of Keegan again. A comedy classic! Painful Rich, ColchesterMy favourite memory of Superstars has to be James Hunt complaining that his shoulders were too rounded to lock his arms in a weightlifting competition. I prefer the non-athletic types on the show, they show how to be a star through determination but especially humour. Long live the "Shunt". Rich, ColchesterWell done Stevie Claridge, please be the next Mill wall manager. If you did, with that grit and determination we'll be in the Premiership next season. Tim, Tunbridge wells
Good to see Superstars back - though it doesn't seem to be taken as seriously as it was in the 70's
Shakey, Ealing
I thought I had travelled back in time. It's brilliant to see it on the telly again. Memories of Brian Jacks come flooding back. And one of my favourite memories of the show was George Best showing off with a football. Magic. Andy Mitchell, TauntonSo glad to see the program back. The enjoyment the stars are having is plain to see, & it great fun to watch. Well done for bringing it back! Rebecca, CambsChris Boardman was a long distance road and endurance track cyclist and never a mountain bike rider whereas Iwan Thomas is a 400m runner and was allowed to run 800m. Which is the biggest deviation from a specialist event?? Mark Watson, SandbachGood to have it back but seems somewhat a cheaper version. I mean cheaper in the sense we're getting 'older past it' sportsmen competing. I remember years back it was great to see what sport had the fittest athletes as most were in their prime and trying to prove a point! A serious lack of Rugby league players also lets it down! Craig McDermott, Manchester, UKGood to see superstars back - though it doesn't seem to be taken as seriously as it was in the 70's plus I guess insurance means that hardly any current sportsmen can actually compete. My main gripe would be the lack of a running score or a time especially in the gym events - just saying someone's score afterwards isn't good enough - cut out the banal interviews and show every event in full with running scores/times if appropriate Shakey, EalingMore clips of our British Superstars winning their medals in their original sports please. Boardman on the track, the Searle brothers pulling it out of the bag, Gavin Hastings missing against England (ha ha), or even a 30 second intro into a chosen sport 'Gold Fever' style. BBC has a great opportunity to champion sport again through Superstars. Take it Angus, London
I have just watched Superstars and was very pleased that Claridge won - as am a footie fan!
Coops, Shropshire
It's been so long ago now that I can hardly remember the original show but having Superstars back is fantastic! It's been great to see the camaraderie between the competitors from different sports. They seem to like it, we seem to like, so will there be a second series? Rich, Hampshirecan the commentator stop telling us what is going to happen instead of just letting us watch for ourselves - i.e. watch this he nearly gets a hole in one here as opposed to just letting us see if he gets a hole in one - or - he needs to score 4 here to win - then letting us see if he gets 4 - not telling us as he hits the shot Terence McDonald, LondonWhere can I buy a Superstars T-shirt for my boyfriend? By the way I hate sport and I LOVE the program!! Lisa Mountain, BristolThe show was spoiled for me by the fact that Chris Boardman was not allowed to enter the mountain bike event and yet Iwan Thomas and Darren Campbell were allowed to enter the 800 metres. Mike, RossendaleThis is the best thing the Beeb have done since the last series. We need more programmes like this. Where can I get a Superstars t-shirt/merchandise? JON ROSTRON, ManchesterIs it possible to buy Superstars t shirts? what with Xmas coming and all? Louise, Glos
For those of you wanting to see highlights of some of the old shows, on 3rd November there is a "Best of Superstars" DVD released!
Warren Pilkington, Manchester, UK
What I cant understand is why shorter distance runners are allowed to compete in the 800 metres. I can accept 100 metre specialists in the event as there is a big difference between 100 and 800 metres but Ewan Thomas (a 400 metre champion) running the 800? It was obvious he would win ! Still I'm enjoying the series, well done to the beeb for bringing it back ! Khalid Mahmood, LondonWhy has it taken so long to come back? Where can I get a t-shirt from? got to get one.... grant Leuchars, CrawleyI have just watched Superstars and was very pleased that Claridge won - as am a footie fan, but Darren Campbell is wicked, he is so funny and I have to say quite cute! Does he have a fan base website? Do they see messages for them? Coops, ShropshireIt's great to see the series back (although I don't find Johnny Vaughan presentation suited, better stick with Suzi Perry!). Who makes the eligibility rules ? The Underwoods are eligible for Football, Thomas is eligible for 800m but Boardman is banned from Mountain Biking. Boardman was robbed ! Keith Packer, CoventryWatched last week's show it was great. Husband Ian travelling back from Denmark, so I thought I would video it, so we could watch it later. I now realize that you cannot video over Jungle Book. Help, it is repeated, and if so when? Roz Nesbitt, GrimsbyFor those of you wanting to see highlights of some of the old shows, your wait is almost over, as on 3rd November there is a "Best of Superstars" DVD released. Order it from your local friendly online DVD retailer. Warren Pilkington, Manchester, UK
What I cant understand is why shorter distance runners are allowed to compete in the 800 metres
Khalid Mahmood, London
Myself and my house mates have been watching the new series of Superstars with a very keen interest. We do have one question we hope you will be able to answer for us: Where can we get hold of the Superstars t-shirts/vests as worn by the athletes on the show? We all think they are fantastic but so far have been unable to track any down. We have checked the BBC shop website and they do not appear to be on sale there. Are there any plans to release a clothing/merchandise range as a spin off from the very successful and popular series? If so when and where? Please help us!!!! Keith Reader, SouthamptonI remember how chuffed I was when Brian Hooper visited my school to have his photo taken with us straggly haired 13 year olds. Now I'm a straggly haired 34 year old and he's back on the track. Nice one Bri. Superstars - we've missed you. Finally I'm getting good ROI from my license fee. Da da da da... Jim, BristolI remember when some of the early superstars programmes where filmed and was luckly enough to meet the great Brian Jacks when i was young. These programmes where filmed at High Wycombe sports centre but these highlights are very rarely shown. If you know where i could get to see some of these old clips can you please forward it to my e-mail Harvey Brown, NorfolkJust watch the show, excellent but, how can u justify letting athletes in the 800m event, Iwan Evans was bound to win this event and i think its unfair to other contestents.OK it didnt affect the final outcome but how is it allowed. I feel sorry for Boardman,if Thomas goes in the run y couldn't he go in the cycle??I love the show but this topic puzzles me. gerry ward, derbyGreat to have it back, a real classic that works as well today. Six weeks wont be long enough. Every year please. Ruth, YorkWhilst I have just enjoyed watching Superstars I really do feel that it is TOTALLY unfair that 2 runners are able to participate in events at different distances to their normal events, plus Rugby Footballers are able to participate in the Football event. BUT a road and track cyclist is unable to participate in the Mountain Bike event. This is as far removed from his normal racing as the 800 metres running is to a 400 or 100 metres running event, and ball skills with a round ball rather than an oval ball. I think a serious look at the rules is required immediately. Lesley Donington, Biggin Hill, KentWe want Kevin Keegan back! Seriously really enjoying the new series. kids think it's great. was too long coming back. Cath Chilvers, nottinghamFantastic to see this show back on our screens. And even better to see that the format has hardly changed. I've loved the first two heats of this new series and it brings back so many memories as a kid. At last, a programme on the TV which has some quality to it. 10/10 Buck Hysen, SwindonI remember, as a child, sitting for half an hour while Brian Jacks Superstar challenge load from the tape onto my BBC B computer. Then playing the game for ten minutes before having to reload the whole game. Come on BBC make a computer game version and I will be the happiest man alive. Andrew McSHane Andrew McShane, BirkenheadConsidering Brian Jacks was probably the greatest of all the Superstar champions, why haven't any Judokas been chosen for the men's heats? Andy Stay, St. Neots, Cambridgeshire
All the "original" TV programmes seem to fall around soaps these days, so it was a breath of fresh air to see Superstars back
Jason, Wirral
I notice that your list of competitors does not include either a male or female from the sport of squash. In this country we achieve far better results both at junior and senior level than for example tennis, but our stars do not receive such high profile or funds yet have to work twice as hard physically to get the results. This would have been an ideal opportunity for them to show their skill and fitness at a time when they desperately need more television coverage to try and get the sport included at the Olympics. Surely you should have included only one representative from each sport rather than two rowers one week and two rugby players another. Claire London, KentGreat to see it back, but see that BBC Scotland have decided to float it around the schedules. We've got two weeks on BBC1 on a Wednesday at 8.00, then it goes to Thursday on BBC2 at 8.00. Where is it going to be in the following week? Gillian, ScotlandIt was great to see a program that I loved as a kid to come back. All the "original" tv programs seem to fall around soaps these days so it was a breath of fresh air to see this. Just the fun & joking around the competitors had before the matches made it worthwhile. All we need now to come back is It's a Knockout and i'll be ecstatic...... by the way for Alex the music was Furious Angels by Rob Duggan.. Jason, WirrallLast time I visited my parents I came across a load of photos of men my parents' age from my neighbourhood in Ireland competing in a knockoff of the Superstars show. Very silly. Michael Day, USAWhoever decided to bring back Superstars is a genius! And its all done properly with the same music and logo. Nice one BBC! Mark Tyler, Hampshire
The only difference this time is that my dad didn't buy me a tube of smarties to munch whilst watching!
Jon Palmer, Plymouth
I'm delighted it's back. Will move back to the UK next year so looking forward to seeing it. I'm sure you all know this but the theme tune is used in the US for Monday Night Football. It's a total classic and everyone aged 10 or over in the US will know the song: but not as the superstars theme! pat, Us (UK) Pat, USAGreat to see this program back. If you're looking to run a wider series for women or a similar event for women next year, why not ask Karen Morse MBE. She took part in the two of the original series and would still give anyone a run for their money !! Paul Flay, West Byfleet, SurreyGreat to see the return of an old favourite programme it brings back many memories of some of our great sportsmen & women competing in so many different sports, and not just competing but enjoying it as well. Chris Bailey, Newton Abbot DevonAlex of Milton Keynes - every song used in the show (apart from the classic theme tune) is from the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack, in your local music store now! Will Davies, Cwmbran, S WalesThank goodness somebody at the BBC as seen some sense and returned a good family watchable proram.Well done to all concerned, brilliant piece of entertainment. Andrew Sinclair, StockportGreat to see the show back. The only difference this time is that my dad didn't buy me a tube of smarties to munch whilst watching! Jon Palmer, PlymouthAt last, well done BBC for bringing back a superb show! Gary Ell, tivertonA good start, but the golf is a bit silly, and where are the motor sports guys? And please could we see at least one complete gym test. Much the same memories as anyone, Brian Jacks dips, Andy Ripley's shaking hands during the shooting, Tony Knowles as the only snooker player to compete, cyclist Joop Zoetemelk doing 1 dip, the general hopelessness of Rene Arnoux, the one time they tried cricket using a bowling machine. Who remembers the short lived Superteams? Water Sports beating Rugby in the tug of war, Motor Sports deliberately cheating during the road race? Darren, UKSuperstars was so much fun to watch back in the day, I was delighted to see it was coming back again. The BBC did not disappoint. The first show was excellent with John Regis in the kayak as funny as ever. But the person who stood out the most was Wayne McCullough. His feet must have been on fire. Poor lad. And to finish his heat. I think I'd have pulled out. He really fought back. Wayne will be the one I remember for years to come, just like Kevin Keegan and Brian Jacks. I'm sure no-one will fight through the pain he did. Congratulations on a job well done, BBC. And show us more of Wayne. He's a class act and a Superstar along with it. Lucy, BedfordshireAlthough it's great to see Superstars back on our screens, please try to devote more time to the events themselves rather than scene-setting and interviews both before and after each heat. Stick with the old formula; it's a winner . . . Nick, Sheffield
Fantastic! Brill! - As a 38-year-old fan of sport it was terrific to see the old format back
Alan Main, Lancaster
Great to see it back. Still think Brian Jacks would rings round them. Even 20 years on from the original series! Darren McCarthy, Northampton, U.KAny series with Psycho on the first show is good with me. Ricky Hatton's gonna win the whole thing as he's a machine Dave, NottinghamHas the Beeb taken pity on Jeff Winter. Everyone knows he's not fit to referee in the Premiership, so he has to show he can be just as pedantic when it comes to Superstars. John Regis know knows how all football fans & Premiership players feel now!!! Ken, LeedsGreat to see the show back. It was spoilt by me by a few things though. Too much talking, not enough action. I didn't feel like I was watching a sporting event. It would have been nice to see the records on screen for comparison. Needs toughening up to look less like a game show. Simon, CroydonI remember writing in to Brian Jacks when he had to pull out of World Superstars due to shingles, I still have the signed photo at home of him with his perm. Then saw him last year in Covent Garden but alas in a wheelchair, he had done something whilst skiing. Still a legend!!!! Adam Stringer, Essex
When the signature tune came on and it had not been 're-mixed' I knew it would be as good as the original
Dave Reynolds, Bristol I'm disappointed not to see any of our F1 stars involved - maybe we'll see Mr Schumacher in the international superstars version? Dave, EnglandFantastic! Brill! As a 38year old fan of sport it was terrific to see the old format back. Well done to all the guys who took part! Alan Main, LancasterGreat show, glad to see it back with the original theme tune! Oh, and Alex from Milton Keynes, I think the music was "Furious Angels" by Rob Dougan MikeF, UKReplying to those below who think it is unfair for example the Searle's being barred from the canoeing, the premise is that all athletes are prevented from one event at the judges' discretion and obviously canoeing made most sense in their cases. As for many other sportsmen it is unclear how they will choose which events they are not allowed to compete in. I notice there are three 400 runners in Ladejo, Baulch and Thomas - will they be prevented from doing the 800m or 100m? They should excel at both - the 800m should really be a 1500m/mile. Also Thomas was a BMX whiz, so there is another advantage for him. Another issue is the gym tests - surely the 2 tests should not be added simply, as they will always do more squat thrusts than dips. They need some sort of weighting so that each dip counts as more. matthew, Glasgow
Brian Jacks is my superstar hero. He could do dips for England. Shame about the dodgy perm though!!
Danny Caro, London
Missed the show, gutted! but remember fondly many memories. Favourite has to be Declan Burns doing chin ups and Andy Ripley falling off his bike. Timeless. Phil, PlymouthGreat to see this classic show back on TV. When the signature tune came on and it had not been 're-mixed' I knew it would be as good as the original, but nothing could prepare me for 'wibbly wobbly' Jonnie Searle after the bike race. I was still laughing later that night. Please can you repeat it next week. PS did the late/great Ron Pickering do the commentary in the 70's series? small debate going on a work. Dave Reynolds, BristolI thought the show was very good. I watched the original when I was a child. So I was very sad to see that the programme was on so late. My son is 5 years old and I know he would have loved to have watched the show, as would many children between the ages of 5-13 who would be going to bed ,on a school night, just as the show starts. SATURDAY or SUNDAY afternoon or early evening would have been a better slot. My son is only 5 and he has been enjoying shows like STRONG MAN competition and the sporting show on at the moment with Sally Gunnell! So I just cannot understand your decision to put the show Superstars on so late!!!!!!! Beth Robinson, Henley-On-ThamesHow come Henry Olonga and Phil De Glanville weren't pulled from the 100m? Surely both of them are better suited to sprinting than any other sport in the schedule. Dan, London
WOW! Wayne McCullough is a warrior in and out of the boxing ring
Jim, Lancs
I think Steve Claridge will prove to be the competition's dark house. He will probably turn up in odd socks and tatty plimsolls and still win the 100 metres. I can't see him opting for the Gym tests though. Simon Adams, PortsmouthGreat to have what was probably the second best programme of all time (behind It's A Knockout) back on our screens. Pity Johnny Vaughan is on it as David Vine would have been perfect. Only other thing missing was the basketball and the archery. Keith Fielding, John Sherwood Lyn Davies and Brian Jacks, those were the days Paul, LiverpoolWOW! Wayne McCullough is a warrior in and out of the boxing ring. Even with that injury, he kept going. A true Superstar. Jim, LancsThe making/breaking of the new Superstars will be its "international" edition - if there is one. Funnily enough, this is where I think they will get the biggest stars. Even though I don't particularly like the guy, I reckon Michael Schumacher would jump at the chance of taking part. The BBC should aim high - not just go for retired sportsmen/sportswomen. Must admit hearing the theme tune again got me all a-shiverin'. Mike Strong, EdinburghI remember this the first time round and this is not a patch on it. What with Johnny Vaughan's puerile comments and the poor attempts at jokes, the whole thing was a waste of an hour. As for putting golf in as a test of sporting prowess, well... I won't be watching it again. Julian Sahu, LeicesterWell done BBC! Great to have Superstars back on TV and it's also great to see that it hasn't been ruined like many of the re-make TV shows back on! Let's hope it's a long-term thing having it back. David Green, Wigan
Really good entertainment and true to the original
Phil Weston, Leicester
I remember sitting in my living room aged about seven and being told that the programme I was about to watch was the last Superstars ever. I was heartbroken! It was my favourite programme. Great to see it back although things from your childhood never quite seem the same once you're a grown-up. Craig, Leamington SpaAs an exiled Scot in Philadelphia I have noticed that the Superstars theme tune is the same one used here for 'Monday Night Football' - a fixture, apparently, on US television since 1969. Who was first to use the music? Iain Fitzpatrick, Philadelphia, USAAs a club canoeist of 40 years ago, now confined to a wheelchair, I am sorry to note that Mr Vaughan dosn't know the difference between a paddle and an oar. A paddle is used to propel a kayak while an oar is used to row a boat! Mervyn Bailey, Steeple ClaydonGreat to see Superstars back. Really good entertainment and true to the original. Particularly like the retro music and logo! Phil Weston, LeicesterBrilliant, great start to the weekend. Golf, is that really a sport? What fun! Julie, LondonIt's so good to see Superstar's back. I remember the first series with great affection it used to be the highspot of my week. I was gutted that Colin Jackson didn't perform better but there you go. As I remember it was usually the 'lesser known' sportsmen/women who really did well. Sue, North Lincs
Ace, fab, what a racey programme! Big congrats should go to the Producer for re-creating this excellent cult series
Nick, Buckinghamshire
Thanks for the hilarious evening last night. It's a long time since I had a great laugh. Thanks to Henry Olonga flipping over in the kayaks and John losing his bearings that really was great guys. I'm looking forward to the group two finals which i hope will be equally entertaining. Thanks for the wonderful show!!! Edmund, LondonAce, fab, what a racey programme! Big congrats should go to the Producer for re-creating this excellent cult series. We want more! Nick, BuckinghamshireThe first show in the new series was spoiled by too much talk and looking at the sights and 2 little action. you need a camera on the line in the 100m and a count on the gym tests like the old show, 6/10, could do better Tony Southern, LiverpoolGood show on the whole..but the Searles couldn't compete in Kayaking for what reason? it's not their event, OK it's in a boat, and on water. But utilises completely different muscles to rowing. So why could John Regis and Colin Jackson take part in the 800m? that's running, which is what they do (did) for a living. I loved the melted toes though Andy, Manchester
My all-time favoutite show, my 12th and 13th birthday parties were Superstarts parties and were Ace
Stuart, Bristol Are things so bad for Johnny Vaughan that he has to do sports shows? I would have preferred a serious sports commentator and it spoiled it for me. Even some of the competitors seemed to be taking things too lighthearted. Brian Jacks would beat them even now!!! Sean, ReadingMy all-time favoutite show, my 12th and 13th birthday parties were Superstarts parties and were ace. I'm going for Leanda Cave and Darren Campbell. Stuart, BristolGreat to see this show back on - top family entertainment! Please show more clips of the old 70's series if poss, including my own favourite of René Arnoux running the 100m. The memory's a bit hazy, but I'm sure it took him about 40 seconds and he zig-zagged over 5 lanes before crossing the finishing line! Marv, BrightonFantastic having it back. Why don't you have the sportsmen who are excluded from some of the races because it is their sport (eg Stuart Pearce and football) still do the event beforehand to show what their performance would be - is then good to see how well the others do to that Tracy, EdinburghQuality to see the show back. would really appreciate it if someone could tell me if you can buy the t shirts they are awesome Rich, ukThank you for bringing back Superstars and for keeping the original music too. Fantastic viewing, looking foward to next week. Sue, Northants
Fantastic to see this classic TV back on our screens instead of more DIY shows
Mike, Wraysbury
Thanks for last night, it brought back many childhood memories. Good to see the BBC have used the classic theme tune & logos again. Superb. can't wait for next weeks now. Ian B, Glos, UKI'm just wondering why when presenting the show (which is very good!) the commentator has to say "Soccer" instead of "Football" it main seem sad but I think as we did invent the game we should call it by its true name! Jason Cooper, UKFantastic to see this classic TV back on our screens instead of more DIY shows. Every competitor is a world class athlete in their own field so lets see who ends up as the Brian Jacks and Kevin Keegan of 2003. Long may it continue. Mike, WraysburyNot bad, although not a patch on the original. Does anyone know whether you can get a DVD of the best moments from the original few series (eg Keegan off the bike, Jacks, Ripley etc?) Jason Pettigrove, Brentwood, Essex
Why can runners compete in the 800m, but rowers can't compete in a canoe?
Simon Ramskill, Maidenhead
I was so looking forward to the return of this series but the thing it desperately lacks is the competitiveness of the original series. That's what we love about sport - that it's a serious battle. That's why Brian Jacks was so memorable because you could see he really wanted to win. This new series is too much on the light entertainment and too little on the sport and drive to win. Sarah Gee, BedfordBrilliant! Mint! Best TV show for ages. (Apart from Burn It!) Why has it taken so long for this classic TV to make a return. Wasn't it great to see some true sportsman too - none of the over paid prima donnas like some of our Premiership stars. Well done Phil De G! and hard luck on Henry Olonga. Any chance of some repeats from the 70's and 80' or a BBC2 Superstars night? Jeff Tatum, KeynshamWhy can runners compete in the 800mtrs, but rowers can't compete in a canoe? Rowing has little to do with canoeing either technically or in muscles groups used, yet 800 metres for runners is OK? Simon Ramskill, MaidenheadGreat show tonight. As a life long Man Utd fan I would love it if Kevin Keegan could come back and ride/fall off a bike. I'm getting old now I can't remember but who did the commentating along with David Vine? Roy Brown, Portugal
A very big thank you for bringing back one of the best programmes and a lot of memories
Paul Williams, Mitcham
Can anyone tell me the name of the song that was playing during the mountain biking part of superstars on 16/10/03 at all ? PLEASE ???? Alex, Milton KeynesI think the programs are great the football is the best! Annabelle, EnglandA very big thank you for bringing back one of the best programmes and a lot of memories. Great to see the competitors still have the great sportsmanship attitude. Paul Williams, MitchamI don't understand why the women are not expected to participate in the football and golf portions. Emily, USI'm really pleased to see the show back. I wonder who will emerge as the best all rounder. Last time it was the fighters and the lesser known athletes. Steven Patmore, Hull, East Yorks.
I will always remember Jonah Barrington throwing his toys out of the pram because he was marked down on the push ups
Peter Mansfield, Bristol It is Great that the Superstars is back on TV for the First Time in years. Apart from there will be Superstars on TV will there be the Superteams on TV as well? And who will it be introduced by instead of David Vine? Marc Ricketts, EnfieldIt is fantastic to see it back. I have bored my younger colleagues for years about how good it was. I will always remember Jonah Barrington throwing his toys out of the pram because he was marked down on the push ups. Peter Mansfield, Bristol
A great decision by the BBC. A classic returns. Gutted I am now in the USA and will not see it
Jason, USA
Welcome back Superstars! This is where we find out if today's sportsmen & women have got the same bottle as those who went before. I remember Jody Scheckter soaking his trainers in sun oil to slide for the squats and thinking he was a cheat for doing that. Brian Jacks was incredible and left a clear mark on my childhood - I still eat oranges like he did! Please bring out the old series on DVD!! Phil de Glanville may be a dark horse. He performed well in the Bath v Wigan rugby challenge - a similar performance here may take him far. Brian Dowling, Wolverhampton, UKI still remember when Brian Jacks came to our local sports centre and we competed in Junior Superstars. Andy Ripley and JJ Williams running will stick in my memory for ever. Bring back Brian Hooper! Simon Dolley, Newton AbbotA great decision by the BBC. A classic returns. Gutted I am now in the USA and will not see it. Jason, USAI am so pleased Superstars is making a return to our screens. It was a big favourite from my childhood. After all the reality TV we have to endure, this will be breath of fresh air! Bring it on! Jennee, LondonPlease, Please don't do the 'Irony' thing - the original wasn't great in an ironic let's all laugh at the seventies haircuts kind of way but it was a genuinely great show and should be brought back correctly with no hint of a smirk from the boy Vaughany Peter Field, St AlbansPlease put the Stan Bowles shooting the table and his canoeing exploits up on the site , it was classic TV. Martin Beer, ColchesterDavid Hemery's polyester hair, what a chinless wonder! I also liked Suzanne Dando's towelling shorts as she beat Valerie Hockey player in the women's games. Rick, Boston, USA
Mark Foster will win it, he is an all round athlete. Strong, physical and mentally tough
Phil Lloyd-Bushell, England
I dimly recollect the World Superstars being dominated by Brian Budd, a moustachioed ginger Canadian soccer star nimbly negotiating an awkward set of upturned car tyres. Edwin Moses jumping to the top of a very high wooden wall without the aid of a rope. Hmm, and the bubbling controversy that was Jody Shechter's use of socks in the squat thrusts. But best of all, Brian Jacks himself visited Loughborough Grammar School in 1982 after our very own Superstars competition. I trust the eventual winner of the new series will take their sporting ambassador role as seriously! Matt Clements, ManchesterMark Foster will win it, he is an all round athlete. Strong, physical and mentally tough. Only Colin Jackson could get close... Phil Lloyd-Bushell, EnglandThat theme tune brings it's the memories back. Last time I heard the theme was in the US as they were using it for Monday Night Football. But it will always be to me Superstars of the 70's. Well done BBC for bringing a Classic back to the millions Tim, SurreyGreat to see the programme back and like the website. Just one problem - what about the women who took part way back when?! Please can you give some of them a mention! Thanks! Bev Neil, BournemouthI remember big Geoff Capes in the swimming. If I remember he won the race because everyone else got caught up in the tsunami he created diving in! Simon Wise, Reading, UKMe and my mates [late 30s] still talk about Superstars and can remember all the best bits (lights going out in studio and Jacks still going strong). A great decision to bring it back. Anonymous, UK
