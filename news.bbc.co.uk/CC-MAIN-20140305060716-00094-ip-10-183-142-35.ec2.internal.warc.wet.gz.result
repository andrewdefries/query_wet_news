Lula calls for ethanol investment
President Lula is currently holding talks in India Rich countries must be ready to pay to help developing countries preserve their environment, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said. This should include investment for African nations to develop biodiesel and ethanol, President Lula told the BBC's HARDtalk programme. Brazil is a pioneer in producing ethanol vehicle fuel from sugar cane. President Lula has been invited to attend a G8 meeting in Germany this week that will focus on global warming. "Rich countries have to pay for the poor countries to avoid deforestation so they can adopt clean models for development that don't cause pollution or greenhouse gas emissions," President Lula said. "That's what I'm going to discuss at the G8 meeting." Brazil says it has reduced Amazon deforestation by 50%
He denied that Brazilian plans to devote more land to ethanol production rather than food would put more pressure on the Amazon rainforest and cause further deforestation. "Brazil has 440m hectares of land for agriculture. Sugar cane cultivation uses only 1% of that. Soya bean uses only 4% and cattle raising 29%. So the issue is not land, and it's not even about the rainforest because the Amazon is not a good area for sugar cane production," he said. Brazil did not want to be the only country to grow sugar cane or biodiesel crops, he said. Rich countries should "start to help African countries to start to produce biodiesel and ethanol so that we can create jobs in Africa and wealth". Chavez criticism In a wide-ranging interview, President Lula also spoke about Brazil's insistence on reform of the UN Security Council and its desire for a permanent seat. Ties have cooled recently between Venezuela and Brazil "We need to convince the world that there's no reason Latin America should not be represented on the Security Council, or that Africa should not be represented and that important countries like India, Germany or Japan should not be members." The Brazilian president also said he was optimistic that the Doha round of world trade talks would reach agreement. He would not be drawn on recent disagreements with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Last week, Mr Chavez accused the Brazilian Congress of acting like a "puppet" of the US after the Senate in Brasilia passed a motion urging him to reconsider his decision to revoke the licence of Venezuelan television network RCTV. This prompted President Lula on Friday to tell his Venezuelan counterpart to mind his own business. But in the BBC interview, President Lula insisted that Venezuela was a partner of Brazil. "Chavez has his own reasons to fight with the US. And the US have their own reasons to fight with Venezuela. Brazil has no reason to fight with the US and no reason to fight with Venezuela," he said. President Lula is currently in Delhi for talks on boosting trade and ties between two of the world's major emerging economies.

Telkom in black empowerment deal
Telkom operates telecom services across South Africa
A South African black investment group is to buy a 10.1% stake in the county's biggest phone company, Telkom.
The Elephant consortium said it was committing 40m rand ($6.7m; �3.5m) of its capital to the stock acquisition.
The deal is part of the policy of black economic empowerment, which seeks to ensure the black majority holds a greater share of South Africa's wealth.
Elephant consortium head Andile Ngcaba described the deal as a milestone for black entrepreneurs.
'National asset
The remainder of the deal will be funded by banking groups Nedbank and Absa and the South African state asset manager the Public Investment Corporation (PIC).
"A group of entrepreneurial black investors have worked together to acquire a stake in a strategic national asset, ensuring in the process that the bulk of the benefit will accrue to a broad base," said Mr Ngcaba.
He said a portion of the annual dividends paid by Telkom to investors would be used by the consortium to fund community development projects.
The consortium will buy the 10.1% Telkom stake from PIC, which itself bought a 15.1% stake in the telecoms company for 6.6bn rand in anticipation of Thursday's deal.
Telkom is one of South Africa's biggest companies, and offers fixed-line voice and data services. It is also the majority owner of the country's biggest mobile phone operator, Vodacom.

Fusion power seeks super steels
By Jennifer Carpenter
Science reporter, BBC News, Liverpool
The JET lab has helped pioneer fusion
Scientists say an understanding of how the Twin Towers collapsed will help them develop the materials needed to build fusion reactors.
New research shows how steel will fail at high temperatures because of the magnetic properties of the metal.
The New York buildings fell when their steel backbones lost strength in the fires that followed the plane impacts.
Dr Sergei Dudarev told the British Association Science Festival that improved steels were now being sought.
The principal scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) said one of the first applications for these better performing metals would be in the wall linings of fusion reactors where temperatures would be in a similar range to those experienced in the Twin Towers' fires.
'Not melting'
The key advance is the understanding that, at high temperatures, tiny irregularities in a steel's structure can disrupt its internal magnetic fields, making the rigid metal soft.
"Steels melt at about 1,510C, but lose strength at much lower temperatures," explained Dr Sergei Dudarev, principal scientist at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).
Iron atoms in steel: Black balls show irregularities that disrupt magnetic fields, weakening steel
At room temperature, the magnetic fields between iron atoms remain regular, but when heated, these fields are altered allowing the atoms to slide past each other, weakening the steel.
"[The steel] becomes very soft. It is not melting but the effect is the same," said Dr Dudarev.
He said blacksmiths had exploited this property for hundreds of years - it allows iron to become pliable at temperatures much lower than its melting point.
The peak in this pliability is at 911.5C, but begins at much lower temperatures, at around 500C - a temperature often reached during building fires.
The steel backbone of the Twin Towers was probably exposed to temperatures close to this, when insulating panels - meant to protect the buildings' structural frame - were dislodged by the impacts of the hijacked planes.
The roaring fire mid-way up the building heated the steel struts, and once temperatures rose above 500C the structure became plastic, and collapsed under the force of the floors above.
Tuning up
The interest of Dr Dudarev and the UKAEA is to find steels that can withstand the intense heat of being inside a fusion reactor.
UKAEA has helped pioneer fusion power - deriving energy by forcing together atomic nuclei - at Europe's JET lab in Oxfordshire; and is now assisting the development work on the world first large-scale experimental reactor known as Iter.
The extended periods over which Iter will run means the reactor must have robust materials built into the vessel where the fusion reactions will occur.
Dr Dudarev said it should be possible to tune the properties of suitable new steels by adding a mix of other elements.
"We need to look at the magnetic properties of steel, [and] vary their chemical composition in a systematic way in order to get rid of this behaviour," he suggests.

Saturday's edition of Strictly Come Dancing was thrown into chaos.
The TV show's producers realised that it was mathematically impossible for a public telephone vote to influence the contest.
This came after the marks the studio judges awarded put two of the contestants in joint first place.
The BBC executive in charge of the programme put the problem down to "exceptional circumstances".
More or Less listener Dirk Nachbar disagrees. From his hospital bed, he ran a computer simulation, based on past scores, and concluded that the chance of such a problem was 1 in 8.
Our reporter, former computer programmer Oliver Hawkins, has run his own simulation and come up with a similar result. Watch him explain it.
And read Tim Harford's article about the voting fiasco.
More maths of the credit crunch
Which maths error may have contributed to the credit crunch?
Financial mathematics guru Paul Wilmott continues with his More or Less series explaining how mathematical blunders contributed to the credit crunch.
This week, he talks us through the maths error that might have contributed to the mispricing of financial derivatives and thus to the travails of the banks, the credit crunch, and the recession.
Imperial measures: why do they refuse to die?
Tim Harford talks pounds and kilos with Derek Pollard.
Pints, miles, pounds and inches. They are fiendishly complicated and politicians have tried to ban their use, but for some reason imperial measures have proved impossible to kill off.
This week, the European Parliament voted to allow UK consumers to use both metric and imperial measures. It marks the end of a long campaign to make Britain fully metric.
Warwick Cairns, author of About the Size of It explains the appeal of imperial whilst Derek Pollard, Secretary of the Metric Association vows to carry on the fight for a "single rational system".
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. An imperialist and a metricist argue their case
Read Warwick Cairns' article and your comments on metric Vs imperial.
Childhood Obesity
The Chief Medical Officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, this week reiterated his appeal for urgent action on childhood obesity, claiming in an online article for BBC News that "the obesity epidemic" is a national crisis and that to do nothing was not an option.
According to the Health Survey for England, a quarter of 5 year olds are obese or overweight. Simon Cox, presenter of our sister programme The Investigation explains why the figures exaggerate the extent of the problem.
Read more about The Investigation's findings.
Knife-crime statistics
"Fewer teenagers are being wounded by knives" claimed a Home Office press release issued last week.
How accurate are the latest government figures on knife crime?
Figures in the document purported to show that the government's Tackling Knives Action Plan had been a great success.
The head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Michael Scholar, disagreed.
On Friday he condemned the government for releasing "unchecked" and "selective" numbers against the advice of professional statisticians.
So why might an apparent fall crime be not all it seems? It could be something to do with a concept called "regression to the mean".
Read more about regression to the mean.

US mid-terms panel: Octavia Phillips
MEET THE PANEL
Name: Octavia PhillipsAge: 26 Lives: Richmond, VirginiaWorks: University administratorVoted: DemocratIn 10 words or less:"Motivator, leader by example, thrill seeker, advocate for the people"
Results: Virginia
One day we win the House, the next day we clean house! I am glad Rumsfeld has finally gone, after six long years. At one point last year I had four family members serving in Iraq so, while I am totally against the war, I wholeheartedly support our troops. When I found out that Rumsfeld didn't even have enough respect for the families of our troops to sign the letters that go to families who have lost loved ones, I knew then that he needed to go. I see his departure as a victory for people on both sides of the party divide, but more importantly it is a victory for our troops. They went into this war under false pretences and are now caught in the middle, with no leadership here in America to turn to. I am not going to get too excited until I see what Bob Gates' plan of action is however. Regarding the mid-terms, I am very pleased with my party's win in the House. My state of Virginia is the remaining state to declare a victor in the Senate. US MID-TERMS PANEL
Kandace Heimer Octavia Phillips Nathan Bhat
Michael DeLaurentis Maria Peralta Edward Wilson
It appears that Democratic challenger James Webb will win, but he is leading by the slimmest of margins and it may take some time before we get a final result. After 12 years, America is ready for change and I hope the Democrats can make it happen now. I was very pleased with some of the historical victories in this election - the first Muslim elected to the House, Keith Ellison, the first female Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the second African-American governor in US history, Deval Patrick.
The American population is becoming more and more diverse every day and our leadership needs to diversify to represent all of the people. I hear a lot of people talking about making changes in Iraq and in our policies, but I would like to see more assistance given to the families of our troops. I also hope to see the federal minimum wage increase become a top priority.
Also I hear very few people on either side talking about improving the quality of living for Katrina victims. I hope that with this change in leadership that now something can and will be done to assist New Orleans evacuees in their efforts to reclaim their land and rebuild their lives.

UK hurtling towards war - Swinney
The parliament has been debating the Iraq crisis
Britain and the United States have embarked on an "inevitable path to war" with Iraq, according to the Scottish National Party leader.
As Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Scotland, John Swinney opened a debate on the Iraq crisis in the Scottish Parliament. He told MSPs that the UK Government must he held to account over any future military action.
He also warned that any unilateral or bilateral military action with the US without United Nations endorsement would weaken the international community.
The US and UK are currently pursuing an inevitable path to war and I feel it is our duty to steer this government away from this inappropriate approach
John Swinney, SNP leader
Mr Swinney said: "We've had the rhetoric, we've had the public relations offensive, now we have the military action.
"Along with many other people in Scotland today I fear there can only be one conclusion.
"The US and UK are currently pursuing an inevitable path to war and I feel it is our duty to steer this government away from this inappropriate approach."
Mr Swinney made his comments in an SNP-instigated debate on the Iraq crisis.
Although defence and foreign policy powers are reserved to Westminster, the SNP has argued that its debate would help in filling a democratic void on the issue.
Public ignored
It has accused Labour of failing to allow proper debate on the Iraq crisis at Westminster and of ignoring public opinion on the issue.
The Labour MSP Tom McCabe accused the SNP of political opportunism by forcing the parliament to debate Iraq.
He said: "Whether they like it or not and whether they intend it or not, in tabling this motion they open themselves up to the charge of using a tense and worrying international situation to illuminate their views on the constitution at a time when brave young women and men in our armed forces might find themselves in deadly conflict."
Mr McCabe praised Prime Minister Tony Blair's attempts to secure a
peaceful resolution to the issue and said the SNp debate was as "opportunistic as it is
repugnant".
Mr Blair would be failing in his duty if he were simply to wring his hands and do nothing about it."
Phil Gaillie MSP Scottish Conservative MSP Phil Gallie said that despite his
political differences with Mr Blair, the country should trust the prime minister if he believes Britain's national security is under threat.
He said: "Mr Blair would be failing in his duty if he were simply to wring his hands and do nothing about it."
He said that while the SNP's calls for a second UN resolution before any military action was a preferred option, it should not be seen as a block on troops being sent into Iraq.
But Liberal Democrats said there must be a fresh UN resolution and a Commons vote before troops are committed. 'New hell'
Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott said he could not support the SNP motion since this opposed war in all circumstances.
He said: "This debate is not simply about Saddam Hussein's evil regime and the nature
of the threat posed by it to world peace, but how the world in general and the
UK in particular confronts the threat posed by those who flout
international law."
Scottish Socialist Party leader Tommy Sheridan told MSPs it would be "a nonsense" if the Scottish Parliament did not discuss the current situation,
He said: "It is important that we discuss whether or not we think unleashing a new hell on the people of Iraq is right or wrong, just or unjust, legal or illegal, moral or immoral."
Scotland's only Green MSP Robin Harper said: "If we are going to have a war then let it be, as Tommy Sheridan said, one against poverty and inequality, not against people." Resolution vote
Labour won the vote with the backing of the Conservatives.
MSPs agreed that if Saddam Hussein fails to comply with the United Nations resolution then the security council should meet again.
Moves by the SNP and the Liberal Democrats for a more hardline amendment demanding a specific mandate from the UN before British troops are sent to war were rejected.

The auditions on Monday were invitation-only, with only a few hundred hopefuls invited to face the judges' jibes.
Fact File
Open auditions
9 August: Wembley Conference Centre, north-west London
16 August: Lowry Hotel in Manchester
But organisers have been flooded by so many telephone pleas, they have decided to hold two open auditions - one in London and the other in Manchester.
They will be going up to Glasgow too.

Thousands turned up at mass auditions for the first series, which created Hear'Say and Liberty X.
Big Brother twist
Popstars II: The Rivals is looking for two bands this time round - one girl and one boy band.
And there's a Big Brother style twist to the show this year.
The judges will pick 10 girls and 10 boys as finalists. They will live together, Big Brother-style, in two houses, next door to each other. The public will then vote to evict a girl and a boy each week until the final line-up is left.

Williams battles to Aussie title
Lindsay Davenport said fatigue had cost her a first grand slam title in five years at the Australian Open, but she hopes to play in it again in 2006.
"My body's definitely a little bit worn down," said the 28-year-old after her 2-6 6-3 6-0 defeat by Serena Williams.
"I think at the end, I was just overall a little bit fatigued."
But, asked if it might have been her last time playing in the tournament, she added: "I haven't gone there yet. I do hope I'll be back."
Despite finishing last season ranked number one, Davenport has not won a Grand Slam since the 2000 Australian Open.
And the American also finished as runner-up in the doubles this year in Melbourne.
"I think more than anything, just especially this last week, (I spent) a lot of hours on the court, just a lot of close, long matches," she added.
"It was definitely physically, really getting down there for sure," Davenport said of the final.
