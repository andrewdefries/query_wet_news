UK car plants most efficient in Europe
Nisan's Sunderland plant is the most efficient in Europe
Nissan and Toyota's British car factories were the most efficient in Europe in 2000, followed by plants run by Ford and General Motors in Germany, according to a study published on Thursday.
A Volkswagen plant in Emden, Germany, making the Passat large family car, was the least efficient, according to World Markets Research Centre's (WMRC) annual European Automotive Productivity Index.
Honda's British operation at Swindon, west of London, often seen as a efficiency trail-blazer, slumped from second place in the 1999 index to 26. In 2000, productivity slumped to 55 cars per employee compared with 83 in 1999.
The best performing European owned plant was Renault of France's Valladolid, Spain factory which made little Clios at the rate of 77 per employee, according to WMRC.
Honda problems
Nissan, at its Sunderland factory in the north-east of England, was way out ahead in the productivity race with a 7% increase in 2000 to a rate of 101 cars built per employee.
Nissan made 327,701 Micras, Almeras and Primeras last year.
Toyota employees at Burnaston in the English Midlands, in a distant second place, turned out 171,338 Avensis and Corollas at the rate of 86 per employee.
Honda's UK performance was hit by model changeovers and reorganisation. Honda switched to the new Civic family car, introduced the CR-V compact multi-purpose vehicle, repatriated production of the Accord to Japan and cancelled plans to make a city car.
Trailing in last place, VW's Emden, Germany plant only managed 27 Passats per employee.
Ian Robertson, of WMRC, said: "The report again sees a UK plant competing with the top global performers."
"When the Global Index is issued later this year we will see whether Nissan, Sunderland can outstrip all other plants."

BBC News | BUSINESS | Business lobbies hard on China

Business lobbies hard on China
Companies like Boeing see China as a major market
The vote in the US Congress over granting permanent normal trading relations with China is being seen as a key test of future US trade policy. Politicians, unions and the business community are all lobbying hard on the issue. News Online profiles the efforts of US business to persuade a sceptical public of the benefits of the deal.
The US business lobby has mobilised as never before over the China trade deal.
Business believes that if the US turns it back on a deal which could open the Chinese market to US companies, they will be at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to their European and Asian rivals.
The business community has a strong ally in President Clinton
Business groups are working overtime to drive home the importance of the deal and win passage of the trade pact.
"This is one of the most important business issues to come along in a generation," said Bill Morley, chief trade lobbyist with the US Chamber of Commerce.
The chamber's members have told the organisation's leaders that this is a huge priority, and "they are putting their money where their mouth is," Mr Morley said. John Schachter with the Business Roundtable, said: "The vote coming up is the most critical economic and foreign policy vote in a long time."
Businesses in the US see the trade deal as crucial in gaining access to China's 1.4 billion people. "We have mobilised the business community like never before," he said. Lobbying congress
The US Chamber of Commerce has 16 full-time lobbyists working on the issue in Washington.
But the effort extends far beyond Capitol Hill. The chamber's 13 regional directors and managers and state and local chambers have been working across the country.
During the recent congressional recess, not only the Chamber of Commerce but also the Business Roundtable fanned out across the country to sell the agreement to legislators.
Trade groups have praised USTR Charlene Barshefsky's deal with China
Representatives from the chamber lobbied in 132 districts across 28 states, and the Business Roundtable was in 88 districts in 19 states rallying support for the bill. They targeted undecided legislators and new members of Congress who might still be swayed to vote for the bill. Grassroots push
But it was more than simply lobbying members of congress. Mr Schachter said that his organisation also hired local grassroots organisers to rally local support.
They also worked with small, medium and large businesses, academics, officials and "anyone interested, to promote the benefits of international trade," he said. These people, in turn, met with local boards of education and spoke at public functions on the issue. They also have it on their web sites. The Business Roundtable allows visitors to their site to click on their state to see how the trade deal with China will potentially affect them. Filling the airwaves
To complement these efforts, the Business Roundtable mounted a number of print, radio and television ad campaigns. Some were aired nationally, some in specific congressional districts and others in Washington. And during the last congressional recess, they launched a targeted, co-ordinated campaign to reach key undecided members of congress.
They wanted to make sure that members of congress saw and heard their message wherever they turned. We wanted them to see it in what they were reading, hear it on the radio, watch it on television and hear it from who they were meeting with, Mr Schachter said. Working overtime
It is a Herculean effort even by Washington standards, said Robert A. Kapp, the president of the US China Business Council.
He has been working 14, 15 and even 16 hour days for much of the last year on the issue. He wants congress to realise the "insanity of walking away from a brilliantly negotiated agreement."
But after all the effort, he recognises that it will be politics, not economics, that will determine the outcome of the vote.
