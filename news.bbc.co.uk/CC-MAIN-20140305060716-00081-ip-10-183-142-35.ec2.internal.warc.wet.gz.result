Ivory Coast braces for parliamentary polls
Political parties want to prove their strength
By Elizabeth Blunt in Abidjan
Candidates in Ivory Coast have begun registering for the parliamentary elections due on 10 December.
They will come barely two months after a widely disputed presidential poll that led to the ousting of military ruler, General Robert Guei, when he attempted to rig the polls in his favour. Public uprising forced General Guei to flee
The December parliamentary elections are crucial for all the three main parties in the country. New President Laurent Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) is set to battle with the PDCI party which ruled the country for 40 years since independence and former prime minister, Alassane Ouattara's RDR party. Born to rule
President Gbagbo's FPI needs to do well to consolidate its presidential victory and silence suggestions that it won the presidency by default. Until the December 99 coup d'etat, Ivorian politics was completely dominated by the PDCI which still has a strong and long established national organisation. Time for Ouattara's RDR to prove its popularity
But no-one knows if that will be enough to win seats now that the party no longer controls the media and the electoral system and has lost the aura of a party born to rule. The PDCI is also deeply divided; some of the party's best known figures actually supported General Guei in the presidential election. Their attempts to vie for assembly seats on the PDCI ticket are likely to be bitterly contested. Mr Ouattara who was barred from contesting the presidential elections, will also want to prove that the RDR is not just a one-man band but a potential party of government.
It is well funded and has a strong regional base among northern Muslims, who also make up a large part of the population in urban areas throughout the country. The RDR has declined an offer to join President Gbagbo's government for the time being, but says it hopes to be approached again after the December poll when it will have proved its strength.
Honeymoon
President Gbagbo, victory by default?
The current ruling FPI hopes to make the most of its honeymoon period and win enough seats to prove their sceptics wrong. The party has genuine popular support but its rivals say Mr Gbagbo would never have won the presidency if their candidates had been allowed to stand. The December parliamentary polls will put their claims to the test. Everyone expects that the eventual outcome will be some kind of government of national unity.
But the bargaining can only start after the parties have discovered their real strength.

Binge drink ritual upsets actor
Newman is said to be "disturbed" by the use of his name
Veteran actor Paul Newman has complained to Princeton University over a day named after him in which students are encouraged to binge drink.
Newman's Day, which is held annually on 24 April, sees students attempt to drink 24 beers in as many hours.
In a letter sent to the university, Newman's lawyer said the actor was "disturbed" by the use of his name in conjunction with the event.
"He would like to bring an end to this tradition," the letter said.
The ritual has been named after the 79-year-old actor in reference to a quote he is alleged to have said: "24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not."
Unofficial
Part of the challenge sees students attempting to make it through their classes while drunk or consuming their hourly beer.
However, Princeton's dean of undergraduate students Kathleen Deignan said that the event was unofficial and did not have the backing of the University.
"We clarified that Newman's Day is not sanctioned by the university and in fact we go the other way. We try to stop it."
Ms Deignan said that the event was "insulting" to Newman given that his 28-year-old son Scott died of a drug overdose in 1978.
The actor founded the Scott Newman Centre in 1980, a non-profit organisation which is "dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education".

Rivals bid to snatch green domain
By Jonathan Fildes
Technology reporter, BBC News
The two groups have different business models for the domain
Rival environmental groups are lining up supporters to try to take control of a new net domain aimed at green groups.At least two consortiums are known to be preparing bids to control .eco. In March this year, former US vice president Al Gore backed a bid by the California group Dot Eco to operate the proposed "top level domain" (TLD). But now a Canadian environmental group known as Big Room has launched a competing bid to manage the TLD, which is similar to .com or .uk. Both firms plan to apply to Icann - the regulatory body that oversees domain names - for the creation of .eco early in 2010. "We're two different applicants with two different business ideas," Minor Childers, co-founder of Dot Eco, told BBC News. "Ours is to sell domain names to raise funds for organisations who can effect change." He said the group had already entered into contracts with its supporters - such as the Sierra Club and the Alliance for Climate Protection - to give away 57% of its profits from sales. "We could be one of the biggest contributors to environmental causes anywhere in the world," said Mr Childers. 'Sole focus'Big Room also plans to generate money from the sale of .eco domain names to fund "sustainability projects around the world". However, the consortium, which includes WWF International and Green Cross, also believe that .eco could be used as a labelling system to endorse companies with green credentials.
Al Gore won a Nobel Prize in 2007 for his environmental work
".eco should mean something and it should be about something more than just another domain," Trevor Bowden told BBC News. Companies and organisations that apply for .eco domains through Big Room would have to meet certain criteria to be granted a web address. For example, the company may have to measure and publish its carbon footprint to apply. "This could evolve over time - this is not about us deciding what is green and what is not," said Mr Bowden. The criteria would be drawn up with the help of international organisations, he said. Mr Bowden envisages that the companies would use the .eco sites to publish all of their green information. "We think transparency is a really powerful tool," he said. Mr Childers said that his scheme would also require applicants to prove their green credentials but would probably not be as strict. "It's unrealistic to think that you will get a lot of sign-ups if you're too restrictive," he said. "I think our websites should give the opportunity for the 13-year-old environmentalist to have a website as well as a business," he said. Despite having differences about a model for .eco, Mr Childers said that both groups would "definitely have to sit down" together at some point. "My only problem is that I think labelling is a really poor use of this opportunity," he said. The .eco domain has been made possible because of a relaxation on Icann's strict rules on top-level domain names. The decision, made last year, means that companies could turn brands into web addresses, while individuals could use their names. As a result, either group could apply for a different domain. However, for the moment, both sides have one goal. ".eco is our sole focus," said Mr Bowden.

Saddam Hussein condenado a muerte
Mientras escuchaba su sentencia, Hussein se mostr� desafiante ante el juez.
La corte de Bagdad encargada del juicio a Saddam Hussein, conden� a muerte al ex presidente de Irak por cr�menes contra la humanidad.
Saddam Hussein fue hallado culpable por su papel en el asesinato de 148 personas en el pueblo de Dujail, predominantemente chi�ta, en 1982.
La corte tambi�n confirm� que la pena para el ex mandatario ser� la horca, a pesar de que �ste hab�a pedido que, en caso de ser condenado a muerte, su ejecuci�n fuera realizada por un pelot�n de fusilamiento.
El juez Rauf Abdel Rahman orden� a Saddam Hussein que se pusiera de pie mientras le�a el veredicto, pero el ex presidente se neg� a hacerlo y fue obligado a cumplir la orden por asistentes a la corte.

Al conocer la condena, Hussein grit� repetidamente con una copia del Cor�n en la mano "larga vida al pueblo, larga vida a la naci�n. Abajo los invasores. Dios es grande".
El juez continu� leyendo la sentencia a pesar de la intervenci�n de Hussein.
Tambi�n fue sentenciado a muerte el ex juez iraqu�, y medio hermano de Hussein, Awad Hamed al-Bander.
El ex vice presidente Taha Yassin Ramadan fue condenado a cadena perpetua.
Otros tres acusados recibieron una pena de 15 a�os de prisi�n, mientras que Mohammed Azawi Ali, un funcionario de Baas (el antiguo partido gobernante) fue absuelto.
La defensa tiene ahora 30 d�as para apelar el fallo de la corte.
El primer ministro de Irak, Nuri Maliki, exalt� la condena en una intervenci�n televisada en la que dijo que la entencia no era "contra un hombre, sino contra el oscuro per�odo de su mandato".
"Quiz� esto ayude a aliviar el dolor de las viudas y los hu�rfanos y el de aquellos a quienes se les orden� sepultar a sus seres queridos en secreto, aquellos a quienes se forz� a ocultar sus sentimientos y su sufrimiento, aquellos que pagaron en manos de los torturadores", dijo Maliki.
El portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Tony Snow asegur� que era "un gran d�a para el pueblo iraqu�".
Furia en Tikrit
Poco despu�s de la lectura del veredicto se escucharon disparos de celebraci�n en Bagdad. LAS SENTENCIAS
Saddam Hussein, ex presidente de Irak: muerte en la horca
Awad Hamed al-Bander, Juez Principal de la Corte Revolucionaria: muerte en la horca
Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, medio hermano de Hussein: muerte en la horca
Taha Yassin Ramadan, ex vice presidente de Irak: cadena perpetua
Abdullah Kadhem Ruaid, dirigente de Baas: 15 a�os
Abdullah Rawed Mizher, dirigente de Baas: 15 a�os
Ali Daeem Ali, dirigente de Baas: 15 a�os
La ciudad, de seis millones de habitantes, est� bajo toque de queda por 12 horas para evitar que haya brotes de violencia por parte de simpatizantes de Saddam Hussein.
El gobierno iraqu� cancel� los permisos de ausencia del ej�rcito y cerr� el aeropuerto civil de la capital.
Tambi�n se vieron escenas de j�blio en el distrito chiita de Ciudad Sadr, en la capital, en donde la gente sali� a celebrar a pesar del toque de queda.
Tres provincias cercanas a Bagdad, entre ellas Salahuddin, en donde queda Tikrit, la ciudad natal de Hussein, tambi�n est�n bajo toque de queda.
Sin embargo, miles de personas desobedecieron la medida en Tikrit para expresar su apoyo al ex mandatario.
Casi tres a�os despu�s de la captura de Hussein, la creciente violencia sectaria tiene a Irak al borde de una guerra civil.
Seg�n el corresponsal de la BBC en Bagdad, Andrew North, pocos iraqu�es, incluso aquellos que se oponen a Hussein, creen que el veredicto sirva para apaciguar el conflicto.
Interferencia en el proceso
Muchos cr�ticos han desestimado el juicio como una forma de justicia del vencedor, dada la atenci�n que Estados Unidos ha puesto en el caso.
Vea Juicio a Hussein: "Es ilegal"
En im�genes: despu�s del veredicto
Los abogados de Saddam Hussein tambi�n han acusado al gobierno de interferir con el proceso, una queja que ha sido respaldada por la organizaci�n estadounidense de derechos humanos Human Rights Watch.
La defensa del ex mandatario iraqu� tambi�n critic� la fecha dispuesta para la lectura del veredicto, que se fij� para pocos d�as antes de las elecciones legislativas en Estados Unidos.
El partido Republicano, al que pertenece el presidente de EE.UU., George W. Bush, corre el riesgo de perder el control del Congreso en parte, por la insatisfacci�n del electorado con la manera como se ha manejado el conflicto en Irak. Env�e esta nota por e-mail

1967: Harold Wilson wins Moving apology
The Move pop group have made an apology in the High Court to the Prime Minister for a "violent and malicious personal attack".
Libel action was taken by Harold Wilson after a postcard was published, promoting the group's new record Flowers in the Rain. It featured a caricature of the Labour Prime Minister in the nude. Speaking for Mr Wilson, Quentin Hogg QC described the publication as making use of "malicious rumours" concerning his character and integrity.
"We did it as a cartoon...it wasn't intended to be anything but that."
Tony Secunda, Move manager As part of the libel settlement, the band and their manager Tony Secunda have agreed to devote all royalties from their record to charities of the Prime Minister's choice.
The defendants also included the card's artist, the advertising agency and printers. All have apologised for their involvement and have agreed to pay the costs of the proceedings estimated at �3,000. Mr Hogg labelled the card "scurrilous" and criticised the decision to send it to journalists, television producers and music publishers.
Representing the group's manager, members and the artist, Richard Hartley said his clients wished to express their "profound regret" for what had happened.
Members of the Move did not arrive at the High Court in time for the proceedings, but appeared in high spirits. Asked about their political standpoint they joked:
"We've no faith in any political sides at all. We'd vote for people like Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, you know."
The Move recorded and published Flowers in the Rain in August, and Mr Secunda circulated copies of the promotional postcard to coincide with the record's release.
But he denied the publication was a publicity stunt, suggesting the resultant libel action had created that impression.
"Wilson started legal proceedings, we did it as a cartoon, remember that. It wasn't intended to be anything but that," he said.
Worldwide sales of the record, of which an estimated 200,000 copies have already been sold, are expected to generate about �10,000 in proceeds.
Mr Wilson has nominated the Spastics Society and the Amenity Funds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital for the benefit of paraplegic patients to receive the royalties.
Mr Hogg concluded Harold Wilson had never intended to be "harsh or vindictive" and he warned that in any future incident Mr Wilson might not be so lenient.
In Context
The Move formed in 1966 in Birmingham. They had a number of hits including Flowers in the Rain, Blackberry Way and Fire Brigade.
Flowers in the Rain went on to become the first single ever played on BBC Radio1.
Tony Secunda was their first manager, known in the industry as one of the more controversial pop promoters. He encouraged wild stage acts including smashing up TV sets and effigies of political figures.
The libel action ultimately ended the Secunda relationship and the band moved on to new management.
Some of the band's members went on to form the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and now ELO2.
Proceeds from Flowers in the Rain continue to go to charity.

Ramos prepares for Berbatov exit
Berbatov could be ready to turn his back on Spurs
Tottenham manager Juande Ramos has admitted he is already making preparations for the possible departure of star striker Dimitar Berbatov.
Ramos wants to keep the 27-year-old at White Hart Lane but revealed he could leave if Spurs's asking price is met and the player wants to move.
"I've spoken to him many times and know exactly what he wants," Ramos said.
"We have to cover our backs in case the player decides to leave and we have to have options to replace him."
The Bulgarian has been linked with a host of clubs, including Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Ramos added: "I would obviously like him to stay here but we don't know how future negotiations will go so it is something I cannot guarantee.
606: DEBATE
I know he is a brilliant player, but let's just move on
3 Euro Trophies to 2 "If there are offers coming in we will see if they convince the club and the player as well.
"What we want is for the player to be happy and enjoy his football. The player has the key to this and it is up to him at the end of the day.
"If that happened I'm sure the club would prefer to have the money because with the money they would be able to sign the players necessary.
"They would be able to look on the market for appropriate players."
Ramos believes it will be possible to replace Berbatov if he leaves, adding: "Of course there are great players in Europe that can do just as well as Berbatov."
Berbatov, who has netted 23 goals this season, joined Tottenham from Bayer Leverkusen for �10.9m in the summer of 2006. Of course there are great players in Europe that can do just as well as Berbatov
Juande Ramos
He has recovered from a groin injury and is available to play against Liverpool on Sunday, which could be a farewell appearance if an appropriate bid is tabled over the summer.
With Berbatov keen on Champions League football, Spurs have looked at other strikers in case he leaves.
Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o has been linked with a move to White Hart Lane and the Catalan giants have suggested they would study any bid made for the Cameroon forward.
