Orange staff braced for job cuts
Orange is trying to boost its non-voice-related mobile services
Staff at mobile phone group Orange are braced for job cuts after the firm said it would reduce its workforce.
While Orange said it is to cut a "small number" of staff, reports suggested up to 300 staff across its network and technical systems departments could go.
"These are only proposals at the moment and are not related to call centres or other customer-facing roles," an Orange spokesman added.
No locations have been earmarked for the redundancies, he added.
The move is part of a new strategy set out a year ago by former chief executive Sol Trujillo.
The Bristol-based company is hoping the proposals will make its products more user-friendly and also to boost the usage of its non-voice-related mobile phone services.
French state-owned telecommunications group France Telecom owns Orange, which has operations in 19 countries worldwide.

Organ donor system overhaul call
Campaigners say people are dying while waiting for transplants
Government advisers have recommended a radical overhaul of the UK organ donor network in a bid to double the number of organs available for transplant.
By recruiting twice as many transplant co-ordinators and creating 24-hour organ retrieval teams they hope to emulate Spain's successful model.
A system of "presumed consent" in which everyone is a potential donor unless they opt out is also being considered.
Gordon Brown has backed the opt-out idea, which is still under discussion.
Writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, the prime minister said a system of "presumed consent" - where hospitals could take organs unless a person had explicitly opted out before death or their family objects - could save thousands of lives.

Tito Mora
Praise for Spanish system How Spain's system works
"A system of this kind seems to have the potential to close the aching gap between the potential benefits of transplant surgery in the UK and the limits imposed by our current system of consent," he wrote.
A government taskforce set up to examine the donor shortage and consider the issue of presumed consent will report in the summer. Meanwhile, the Scottish Government said it was committed to implementing the reccomendations in the taskforce report, which they said could result in an extra 120 transplants a year in Scotland.
Mr Brown, who carries an organ donor card, said he hoped the measure could be introduced this year.

Lib Dem MP Dr Evan Harris, chair of All-Party Kidney Group and member of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee, welcomed Mr Brown's comments.
"Under an opt-out scheme donor's real wishes will be more often respected, more lives would be saved and grieving relatives will be spared the experience of making the wrong decision at the worst time," he said.
Mr Harris said too many people were "needlessly dying while waiting for organs".
However, several patient groups, including Patient Concern, are against a system of presumed consent, arguing that it is not up to the state to decide what becomes of people's bodies when they die. Joyce Robins from Patient Concern told BBC Radio 5 Live presumed consent turned volunteers into conscripts and that proposals did not tackle the problem of donor shortages. "Presumed consent is no consent at all. We've worked for years to get a system of proper, informed consent in the health service in this country and Gordon Brown is willing to throw it all out of the window," she said.
Dedicated teams
There are more than 8,000 people waiting for organ transplants in the UK - a figure which rises by about 8% a year. And one person dies every day because of a lack of organs.
These recommendations are an essential first step to improve the systems supporting organ donation
Alan Johnson, health minister
Send us your comments
So far, the taskforce has made 14 recommendations for tackling the backlog.
They include doubling the number of transplant coordinators in the NHS to 200 and employing and training them centrally rather than by individual trusts.
Coordinators identify possible donors, talk to bereaved families and inform the national transplant list.
Dedicated organ retrieval teams available 24 hours a day would also be established to work closely with the critical care teams in hospital. The proposed system is similar to that in Spain where they have three times more available organs than in the UK.
Consent
It is expected the measures could result in a 10% increase in the consent rate for donation which currently stands at 60%.
The taskforce says an extra 1,200 transplants could be done each year, which it says could save the NHS more than �500m over 10 years.
This is because dialysis for kidney failure patients costs �25,300 a year, whereas a transplant costs �45,900 initially followed by annual treatment costing �7,100. Health Secretary Alan Johnson said: "Last year around 2,400 people in the UK benefited from an organ transplant, but more than 1,000 people die every year waiting for a transplant. "These recommendations are an essential first step to improve the systems supporting organ donation."
Chris Rudge, director of UK Transplant, said there were weaknesses in the current system that needed to be addressed, saying lack of family consent meant four out of 10 organs considered suitable for transplant were not being used.

South Korean gamers
Crossing Continents
Thursday, 3 January 2008
At 1102 GMT on BBC Radio 4
South Korea is the world's most "wired" country with around 70 per cent of the population hooked up to a high speed internet connection. This reality has spawned a whole new type of sportsman: the "e athlete". Professional computer gamers can now earn hundreds of thousands of dollars playing to packed audiences. However, a 2006 government survey suggested addiction to computer gaming is a significant and growing problem: ten people have actually died after exceptionally long stints in front of the computer screen.
Julian Pettifer investigates the extent of this addiction in Korea - and asks how the Korean government is persuading young people to turn off their computer screens.
BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents will be broadcast on Thursday, 3 January 2008 at 1102 GMT. It will be repeated on Monday, 7 January 2008 at 2030 GMT.

Tourism crash threatens big cats
The compensation scheme has been very successful
Big cats living in Kenya's Maasai Mara game reserve are being threatened by a collapse in revenues from wildlife tourism, it has been claimed.
The Mara Conservancy says tourists have stayed away since the violence which followed last year's disputed election.
The group, which manages a 510 sq km area called the Mara Triangle, can no longer pay pastoralists compensation for cattle killed by lions or leopards.
This could force local people to kill the cats in order to protect livestock.
It may be only a matter of time until rangers won't be so lucky in stopping cattle owners from taking their own measures to protect cattle
William Deed, Mara Conservancy
William Deed, from the Mara Conservancy, told the BBC that it was facing a shortfall of $50,000 (�25,000) per month.
The non-profit organisation relies on a percentage of park entrance fees paid by tourists.
Since it was founded in 2001, and the compensation scheme established, the number of lions in the reserve has doubled to 80.
Strained situation
But now the fund has been suspended, some Maasai have threatened to resume hunting the lions and leopards which kill their cows, goats and sheep.
"We have now had several close calls with locals hunting lions and leopards in return for the cattle that have been killed by these predators," said Mr Deed. "Previously, the cattle compensation scheme we had in place would help placate such situations, however with no funding to pay for such a scheme the local communities are no longer seeing the benefits of living so closely with the wildlife."
He said the current situation was leading to strained relations with local communities.
The Mara Conservancy has met with local elders, but each time one of their animals is killed with no money for compensation, the "tension mounts", Mr Deed explained.
"It may be only a matter of time until rangers won't be so lucky in stopping cattle owners from taking their own measures to protect cattle," he added.
Slow recovery
Cuts in electricity are also making the job of rangers increasingly dangerous. Part of their job involves catching armed cattle rustlers who often make their escape through the Mara Triangle.
But the area now lacks power for 11 hours out of every 24, meaning that communications are often down between the main station and patrol teams.
The dire funding situation has also forced the organisation to stop night patrols.
Poachers were already profiting from the situation, said Mr Deed: groups of men had been seen using torches to hunt Thomson Gazelles at night.
Last month, the rangers have caught five poachers, including three men who killed a hippo for its meat. Even though the worst of the violence in Kenya has subsided, Mr Deed said it would take time for the tourist trade to pick up again. For now, he explained, the organisation was operating only on small donations from individuals across the world.

Teacher: Why I'm on strike
Julian is head of business studies and economics
Up to 450,000 pupils across London will lose a day's education as members of the National Union of Teachers stage a one-day strike over London weighting allowances. Business studies and economics teacher Julian McAllen feels the action he and his colleagues are taking is justified.
By Katherine Sellgren
BBC News Online
A head of department by the age of 30, Julian McAllen is progressing swiftly up the teaching profession ladder.
And yet he cannot afford to rent a one-bedroom flat near his school in Hornsey, north London, never mind buy one. The area around Hornsey School for Girls is an expensive place to live, with rent for a flat being somewhere in the region of �1,000 a month.
It's not a course of action the teaching profession takes lightly... it's the only way the government will sit up and take note
Julian McAllen
"I'm having to live further out, where the rent is cheaper, and commute in," says Julian.
"Obviously this adds to my monthly outgoings and it costs me time as well."
He is looking to buy a property, but is restricted to cheaper areas, within a commutable distance from his school, such as Tottenham and Walthamstow.
"The affordable areas tend to be the ones with higher rates of crime - i.e. areas I don't want to live in long-term - and so the likelihood of me staying in London is that much less," he says. Moving on out
Julian says one of his friends - who is also a head of department - earns less than him at a school in Gloucestershire, but has a much larger disposable income because housing and living costs are significantly cheaper.
Like many teachers, he believes the high cost of living in London will force him out in time.
"In the short-term I intend to stay in London, but in the medium to long-term I will move out because of the cost of living.
"That's unless teachers' pay improves, unless there's a positive compensating differential between teachers' pay in London and the rest of the country."
Pupils affected
Julian admits Thursday's industrial action will affect the education of the 1,300 pupils at Hornsey School, if only marginally, but he feels the capital's teachers have been pushed one step too far. "The government has put teachers in this position - it's not a course of action the teaching profession takes lightly.
London allowances from April
Inner: �3,105
Outer: �2,043
Fringe: �792
"It's something we'd rather not do, but we've been forced into it - it's the only way the government will sit up and take note."
Julian says he looks at his wages in comparison to other public sector workers and feels there is a discrepancy.
"Take Metropolitan police officers - their London weighting is about �6,000, now that far exceeds teachers' allowance.
"I've been in the profession for six years, I'm a head of department and I'm earning �29,000.
"Now I keep seeing adverts for police officers for the Met with a salary of �26,000 - and that's just the starting salary.
"Maybe it's time for a career change!"

Near-miss sparks investigation
The Loganair service was flying to Glasgow
A near-miss involving a military jet and a passenger aeroplane in the west of Scotland has sparked an investigation.
The incident took place 25 miles west of Glasgow.
An inquiry has also been launched into a near-miss between two British Airways passenger planes on domestic flights - one of which had taken off from Glasgow.
Two BA planes were involved in one incident
The first incident involved a Shorts 360 aircraft from Islay, which was operated by Loganair.
It was being guided into Glasgow by air traffic controllers when it came close to colliding with a Royal Air Force jet at an altitude of about 5,000ft some 25 miles from the city.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is carrying out an inquiry into the incident, which took place last month. An air proximity report has been filed with the CAA and investigators will examine radar records to discover what happened.
The incident came to light two days after the most recent near-miss over mid Wales - which itself took place only days after 71 people were killed when two jets collided over Germany.
A Bristol to Newcastle flight came within 1,000ft of a plane travelling from Glasgow to Bristol at about 1900 BST on Wednesday.
The two planes must have been closer together than 1,000ft or no report would have been filed
CAA spokesman Emergency anti-collision systems were activated and both planes were steered apart.
BA said it was "unlikely" the passengers were aware of the incident.
A CAA spokesman said: "An investigation is under way but the two planes must have been closer together than 1,000ft or no report would have been filed.
"Nobody knows how close they were at this stage but closer examination of the facts and courses will reveal more."
The Embraer 145 jet from Glasgow had been carrying 43 passengers, while the Dash 8 aircraft leaving Bristol had 22 passengers on board.

A bomb attack on a housing complex in the Saudi capital Riyadh bears all the hallmarks of al-Qaeda, senior US and Saudi officials say. Seventeen people are killed and more than 100 injured in the blast, mostly foreign Arab workers.
The Saudi royal family has close ties to the US
Militant Islamic groups connected to al-Qaeda are actively seeking to overthrow the Saudi royal family, US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage says. Mr Armitage also warned of fresh terror attacks to come in the kingdom. Story link:
Saudi Arabia: Uncertain front in war
Italian Defence Minister Antonio Martino says he believes al-Qaeda elements to be involved alongside Saddam Hussein loyalists in an attack on a police station in Iraq in which 18 Italian policemen and nine Iraqis died.
"The enemy we have to deal with is the same one - global terrorism - which is striking wherever possible," Mr Martino said. Two synagogues were targeted in the Istanbul attacks
Turkish officials investigate claims of al-Qaeda involvement in two devastating attacks on synagogues in Istanbul. At least 23 people are killed and more than 300 injured in the bombings.
The London-based Arabic newspaper al-Quds said it had received an emailed statement from al-Qaeda claiming responsibility.
It said the group targeted the synagogues because Israeli agents were working there, Al-Quds Editor Abdel-Bari Atwan told the BBC. Following two major bomb attacks on British-linked targets in Istanbul, there are separate claims of responsibility from two allegedly al-Qaeda connected groups.
One unconfirmed report said a group calling itself Abu Hafz al-Masri Brigades had admitted to carrying out attacks on the British Consulate and the HSBC bank offices in Istanbul, which left 27 people dead and more than 450 wounded. Another claim came from a caller to the semi-official Anatolia news agency, who said that al-Qaeda and a Turkish militant group IBDA-C were jointly responsible. Story link:
Q&A: Is al-Qaeda behind the attacks?

Baby tortoises stolen from animal sanctuary
Seven baby tortoises, including an endangered leopard tortoise that's worth up to £1,000, have been stolen from a sanctuary in Cornwall.A visitor is thought to have snatched the youngsters from their pen at the Tortoise Garden sanctuary, which looks after more than 400 of the creatures. The baby tortoises, some of which are as small as a 50p piece, will die if kept in the wrong conditions. Owners Joy and Geoff Bloor described the theft as "heartless". Try our tortoise quiz
The missing leopard tortoise, Banjo, was the first of his kind to be born at the sanctuary. The other missing babies are Hermann tortoises, which are worth around £100 each. Joy Bloor and her husband, who have been caring for tortoises in their garden for 11 years, said it was one of the saddest days of their lives. In a message on their website, Joy said: "My faith in humanity has been completely destroyed and this episode will now lead in all probability to the closure of the garden. "I have put my heart and soul into looking after tortoises in my tortoise garden for the past 11 years and to be repaid in this heartless manner has taken my heart out of here." Police are investigating and want to speak to a man in his mid-20s, with short dark brown hair, who was seen nearby at the time of the theft.

Chelsea 2 - 1 Fulham
Drogba scored Chelsea's equaliser to spark a comeback that had looked unlikely
By Ian Hughes
Chelsea opened up a five-point gap at the top of the Premier League table as they came from behind to beat Fulham.The visitors stunned Chelsea by taking the lead after four minutes when Zoltan Gera hooked in from 12 yards. Fulham then defended comfortably as Chelsea struggled to make an impact but Didier Drogba finally got the equaliser when he headed in at the far post. And an unfortunate own goal by Chris Smalling handed Chelsea a victory that had looked unlikely for long spells. For much of the match Chelsea looked short of ideas and out-of-sorts as Fulham produced a performance that was full of commitment and excellent defending. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Ancelotti resolute after beating Fulham
Even without the injured Brede Hangeland, Fulham looked comfortable at the back - until John Pantsil went off injured, and that was perhaps the turning point of the game. Until then Pantsil had got the better of Drogba in an excellent battle, with the Ivorian striker cutting a frustrated figure. But in the end Drogba helped give Chelsea the perfect farewell present before he heads off to the African Cup of Nations. Yet it might have been so different. If ever there was a perfect time for Fulham to play Chelsea, perhaps this was it with the Blues having won only one of their five previous games in December. Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti said after Saturday's 0-0 draw with Birmingham that his side were lacking confidence and that was certainly in evidence. The Italian made six changes to his line-up but the number of alterations outweighed the number of chances created. Time and again Fulham easily repelled half-hearted Chelsea attacks. 606: DEBATE
I said I couldn't see us winning the way we were playing, but we won! Albeit with a bit of luck
Tue_Blu
Right from the start, Chelsea looked off key and when skipper John Terry failed to head away Paul Konchesky's cross, Gera was on hand to hook the ball in after Bobby Zamora had nodded it his way. A miserable afternoon for Terry continued when he suffered cuts under his eye and on his cheek after a clash with team-mate Yuri Zhirkov, who will not look back fondly on his first Premier League start. For all their possession, Chelsea barely forced a save from Mark Schwarzer in the first half - the Australian easily gathered two Drogba efforts, while Salomon Kalou dragged a shot well wide. And just after the break, Zamora should have punished Chelsea when he intercepted Ricardo Carvalho's backpass but Petr Cech made a fine save. That might have wrapped up Fulham's second victory over Chelsea in the last three decades, but instead they ended up suffering a 17th defeat. Drogba gave warning that Chelsea were far from finished when he tested Schwarzer with a fizzing shot. And it was Drogba who hauled his side back into the game when he exploited the space at right-back, after Pantsil had been forced off injured, and headed in Branislav Ivanovic's far-post cross. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. We pushed Chelsea to the limit - Hodgson
It was a crushing blow for Fulham but worse was to follow. Three minutes later, Daniel Sturridge's cross-shot was beaten out by Schwarzer but it hit Smalling and he put through his own net trying to clear. Kalou clipped the bar with a shot late on, but the result was already harsh enough on Fulham. Chelsea, however, will be buoyed by a victory that was achieved when they were far from their best. Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti: "The first half was not good, the second half was better - we played with great determination. It was not easy but we deserved the win. "In the second half we changed our system, put Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou out wide and that was better. "Drogba not only scored but worked very hard and gave strength to the team. It was good for him and for the team." Fulham manager Roy Hodgson: "Chelsea had a lot of the ball and we did a lot of defending but that can happen when you take an early lead. "It's very disappointing to put in such a great performance and have nothing to show for it. "It would have been nice to have gone away with a least a point - we pushed Chelsea to the limit and we can consider ourselves very unlucky." Live text and stats

Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs out for three months
Gibbs (right) was injured in a hefty challenge from Standard's Eliaquim Mangala
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Kieran Gibbs has had surgery and faces three months out.Gibbs, 20, injured his left foot in a challenge with Standard Liege's Eliaquim Mangala during the Gunners' 2-0 Champions League win on Tuesday. "The first metatarsal is broken, which is very rare. He will be out for at least three months," Wenger explained. With Gael Clichy also out, Armand Traore could deputise at left-back when Arsenal host Chelsea on Sunday. However, with centre-back William Gallas also doubtful having hobbled off against Liege with an ankle injury, Wenger could start Mikael Silvestre, or even move either centre-back Thomas Vermaelen or right-back Bacary Sagna to the left.
606: DEBATE
Have your say on Gibbs' injury
Having seen first-choice Clichy ruled out for several weeks due to a back problem, Wenger was left fuming at the tackle that caused Gibbs' latest injury, the England-Under-21 international having only just recovered from an injury to his right foot. "It was a very bad challenge by the number 22 [Mangala] and was not his first try," he said. However, the Arsenal manager has conceded that even a first-choice defence would face a stern examination from Didier Drogba and former Gunner Nicolas Anelka in the league-leaders' attack. "You know they are a good side and to beat them, you have to deliver a good performance," said Wenger.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "It is more important we focus on what we do than any strength or weakness of Chelsea. "They are a strong side and have a good manager in Carlo Ancelotti, but I still believe that despite all that, we can still beat them. "Let us expect them to be strong on the day, and then let us be stronger."

Killie striker on loan to Annan
Anson was the top player in last season's SPL under-19 league
Annan Athletic have signed 19-year-old Kilmarnock striker Scott Anson on loan.
Anson is expected to be included in the squad for Saturday's Third Division meeting with Albion Rovers.
The "rising star" award winner in the Scottish Premier League's under-19 set-up last term is the third signing Annan have made during the transfer window.
Annan this week handed professional contracts to 18-year-old Aaron Muirhead and 17-year-old Phil Storey that tie the pair to the club until 2010.
Meanwhile, Annan have placed out-of-favour 28-year-old defender Simon Ruddick, previously of Gretna and Penrith, on the transfer list.

Russia labour to win over Tunisia
Egor Titov is swamped by celebrating team-mates
Russia 2-0 Tunisia
Russia underlined their status as Group H favourites with a hard-earned victory over Tunisia in Kobe.
But they were made to work for their win by a Tunisian team which had not read the script marking them out as group whipping boys.
GRAPHIC ANALYSIS
Titov's opener
Yegor Titov's accurate strike and Valery Karpin's penalty took Russia to the top of the group, with Tunisia suggesting they will test Belgium and Japan.
Russia's willingness to shoot from long-range saw Andrei Solomatin's stinging 14th minute drive spilled by Ali Boumnijel who grabbed the ball ahead of Ruslan Pimenov.
I'm dissatisfied with the way we played in our penalty area and in their penalty area
Russia coach Oleg Romantsev
Russia reaction
Tunisia reaction
Lokomotiv Moscow striker Pimenov then sent an acrobatic bicycle kick straight at Boumnijel.
But it was Tunisia who almost took a bizarre 20th-minute lead. Russian defenders Yuri Nikiforov and Yuri Kovtun tangled as they intercepted Slim Ben Achour's through pass.
Nikiforov's clearance struck Kovtun and the ball rolled inches wide of the unguarded goal with keeper Ruslan Nigmatullin stranded.
Russia got plenty of width in their play, providing a plentiful supply of crosses, but Hatem Trabelsi and Radhi Jaidi were towers at the heart of the Tunisian defence.

See full photo gallery
Trabelsi, who plays for Dutch club Ajax, then stretched into a timely challenge to nick the ball away from Vladimir Beschastnykh.
Have your say on Russia
In first-half injury time, Nigmatullin had to dash from his goal to grab Ziad Jaziri's through-ball just ahead of Khaled Badra, while at the other end Titov lashed a first-time shot inches wide of the post.
Half-time substitute Dmitri Kokhlov almost made an instant impact, rising to head a free-kick just wide with his first touch.
MATCH FACTS

64mins:Karpin penalty makes it 2-0
Relive every kick
More match stats
Tunisia twice almost nosed ahead, first Slim Ben Achour thumped a shot inches wide, and Karpin bravely put his head in to nick Badra's cross away from Sellimi.
Pimenov then went close, volleying into the side-netting from a corner. Russia took the lead on 58 minutes with a helping hand from Tunisian keeper Boumnijel, whose sloppy throw-out was intercepted by Dmitry Sychev.
Have your say on Tunisia
The ball was worked in to Titov who slotted in an accurate shot from the edge of the box.
Russia took an even firmer grip on the game five minutes later when Jaidi's foul on Sychev gave Karpin the opportunity to score from the penalty spot.
Tunisia showed plenty of willing spirit to try and find a route back into the game, but poor finishing let them down as a determined Russian defence held firm.
