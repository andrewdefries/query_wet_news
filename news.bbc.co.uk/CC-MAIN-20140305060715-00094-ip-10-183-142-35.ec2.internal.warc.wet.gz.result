Algeria and Mali target al-Qaeda
Reports say the joint operation could last up to six months
Algeria has begun sending military equipment to Mali in preparation for a joint operation against Islamist militants linked to al-Qaeda.The aid includes fuel, weapons and sleeping bags, according to reports in the Algerian media. The operation could involve neighbouring countries Niger and Mauritania, say the reports. Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure has called for regional co-operation to deal with al-Qaeda linked groups. The move follows a recent visit to Algeria by Mali's defence minister, during which he had talks with President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Hostage deadlineTwo independent newspapers have reported that the operation could start within the next month or two and last for six months. Islamist groups have been using the Sahara in northern Mali as a base for attacks in Algeria and for keeping Western hostages. A group called al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has threatened to kill a British hostage, believed to be held somewhere in the Sahara region, on 15 May unless the UK frees a detained Jordanian Islamist. The group has been waging a campaign of bombings and shootings, primarily along Algeria's Mediterranean coast. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

What's in it for Nice?
Protesters take some of the gloss off Nice
With violence breaking out at the European Union's Nice Summit, city leaders are again reminded of the pitfalls of hosting attention-grabbing conferences.
As EU leaders descended on the C�te d'Azur port of Nice, locals might have hoped the summit would put their city on the political as well as the tourist map.
However, with demonstrators and police clashing outside the conference, Nicoise may now fear their home town will live in infamy as Europe's Seattle. Nice to see you, to see you Nice
Seattle is still licking the wounds inflicted by the violent demonstrations which accompanied last year's meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The city, which is home to such corporate giants as Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks, had banked on bolstering its kudos among the global business community. But the public relations bid backfired, and instead millions of people now associate Seattle with images of smashed glass and tear gas. The riots which marred the five-day WTO meeting cost the city $9m, after the cost of putting right vandalism and paying police overtime was taken into account.
As well as lost business, locals were horrified to see pictures flashed around the world of their menacingly well-equipped police. What went wrong?
When it was all over, Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, was in no doubt the entire event had gone badly awry. "Could you point me to the nearest Starbucks, officer?"
"We're taking the city back to make Seattle again," he told concerned locals. It could have been so different. Hosting international conferences has been the making of many a city. Geneva is synonymous with humanitarianism, thanks to the series warfare protocols - the Geneva Convention - brokered by the Swiss-based Red Cross.
Similarly, Canada's capital witnessed the birth of an international effort to outlaw landmines: the so-called Ottawa Process. Inhabitants of the once obscure Dutch city of Maastricht may not care for the tone in which Euro sceptics talk of their home. But there's only one thing worse than being talked about... Step aside Maastricht
When Cardiff was picked to host a summit at the end of the UK's presidency of the EU in June 1998, the Welsh capital relished the prospect of such respectable notoriety. "I hope it dries before Tony gets here"
Alas, it was not to be. But Cardiff is not alone in such disappointment.
The Hague, in the Netherlands, and Kyoto, in Japan, may go down in history more for the hot air of political negotiations, than for any real progress on reducing greenhouse gases. However, even if a city doesn't go down in the history books, it can do very well from hosting a few days of political glad-handing. The rather rundown resort of Nago, on the Japanese island of Okinawa, got more than a lick of paint when it welcomed leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) last summer. It secured $945m of investment from Tokyo.
When Birmingham hosted the G7 summit in 1998, it was a perfect opportunity to show off the results of the city's ambitious regeneration programme. Back on the map
The Times responded by declaring "Birmingham is once again the centre of the industrial world".
Birmingham be proud
Myra Benson, project manager for the summit, says it was a wonderful experience for the city.
"You can host these things in a way which is just inconvenient to citizens - what with the huge motorcades and tight security - and then have the city foot the bill. We didn't do either."
Ms Benson says "Brummies" were proud to accommodate the 2,000 delegates and 3,000 journalists.
"We ran a campaign with posters saying: 'Birmingham welcome the world and hold your head high'."
Citizens were encouraged to engage with delegates. "We tried to make the people feel involved, so it wasn't just something happening to their city."
Picture perfect
When Bill, Boris and Tony rocked out to pop group All Saints at the Symphony Hall, 30,000 locals sang along in a simultaneous concert.
But was it a cost-effective display of civic pride? "No, Boris, they don't need any more photos of you holding a pint"
The summit brought in more than �6m over the weekend, says Ms Benson.
Sponsorship helped soften the blow, but the event still cost the city council �240,000.
"If you'd asked me how much I'd pay for a photo of Bill Clinton drinking a pint in one of the city squares I'd regenerated - I'd probably have said much more than a quarter of a million pounds."

Zoo celebrates deer new arrival
The pudu is the smallest species of deer
One of the world's smallest species of deer has been born at Edinburgh Zoo as part of a conservation drive.
The pudu, who has been named Jon by zoo keepers, is the first of his species to be delivered at the zoo since 2000.
Head keeper Darren McGarry said everyone was delighted with the tiny new arrival.
Edinburgh Zoo has been participating in a European Endangered Species Programme for pudu since 1985.
Jon, who is only 15cm long, was born on 6 February and is the first infant to parents Amber and Henry.
Mr McGarry said: "We are so happy to have a baby pudu again, as it has been a few years since the last one.
"Hopefully, this is the start of a new period of success with this endangered species at Edinburgh Zoo."
The moves are coordinated by the European studbrook keeper for the species who is based at Wuppertal Zoo in Germany.
The southern pudu live in lowland temperate rainforests in Chile and south-west Argentina.
Wild populations are most at risk through the destruction of their lowland forest habitat and natural predators such as pumas and foxes.

Hollyoaks star is secret 'Maria'
An actress from Hollyoaks is the subject of a showbiz stunt - in real life she's going to play the new Maria in The Sound of Music in the West End.
Summer Strallen has been playing Summer Shaw in the TV show since October.
Viewers have watched her character desperately trying to make her dream of being a theatre star come true.
But in real life, Summer was actually given the role in The Sound Of Music six months ago by top theatre man Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.
What's your fave TV programme? In Hollyoaks, Summer dreams of stardom and eventually gets to audition for Andrew Lloyd Webber, who was behind the stunt. Connie won her part on TV
He said he thought it was an unusual idea to mix a soap story with real-life: "I thought 'Do you know what? It's never been done before and it's funny'."
Hollyoaks viewers will watch Summer rehearse until 26 February when she leaves the soap and takes to the stage.
Summer will replace Connie Fisher who won the role on a TV talent show.
Connie is moving on to do a TV drama after two years in the musical.

Demonstrations
Articles 10 and 11 of the Human Rights Act state that everyone has rights to free expression and assembly. How these will be interpreted by the courts remains unclear.
Legal observers of demonstrations which have turned violent have argued that the public has not been able to take action against officers because it has been unclear under what rules the police are operating. While forces will be obliged to more precisely justify their actions, Article 11 does not prevent �the imposition of lawful restrictions � by the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the state�.
Some legal commentators have already suggested that the police�s approach to the UK�s fuel crisis protests of September 2000, where they didn�t break up blockades, may have been influenced by uncertainty over how the courts would interpret the balance between the public�s rights and the police�s duties.

Clingan completes Coventry switch
Clingan has made 17 appearances for Northern Ireland
Coventry City have signed midfielder Sammy Clingan on a three-year contract from Norwich for an undisclosed fee. The 25-year-old Northern Ireland international agreed personal terms and has now completed his move to the Championship club. Clingan attracted interest from other clubs following Norwich's relegation to League One last season. The midfielder began his career with Wolves and helped Nottingham Forest to promotion in 2007/08. Clingan's arrival comes less than a fortnight after City manager Chris Coleman accused the player's agent of sinking a deal to bring the midfielder to the Ricoh Arena. Coleman told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire: "I advised the chairman not to pay the agent. "He's done nothing for the player. We didn't get the player because of the agent and that's unfortunate."

Venus in shock second-round exit
AUSTRALIAN OPENVenue: Melbourne Park Date: 19 January-1 FebruaryCoverage: BBC Red Button, BBC One & Two (including all Andy Murray matches), Radio 5 Live sports extra, BBC Sport website (Red Button coverage streamed on website throughout fortnight)Friday: Wozniacki v Dokic followed by Federer v Safin live on Red Button from 0830 GMT
Venus looked a shadow of the player who triumphed at Wimbledon last year
Sixth seed Venus Williams suffered a major upset in the second round of the Australian Open, beaten by unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro.Suarez Navarro, playing in only her fourth Grand Slam, saved a match point before beating Williams 2-6 6-3 7-5. The 20-year-old bettered her more decorated opponent for much of their two-and-a-quarter hour match. Elsewhere, younger Williams sister Serena is through to the third round along with Russian Elena Dementieva. Venus rarely looked like the reigning Wimbledon champion against the inexperienced but fearless Suarez Navarro, ranked 40 places beneath her in the world rankings and whose best Grand Slam showing is reaching last year's French Open quarter-final.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Initially overwhelmed, Suarez Navarro was broken twice in losing the first set, but turned the tables on Venus with a double break to take the second as the 28-year-old American's poise evaporated. Venus appeared to have reasserted her authority in the third set, taking a 4-1 lead but Suarez Navarro dragged herself back into it and saved a match point at 4-5. She broke in the next game and served out for a famous victory. "We haven't quite figured out exactly which areas went wrong," said Venus afterwards. "But I definitely have to credit her.
She was super consistent and aggressive and just went for her shots
Venus Williams
"She was super consistent and aggressive and just went for her shots." When asked if she was frustrated at another early exit here after her first round loss in 2006 she replied, "I don't believe in jinxes because I don't believe in witches or warlocks or magical creatures and stuff." An understandably jubilant Suarez Navarro told a courtside reporter: "I don't know what I did, I only played. I don't know what to say." Her reward is a third-round tie with fellow Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez who saw off Uzbekistan's Akgul Amanmuradova 6-2 6-4 in round two. Second seed Serena laboured to a straight-sets victory over Argentine Gisela Dulko. The stubborn Dulko made the US star save six set points on the way to a 6-3 7-5 victory on the Hisense Arena. Serena, who has won the Australian Open every alternate year since 2003, needed treatment for ankle trouble at the end of the marathon ninth game of her second set against Dulko. She had a couple of opportunities but I always felt I wasn't going to lose
Serena Williams
Dulko squandered six set points then saved five break points before Williams finally put the game to bed, then held her own serve to even the set at 5-5. Williams proceeded to break again in another gruelling game, featuring six deuces, before holding her serve to win the match with an ace. "It was a very tough second set, she started playing unbelievable, hitting winners left and right," said Williams. "She had a couple of opportunities but I always felt I wasn't going to lose. "I feel I could play a lot better," she added. "Today I was at like a D minus at best." Williams will play Peng Shuai of China in the third round after she beat Bulgaria's Sesil Karatancheva 6-4 6-0. By contrast, Russian fourth seed Dementieva made short work of Czech opponent Iveta Benesova with a 6-4 6-1 victory. The Beijing Olympic gold medallist, hunting a first Grand Slam title,will be feeling comparatively fresh having needed just over an hour to register a straight-sets victory over Benesova. "I'm not thinking about my chances," she insisted. "I'm really enjoying the way I'm playing right now and I just want to go as far as I can, just enjoy every single match I play here." Russian eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova booked her place in the third round with an assured 6-2 6-2 victory over Germany's Tatjana Malek. The wind was swirling around and it was hard, but I think I coped well
Svetlana Kuznetsova
The 23-year-old from St Petersburg, who won the US Open in 2004, was never in any trouble against Malek, ranked 239 in the world. The Russian's main problem came from the high winds that swirled relentlessly around the exposed Margaret Court Arena. "The conditions were hard but I think I played quite well with the wind, so I'm happy with that," she said. "The wind was swirling around and it was hard - I had to move around a lot, but I think I coped well." Swiss 14th seed Patty Schnyder was an early casualty, dumped out 6-3 6-1 by France's Virginie Razzano. And 13th seed Victoria Azarenka, from Belarus, led Tathiana Garbin 4-1 when her Italian opponent retired through injury, sending Azarenka through to face French 20th seed Amelie Mauresmo. Mauresmo came from a set down to see off Britain's Elena Baltacha.
