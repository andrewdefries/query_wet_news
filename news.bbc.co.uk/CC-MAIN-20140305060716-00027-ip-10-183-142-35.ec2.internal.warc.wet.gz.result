Finding work for unemployed MPs
James Trollope
Politics Show BBC South East
149 MPs decided not to fight the last election.
One day they are members of parliament, the next members of the public looking for a job.Politics can be a cruel business for those defeated at the general election. So what has happened to our former MPs? Well, a record number saw the writing on the wall and stood down before facing the voters. Nationally 149 MPs decided not to fight the last election. In our region, seven MPs fought and lost. All were Labour except for Conservative, Nigel Waterson who, after 18 years, lost his Eastbourne seat. Six of the former Labour MPs were elected in the Labour landslide of 1997 except for Celia Barlow who became MP for Hove in 2005. Finding workSo how easy has it been for this group of seven defeated MPs to find another job? The average age of the group is 56 statistically not the best age to be seeking work. Angela Baron from the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development said: "Quite a lot of the jobs that might have mopped up some of these people are just not going to be there in future because of public sector cuts." Paul Clark When we contacted our group of seven only Paul Clark, the former transport minister and MP for Gillingham, was willing and able to talk to us on camera. Many were still feeling bruised after the election. "I suppose it's a bit like a death in the family," said Mr Clark. "Even though you know it's going to happen it still comes as a bit of a shock." Nigel Waterson
However, I spoke to all but one of the group on the phone and asked them about their plans for the future. Nigel Waterson, may have lost his Eastbourne seat but not his sense of humour. "I'm thinking about becoming a drug dealer," he quipped. Joking aside, he's "considering all sorts of possibilities" Jonathan Shaw
Jonathan Shaw, the former Minister for the South East and Labour member for Chatham and Aylesford was less forthcoming. "I've completely withdrawn from public life" he said. Gwyn Prosser
At 67 ,Gwyn Prosser the former Labour MP for Dover is the oldest of the group. He said although defeat was disappointing: "The silver lining is I've got my life back". Dr Stephen Ladyman
Dr Stephen Ladyman, who represented Thanet South for Labour has already started his new job as chief executive of a retirement housing group. Currently he's abroad on holiday. "I've been fortunate," he said, "but I've heard a lot of my colleagues are struggling." Michael Foster
Labour's Michael Foster is planning to return to work as a solicitor. He hopes to open an office in his former constituency of Hastings. "I'd rather be doing the other job. If there's an early election I'd consider standing." Celia Barlow
Celia Barlow, the former Labour MP for Hove, didn't wish to speak me. Her campaign manager said she was still hurt at the loss of her job and wants to focus on her three teenage children. "She doesn't know what the future holds," he said. But before you start feeling too sorry for our group of seven, it is worth considering they are not leaving parliament empty handed. All will receive a resettlement package calculated on length of service and age. The longest serving of the group Nigel Waterson who is 59 will receive a years salary - £65,738. While Celia Barlow, who served for the shortest period, qualifies for half of that. The others will be paid something in between with the first £30,000 tax free. PensionAnd then of course, there is an inflation linked pension which is considerably more generous than the majority of other schemes. The 5 with 13 years of service will be entitled a pension of £19,638 rising by 2.5 per cent each year until retirement at 65. Although the severance package might seem overly generous to some, others believe it is a just reward for a demanding but insecure job arguing that if the benefits were to be reduced so would the quality of candidates. "You have to make sure you're getting the right balance between rewarding people properly and giving them the right kind of support when they leave politics but not over rewarding them or over compensating them," said Angela Baron. Some firms may value a former politician's knowledge of the corridors of power. But one leading head-hunter, Sam Allen from Sam Allen Associates, thinks the public outcry over expenses may have damaged their job prospects.

Chance for a new start in Afghanistan
By John Simpson
BBC World Affairs Editor
Afghan insurgents have imported tactics from Iraq
Afghanistan is not Iraq. It should not be necessary to make the point, of course.
But after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein there is a growing resistance in the West to further adventures. In the minds of many people in Europe, sending more troops to Afghanistan is both dangerous and imperialistic.
It does not necessarily have to be either. The motives that have led Britain, Canada, France, Germany and other countries to send their soldiers to Afghanistan are very different from those which led the United States and Britain to invade Iraq three years ago. Mutual interest
And the response by most Afghans to the presence of foreign troops in their country is nothing like the hatred and anger which so many Iraqis feel towards the Americans and British. In Afghanistan, the self-interest of Western countries happens to coincide with that of the Afghan people. We need a peaceful, prosperous and well-governed Afghanistan. Afghans were ignored by the West after the Cold War ended
When it is none of these things, it can do us immense damage. The attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States were planned and organised in Taleban-ruled Afghanistan. The great majority of the heroin that reaches the streets of Western cities comes from the wilder parts of Afghanistan. Help the Afghan government grow strong, support the living standards of the Afghan people, and we ourselves will be safer.
The trouble is, the West has never seen Afghanistan as a real country. It has always seen it, instead, as a square on the international chess-board. The overthrow of the Taleban was a triumph of minimalism
In the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was president of the United States and Margaret Thatcher was the British prime minister, we heard a great deal about the sufferings of the Afghans under the Soviet yoke. But when the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan in February 1989, the Americans, the British and everyone else lost all interest in the country. Now it was just an extremely poor country with no natural resources. Taleban loathed
In the 1990s, ignored by the outside world, Afghanistan descended into a spiral of insane violence which ended only with the arrival in power of the most perverse and retrograde government in modern times: the Taleban. The overthrow of the Taleban in November 2001 was a triumph of minimalism. A small number of US special forces and a certain amount of bombing helped the anti-Taleban Northern Alliance to chase them out of Kabul.
HAVE YOUR SAY
Public opinion in the United States still favours the use of force rather than reason
Send us your comments
The Taleban had been loathed by most Afghans, and their departure was greeted like a new dawn. Britain and America promised they would not lose interest in Afghanistan again.
Then came the invasion of Iraq. All the attention was redirected there. As the resistance movement blossomed and spread in Iraq, its influence spread back into Afghanistan. The Taleban, which had seemed to be finished, began to grow in influence again. It imported the tactics of the Iraqi insurgents and became a training-ground for Islamic militants again.
New start
Anyone who knows Afghanistan knows how ordinary people there long for peace and prosperity. The author and commentator Ahmed Rashid writes: "Western forces are still welcome - as long as they are really useful and are willing to both fight and help in reconstruction."
Even the south-east, where the Taleban always had greater support, and where British troops are now going to be based, is less dangerous than Iraq.
British troops can restore their reputation in Afghanistan
They can do a great deal more good in Afghanistan - especially if they learn from their Iraqi mistakes.
The key is to act as partners in Afghanistan, not as occupiers. One of the most thoughtful American commentators on Afghanistan, Vanni Cappelli, argues cogently that the Western forces need to work with the tribes along the wild borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Osama Bin Laden and the Taleban leaders are being sheltered. Last month the CIA launched a missile attack across the border, killing 18 civilians. This kind of action against the tribes will not, Cappelli argues, "sway this warrior people if it feels it can uphold its honour and dignity by supporting Islamic extremists. The trick is proving to them that there are better ways to secure these things."
Cappelli is entirely right. If the trick can be performed, Afghanistan will be a safer, better, more prosperous country. The trouble is, public opinion in the United States still favours the use of force rather than reason. Although he is a well-regarded authority, Cappelli's eminently sensible article was rejected by 24 American newspapers before finding a home in US Italia.
There is a brief opportunity for a new start in Afghanistan. The Americans could rethink their whole approach; the British could restore their reputation, so battered in Iraq, and other Nato countries could show they can be something more than merely critics on the sidelines. Let us hope they get it right for a change. E-mail this to a friend

'Crisis on horizon' in UK universities
Sir Michael Bett: "A remedy must be found"
The higher education sector is heading for crisis unless more young people can be recruited and retained in academia, a senior academic warns. Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, Sir Michael Bett said the measures taken by the government to address the issue had been "more sticking plaster than strategic".
In a few years' time there will be too few of the right people in higher education, unless a remedy is found right now
Sir Michael Bett Sir Michael - author of a landmark report on higher education pay and conditions - said the sector's teaching profession was due for an exodus in 2005, when academics of the 1960s retired.
"There's a crisis on the horizon unless we get it right and bring the good young teachers and researchers through now, before 2005," he warned.
"You really do have to make sure you've got the right people teaching the right people in higher education.
"In a few years' time there will be too few of the right people in higher education, unless a remedy is found right now," Sir Michael said.
Poor pay
He also pointed to the problem of poor pay for academic staff.
Mr Packham says academics' work has increased
He cited the example of a lecturer, who - by the age of 28 - would have qualified and started on a salary of �18,000. He or she would compare themselves to their peers who had started on considerably more many years previously, Sir Michael said. "It's a daunting prospect for bright young students who would like to stay in academia - debt and relativity provide a disincentive." Changing role
Giving evidence to the committee alongside Sir Michael, David Packham, registrar of Aston University, highlighted the growing pressures on academic staff.
"Over the past 12 years student numbers in higher education have doubled," he said.
The new universities, in particular, had embraced the idea of widening participation, Mr Packham said, which often meant students needed more support. Support staff in universities and colleges were also hard to retain, especially in areas such as information technology, which in turn added to the burden on academic staff.
These key workers had suffered much of the brunt of efficiency savings, Sir Michael said, and should be paid more.
Fear of debt
On the broader point of student retention, Sir Michael told MPs there was not a culture in this country of young people building up debt.
"It may be that elsewhere in the world this has become a way of life, but there is still, I think, a fairly puritanical streak here.
Professor Beath views higher education as "a public investment"
"For a lot of families the prospect of their son or daughter building up a debt of something like �10,000 to �12,000 by the age of 21 is a really daunting thing and will continue to contribute to the failure to retain."
Professor John Beath, the Head of School of Social Sciences at the University of St Andrews, urged MPs to see higher education as "a public investment".
"There are large public benefits that flow form higher education - they're much greater than the private benefits.
"If people are having to borrow, they look only at the private benefits and the public benefits," Professor Beath said.
Mr Packam pointed to the need for better information for prospective students.
Some, from families with no history of sending their children to university, were put off because they thought they had to pay tuition fees, he said.
Tuition fees
On Tuesday the committee heard how increasing numbers of students were being thrown out of university because they had not paid their tuition fees.
The vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Professor Diana Green, said the number excluded for debt there had risen 17% since 1998, when fees were introduced, and fee-related debt has trebled.
There was "some evidence" that the same thing was happening at other
universities in the UK, she added.

Council secures 21 bus services
A council has stepped in to save 21 bus services in Essex after a bus company went into administration.Stansted Transit, which operates services in mid and north-west Essex called in administrators last week. Routes serving Maldon, Takely, Bishops Stortford, Saffron Walden, Colchester, Chelmsford and Harlow are affected. Essex County Council is now running the routes and said school bus services operated by the company will also continue to run. Services 1, 5, 7, 7A, 9/10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 21, 71C, 73A, 118, 133, 301, 306, 317, 318, 319, 347 and 392 will run according to their normal timetables. The council's passenger transport manager, Nick Roberts, said: "It was important that we stepped in to save these services and we have reacted quickly to the situation having new operators in position within hours. "All of these services will continue to operate as normal until a formal tender process takes place later in the summer." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Think-tank attacks city's rebirth
The report was critical of Glasgow's urban regeneration
Poorer parts of Scotland's largest city have been left behind by major regeneration projects, according to a new report.
Think-tank Demos found that high-profile regeneration programmes were failing to improve many people's quality of life.
The survey also found that many UK city leaders were running out of ideas to "deepen the urban renaissance". Glasgow City Council dismissed the report as "an insult to Glaswegians".
The report - The Dreaming City: Glasgow 2020 and the power of mass imagination - called for "mass-imagination" programmes to "capture the aspirations and creativity of citizens".
City leaders are running on empty in terms of ideas to sustain the urban renaissance
Melissa MeanDemos
It warned that without this, regeneration efforts which rely on iconic architecture, leisure and tourism would increase social division and erode trust and civic pride. Demos asked more than 5,000 Glaswegian residents to create a new shared vision for the future of their city. Schoolchildren, council tenants, company directors, cleaners, asylum seekers, single parents and teenagers were among those who took part. The report argued that recent UK urban regeneration was based on an unsustainable 'cultural arms race', with cities competing against each other to attract investment and tourism. New ideas
Melissa Mean, head of Demos' self build cities programme, said: "City leaders are running on empty in terms of ideas to sustain the urban renaissance. "When every city has commissioned a celebrity architect and pedestrianised a cultural quarter, distinctiveness is reduced to a formula.
"To find some new ideas and energy, instead of dry consultations which have pre-set boxes to be ticked, cities need to open up to the mass imagination of their citizens. Bizarre would be a charitable way to describe some of the report's conclusion
Glasgow City Council spokesman
"People in Glasgow showed that they have the creativity to imagine better and more innovative futures. Councils need to listen."
However, Glasgow City Council was scathing in its condemnation of the survey.
A spokesman said: "This report is nothing less than an insult to the many Glaswegians who gave up their time to take part. "Bizarre would be a charitable way to describe some of the report's conclusions. What on earth is meaningless nonsense such as 'assemblies of hope', 'alchemists' or 'mass imaginings'?
"Regeneration in Glasgow has meant new homes, schools and leisure facilities in every community. "That's something London-based academics who know nothing and care less about Glasgow may ignore, but means a huge amount to Glaswegians. "Of course, there is still a lot of work to do in the city. However, this will be done by investing in education, getting more people into work, and continuing to regenerate local communities, including more new housing."

US General Franks: Iraq war 'on track'
Updated 30 March 2003, 20.12
Coalition forces have made "truly remarkable" progress in Iraq says the US commander in charge of war plans.
Click here for all our Iraq stories and guides
General Tommy Franks
General Tommy Franks also angrily told reporters ground troops had not been ordered to stop making their way towards Baghdad.
There had been rumours they were forced to wait for supplies to catch up with them and that Iraqi fighting was stronger than they had expected.
He reported lots of progress was being made in other areas of Iraq too.
An attack by UK forces south east of Basra is still going on, but they are facing strong fighting from Iraqi soldiers.
A UK soldier was confirmed as killed in fighting there.
Elsewhere in southern Iraq, fresh water supplies were delivered by UN aid trucks which had driven up from Kuwait. Guard targets
Baghdad is bombarded
Meanwhile, Baghdad is being bombed day and night in some of the heaviest attacks since the war began.
Reporters there say they heard huge blasts around the southern areas of Baghdad. Lots of Saddam's loyal Republican Guards and specially trained Fedayeen - tough, unofficial soldiers - are based there.
Other main points:
UK forces have captured five Iraqi officers and killed a Republican Guard colonel in a raid on a village south of Basra
In northern Iraq, the UN children's agency Unicef are hoping to get aid supplies across the border with Turkey
A "massive terrorist facility" was attacked and destroyed by coalition forces in northern Iraq, General Tommy Franks says
US officials say they will change their methods to deal with the threat of more suicide bomb attacks.

Carling Cup as it happened
Chelsea 2-1 EvertonMatch report
GOALFLASHES AND MAJOR INCIDENTS (all times GMT)
606: DEBATE
Have your say on the action
To get involved use 606 or text us your views & comments on 81111. (Not all contributions can be used)
By Jonathan Stevenson
2145: So, that's that for tonight. I hope Fabio Capello was as impressed as I was. Shaun Wright-Phillips must be a dead cert for the Italian's first England squad, but Joleon Lescott might be struggling now. Join Caroline Cheese tomorrow for Arsenal v Tottenham - if you thought this one was feisty, you ain't seen nothing yet. Laters.
2144: Player Rater latest: Shaun Wright-Phillips head and shoulders above everyone else (especially Joleon Lescott), on 7.85. Claudio Pizarro is the villain of the piece, on a forgettable 4.95.Rate the players
2143: "Sorry Everton, but we're called "Top Four" for a reason."TheTruthabtFooty on 606Join the debate on 606
2142: "There is only one Avram Grant!"Dazza, via text
2140: What an incredible end to the game at Stamford Bridge. It looked as though Chelsea were there for the taking, but somehow they managed to find a winner and they hold the advantage going to the second leg at Goodison Park in 15 days time. Incidentally, the winner is officially being credited to Shaun Wright-Phillips, but I'd expect that to change.
2139: FULL-TIME Chelsea 2-1 Everton
2138: Joleon lescott has a great chance to equalise, put clean through by Tim Cahill, but he stumbles on the ball and then can only clip his shot straight at the advancing Hilario.
2136: GOAL Chelsea 2-1 EvertonJoleon Lescott has scored an own goal and Stamford Bridge erupts. Lescott was under massive pressure from Shaun Wright-Phillips at the back post, the little midfielder rising high to challenge the Everton defender in the air after Michael Ballack's looping left-wing cross.
2135: We are into the four minutes of stoppage time now.
2134: "Tactically, I think Avram Grant could never be among the good managers. He's always relied on the strength of the Chelsea squad, not tactics. Bringing on Sidwell for Cole at that time was wasteful, and unwise."KWEKU1 on 606Join the debate on 606
2132: Ricardo Carvalho heads wide from a Chelsea corner from the right. Meanwhile, Yakubu is taken off by David Moyes and Victor Anichebe comes on in his place.
2131: (Re 2124:) "I love the naivety of Chelsea fans. "Harsh red card" - it seems that everyone that supports Chelsea reads a different rulebook. That was a sending off if ever I saw one."Aaron, via text
2126: Claudio Pizarro is taken off after his less-than-spectacular display, with Paolo Ferreira brought on for Chelsea. Anyone would think Avram Grant's settling for a draw.
2125: "Like I said - a late Ballack winner."Yusuf_07 on 606Join the debate on 606
2124: "This seems like a familiar story for us this season. Periods of fine football undermined by a harsh red card and a goalkeeping blunder. How I miss the sense of invincibility we had under Jose. Our home supremacy is clearly at risk; if not tonight then soon - possibly, horror of horrors, at the hands of Spurs on Saturday."Jay, via text
2122: Phil Neville is a little lucky not to pick up his second booking of the evening for a clumsy challenge on Florent Malouda.
2120: Juliano Belletti sparks mayhem by hacking away at the legs of Joleon Lescott and he picks up a booking for his endeavours. Lescott is furious and runs after the former Barcelona right-back, but he escapes a yellow card.
2116: "I would love to be on the flight that takes Mikel, Yakubu and Yobo to the African Nations Cup. I wonder what they will be talking about?"redandblackT(1899 was a vintage year) on 606Join the debate on 606
2115: Joleon Lescott blocks off Juliano Belletti inside the Everton area and the Chelsea fans scream for a penalty, but nothing given.
2113: Oh my goodness me Everton nearly go in front. Yakubu expertly back-heels the ball on the left wing to send James McFadden away and he cuts in and gets near the byeline before his cross-shot clips the post and runs away to safety.
2110: "If Yakubu gets out of bed the right side, he's brilliant. If he doesn't, you're in trouble. I've managed players like him before."BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Graham Taylor
2109: Andy Johnson is booked for a late tackle on Ricardo Carvalho. After not booking Steve Sidwell, the referee's nightmare evening gets worse.
2108: GOAL Chelsea 1-1 EvertonYakubu absolutely hammers the ball into the top corner on the half-volley from 10 yards, after Hilario completely misses a James McFadden free-kick and Joseph Yobo directs the ball back across goal.
2106: Steve Sidwell nails Lee Carsley, a truly horrific tackle, leaving his studs on the back of Carsley's leg. That, in my book, is a straight red, no question. Sidwell is not even booked after a long talking to. Poor refereeing.
2105: "Yes, a year ago it would've been just a booking, but this year, it's a straight red, everyone knows it, so he shouldn't have gone in like that, Mikel has got no-one to blame but himself."Sebwinder on 606Join the debate on 606
2104: Joe Cole is taken off and Steve Sidwell comes on in his place.
2102: Magnificent stuff from Shaun Wright-Phillips. He gives the ball away to James McFadden, but brilliantly chases back and wins the ball back before sliding in Claudio Pizarro, but the Peruvian's horror show continues as he hits his 18-yard shot straight at Tim Howard.
2100: Things are hotting up. Chelsea now will not see Jon Mikel Obi again until the end of the African Cup of Nations. What a way to bow out. Steve Sidwell is being prepared, by the looks of things.
2058: SENT OFF Jon Mikel Obi is dismissed for a late, sliding tackle on Phil Neville. Dan, you were right about the ref.
2057: "It seems the Carling Cup has captured some magic while the FA Cup is struggling to recapture it."Top Edge on 606Join the debate on 606
2055: Now Joe Cole is booked for a foul on Joleon Lescott. "This ref's a bit card-happy isn't he Stevo?" says my gaffer Dan.
2054: Claudio Pizarro is snuffed out in the Everton box, but Chelsea are dominant here and they look far more likely to grab the next goal.
2052: Phil Neville is the next man in the book and again it seems a touch harsh, the Toffees skipper cautioned for clipping the ankles of Florent Malouda.
2051: "For me, it is essential that we score a second goal and win this game 2-0 or by a two-goal margin, because Everton are not bad at home."Chels' - in the blood on 606Join the debate on 606
2049: Shaun Wright-Phillips has another chance after a fine one-touch Chelsea passing move, but his 18-yard shot is straight down Tim Howard's throat.
2049: We're off again. No changes as yet.
2048: "Everton will come on stronger in the second half of this. 1-1 with McFadden to score."Jonathan and Martin at Stamford Bridge, via text
2046: "No worries, Cahill will score an overhead kick again - 1-1 final score."mdfactor on 606Join the debate on 606
2041: "I reckon that when Chelsea got Pizzaro for nothing they were ripped off. He's atrocious."Phil, Lincolnshire, via text
2037: "How great is Ballack? He seems more settled so far this season and will be very significant in the remainder of the season."abrighterview on 606Join the debate on 606
2035: Looking at the Player Rater chat so far, Shaun Wright-Phillips is miles out in front on 7.68. Tony Hibbert is really struggling at the moment, with a paltry 5.31.Rate the players
2032: HALF-TIME Chelsea 1-0 Everton
2031: Andy Johnson finds some space to get his head on the end of a corner, but he can only nod well wide from 12 yards out.
2030: "Everton don't need to hang on, they need to score here because Chelsea will without a doubt score at Goodison Park. Many teams have drawn 0-0 or lost 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in two-legged ties against Chelsea, only to go on and lose their home leg or go out on away goals."PulpGrape on 606Join the debate on 606
2028: Michael Ballack goes for an acrobatic finish just inside the Everton area, but Phil Neville just gets in there and prevents the German getting his shot away.
2027: "Shaun is going to be a massive player for us over the next few months."Edward, Chelsea fan, via text
2026: "What's the point of Claudio Pizarro?"dunne_and_dusted on 606Join the debate on 606
2025: "Too many English players in the Everton team. They need more foreigners."Novelo on 606Join the debate on 606
2023: Great work by Everton. James McFadden slips in Joleon Lescott inside the Chelsea box on the left, but his cross is too close to Hilario, with Tim Cahill, Andy Johnson and Yakubu all waiting for a ball across the six-yard box. That's why Lescott should be playing centre-half, not left-back.
2021: In case you didn't know, new England manager Fabio Capello is among the crowd in west London.
2019: "I'm really impressed with Shaun Wright-Phillips playing in this role more infield. He's not playing wide, he's getting involved in the play all the time and he looks like he's really enjoying himself."BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Graham Taylor
2017: Tony Hibbert is booked for a foul on Florent Malouda as Chelsea up the tempo once more. Everton are struggling to live with them at the moment.
2014: Nearly 2-0. Joe Cole runs half the length of the pitch and his shot is saved by Tim Howard as he surges into the area. Referee Peter Walton gives Chelsea a free-kick on the edge of the box for Phil Jagiekla's attempt to win the ball off Cole and from the resulting set-piece, Michael Ballack curls fractionally wide. Phew!
2013: "Excellent goal. But absolutely torrid defending. Wright-Philips had all the time in the world to pick his spot."JohanMourinho on 606Join the debate on 606
2012: GOAL Chelsea 1-0 EvertonShaun Wright-Phillips puts the hosts ahead with a nice turn and finish in-off the post from 12 yards after he was played in by Florent Malouda. Good goal, but where was the marking?
2010: "Drogba has already been out. There's too much expectation at Chelsea. This is a transition season."Don, London, via text
2006: Everton are getting into some good wide areas, but their crossing is utterly hopeless so far. Joleon Lescott this time is the culprit, down the left.
2003: "It seems as if Chelsea's attack is non-existent. How the season could fall apart without Drogba for a month."Anonymous, via text
2001: "Pizzaro is useless. Bring on Ben Sahar!"Bluestopfan on 606Join the debate on 606
1959: Ooooooooooooohhhhh. Juliano Belletti nails a shot from the right-hand edge of the penalty area which screams narrowly high and wide of Tim Howard's goal. It's a lively start for a first leg game, no doubt about it.
1957: Yakubu strolls past Alex as if he isn't there, but Mikel Jon Obi gets back quickly to nip the danger in the bud.
1954: Lee Carsley is booked for a late challenge on Florent Malouda. Seemed a bit harsh, to be fair to Carso. Michael Ballack gets away with a warning for sliding in late on Phil Neville after the whistle had blown.
1953: "Does anyone else think that David Moyes looks like Moe from The Simpsons?"Harvey, Liverpool, via text
1952: James McFadden plays Phil Neville in down the right, but the Everton captain's cross is woeful and it bounces out for a goalkick. Why on earth is he playing right-wing?
1951: "Jeez, looks like it's very windy down there at the moment. I think it could very well be a factor."toffees1888 (Irish evertonian of TBBCOE) on 606Join the debate on 606
1949: Half-chance at the other end and the ball falls nicely for Shaun Wright-Phillips, but his shot from the edge of the box is horribly sliced and it flies miles wide.
1948: First sniff for the visitors, Yakubu plays a ball over the top for Andy Johnson, but Hilario races to the edge of his area to gather just ahead of the England striker.
1946: Andy Johnson and Lee Carsley get us under way at Stamford Bridge.
1944: "Wayne Bridge one of the best left-backs? Laughable... I bet Grant had his serious face on as well when he said that."unitedforevernever on 606Join the debate on 606
1943: The teams are out to a rapturous ovation at Stamford Bridge. They're ready - are you?
1942: "I think Everton will be more focused after the weekend's nightmare, 2-0 to the Toffees."Chris, Middle East, via text
1939: Avram Grant says Ashley Cole was fit for tonight's game, but he picked Wayne Bridge to play left-back instead. "They are the two best left-backs in England and they must both play regularly," said the Israeli.
1935: David Moyes is in cracking form in his pre-match chat. He's asked about the weekend's FA Cup defeat at Oldham. "Is that your first question, really?" jokes the Scot. "What about four wins in your last five away games then?" asks the interviewer. "That's a better first question, isn't it?" Moyes replies. He certainly doesn't seem nervous, anyway.
1931: "I think McFadden will definitely get on the scoresheet. I also feel a blunder from Hilario is on the cards."Pete, Edinburgh, via text
1929: "I predict 2-0 Chelsea. Though I'd prefer Everton to win and then win the cup cos I always feel better losing to the team that won the cup Unless it was a final of course. Then I'd be gutted."Join the debate on 606
1927: Paul Fletcher, who will be writing a brilliant match report on tonight's game, informs me that the last time Everton beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge was on 26 November 1994, when Paul Rideout notched the winner in a 1-0 victory.
1925: BBC Sport's Alan Hansen is sitting on the fence for this one. "It will be a lot tighter than people are expecting," said the three-times League Cup winner. "This tie is too close to call".Hansen on the Carling Cup
1922: "I believe Phil Neville. He is a fundamental part of the Everton team. At Man United he defined bit part."Graeme, Glasgow, via text
1920: "I reckon Everton will nick this one 1-2. Chelsea have got no-one who can replace Drogba and they look shaky at the back without Terry and Cech."James, York, via text 1919: Chelsea's Joe Cole seems bang up for it. "Everton are a brilliant side. It's a great challenge, but we've got to go and win on Tuesday," said the England winger. Could be a tasty one tonight.
1916: Everton skipper Phil Neville says leading the club out at Wembley would "probably be the best thing that has happened in my career". That's six-times Premier League winner, three-times FA Cup winner and Champions League winner Phil Neville. So, do you believe him?
1914: "What do you think the score will be? I reckon anything better than 1-0 will be ideal for Chelsea, but I can see Everton doing well - 1-1."Return to the Shed - 72 on 606Join the debate on 606
I reckon it'll be 1-1 as well. Though I'm hoping for 4-4, obviously. Scorers? Pizarro and McFadden.
1912: "I think Chelsea will win by a goal from Ballack because he is a good player."Tom, Rugby, via text
It gets no more simple than that.
1909: Team news in full:
Chelsea: Hilario, Belletti, Alex, Carvalho, Bridge, Wright-Phillips, Obi, Ballack, Malouda, Joe Cole, Pizarro.
Everton: Howard, Hibbert, Yobo, Jagielka, Lescott, Cahill, Neville, Carsley, McFadden, Johnson, Yakubu.
1908: Some early team news, with Chelsea's Ricardo Carvalho back after suspension and Jon Mikel Obi plays too, while Joseph Yobo is fit to start for Everton.
1904: Remember, it's easy to get involved. Simply text on 81111, or join the debate on 606. It's not rocket science, and you don't have to be Iain Dowie.Join the debate on 606
1902: So, what price a 'cupset' at the Bridge tonight? Well, Chelsea are about as well-acquainted with losing at home as Fabio Capello is with the English language. It's now 55 games in all competitions since they lost at home, a 2-1 defeat to Barcelona. Domestically-speaking, it's 92 matches since Patrick Vieira and Edu bagged and the Gooners did them 2-1 in the Premier League.Chelsea 1-2 BarcelonaChelsea 1-2 Arsenal
1900: Forget the Cup with a capital 'C'. It's all about England's second favourite knockout competition tonight. We're down to the last four and Stamford Bridge is the venue for Part I of Chelsea versus Everton.

England Saxons 17-13 NZ Maori
England Saxons came from behind to lift the Churchill Cup England Saxons (7) 17Tries: Sackey, Voyce, Croft Cons: Barkley
NZ Maori (5) 13Tries: Tahana, KawauPens: Ellison England's second-string Saxons side edged New Zealand Maori 17-13 to win the Churchill Cup at Twickenham.
The Saxons trailed with less than five minutes to go before replacement lock Tom Croft outpaced the cover on the right wing to score the winner.
The hosts led 7-5 at the break after a converted try from Paul Sackey against Anthony Tahana's score for the Maori.
Tom Voyce and Kiwi Jason Kawau swapped second-half tries but a penalty gave the Maori the edge before Croft struck.
"We've said it all along, the reason for the Saxons is as a breeding ground for the first team," said Saxons coach Mallinder.
"There are players who have certainly shown me that they are capable of playing at international level.
We started to panic kick and gave their full-back [Cipriani] a chance to get himself in the game, and he came good
Maori coach Steve Howarth
"The side has grown over the last three weeks. Defensively we've been great throughout and today we were outstanding."
Maori assistant coach Shane Howarth said: "We were very, very flat and every time we got momentum seemed to turn the ball over. They were more cohesive as a team.
"We started to panic kick and gave their full-back (Danny Cipriani) a chance to get himself in the game, and he came good."
The two-week competition also featured the USA, Canada, Scotland A and Ireland A.
An absorbing opening set the tone for a tight, physical match punctuated by moments of individual brilliance from the likes of Wasps' 19-year-old full-back Danny Cipriani and Maori captain Rua Tipoki.
England went ahead on 17 minutes when fly-half Olly Barkley retrieved a long line-out throw deep in Maori territory and sparked a move which put Sackey into the right corner.
Despite going behind, the Maori bristled with intent but were let down by Tamati Ellison, who missed two penalty attempts in quick succession.
Ellison's inaccuracy nearly cost his side dear when England went close after a good running from Voyce and Cipriani.
But the New Zealanders finally crossed when centre Tipoki set off on a jinking break before putting in Tahana in the left corner.
Ellison missed the conversion but made amends with his first successful penalty shot shortly after the break.
But almost instantly, the Saxons hit back after full-back Cipriani received Nils Mordt's long pass and drew his man to send Voyce into the left corner.
Barkley missed the conversion and the game entered a phase of stalemate before the Maori rumbled over with centre Kawau to retake the lead on 57 minutes.
The Maori sensed an opportunity and went close again after another Tipoki break.
But Saxons had their own stars and Cipriani almost carved his way through late on before Wasps team-mate Sackey launched a counter which was finished off in sensational, match-winning style by the pace of Croft on the right wing.
England Saxons: Cipriani; Sackey, Sorrell, Mordt, Voyce; Barkley, Wigglesworth; Hatley (capt), Paice, Brooks, Blaze, Evans, Haskell, Skinner, Dowson. Replacements: Thompson, Forster, Mercey, Croft, Crane, Dickson, Erinle.
NZ Maori: Paku; H Gear, Sweeny, Tipoki (capt), Tahana; Ellison, Smylie; West, De Malamanche, May, Ormsy, Triggs, MacDonald, Latimer, Smith. Replacements: Mahoney, Hoani, Ross, Waldrom, Rodley, Bruce, Te Whare
