Jolie donates to Pearl foundation
Pitt and Jolie are shooting the film in the Indian city of Pune
Hollywood couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have donated $100,000 (ï¿½54,000) to a foundation set up in the name of murdered US reporter Daniel Pearl.
The pair, who are in India making a film based on the journalist's life, made the donation on what would have been Mr Pearl's 43rd birthday.
Jolie plays his wife Mariane in A Mighty Heart, which is being produced by Pitt's company Plan B.
Mr Pearl was abducted and killed while on assignment in Pakistan in 2002.
The charity, founded in the wake of his death, observed his birthday on Tuesday with a series of musical events around the world.
Jolie recently said that she was "disappointed" that the film could not be made in Pakistan due to safety concerns.
'Shocking'
Meanwhile, Jolie has accused Western governments of trying to shut out refugees, stating that more than 7,000 migrants have died during the past year in their attempts to enter Europe.
The actress, who is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), told the organisation's magazine Refugees of how a picture showing a couple sunbathing on a beach close to the washed-up body of an African man had affected her.
"We'll never know who he was or why he ended up there and the couple on the beach apparently couldn't care less," said Jolie in the article.
She added that her experiences of meeting refugees had been "a truly humbling experience, a shocking eye-opener".
"It has made me realise that we are all - myself included - behaving like the couple sitting under their umbrella on the beach, gazing studiously out to sea," she added.

Hostage recalls 'hail of gunfire'
Giuliana Sgrena is a veteran war correspondent
Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena has described how she came under a "hail of gunfire" moments after being released from her Iraqi abductors in Baghdad.
Ms Sgrena, who was wounded in the incident, has been sent to a military hospital in Rome for an operation.
She denied US military accounts that the car was speeding past a checkpoint when it was fired upon.
The body of Italian security agent Nicola Calipari, who died in the incident, has now arrived in Rome.
He will be given a state funeral on Monday, and a street in the centre of the city has already been named after him. US President George W Bush has pledged to fully investigate the shooting.
Ms Sgrena was abducted on 4 February. It is unclear how she was released.
Some Italian press reports say a ransom was paid.
'Terrible thing'
Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, one of President Bush's staunchest allies, has demanded to know why US troops fired on the car carrying Ms Sgrena to safety. "There was suddenly this shooting, we were hit by a hail of gunfire, and I was speaking with Nicola, who was telling me about what had been happening in Italy in the meantime, when he leaned towards me, probably also to protect me," Ms Sgrena told Rai radio. "I was especially shocked because we thought that by then the danger was past," she said.
There was suddenly this shooting, we were hit by a hail of gunfire

"And then he collapsed and I realised that he was dead." She said the shooting continued "because the driver wasn't even managing to explain that we were Italian". "So, it was a really terrible thing."
Asked if the car was going too fast when the US troops opened fire, she said: "We weren't going particularly fast given that type of situation."
This is a serious diplomatic incident between the US and Italy, says the BBC's David Willey in Rome.
President Bush has telephoned Mr Berlusconi to offer his condolences and apologies. He "assured Prime Minister Berlusconi that it would be fully investigated," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan.
No celebration
The prime minister and other dignitaries joined family members to welcome Ms Sgrena to Rome's Ciampino airport.
Walking slowly and with some help, a tired Ms Sgrena struggled to a waiting ambulance.
Her left-wing newspaper Il Manifesto says a peace rally will be held in Rome later on Saturday. Ms Sgrena's colleagues cheered the initial news of her release The death of one of Italy's most senior intelligence officers in the shooting cast a pall of gloom over what should have been a joyous occasion, says our Rome correspondent. Mr Calipari is being portrayed as a national hero in Saturday's Italian press for his courage in saving Ms Sgrena's life.
A little-known militant group, Islamic Jihad Organisation, had said it kidnapped Giuliana Sgrena and demanded that Italy withdraw its troops from Iraq.
The same group said in September it had killed two Italian aid workers, Simona Torretta and Simona Pari - but they were later released by another organisation.

Net freedom fears 'hurt terror fight'
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says "naive" campaigners against stronger internet surveillance laws have hurt the anti-terror fight.
He suggested that with stronger powers, the security services might have detected some of the 11 suicide hijackers who are now known to have passed through the UK on their way to the US.
The most fundamental civil liberty is the right to life and preserving that and sustaining that must come before others
Jack Straw
Mr Straw also repeated warnings that prime terrorist suspect Osama Bin Laden and his followers - whom he compared to the Nazis - could be planning further outrages.
"We don't know exactly where. On the one hand, none of us wish to raise anxiety in the minds of the public, but we would be complacent and irresponsible not to warn of the risks," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.
It was Mr Straw's successor as home secretary, David Blunkett, who disclosed that some of those responsible for the attacks on New York and Washington could have previously been in the UK.
Hijackers in Britain
There is conflicting media speculation about the length of their stay and whether any associates are still on the loose in Britain. But Mr Straw reacted forcibly when challenged by Today over why the 11 had gone undetected.
He said he had tried, through the recent Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, to allow the security services to de-encrypt commercially encrypted (scrambled) e-mails.
It wasn't Big Brother government, it was government trying to put in place increased powers so that we could preserve our democracy against this new kind of threat
Jack Straw
"What happened? Large parts of the industry, backed by some people who I think will now recognise they were very naive in retrospect, said: 'You mustn't do that'.
"The pressure was so great that we and the United States... had to back down a bit.
"Now, I hear people saying 'why were these terrorists here' - well, the answer is not because of any lapse by the intelligence or security services or the police, but because people have had a two-dimensional view of civil liberties.
"The most fundamental civil liberty is the right to life and preserving that and sustaining that must come before others."
However, despite his predecessor's comments, Mr Blunkett later told BBC Radio 4's World at One that "even with the best legislation and will in the world you can't apprehend everyone who passes through an international airport on their way to somewhere else".
Terrorist threat
Asked if the hijackers would have been picked up had stronger powers to read e-mails or monitor phone calls been in place, Mr Blunkett replied that it would unlikely if they were just passing through a UK airport, but that a combination of new measures might be able to track it.
The home secretary also took the opportunity to reassure the public that Britain did not "imminently" face a terrorist attack despite the global threat.
"We are putting in place the necessary security at every point, whether that's for particular facilities, whether it's securing ourselves against internal or external attack."
David Blunkett: Every precaution being taken
Groups that opposed Mr Straw's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act also sounded a note of caution following his critical comments.
John Wadham, director of civil liberties group Liberty, warned that any curtailing of freedoms "for no good reason" would be a victory for
those behind the 11 September attacks.
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said "If the government think that a law only just on the statute book needs changing literally a few months later, then they must come back with the argument and evidence." The Confederation of British Industry said a balance between fighting terrorism and the right to privacy for commercially sensitive information had to be found.
Meanwhile the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, has warned any new anti-terror measures must take the Human Rights Act into account.
"We are a country governed by the law and we mustn't allow the stresses and tensions, which are understandable, to deflect us from that," he told BBC Radio 4's Law in Action programme.

Straw optimistic on UN resolution
The Security Council is still deeply divided on Iraq
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says he is optimistic about the prospect of securing a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq. I know that the progress has been slow, for sure, but it has genuinely been constructive
Jack Straw
Mr Straw said there had been a genuine "meeting of minds" among the members of the UN security council on the issue. And although progress had been "slow" towards a resolution backing the desire to disarm Saddam Hussein with the threat of force, Mr Straw said he was confident of securing a "positive" outcome.
Chancellor Gordon Brown has signalled he is building the possibility of war with Iraq into his Budget plans next month.
Mr Straw's optimism about a UN resolution are in contrast to signals coming from Washington, where patience with efforts to get France and Russia to sign up to a new resolution appears to be running out.
Threat of force
The United Nations' chief weapons inspector Hans Blix has flown to Washington, where he is expected to meet US Vice-President Dick Cheney and other senior administration officials.
They will discuss a draft UN resolution sponsored by the US and Britain, which threatens Iraq with "serious consequences" if it fails to co-operate with arms inspections.
France and Russia oppose any language that could be interpreted as authorising automatic military action.
The UN Security Council is due to resume discussions on the draft later on Wednesday.
'Going it alone'
US Secretary of State Colin Powell said there would have to be a decision on a new UN resolution "in the very near future".
Hans Blix says some sort of pressure on Iraq is needed
BBC News has been told Washington is not ruling out the possibility that a vote on a resolution may not now take place until next week - after the mid-term elections on 5 November. Meanwhile, Jack Straw repeated his assertion that the UK would be prepared to back the US, if it decided to "go it alone" against Iraq.
'Preferable outcome'
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Straw said: "We don't rule that out."
But he added: "It is the UN that as a whole has been defied by Iraq and it is the UN, therefore, which has a responsibility to deal with that.
"If they fail to in their responsibility, then others may have to take up that responsibility in their place."
Mr Straw said "the preferable outcome" was for the UN to agree to a new tough resolution giving power to weapons inspectors.
'Slow progress'
He said the inspectors had to be allowed to "inspect and remove" the "weapons of mass destruction which we know Saddam Hussein has", and to back that by "credible use of force". Mr Straw added: "I know that the progress has been slow, for sure, but it has genuinely been constructive. "And I think - I can't be certain about this, you never can at this stage in negotiations - I think that the final outcome will be a good one." He said when the "history of the last eight weeks" was written people would see there had been a "genuine meeting of minds" between the five members of the UN Security Council.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor has asked Chancellor Gordon Brown to release the Treasury's prediction of how an Iraq war could affect the UK economy.
In his reply, Mr Brown said the Treasury would update its predictions about the economy and public finances in the pre-Budget statement, expected next month.
"These projections will of course take into account all available information, including that relating to the global economy and oil prices, and include a full assessment of the risks to outlook," said Mr Brown.
