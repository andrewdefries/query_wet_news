UN warns of Angolan catastrophe
Displaced people are heavily dependent on food aid
The United Nations World Food Programme, which has suspended food aid flights in Angola after planes came under rebel attack, says the whole international humanitarian operation in the country is being put at risk. The WFP representative in the central town of Kuito, Peter Rodrigues, said the situation there was likely to become catastrophic if there were no food flights for the next week or two. The UN agency cancelled all aid flights in Angola until further notice after a missile was fired at a WFP plane for the second time in a week.
Attacks like this are usually blamed on the rebel Unita movement, which has admitted shooting at one of the planes.
A spokesman for the Unita rebels, Joffre Justino, told the BBC that there was no food in the agency's planes, only weapons and soldiers, and he said the aircraft were legitimate targets. He said that if the UN pressed the Angolan Government to stop the war, the food problems would be solved.
No-one has admitted responsibility for the more recent attack in which a missile narrowly missed another aid plane. Angolans in Kuito queuing for aid handouts UN officials met Angolan Government representatives on Tuesday morning, hoping to obtain security commitments such as a safe air corridor that might have allowed the flights to resume.
But WFP spokeswoman Cristina Muller told the BBC that the UN had been unable to secure the security guarantees it had been hoping for.
More than a million Angolans rely on emergency aid - most of them displaced by a civil war, which has continued for more than 25 years.
With land travel inside Angola hindered by fighting and landmines, international agencies use aircraft to deliver aid.
The BBC correspondent in Luanda, Justin Pearce, says that while some areas have food stocks to last several weeks, the Central Highland area of Angola is particularly vulnerable. More than 1,000 children have been admitted to therapeutic feeding centres
The town of Kuito, where more than 200,000 people depend on international handouts for survival, has only enough food to last until the end of the week.
The number of people requiring emergency assistance has increased dramatically in recent months.
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has called on the international community to put pressure on Unita to end the civil war. Mr Dos Santos, who is on a visit to Belgium, told journalists that the international community should increase pressure on Unita to observe the 1994 Lusaka peace accord. He also said Belgium had agreed to monitor the trade of illegal diamonds from Angola. Unita is believed to be funding the war from diamond smuggling. Last week its leader, Jonas Savimbi, admitted that United Nations sanctions against his movement were a major setback. Search BBC News Online

Clue to stopping killer viruses
Retroviruses insert their genetic material into healthy cells
Scientists believe they may have found a new way to fight diseases like Aids and some forms of leukaemia. Researchers in the United States say they have identified a chemical, which may be able to stop so-called retroviruses in their tracks. These viruses spread by permanently inserting their genetic material into healthy cells. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the chemical may prevent this.
Most retroviruses are difficult to treat not least because they permanently change the genetic make-up of cells. Harmless viruses
However, humans and animals can carry harmless retroviruses - viruses that have evolved over time and pose no threat to health. A team of scientists from across the US carried out tests on sheep as part of this latest study.
We need to understand more about how this works
Dr Massimo Palmarini,University of Georgia
They compared a retrovirus that causes lung cancer in sheep with some of the harmless retroviruses they also harbour. They identified a harmless retrovirus that is very similar to the virus that causes lung cancer in sheep. This virus was unable to spread and to infect healthy cells because its viral particles were incapable of escaping from the host cell in the first place. The scientists discovered that an amino acid called tryptophan was responsible.
But they also discovered that this retrovirus, called enJS56A1, interferes with the virus that causes lung cancer in sheep. While much more research is needed, the scientists said the discovery could lead to new treatments to fight retroviruses. "It could have applications," Dr Massimo Palmarini of Georgia University, who led the study, told BBC News Online. "But I would be cautious. We need to understand more about how this works. There may be subtle differences between different retroviruses. But it has potential."
Dr Dinean Pillay, an honorary consultant at University College London, said there was extensive research into retroviruses as part of efforts to tackle HIV. "There are many human retroviruses," he told BBC News Online. "HIV is the most severe in terms of the number of cases worldwide.
"The problem with retroviruses is that they become embedded into the cell and into the human genome. "It can last there for a long time without the cell producing the virus. But as long as that happens, then we haven't been able to beat it."

Ratko Mladic's very personal war
With the capture of the Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic, the BBC's Paul Martin recalls trying to track him down, in this despatch for radio first broadcast in 2008.
Gen Mladic led Bosnian Serb troops throughout the 1992-1995 war
Thick-set guards with walkie talkies and body armour blocked the way to the front gate. I was walking towards a two-storey villa in a leafy suburb of Belgrade, the house that I was pretty sure was sheltering one of Eastern Europe's most notorious indicted war criminals, General Ratko Mladic. "This is diplomatic property," said one of the guards in good English, as he thrust me hard up against a jeep. After a few messages his walkie-talkie crackled again and they released me, with a warning that next time I would not be so lucky. That was 2002, just after the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was put on trial in The Hague for orchestrating the Bosnian war. A lady told me she would often see Gen Mladic strolling in a park, close to a big military base, with his sweet little dog. But soon after my visit he disappeared again - presumably protected by elements of the Serb military, some of whom still saw him as a patriotic hero. Expressionless eyesI had met the general several times before. The last encounter was in the mid-1990s on top of a mountain that, despite a supposed ceasefire, he and his armed band of Serb militiamen had just captured from Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) fighters. He was standing with an air of triumph on his large round face. He was handing over the mountain, near the city of Sarajevo, to the United Nations' forces in a bizarre Serb-imposed ceremony on a ski slope beside two cable cars. More than 7,000 Bosniak men and youths were killed in Srebrenica
The city, you will recall, had been the venue for the 1984 Winter Olympics. On the mountain peak Gen Mladic gave us our long-promised interview, pledging he would conquer all of Sarajevo soon, and walked to a helicopter camouflaged nearby. "Oh," I said. "I thought all sides agreed to the United Nations ban on using any form of aircraft in this war?" The general stared at me with his expressionless blue eyes and his thick-set jaw got even thicker. "The commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces does not ride on a donkey," he said. And seconds later he was airborne. Personal vendettaGen Mladic could hardly hide his contempt for the international figures who were trying to keep this war from getting even worse. He would deliberately mispronounce the name of the European Union's chief envoy David Owen, for example. He called him David O-van, which means David the Sheep in Serbo-Croat. He would take any visitor on a trip around his home village in Bosnia and show them every location where he said 101 people from his own extended family had lived before they were, he said, slaughtered by a pro-Nazi band of Muslim fighters during World War II. Yes, this war was personal. Gen Mladic had served in the Yugoslav army so long he knew many of the commanders on the opposing Bosnian Muslim and Croat sides. He would even radio them - their ex-Yugoslav army walkie talkies all had the same frequency - and ask about their health, their wives, their children, then inform them: "In 10 minutes we're gonna knock you guys to hell and back," or some such wording. Bad tasteHis relationship with the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic - who is now being tried at The Hague - was somewhat uneasy. I once asked him, as the two men stood together, who took orders from whom. "I report to him," said Gen Mladic. "But I am in command of fighting this war." Mr Karadzic gave the impression he found the fighting somewhat distasteful. The UN has charged Mr Karadzic and Gen Mladic with genocide I once heard him screaming for silence from a group of drunken Serb fighters as they sang war songs and let off volleys of gunfire from the back of their armoured vehicle as it pulled up near his headquarters in Pale, another former ski resort overlooking besieged Sarajevo. Mr Karadzic was obsessed by the rule of the Turkish Ottoman empire, which he thought was being re-imposed, and cursed the Americans for supporting the side of the Muslims. One day he insisted we fly with him by helicopter to see what he called a massacre of Serb villagers by marauding Muslim fighters. The helicopter ducked and dived to avoid potential ground fire. Mr Karadzic seemed unwell, he cowered in his seat, blocking both ears with his hands. His loyal wife Liljana put her hands in front of our camera and ordered us not to film him in that position. "The world does not need to blame him for getting air sick as well," she said. When we landed we found 28 Serb bodies, all men of fighting age, laid out in Vlasenica's town square. Mr Karadzic turned to our camera and said: "If this goes on, I think there will not be many Muslims left in Bosnia." A foretaste of the ethnic cleansing that was to become the grim hallmark of the war. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

BBC News | UK POLITICS | Tories deny U-turn over Tube sale

Tories deny U-turn over Tube sale
The future of the Tube is currently uncertain
The Conservatives have shifted their policy over the future of London's Underground and say privatisation is no longer their priority.
Instead backing is being given to Bob Kiley, the capital's Transport Commissioner, who has condemned the government's public-private partnership (PPP) proposal for the Tube as "fatally flawed".
The crisis of London Underground is the jewel in the crown of Labour's transport failures
Bernard Jenkin The Tories are pledging a Tube "recovery plan" including better management, long term planning and access to funds for network improvements - but would also demand a 'no-strike' agreement from staff as a precondition.
Although the party has previously fully supported privatisation shadow transport minister Bernard Jenkin told BBC News Online: "This is not a U-turn."
"We are not ruling out privatisation for the Tube at some stage in the future but the priority and the agenda at the moment is Mr Kiley."
Ministers 'pig-headed'
The Tories are emphasising Mr Kiley's experience - he helped turn round New York's subway system - and say they want to ensure he stays in London and delivers a better Tube service.
Whether that was in the public or private sector was "neither here nor there", Mr Jenkin insisted.
He added: "The government's pig-headed stubbornness has left the Tube without a penny of private investment over the last four years."
Bob Kiley: Damning verdict on Labour's plans
According to The Guardian newspaper, advisers to party leader William Hague believe "events have moved on" since the privatisation policy was drawn up by John Redwood, then shadow environment secretary, in 1999.
Mr Redwood's plan was to give passengers and workers shares in the Underground with the aim of saving government an estimated �750m a year in subsidies.
London Mayor Ken Livingstone hired Mr Kiley to overhaul the tube network, but he says his plans have been blocked by Chancellor Gordon Brown.
Mr Kiley wants to retain unified management control of the Underground in public hands if Labour's planned part-privatisation goes ahead, leaving private companies to deal with day-to-day operations of the lines.
But this week he said the chancellor has blocked any agreement which does not give the private firms ultimate control over their operations.
Policy details
Giving details of the Tory re-think, Mr Jenkin said: "We accept that the present state of the London Underground means that the prospect of privatisation is beyond the time horizon of our forthcoming election manifesto. "The immediate priority is a recovery plan - better management, long term planning and access to funds for renewal of trains and infrastructure - to rescue the Tube from collapse."
He said Mr Kiley's commitment to London presented the Tube with "a new opportunity".
"We are prepared to set aside previous policy positions in order to maximise this opportunity." The next Conservative government would work to reach an agreement with Transport for London for the ongoing financing of the Tube. No-strike agreement
A stable financial proposal would be aimed at allowing managers to plan for maintenance and investment free from day-to-day political interference. But, as a precondition, the Tories would seek a 'no- strike' agreement with Underground staff and the unions. The Liberal Democrats said the Conservative move meant they had joined Mr Kiley, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, the unions and the public in seeing the flaws in part-privatisation - leaving ministers isolated.
"Surely it is time for the Chancellor to abandon his discredited
part-privatisation. PPP for the Tube is now clearly a minority interest," said transport spokesman Tom Brake. "Where there is a monopoly in public transport, it is vital that passenger safety is put before profit."
The risk of further strikes by Underground staff has grown after the Rail Maritime and Transport Union announced plans to ballot its 7,500 members on whether to launch a wave of strikes in mid-March.
The action is part of a continuing row over job security, safety and staffing levels under the proposed PPP.

The Return of the King premiere was fab!
Updated 01 December 2003, 10.43
Lord of the Rings fan Thomas lives in New Zealand.
Here he reports on the atmosphere at the Return of the King world premiere.
"After school on Monday I walked from school and met my Mum to join the crowds at the big screening of LOTR: Return of the King. It felt to me like half of the country was there!
It was hot and as we walked through all the people on Courtenay Place I could see everyone was very excited.
Some were dressed up in costumes - including me. I dressed up in a cape with a fur hood but it got too hot so I took it off!
Frodo plane flew low
Thomas
We were near the red carpet. As there was so many people there I could only see what was going on from the massive screens. But I did manage to see the 747 plane that flew really low over us with Frodo painted on the side. As a New Zealander I am very proud of director Peter Jackson - I think he did a brilliant job on the last film. And it will be brilliant to see my favourite character, Legolas, in the film which I'll be going to see on Christmas Eve. I can't wait!"

Benitez job safe says Reds chief
The Liverpool manager seems to have got the thumbs up - for now
Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has been handed long-term job assurances by the club's managing director ahead of Sunday's game with Manchester United.Pressure has been mounting on the Spaniard following a miserable run of four successive defeats. But Christian Purslow told Sportsweek: "Liverpool are on a long-term journey and you do not do that by worrying about short term results. "Rafa Benitez is absolutely central to that long-term plan." Despite an impressive start to the season, the Reds have plummeted to eighth in the Premier League and are wobbling in the Champions League, with some reports suggesting Benitez could be sacked if they lost Sunday's match with United.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. However, Purslow, appointed in the summer, believes the club will turn things around and guaranteed that Benitez would still be in charge at the end of the season, regardless of trophies won. "The core of the team that won 86 points last season remains intact with some excellent additions and so I've got every reason to believe we can perform at that level over the season," he added. "The most important aspect of the club I was involved in in my first week in the job was securing Rafa for another five years. "You only have to look at the Premiership era and our two major competitors in the last 10 to 12 years to see the benefits of longevity." He also said that Spanish striker Fernando Torres and Argentine midfielder Javier Mascherano were happy at Anfield, despite suggestions the pair were keen on leaving.

A Liverpool victory would bring calm to the troubles and a United win would inflict potentially fatal damage on a club Ferguson still sees as huge rivals
BBC Sport's Phil McNulty
Benitez's side are seven points behind United and with four straight defeats in all competitions, including two in the league, Liverpool are enduring their worst run of results in 22 years. The Anfield club have not lost five in a row for 56 years and their hopes of winning a first league title since 1990 appear to be receding. However United manager Sir Alex Ferguson refused to be drawn on Benitez's future. "I'm not going into that at all. I'm not interested in Liverpool. I'm only concerned about what we do on Sunday. We are consistent and that is important," he added. United's Michael Owen, meanwhile, has received backing from Ferguson as the striker prepares to return to his former club after quitting Anfield in 2004 for Real Madrid. Ferguson snapped up Owen on a free transfer from Newcastle in July and said ahead of the Liverpool visit: "It will be interesting to see what reaction Michael gets, but he's got the experience to handle it.
Owen scored 118 goals in 216 appearances for Liverpool "There are very few players who have played for both clubs. Paul Ince obviously got a bad reaction from our fans when he went to Liverpool, and Michael might get that on Sunday. "The goals he scored for Liverpool mark him down as one of their best-ever strikers. That stands him in good stead in terms of the Liverpool fans." Ferguson hopes there is a possibility that England striker Wayne Rooney could still be fit. The 24-year-old has scored six goals in 10 games this season but has not played since England's defeat by Ukraine on 10 October. "He is always desperate to play," said Ferguson. "That is the nature of the boy, you won't stop that. "It is important how he does in training. If he does train we will have a better idea."

Morton takeover will go ahead
The ramshackle main stand at Cappielow
Fans of troubled Morton have been assured that Mike Peden's protracted takeover of the Greenock club will be completed before Christmas.
The former Darlington F.C owner signed papers in July, but the hugely unpopular local businessman Hugh Scott still has a controlling interest of the First Division club.
In recent seasons, Morton have been dogged by a series of public demonstrations from frustrated supporters and wage disputes among the players.
Confusing stories have emerged this season, suggesting that Peden is paying some players out of his own pocket, while Scott continues to fund the salaries of others.
"All the players have been paid what their due," insisted Peden.
Blown out of proportion
"A lot of these stories have been blown out of proportion by the media."
Explaining the delay concerning his takeover, Peden said:"We have been waiting for accounts to be set up and there have been a few problems putting the investment package together.
"However, Mr Scott and I have been working very closely together and we hope that the next few weeks will see the move completed.
Jim McColl, talking on behalf of the Association of Morton supporters, said: "Mr Peden will be given a chance at this club as long as he puts Hugh Scott out of the door."
Not been paid
For Saturday's home game with Clyde, Morton have lost keeper Matthew Boswell, who is staying away claiming that he has not been paid money due, and midfielder Andy Brownrigg is staging a similar protest. To add to their worries both Harry Curran and Andy Millen are suspended while Mark Naylor and Stuart McDonald are injured.
Manager Alan Evans said: "In adversity something always comes through. For Saturday I am bringing in a number of our younger players and we will even have a youth player on the bench. It is up to them to grasp their opportunity." Search BBC Sport Online
