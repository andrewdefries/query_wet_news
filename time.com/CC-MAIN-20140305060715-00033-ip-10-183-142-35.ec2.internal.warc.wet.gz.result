Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake Perform “History of Rap” on The Tonight Show

It is the fifth installment of their popular segment.
Last night on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the late-night host and Justin Timberlake brought down the house with a fifth installment of the duo’s immensely popular “History of Rap” series.
The fifth medley features LL Cool J, Run DMC, Outkast, Ludacris, Jay Z, and Kanye West. In the middle of the performance, Fallon gets a little carried away covering N.W.A.’s “Straight Outta Compton,” so Timberlake actually stops him and asks “You’re straight out of Compton? Out of curiosity, how does one get straight out of Compton?”
