Hi all. Thanks for helping to put my doctor's office comments in perspective. For them, it is a job. For me, it's my life. So of course it's magnified by 1,000 for me and I'm being super sensitive about anything that anyone says. I think it's also hard because we have told no one. It's so early, and this is so nerve-wracking. I know friends and family will be suportive and enthusiastic, but I'm not ready. I feel like I want to wait for the ultrasound first, even to tell close friends. It's not a guarantee of anything. I never had a u/s at 6 weeks with the other pregnancies, so who knows what it will show. WPP, I can't speak to breast implants. My natural ones are a bit swollen already and I feel like they are enormous (rationally I know they are not even close to enormous). It's good that you are waiting it out. If you do have a child, your body may change a lot. I have friends who never went back to their original cup size even when they lost weight elsewhere. And some of them were quite happy with that. So, you never know. Fakin, not sure what kind of cyst you are dealing with. I had ovarian cysts and even had one burst one time when I ovulated. I went to the emergency room thinking it was an appendicitis. I couldn't think of anything else that would just suddenly cause that much pain. They mostly went away on their own and I only had the dramatic bursting pain the one time. So I'm not sure what the difference is between that and what you are dealing with. I hope whatever you need to do is as painless as possible. Good luck!

Hibernian--Sorry you are dealing with insensitivity from your doctor's office. I don't know why they are projecting so much negativity, because even though it's always a gamble, statistically you still have a good chance at a healthy pregnancy after three miscarriages. (Especially since you had the RPL workup already if I recall correctly and they didn't find anything.) A 6w u/s should usually show a gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole, I believe. Seeing a heartbeat is iffy at 6 weeks, but if they don't see it, I'm sure they'll schedule you to come back in a week or so and look again. I had u/s at 5w and 7w with this pg. FB--I had an ovarian cyst, but it didn't cause me any pain. It was sort of an incidental finding my doc followed with u/s and MRI imaging, but at the end of the day it didn't really mean much clinically and there was no point to treating it. However, she said if it became painful it would be another story. Anyway, I hope you get some helpful answers this week from your doctors.

I actually had to do my HSG twice - the first time, my cervix was stenotic and they couldn't get the catheter in, so I had to take some sort of mucus softening pill four hours before the procedure (dissolve in cheek, thank the lord because the other option did not sound appealing). After the first attempt, I was terrified of how the second was going to go, but it wasn't awful. Maybe because the first time was such a trainwreck, the actuality of it was just uncomfortable. And the people at the hospital where I had it done where amazing. So far, every doctor I've dealt with at my ob's office has been fantastic and I am so, so glad she broke with her old practice and went with this one.

I also have had an HSG twice. The first I had a slight blockage, which the dye was able to push through. That was definitely painful, and quite a shock since I was expecting the "cramp" as they said. But the pain lasts all of 10-20 seconds. Seems like a lifetime when its happening... but the pain goes away very quickly (at least it did for me). The second HSG I actually didn't feel at all. A slight cramp when the cath was inserted, and then they were telling me we were done (clearly no blockage that time). So I think it could go either way. (Now if someone tells you they want to do a Karmin Biopsy... run for the hills, as Siena can also agree). As for the implants... the ladies in my side of the family have gone the other way. Mom went down two sizes and I may do the same in a few years if I don't get PG in that time. The ladies on my DH's side have them because they had breast cancer and double mastectomys. My MIL got them about 13 years ago, and she just had to have them redone because they fell out of place (which doctor says is normal... as someone said above, they are not lifetime guarenteed). My SIL just had her reconstruction about 4-5 months ago and she looks fantastic, but said they are much harder than her old ones. She was holding a newborn this past weekend and commented how he must not have been very comfortable against her hard chest. Everyone will have their own opinions about this type of surgery, or anything cosmetic. You really have to do what you are most comfortable with. I don't buy into not doing it because of putting a foreign object in your body. Many people do this all the time with IUDs and pace makers or replacement hips and knees. Just do your research and I bet there are doctors who do free consultations once you are getting more close to the time you want to do it. Definitely wait until after any and all your pregnancies though... totally agree with this. You will be quite surprised how much your b00bs change during and after, especially if you breastfeed. Wed.. very best this IUI cy

I've read posts on other boards of Bruins' fan believing that, while very good this year, the Bruins won't be repeating as champs.So it made me think, who do you think will prove to be the Bruins biggest challenge/team that scares you the most in the East in a seven game series against the B's?A few weeks ago I didn't think any team was a real threat in a seven game series against this team.

In Response to Re: 2011 Patriots Draft Options ***UPDATED MOCK 1/15***:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: 2011 Patriots Draft Options ***UPDATED MOCK 1/15*** : It's a nice story but it works both ways. If he had to become the head of the house and it woke him up he cuold have easily seen the best way to take care of his family was to make it big in the NFL and the easiest way to do that is suddenly spike your numbers by juicing up and being selected high. I hope it isn't the case cause he does have a good story but for everyone that suddenly wakes up and is clean there are as many who will do anything to make it big. I'd still be cautious of that sudden spike and do my homework before drafting him.Posted by PatsEng[/QUOTE]I am not advocating trading up for him just answering with one proposed reason for the change, as it was written.I already cleary stated my case on page #109 on why I am against trading up for a 3-4 OLB pass rusher.The history does not support it with nearly enough fruequency.

In Response to Re: 2011 Patriots Draft Options ***UPDATED MOCK 1/15***:[QUOTE]You are the best mb07! Sometime soon, could you also go over the 2009, 2010 Pats picks and give them/us a grade and future potential advisory? Thanks!Posted by PetesCall[/QUOTE]PC,Thanks for the kind words. I'm just a huge Pat's fan that also loves the draft!Overall, I love this draft class and the early returns has been extremely positive, yielding 2 starters on offense and another 3-4 on defense to go along with a starting punter.Using a baseline of "C" for average NFL starter, I'll apply the below grades:Devin McCourty- A+: Has been one of the biggest impact defenders in this class and looks like a potential All-Pro type talent.Rob Gronkowski- B+: Solid rookie season and can impact as both a receiver and blocker, definite pro-bowl potential with maybe All-Pro potential down the road.Jermaine Cunningham- C: Has flashed some ability, but still has a ways to go. Starting as a rookie is a good way to kick off your career though.Brandon Spikes- C: Solid run defender, needs work in coverage. He also needs to make better decisions off the field. Should be the starter along side Mayo next season.Taylor Price- Incomplete: Flashed some ability when given some PT, but he didn't get enough burn to formulate a grade, IMO. I think he's a kid that plays a bigger role in their offense in 2011.Aaron Hernandez- B: Versatile player with big time potential. He tailed off toward the end of the season, but looks like a huge part of their offense moving forward.Zoltan Mesko- C: NE was 19th in the NFL in gross yards per punt and 13th in net yards per punt. He didn't have a ton of chances as NE was 29th in the NFL with only 58 punts and the early snapping issues with Jake Ingram, certainly didn't help. He has a good leg and I think he turns into an above average punter. Brandon Deaderick- C-: Got some burn with the ones as a 7th Rd rookie, but he needs to focus and improve his off field habits if he wants to stick around. I think he can provide solid depth along the DL if he smartens up.I'm not going to grade the drafted players that didn't play for NE: Larsen/Welch/Weston/Robinson.As for the URFA's, I'm really high on Dane Fletcher is a potential break out type player next season and I like what I've seen from Sergio Brown in limited snaps, he's also a solid special teams guy. Kyle Love was forced into a starting role late in the season and could be a solid potential DL rotation guy, though I think they look to upgrade the overall depth of the DL.

In Response to Re: 2011 Patriots Draft Options ***UPDATED MOCK 1/15***:[QUOTE]Faucet - Kerrigan has a proven track record 08' 7 sacks 11.5 TFL, 09' 11 sacks 17 TFL, 10' 12.5 sacks 26 TFL That shows one heck of a solid track record imo so just saying that he ate up on weaker lines in 10' wouldn't explain how he managed to be a great pass rusher from 08-10'. That's a more solid track record then Miller With Reed he's got about the same sack and TFL numbers as most the potential OLB's but the thing that really impressed me about him and well Kerrigan is during senior bowl week they were put against the best T's and G's and both found ways to get to the QB. No matter what competition they played during the season when you look at the numbers then look at how they performed in the senior practices they are legit pass rushersPosted by PatsEng[/QUOTE]I'm not knocking Kerrigan or anyone else, I'm just saying it would be helpful to look at the level of competition that some of these sack leaders had. I agree, Kerrigan and Jordan looked great the whole Senior Bowl week. I caught every practice. Problem is we don't get to see the declared underclassmen play in another game after they've declared. Bowers, Houston, Ayers, Smith and Quinn; these guys are a bit unknown and risky. A lot of so called draft experts don't even look at the underclassmen until about a month after they declare and really don't start making their evaluations until the Combine. Mike Mayock is a classic example. He doesn't even think about the underclassmen, except for maybe a handful that are hard to ignore, until about now. He's still learning about some of these guys that we've been talking about for awhile. I'm not 100% sold on Miller, Kerrigan or any OLB type at this point. We haven't had the Combine yet. That is where things start to solidify for me. My only point about trading up to get an elite pass rusher is if we could and the player was a pretty certain stud, that we have the ammo to go do it. I'd be just as happy sitting tight and taking Watt or Jordan at 17. Better play from the DL means more opportunities for the LBs.The OLB position for some reason is hard to draft. It's probably because most of the time we are looking at converting DEs. That's a bit like taking a pitcher and telling him to play outfield. We might be a whole lot better off going after a F/A OLB and worry about other positions in the draft.

I see your point Faucet but even though we have the ammo to move up I still feel that 1 of Kerrigan, Smith, Watt, or Jordan will be there at 17. If we were going to move up I'd rather it be #60 to get into the early 40's late 30's truthfully. I say that because I think we can get an impact D player at 17 whether that be OLB or DE and an impact player at 28 on OL. #33 is a toss up in the air whether to trade back or there are OLB's, OL's and DE's that can be there as well. Taking #60 and moving early into the round gets you a good shot at one of the better WR's (Baldwin or Hankerson) or RB's (Leshoure or Williams) or even another good OL. Imagine coming out of the draft with a combination of the best rushing DE, rushing OLB, T, G/C, RB, or WR. 4 picks in the top 45 would fix most of the holes.OLB is really hard to draft for which is one reason I wouldn't move up for one. When I look at DE's to transition over to OLB's I look for players who can stand up and have played in a system that has asked them to stand up and sometimes cover. When Kerrigan first asked to stand up he looked a bit awkward but he seemed to get stronger during senior week and by the end he looked like he was getting the hang of it. Reed on the other hand looked completely natural standing up. Some who didn't and I don't think can translate are Beal and Bailey. They will either be 4-3 DE's or someone will fall in love with their numbers and try them out as 3-4 OLB's but I just don't see them succeeding at the position. It's funny at the beginning of the season both Beal and Bailey were considered top 20 picks now they might even fall out of the 2nd

About Me: Just a cranky old taxpayer tired of hacks, sinners and T Execs who milk the system... Had once hoped bloggin' and votin' would create a better place, but since no one can read (or save emails) in City Hall (let alone use PCs, Mr. Mayor...), DeVille is too busy decorating his office or driving his Caddy to Camp Berkshire, and Barry too occupied-o quaffing beers with Skip and the Sarge, guess I was just blinded by the light of their "ch-ch-changes..."
