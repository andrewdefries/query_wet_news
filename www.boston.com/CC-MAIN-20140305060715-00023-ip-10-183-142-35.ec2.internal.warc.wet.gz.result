I buy the Tidy Cats scoopable, and pay the same as you. Every once in a while Target has these sales, I think to move the heavier containers of litter and I just happened to walk down that aisle. It sits in the trunk of my car, until I see my son at the barbecue Sunday and ask him to stop by and lug it down cellar for me. The ibuprofen always helps pain for me, I'm just not supposed to take it at all. Obviously because I could run out to the store, it's much better than at first. Picked up an individual chicken pot pie and heated it for my supper. Tasted so good, a perfect night for it with a dish of sliced tomatoes/cukes with dressing. Got a couple of packs of mini eclairs and will freeze at least one of pack to have as a frozen dessert when the boys come Saturday. Glad to hear your husband is feeling better. Enjoy your pampering tomorrow. "Each one of us contributes in some unique way to the composition of life." ~ Mr. Rogerstt

Be careful lugging that thing down your basement stairs! You are smart to wait for your son to do it for you. Even I..who do weight training a couple of times a week..think those big containers are awkward..especially if you are on the short side. Do you have a heating pad? If yes...you could use it on your back later tonight so that it doesn't stiffen up overnight. That stinks that you are not able to take Ibuprofen. That is actually the only pain reliever I am allowed to take. Works like a charm though thankfully..but it's also not good to take it for long periods of time.

I'm very careful with heavy stuff - usually. I sit the canister of litter on the side of the 4th or 5th cellar stair, then push the litter box over to it, and just tip the canister so the litter falls out to the box below. No lifting needed. Little tricks you learn when you live alone and have a bad back. - Which feels fine tonight. Just a little strain from earlier. Guess I'll play one more game of MahJong, check at 9:00 to see if any of my programs are on, and shut the computer off for the night. Chat tomorrow.

Good morning, Looks like we got gentler rain than predicted; the garden looks so happy! Balance seems to be reestored. We have lots of baseball sized and smaller tomatoes, and the onions are starting to bulb. Still getting radishes and lettuce so salads have been on the menu a lot. I just cooked up the last of the TJ's chicken breasts that I chop raw and saute to go with. DH likes that and regular tuna salad. tt, how is your back this morning? I hope it was just a temporary twinge of a reminder to be careful. Lunch is still on, I've got my shoes by the door to exchange, and I'm counting down. Got a ton of strawberry work done yesterday and it's raining today so no loss there for being away. I suppose I should seal up the cookie sheet frozen ones before I go, but not feeling it, LOL. So, just sitting here in my PJs listening to the rain with my cuppa for now. TGIF, everyone! Where are our regulars - Princess? Amber? Tulips? JC? MM? Hoping all is well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Discretion is the better part of valor.

Good morning everyone. tt, be careful with the litter those containers can get heavy. Have a good day out East Kar. Looks like a rainy weekend. I have a cousin and her husband over on Sunday. We hadn't seen each other much, but spent a lot of time together during KC's funeral, etc., we realized we missed each and life's too short. Hopefully we get some pool time. ----------------------------------------------------------I find your lack of faith disturbing - Darth Vadar

Holy crap, will that guy ever shut up? He's a complete idiot. He only looks at height and not how good a player is. He could have Gretzky, Yzerman, Crosby and Sakic as his 4 centers and he would say they aren't tall enough to win. Most elite centers are not big. Some are, but you can't measure value in feet and inches when it comes to hockey. The Bruins' centers are plenty good enough, they've already proven it.

Dupont is still trying to come up with reasons the Bruins shouldn't have won the Cup. It's as if he thinks he can still maintain some dignity after picking the Bruins to lose in all 4 rounds last year. Vancouver has a #1 center with Sedin. How did that work when stacked up against Boston's 3 pronged attack? I especially liked his comment about the Bruins wanting a #1 center who's 6'4 and 220. There are only 6 teams in the league who feature players that fall under those parameters. Obviously most teams would prefer to get a huge center that can really play. He might as well have said Boston could use another 6'6" two-way D-man. GetzlafE. StaalKopitarJ. Staal (better than the #1 on many teams) ThorntonLecavalier

I decided to put this statement to the test and purchased NFL Game Rewind. In the Dolphins game (week 4), I have seen this guy flying around like a missile. He laid a out a TE going over the middle and jarred the ball loose. The TE (Clay) was slow to get up. Even though he was hitting a bigger TE, the guy was flattened. Just imagine what he will do to a WR.
He made an impressive diving interception which was overturned, but it looked clean to me.
He blitzed up the middle, blew the RB up who tried to block him, and sacked Tannehill with ease. Very impressive.
I'll continue to watch, but I see little reason to be concerned about how much this guy has left in the tank. Flying around to the ball last season looking to inflict pain on others. I'm impressed. You have chosen to ignore posts from kansaspatriot.

there's been alot of negativity about BB's choices so far, but gotta be better than what we been putting on the field the fast few years he a seasoned vet, and that's probably what BB was looking for.

Burlington The Planning Board has endorsed a rezoning proposal for a 14.6-acre site at 36 Muller Road. The proposal, offered by the Land Use Committee, will come before the Sept. 26 Town Meeting. In May, Town Meeting rejected a previous proposal by Symes Associates to rezone the site to a Planned Development District in order to build a residential project on the property. The new proposal, which Symes has said it does not oppose, would zone the property for single-family homes, according to Don Benjamin, a member of the town’s planning staff. In other business, the board approved a subdivision plan for the Building 19 property at Cambridge and Center streets. The retail chain submitted the application last year before a moratorium on multifamily housing in the town center took effect. Benjamin said the company has not indicated it has any current plan for a new development on the site. - John Laidler CHELSEA COMMUNITY FORUM TOMORROW - City Manager Jay Ash tomorrow is holding one of his occasional public forums to seek input from residents and businesses. The event will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. in the senior center, at 10 Riley Way. Ash will provide an update on issues facing the city, and invite questions and comments from the audience. Meanwhile, city officials are reminding residents that Wednesday is the opening day of school. - John Laidler Everett PROPERTY TAX REVIEWS - The city is holding two seminars for residential and commercial property owners with questions about quarterly tax bills. Assessor Pam Davis and her office’s staff members will discuss the bills and answer questions. They will also be available to review individual bills. The city decided to hold the sessions after receiving numerous questions about a change, which took effect this year, in the way the residential property exemption is calculated. The seminars will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. tomorrow in the George Keverian Hearing Room, and on Sept. 12 in the mayor’s conference room, both on the third floor of City Hall. Participants are advised to bring copies of their tax bills. - John LaidlerLynn HELP FOR HOMEOWNERS - Lynn Housing Authority & Neighborhood Development, in partnership with Mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy, is offering a series of new loan and grant programs to aid homeowners. Residents meeting income requirements, and living in parts of the city that the housing agency has designated as neighborhood revitalization areas, can apply for a direct loan of up to $15,000 at 3 percent interest for home repairs. Income-eligible residents 62 and older or physically disabled citywide can apply for a no-interest loan of up to $15,000 for home repairs. The authority is also offering Target Area Grants to income-eligible homeowners residing in neighborhood revitalization areas. Recipients can receive up to $5,000 for exterior repairs and up to $300 for exterior painting. For more information, visit www.lhand.org or call 781-581-8600.
- John LaidlerMalden MEMORIAL WALK FOR 9/11 - The city will observe the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks with a memorial walk at Government Center Plaza. The event begins at 9:30 a.m. with remarks by Mayor Richard C. Howard and Kevin Jarvis, Malden’s veterans services officer. All residents are invited to take part in the walk, which will proceed on Pleasant Street to Immaculate Conception Church, 600 Pleasant St., where the Knights of Columbus Council 13966 is hosting an anniversary Blue Mass at 11 a.m. in honor of Malden and Medford’s first responders. The Mass will be followed by a reception brunch in the parish hall. The day will conclude at the Irish American Club, 177 West St., where a special Community Reflection of September 11th program will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. It will include a sharing of experiences and traditional Irish music. For more information, contact Carol Ann Desiderio in the Veterans’ Services Department at 781-397-7139 or cdesiderio@cityofmalden.org. - John Laidler Malden, Melrose CONTRACTOR FOR PINE BANKS - The Pine Banks Foundation recently selected Quirk Construction to build new athletic facilities at Pine Banks Park. The Georgetown company’s winning bid of $1.69 million was more than $200,000 under the initial estimate for the project, which calls for construction of a regulation-size running track, a multipurpose field inside the track, a new grass softball field, and more than 100 new parking spaces. The 107.5-acre park in Melrose and Malden is managed by the foundation’s seven-member board, which includes representatives of the two cities and a descendant of former Malden mayor Elisha S. Converse, who in 1905 bequeathed the land for use as a public park. The total cost of the project, including design and engineering, is $2.75 million. Malden and Melrose will each cover $1 million, of that cost, with a $500,000 state grant and a $250,000 grant from the Adelaide Breed Bayrd Foundation, which is located in Malden, funding the rest. Melrose is covering its share with $1 million in revenues from the Mount Hood Golf Course. The softball field is scheduled to be completed by the spring and the rest of the project by the fall of 2012.
