Habs get a PP in Boston 6 on 4 and their D is throwing the puck on net, it eventually goes in.
Bruins get maybe the most important PP of the season and the 6 players on the ice just don;t get it. It starts with Chara. Everyone knows the puck is going to him and he's either not quick enough to shoot or move the puck. We can complain about the lines all we want, the game was at 2-1 till they got a PP 6 on 4 and they failed miserably , again ! Yes the PP is important, it's clutch and that's the bottom

In Response to Re: Interesting article comparing Brady to Montana.:[QUOTE]To me, the difference is that when Montana had less dominant teams he failed to even reach the SB. Not to diminish Montana, but if some of his other playoff teams had reached the SB his record would show more blemishes.Posted by nyjoseph[/QUOTE]Good point.

In Response to Re: Interesting article comparing Brady to Montana.:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Interesting article comparing Brady to Montana. : TC my point is there is no logical way to debate or prove this. Brady did not have Roger Craig and we cannot replay the SB's he lost with a "runnning game" so I don't know how you can prove that beyond speculation. If Eli had these three receivers instead of the ones in SB 42 do they score more than 17? I could say yes based on production but how can I prove it? Hey imagine what Dan Marino could have done witha great RB? It might have been frightening that offense but we'll never know.Posted by JintsFan[/QUOTE]I doubt we will prove much of anything as this is a discussion board.BUT..in your football fan opinion, do you think that Tom Brady would have an easier time scoring points with a rb of Roger Craigs caliber or a runningback of BJGE's caliber?Soooo again, one thing that Montana had that Brady didn't is a run game that consisted of h.o.f rb Roger craig and one of the better FB's in NFL history The RATHMANI once heard a smart NFL coach say," The run opens up the pass"

In Response to Re: Interesting article comparing Brady to Montana.:[QUOTE]You know what Montana had that Brady didn't? Roger Craig. Give Brady a true running game and he would be 5-0 in Super Bowls.Posted by TrueChamp[/QUOTE]LOL Roger Craig had 2 1,000 yd seasons, one of which was barely over 1,000 yds. Corry Dillion had at least one monster season with the Pats. Try again.I've said it before and I'll say it again. No one will ever be better than Montana, period. You can argue "as good", but not "better". You cannot do better than 11 tds 0 ints and a 4-0 record. He was as close to perfect as any QB could or ever will be in the big game.You guys always play this BS card about surrounding talent, as if Troy Brown were not better than the WRs Montana threw to for his first 2 SBs (Solomon, Neimiah, Clark, i.e, no names). Or Corry Dillion and Kevin Faulk were not complimentary to Roger Craig.If you look up the statistics, Craig, Russ Francis, Dwignt Clark etc were not even pro-bowl level players for good portions of their careers. They're remembered as "great" because they played alongside the best QB in the history of the game, who made them great - especially in big games.Tom Brady is a great QB. No doubt. I find it interesting that people are shooting Elway down for his 2-3 record in the SB yet elevating Brady above Montana's 4-0 SB record.
