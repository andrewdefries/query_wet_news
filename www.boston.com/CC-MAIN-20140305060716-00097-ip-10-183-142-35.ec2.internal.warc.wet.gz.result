Let me preface by saying that I know how unpopular "armchair GMing." I'm not implying that I could do a better job than PC (I love PC), just having a bit of fun fantasizing while Im bored at work. Remember: this is a fantasy.
I would try very hard to trade for Ryder. Dallas continues to underwelm. Usually , when teams fall out of contention, they make their 30+ yr olds available. I am speculating that for the right offer, Ryder can be had. We would have to part with a lot for the 35 goal scorer; however, I'm willing to.
I would offer a 2nd round pick, Sauve and Tommy Cross to start (I would be willing to give even more than this; however, this would be my initial offer). Not 100% sure, but I think we have the cap room to bring Ryder in (fact check needed). Line 1: Lucic - Krejci - Ryder Note: Krejci and Ryder have 2 yrs of experience playing together, and Ryder is a true sniper (an area where we can use some depth). Also: Ryder always raised his game in teh postseason, which is something that shouldnt be discounted. Ryder is picking up where he left off last year (when he scored 35 goals) despite lousy play around him.
Line 2: Kelly - Seguin - Horton
Note: I do not mean to demote Horton, love the guy. I just feel that Seguin could use some physicality on his line to create some space. Also, Horton is a very good shooter who can capitalize on the chances that Seguin is bound to create. I honestly feel that Seguins lack of physicality is a bit exposed at wing. At center, he would be in the dirty areas less and in open ice more. The only downside of moving him to Center is that he would have to be defensively responsible. This is why I have Kelly on this line. Kelly would be the guy who would responsible for getting back, which would allow Seguin to focus on offense. We all know that Kelly is a great defensive forward.
Line 3: Marchand - Bergeron - Peverly
I dont mean this as a demotion to Bergy. I honestly think that line order is overrated. I would play this line as often as the top 2, so its not really a third line. Its more of a defense first (but still with a little bit of offense) line. Everything else: u

In Response to Re: this teams in trouble:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: this teams in trouble : I agree, they have been without their best player for 2 weeks and rushing him back is not a good idea no matter how many irrelevant games they lose in January. The thing that is odd is posters keep saying "seems like a replay" but then they leave out the fact that they took the Lakers to 7 games after playing 500 ball the last two thirds of the season last year. The sky is falling, the sky is falling, the sky is falling - just like last year and the outcome was almost number 18. People panic - last year they lost to the Clippers and Golden State and several other bad teams and after the season Doc basically said they tanked games to conserve minutes, etc. and it almost paid off. Worrying about them now is simply silly as I said in another thread when healthy they are the deepest and best team in the league and built for the playoffs.Posted by TheDUDDER[/QUOTE]Yes, Ha, Ha, Ha. Remember when they lost to the Nets at home last year? Remember we lost all those Friday night games at home? Remember Paul's lingering leg issue and KG's leg strength not there? PANIC.....FIRE DOC, TRADE RAY, Blow up the Team.........oops.....we got to 4 points of the Championship. Guess we weren't so bad after all. You think we'd learn that its a LONG season and great ups and downs will happen.

Photo Source: CDC You know you have a cold when you catch it. Your nose begins to run like a leaky faucet, and your nostrils are beet red from constantly wiping the nasal drip. Your stuffy head feels like you inhaled a wade of cotton, and your throat is sore because of the continual coughing.Unfortunately, you were unlucky enough to inhale at least one of 200 or more viruses that cause Americans to suffer with more than a billion colds annually. The common cold is the leading cause of work and school absenteeism, which can make you feel miserable for up to two weeks. Kids are walking Petri dishes as they not only infect each other but also are the likely cause of infecting adults around them.Can you eat to beat the common cold? Here are some myths and facts:MYTH: Vitamin C Wards Off ColdsIn the 1970s, the scientist Linus Pauling theorized that consuming vitamin C would prevent a person from catching a cold.

Dr. John Kulig vividly remembers the trip he made to Belarus more than a decade ago to treat children harmed by the Chernobyl nuclear accident. He found himself in a room with 50 teenagers, all bearing the “Chernobyl necklace,’’ a scar at the base of their throats from thyroid cancer treatment.The Tufts Medical Center pediatrician knows firsthand the potential of a nuclear disaster to cause harm. But he and local radiation specialists say that while the eventual health and environmental impact of the escalating crisis in Japan is uncertain, one thing seems clear: The situation is dramatically different than the Chernobyl reactor explosion 25 years ago, in which a lack of transparency and inaction by the government needlessly exposed many nearby residents to radiation.“The risk s
