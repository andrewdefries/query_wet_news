How do people feel about gum chewing while they are working out at the gym? I go to the gym regularly (Planet Fitness in Waltham) and there's this one woman who is ALWAYS chewing gum. I'm not a gum chewer, its just not for me. I don't mind people chewing gum in general, but this one woman is constantly POPPING her gum during her workout. She listens to her iPOD but how can she not think no one else hears her? One afternoon I was on the ellipitcal machine for 15 minutes of a 30 minute set. She started using the one next to me to my right, started her workout and started Popping her gum every so often to the point it was just highly annoying. I almost got off my machine to jump on another but was already halfway through my workout. Another day, i was on an exercise ball doing sit-ups, she just happens to start doing some stretches or whatever a few feet from me and starts POPPING her gum. It's loud and I find it annoying. I just want to move every time she is near me or give her dirty looks, but it's a crowded gym and I haven't noticed anyone else be annoyed.

OMG....i agree.People i can't stand at the gym:1. Douchbag who walks around and talks to all the girls...lifts the 150 lb bicep curls, walks around and talks to more girls...repeat...2. Minnie Mouse, the girl who is always on her phone...and loud about it. The girl looks like a hybrid between Annette Founicello and Minnie Mouse3. Stinky who wears heavy sweater/sweatshirt in the gym...P.U....when was the last time it was washed?4. Peacock, who wears his sunglasses, designer Armadi shirt during the workout...very cool looking. Also likes to walk the gym trolling for people to talk to.5. Grunter, who plays his mp3 player so loud he can't hear himself breath, grunt or moan each time he lifts those 20 lb weights over his head. Must be some mean hemorrhoids.6. Rehydrater, the guy who sweats so much on the equipment, he needs IV fluids after every workout. Makes Patrick Ewing look slightly moist.and finally, 7. 1985. The guy who wears his high school wrestling champ shirt...which is so faded and thin...its gotta be from 1985. His Styx Mr Roboto shirt must still be hanging in the closet.

Prior to the injury to JON, Shaq was already practicing with the first team. And from what we're hearing Doc has been pleased with his performance. Do you see him as the starting center even when JON is healthy? You have chosen to ignore posts from Waynestarr.

I see Shaq coming in as the starting center. Jermaine is just too injury prone to endure an 82 game season as a starting center.I think he should come off the bench. He should do well playing against opposing teams backup centers.I would also like to see some "twin tower" sets with both O'Neals on the floor together, to nuetralize the front lines of the Lakers, Mavericks, and the Magic.

For all the haters who are dumping all over the beloved Patriots. Just having fun.Here goes: Trade Brady, Light and Maroney to ST Louis for Jackson, the 1st over all pick and the 33 Pick in the draft.Than trade the 1st pick to the Bucs for the 3rd pick and the 42nd pick.With the 3rd pick you draft Bradford. Then you trade picks # 42 47 and AD For the 10th pick. At #10 you draft Mclain. With pick # 22 you draft TateWith pick # 33 You draft GreshamWith pick # 44 You draft Kyle Wilson or Perrish CoxWith pick # 53 you reach and draft Kyle CallowaySo we trade Brady, Light and maroney For Jackson , Bradford , Mclain , Tate , Gresham , Say Cox and Calloway.Sounds good but not real.

Film director Spike Lee was dressed in Knicks gear and rooting against the Celtics during the 2008 Finals in Los Angeles. You have to respect Lee's enthusiasm considering his beloved Knicks may be the laughingstocks of pro sports. They have been to the playoffs only once since 2002 and have often made more news in court than on the court at Madison Square Garden.But now with a returned New Yorker (Donnie Walsh), a new coach (Mike D'Antoni), and a new forward (rookie Danilo Gallinari), Lee's Knicks have been able to "do the right thing" and give the storied franchise optimism again."Th
