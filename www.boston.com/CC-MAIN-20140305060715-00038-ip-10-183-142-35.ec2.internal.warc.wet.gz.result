Bob Woodward said this evening on CNN that a "very senior person" at the White House warned him in an email that he would "regret doing this," the same day he has continued to slam President Barack Obama over the looming forced cuts known as the sequester.
CNN host Wolf Blitzer said that the network invited a White House official to debate Woodward on-air, but the White House declined.
"I think they're confused," Woodward said of the White House's pushback on his reporting.

Politico: "The Woodward reporting has caused the White House spin machine to sputter at a crucial time. The president was running around the country, campaign-style, warning that Republicans were at fault for the massive cuts set to hit Friday. What Obama never says: it was his own staff that proposed sequestration, and the tax hikes he now proposes – aimed at replacing half of the cuts — were never part of that very specific plan." The White House instead has, with great success, fudged the facts. The administration has convinced a majority of the country that Republicans are more to blame by emphasizing that Republicans voted for the plan. Which they did — after Obama conceived it."

In response to TheBostonBruins's comment: I don't care what anyone says, I want to see Big Z knock Scott's teeth out all over the ice next time we play these a z z-holes. I want Big 33 to make Scott bleed badly. Beat his face in severely! Can't disagree but if Chara goes with Scott and gets beat up -- B's would be a wreck. Keep in mind -- Chara went twice in one game with Georges Laraque with great expectations and basically fought to a draw both times. Scott is far from a David Koci and most likely a few notches above Laraque as well. You have chosen to ignore posts from shuperman.

Chara size and strength wise are even. Chara balance on skates and past wrestling ability huge edge. Chara fighting numerous heavyweights mean he isn't Tyler Myers. Chara came into the league as a project who fought with the NYI. How is it ok to fight Neil or reghr and not ok to fight Scott? Bc he might lose? Again. I don't think it's a must for him to fight Scott the next game. In fact I think Lucic will. I think Lucic can beat him. I think Lucic is the best fighter on the team and won't be man handled like ST. My pt as fletch has aided is that this team had no push back. We aren't the Detroit redwings. We are a in your face slap your face " are you gonna do anything, or just sit there and bleed- tombstone " type team. Buffalo won't be a team that is gonna get bullied anymore by this team. But does that mean we change our style of play. Miller and Ruff must be giggling right now. I've seen Horton Lucic chara McQ boychuk Marchand go after other teams young players and stars and didn't have to face a worthy opponent. Well I think that's changed in buffalo. I will be very interested in the push back by this team. It's more then fighting Scott. I was disappointed in the lact of heart and pushback in a very hyped game. The bruins are the toughest team in the league for a reason and it didn't start with ST in my mind. It was a team with numerous guys. That's what makes them a special team.

In response to GEAUX-TIGRES' comment: Careful what you wish for dick head. There have been plenty of Chara size guys who can't fight a lick. Who has he beaten up? Working a club one night, I saw a 140 lb. street fighter drop a 260 lb thug with one kidney shot. In this case, it is the size of the dog in the fight. Seen it too many times. Chara. Stay clear of Scott so as to not embarrass yourself. The guy is a fighting machine.

If you watched the meeting between Salty and Bedard before Bedard's two strike pitch for a homer to Napoli--Bedard very clearly said, for all to see, Fast Ball. If I saw it, and I'm pretty certain I did, then the third base or first base coach saw it as well. It would be interesting to see if Napoli got any sign for fast ball before the pitch.Which ump should have gotten the "Catch" by Reddick--the first or second base?I'd guess the second since he could have easily been backed up by the 3 rd base ump. It was a tough call but it wasn't that deep in RF for someone not to have given that ump assistance.

You had a runner on first so you don't want the ump leaving second as the next logical spot for a play is there. The home plate ump would move to cover first if needed. The first base ump probaly should have angled a bit more toward right field proper, instead of hugging the line. To the extent possible, you are also taught to not make the call while running as you head would be moving. That said he appeared to have a clean lo
