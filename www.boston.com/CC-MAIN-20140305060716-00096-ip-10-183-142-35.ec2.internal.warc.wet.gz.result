04/01/2012—This piece was written by James H. Burnett III, Nicole Cammorata, Ike Delorenzo, Sheryl Julian, Doug Most, Anne V. Nelson, Kathleen Pierce, Mark Pothier, Julia Quinn-Szcesuil, Denise Drower Swidey, Rachel Travers, Adrian Walker and Eileen McEleney Woods.3 LITTLE FIGS Chef, baker, and co-owner Katie Rooney got her start at area farmers markets, but the family affair (mother, husband, sister) put down roots last fall in Somerville. The airy cafe is a stylish understated place with stylish understated offerings: avocado muffins, glazed lavender scones. Then theres the feta toast with tapenade, tomatoes, and herbs . . . Coffeecakes rotate, and the java is from Gimme! Coffee. Eat breakfast here, and its hard to resist also taking home a snack for later.>3 Little Figs, 278 Highland Avenue, Somerville, 617-623-3447, 3littlefigs.com3 YOLKS BREAKFAST & LUNCHYou will always get offered hot sauce at this Lynn spot, whether with your eggs or your catfish or pork chop breakfast  all for under $10. At this go-to joint for Southern fare, chef-owner Derek Bells grits are superb and drowning in butter, his biscuits liberally ladled with sausage gravy. Muffins are country style  made in a flat pan, then cut into big squares.> 3 Yolks Breakfast & Lunch, 1103 Western Avenue, Lynn, 781-596-1103THE BLUE ROOMThe fixed-price Sunday brunch buffet at The Blue Room in Cambridge is still going strong after 20 years, though now its under the spatula of a new chef. Robert Grant is known for seasonal menus and top ingredients. A mini smoothie  one recent morning, it was blueberry, banana, and pineapple  makes a great start, or jump in with a mimosa. Then whether you go for scrambled eggs or a salad, fresh and delicious is what you get. Dont overlook the pastry tables apple tarte tatin, banana muffins with oat crumble, or lemon-glazed scones.> The Blue Room, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, 617-494-9034, theblueroom.netBREAD & CHOCOLATE BAKERY CAFE Dark wooden farm tables convey a homey feel, and so does the new weekend brunch menu thats available at the Newton Highlands location only. Highlights include the buttery croque-madame and the French (bread) French toast, surprisingly tender despite its baguette origins. The omelets are packed full, and the thick bacon will melt in your mouth.> Bread & Chocolate Bakery Cafe, 4 Hartford Street, Newton, 617-795-0500, breadnchocolate.comTHE BREAKFAST CLUB Tough love is on the menu weekday mornings starting at 6, an hour later on weekends. So are thick white-bread French toast, sheets of scrambled eggs, slow-grilled new potatoes, and basic but effective coffee. The truckers, construction workers, and slumming Harvard Business School students who fill the vinyl banquettes seem to like it that way. For the faint of heart, bowls of fresh fruit, granola, and oatmeal are available with a look of disappointment on the side.
>The Breakfast Club, 270 Western Avenue, Allston, 617-783-1212, thebreakfastclubboston.comTHE BRISTOL LOUNGE Breakfast at the Bristol Lounge at the Four Seasons is always a special occasion. Exquisitely comfortable chairs, tables overlooking the Public Garden, nice linens, coffee poured often, tea with actual leaves, and unparalleled hospitality guarantee it. The staff never flinches, whether youre making up your order (they pride themselves on being able to fulfill it; if they dont have the flavoring for your favorite yogurt, they make it) or a house specialty (corned beef hash with poached eggs and Boston baked beans). The bill is always high. So is the quality.> The Bristol Lounge at the Four Seasons HoteL, 200 Boylston Street, Boston, 617-338-4400, fourseasons.com/boston CAFE FRESH BAGEL The secret to the New York bagel is the water. So whining about why Bostons dont match up is pointless. Instead, get thee to Cafe Fresh Bagel in Needham (or Dedham, Framingham, or Norwood). The service is speedy, the coffee is strong, and the bagels are crispy, chewy, and, if you get a warm sesame seed, as close to the New York taste as youll find.>Cafe Fresh Bagel, 896 Highland Avenue, Needham, 781-444-7444, and other locations CLOVERAt Clover, servers intercept rather than greet you, taking orders on iPods and reporting prep times to the tenth of a minute. And theres plenty of green attitude: no trash cans (everything we use is compostable), no Splenda (its artificial), and no meat. But its worth it. Clovers egg sandwich is a perfectly soft-boiled egg served in a whole wheat pita with Vermont cheddar cheese and tomato. The marvelous $2 coffees feature a cast of local indie roasters. And yes, the same sandwich is sold at Clovers Inman and mobile locations, too.>Clover, 7 Holyoke Street, Cambridge (no phone), and other locations, cloverfoodlab.comCOPPA Imagine this  two farm-fresh eggs, over easy, sprinkled with fresh chives and dried Espelette pepper and served with Parmesan polenta and thick, house-cured bacon. Yes, even brunch is better in Italy. Scrambled eggs with mushrooms get a fancy name like uova con funghi, and a taste to match. Drinks include refined Bloody Marys, Aperol with orange juice, and prosecco spritzers, including one served stealthily in a mug. Inexplicably, you can often walk right in while other South End bruncheries have pointless lines. Hurry, that wont last. (Open Sundays only for brunch.) > Coppa, 253 Shawmut Avenue, Boston, 617-391-0902, coppaboston.com CROSSROADS CAFE & DELI For years, the turnover rate was high for businesses on this busy corner in Hanover. But when Crossroads opened nearly a decade ago, something seemed to click. Locals flock for yummy quiches, three-egg omelets, and the traditional, no-frills plate of bacon, home fries, and eggs any way you want them. The service is always warm at this neighborhood spot, which is decorated in bright, cheerful hues with roosters on the curtains (good morning!).
> Crossroads Cafe & Deli, 216 Rockland Street, Hanover, 781-826-9921 DELUXE TOWN DINER AND DELUXE STATION DINERLike many other diners, Deluxe Town in Watertown and Deluxe Station in Newton Centre serve breakfast all day. Here the difference is you get Fair Trade coffee, cage-free eggs, and artisan-baked bread. On weekends, lines snake out the doors, with patrons waiting for pastrami and eggs, lox-style smoked salmon, and the Acadian buckwheat pancakes called ployes. Co-owner Daryl Levy makes outstanding pies and cupcakes for both locations.> Deluxe Town Diner, 627 Mount Auburn Street, Watertown, 617-926-8400> Deluxe Station Diner, 70 Union Street, Newton, 617-244-2550, deluxetowndiner.comEAST COAST GRILLSure, you can wait 20 or so minutes for brunch at this Inman Square institution serving its own brand of New England seafood meets Southern spice cuisine. But the host will actually thank you for waiting when you sit down, a tiny thing that makes a huge difference between this spot and other hip, tasty Sunday destinations. The fish tacos are crispy and fresh and come with jicama-carrot slaw. Cheesy duck tostadas sit atop a mess of greens and come with gorgeous hunks of grilled sweet potato that make the enormous dish seem almost healthy.>East Coast Grill, 1271 Cambridge Street, Cambridge, 617-491-6568, eastcoastgrill.netEASTERS COUNTRY KITCHENThe first thing youll notice about this East Weymouth restaurant is that country is accurate, from the plaid curtains on the windows to the menus typical country breakfast fare. But there are two dishes at which Easters excels: real Southern-style grits and the garbage omelet. The former is made right  thick, creamy, with dollops of butter. And the latter? Well, theres nothing trashy about an omelet with all the fixins, from multiple meats to cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and more.> Easters Country Kitchen, 1385 Washington Street (Route 53), East Weymouth, 781-337-4123 THE EATING ESTABLISHMENTStarting with its name, this Hanover place sticks to basics. Patrons read actual newspapers in the mornings. Breakfast sandwiches have plain names such as Bob, Harry, and Steve (hes sausage). Theres a counter and stools, the place mats are paper, and many of the friendly servers have worked here forever, says owner Alice Matheny. On a recent morning, Texas French toast stuffed with cream cheese was a menu special, but thats about as experimental as it gets. Theres a crowd of loyalists, many of whom order the same meals every visit. And Mathenys just fine with that.> The Eating Establishment, 2103 Washington Street (Route 53), Hanover, 781-982-7124 THE FRIENDLY TOASTWeekend waits can be up to an hour, but this Kendall Square pioneer opens early and stays open late, so try an off hour and you might get lucky. Walking in is like entering a 1950s arcade  it is filled top to bottom with retro funky stuff, much of it fascinating. The fun tone carries over to the menu, too. The Hansel & Gretel Waffle is made with gingerbread and topped with pomegranate molasses and whipped cream, and then there are Green Eggs and Ham  the green is a light herb sauce. As for the namesake toast, you can choose from six kinds of homemade bread.
> The Friendly Toast, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, 617-621-1200, thefriendlytoast.net GERARDSGerard Adomuness restaurant has been a major morning draw in Dorchesters Adams Village for 40 years. As befits its heavily Irish clientele, the signature breakfast dish here is a concoction called Irish Breakfast Festival: two eggs, two slices of Irish bacon, two Irish sausages, home fries, black pudding, and white pudding. A word about this puddin

Ok ... No secret that even though Edelman caught 10 passes for 103 yards in Welkers absence today ...HE IS NO WES WELKER. The real problem is this teams DEFENSIVE LACK OF HEART . They once again gagged up a big 4th quarter lead and I for one am sick & tired of "praying for a miracle stop " with the game on the line . Its like a bad movie script where the screenwriter continally resorts to the sme tired cliche ...ENOUGH ALREADY ! ii understand that statisticaaly speaking the Pats D is Top 10 ... but these meltdowns prove they are lacking . Wheteher it's Heart / Skill / Coaching ...I could care less, the fact is when it comes to vomiting up 4th quarter chokes ...the Pats are #1 . UNLESS A MIRACLE SOLUTION IS FOUND BEFORE SUNDAY >>> WE ARE ONE & DONE .

FARNESE, Italy - Sometimes, when you feel like you’ve traveled as far from home as you can possibly go, you reach a moment when things start to seem less like a vacation and more like a trust fall.This is the sense that crept over me as I turned the key in my rented white Fiat, coasted out the gate of the stone farmhouse where I was staying, and turned onto a dirt road to follow the Last Brigand.There were seven of us in two cars, a little caravan along an unmarked red ocher road. Ahead, the Last Brigand led the way with his hunting dog in the passenger seat. His car kicked up relentless clouds of dust. “È una strada rotta,’’ the Last Brigand had said - a broken road - and he wasn’t kidding. Where were we headed? Our wheels balanced on one edge of the road, then the other, avoiding the rain-washed crags through the middle.And then we were there: a grassy turnout, a barbed-wire gate, and a velvet green hill.The small peak before us looked empty, peaceful. When we scrambled to the top, we found a different story: broken stone walls; caves hollowed roughly out of volcanic rock. Once this hilltop had been a fortress of the Etruscans, the mysterious ancient civilization that rivaled the power of Rome to the south. Settlers here built houses outward, jealously guarding their peak and the spring erupting from its foot. Then they vanished.The Last Brigand clambered the hills like a goat, pointing out which leaves were edible and the pool where the wild boars drink. The place had yet more history to reveal: Centuries later, medieval Italian settlers had rebuilt the village with a square castle tower whose walls now stood jagged against the gray sky. We stepped within the outlines of a small church, still traced in stone blocks along the ground.The Last Brigand crouched again. He reached into a thicket, and pulled out a long purple-green stalk: wild asparagus. Then another, and another. We all started hunting, and by the end the ruined village had yielded a souvenir, and it was lunch.I had not meant to go on vacation with the Last Brigand. I thought I was spending a week in a country house. It was magnificent, and because it belonged to a friend of a friend, it was free. There would even be a caretaker, a local man named Giulio Castri.The house was in northern Lazio, a corner of Italy that not only had I never visited, but also nobody I talked to had ever visited, even though it’s only 90 minutes from Rome. Five hundred yea
