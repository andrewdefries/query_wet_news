How did you jump from the economy to abortions??BTW, the title was sorta tongue in cheek towards bafools constant attempts to monopolize the board with anti-republican/conservative/spiritual BS.But, if, you want to be offended have at it.

Ok, I don't open his posts and if, you have been equally annoyed and expressive then, I stand corrected "you sir, are an oak"When the SCOTUS rules is there not opinions that can be deemed as just cause to bring forth new evidence and make arguments and provide reasons and evidence for re-examination?If so, can the court not reverse it's ruling on such evidence?It seems and correct me if, I am wrong, that you are saying that since the supreme court has ruled any futher challenges are unconstitutional.

In Response to Re: Why do Reps want to hurt the constitution?:In Response to Re: Why do Reps want to hurt the constitution? : The form of the challenge matters. Viability is the cutoff point, with other things, ie, mandated ultrasound viewing permissible earlier. It's a direct assault on a constitutional right to go outlawing abortions after 20 weeks when 24 weeks is considered viability (absent determinations in independent cases) by doctors. And that's true whether or not you agree with Doe 's reasoning or conclusion. Don't know why, but it gets me when the party that more or less uniformly puts itself out as bigger patriots and constitution-lovers than Democrats picks and chooses which parts/results of the constitution to honor...based on whether it likes them or not.Posted by WhatDoYouWantNowSo, it angers you when people post and try to tie all together as "Liberals" or progressives" but, you catagorize all who think this way as the Republican party?

His quote: "If the events relating to Friday night reflect the state of the league, I need to re-think whether I want to be a part of it." Lemieux called Friday's game a "travesty" and said the NHL "failed" to deliver a clear and strong message about what conduct is acceptable.Can you freaking believe this guy! If he REALLY wanted to make a statement & show how much he feels about the "travesty" in the game, Matt Cooke would not be playing for the PensBTW....I think the Isles/Pens happenings do not belong in the game....The NHL handled it well too

"If the events relating to Friday night reflect the state of the league, I need to re-think whether I want to be a part of it."Double standard at it's best as he cuts a check every two weeks for Cooke. Too bad Bettman will sit up in listen to this whining.

Lemiuex was a great hockey player who bought a team. The city built him a new arena (unlike Jacobs in Boston), his crappy team had numerous number #1s, his team su@cked for years only to be lucky to draft Crosby and Malkin... hmmm me thinks he is right maybe he needs to leave the league. Leave the Pens though! Cooke d and done with the logic of Lemiuex. BTW can we have back the Bs colors you were granted to use by the NHL. You have chosen to ignore posts from Not-A-Shot.

Mario is out of line here. I completely agree with everyone.You can't have Matt Cooke on your team and cry about over the line rough play.

Didn't he play this card as a player as well?What a fraud, with Cooke the NHL's top cheap-shot artist and employing players like Godard & Engelland. Anyone want to guess which team leads the NHL in fighting majors? You are a part-owner of an NHL franchise, if you don't like the NHL, then sell your part.

hey finally a topic everyone agrees on!! Lemiuex also won his first stanley cup....when.....the bruins were up on him 2 games to 0.....and the guy in the next stall to him....a guy called "ulf".....took neely out with a cheap shot!! if not for the league's dirtiest player taking out our best player...he doesn't win the cup. he should def. learn to keep his big mouth shut.

In response to Celtsfan4life's comment: In response to JamezHill24's comment: wheres all the "Jason Terry must go!!" guys? hahahaha. Disappeared when Rondo went down and we realized where the real problem was. Jason Terry is playing better bc of more minutes, and he has finally gotten comfortable. NOT bc Rondo was making him bad. Wow.

I think T.O. is as frustated as he can possibly be at this time a year. The patriots should sign him for the 2010 season. T.O. - Randy Moss - Wes Welker - Brandon Tate - Julian Edelman - looks like a pretty scary scenario for next year oponents.
