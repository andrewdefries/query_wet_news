Since he took over:
Price and Pacioretty signed long term, reasonable deals.
Held the line on Subban and got him in under a good number.
Drafted and signed Galchenyuk.
Signed Brandon Prust and Francois Boullion.They've gone from close to worst to close to first very quickly. And now the Ryder deal.
I see this as he traded a slumping 35 year old with a publically stated bad attitude and two years left on his contract for a not-slumping 32 year old with an expiring contract...and a third round pick. Huge win for Montreal there.
Love or hate Montreal (hate!), there is no looking past this performance by Bergevin so far. He's doing an incredible job.

Rivalry is much more entertaining and exciting when both teams are closer in skill level and every game is a battle to the end.

GIF: Paul George drives by LeBron James and posterizes Chris Andersen May 24, 2013 By Keith Mullett Leave a Comment Indiana Pacers guard Paul George is becoming a household name during the Eastern Conference finals. His heroics kept Indiana in Game 1 against the Miami Heat, and this vicious posterization of Chris “Birdman” Andersen on Friday night during Game 2 will only add to his legend. Have mercy. I don’t know what’s more impressive, running right by the freak of nature that is LeBron James or the brutal jam over Andersen. That dunk and the ensuing made free throw put the Pacers up five near the end of the third period. You have chosen to ignore posts from BCSP.

Hi,I was reading up on the Pats' current roster when I came across Crable's name. He's been hurt for two years in a row so I don't know anything about how he plays. He's 6'5" 243 and plays LB. If this guy gets healthy does anyone here think he will contribute and if so will we see him at LB at all this season?His draft write up said he's from MI where he was a standout his last two seasons, team captain and is close to the top in the school's tackles and tackles for loss records. He could lead and he was very good for MI.What's up with Shawn Crable?

Good to see because it wasn't a good night for other top prospects. The PawSox won, but Bradley Jr. was 0-for-4 with 3 Ks and is now hitting .226; Bryce Brentz went 0-for-4 with 1 K and is now hitting .256 and commited an error; Iglesias went 0-for-4 with 2 Ks and commited his third error of the season; and is now hitting .245; and Allen Webster went 4.0 IP, 3 H, 4 ER, 3 BB and 5 K. His ERA rose to 3.21.

Republicans
The State Fair (Al Franken & Norm Coleman Style)�It�s a Minnesota Thing.
E-mail|Link|Comments (8)
Posted by Isaac Mass
August 30, 2008 12:43 PM	One of the best things about the Convention is taking in the local culture. In Minnesota that is the Mall of America and the State Fair. At the Minnesota State Fair you quickly learn that Garrison Keillor is right about the folks from Lake Woebegone: �The women are strong, the men are good looking and all the children are above average.� This second largest State Fair boasts, bacon on a stick, an all the milk you can drink for a $1 booth and the giant slide. Truly it was amazing large, about four times the size of the Big E.
The state fair also has its share of politics. Sure there were a lot of McCain and Obama buttons out, but the real race highlighted at the state fair was the Minnesota US Senate race between incumbent Republican Norm Coleman the former mayor of St. Paul and failed Air America radio personality Al Franken (You probably know him best as Stewart Smalley). I got to see both candidates up close and get a good look at one of the closest races in the country.
Norm Coleman a Twins fan who took exception to my Red Sox hat, made the case for energy independence in the United States and consoled Minnesotans who had hoped Gov. Pawlenty would be in the #2 spot on the Republican ticket. He reminded them that it was Minnesota values that put the first woman on a national ticket when Walter Mondale picked Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and now 24 years later, it was a Minnesota convention that would nominate Sarah Palin who would be the first female candidate to actually win the Vice Presidency. Later at the Franken booth he gave a stirring speech about the need to improve American education and invest research and development to spur the US economy. In true Stuart Smalley fashion, he joked, �The most recent poll has me with a commanding 1% lead and I see no reason why I can�t double that.� Franken continued, �We need a governing majority in the Senate. Right now we hold the majority by the skin of Joe Lieberman�s teeth.� He also urged people to get involved saying, �I need you to put a bumper sticker on the back of your car and not cut anyone off for the next 67 days. Franken drivers are going to be the most polite drivers on the road.� Franken drew big crowd, but I wonder how much was celebrity and how much was enthusiasm. Franken calls it the Wellstone seat, and is campaigning on that tragic legacy. In the end though, Minnesotans may just stick with Norm. Why? Because he�s good enough, he�s smart enough and dog gone it people like him. One thing is for sure, this is a race I will be watching on November.

Middle East No clear successor should Abbas leave the stage
FILE - In this file photo taken Wednesday, Dec. 8, 2010, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attends a news conference after his meeting with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou in Athens. Washington's Mideast peace efforts are in trouble as it is, but an additional complication is often overlooked: should 76-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a heavy smoker prone to threats of resignation, leave the political stage, there's no designated successor and no agreement on how to choose one.

RAMALLAH, West Bank—Washington's Mideast peace efforts are in trouble as it is, but an additional complication is often overlooked: Should 76-year-old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a heavy smoker prone to threats of resignation, leave office, there's no designated successor and no agreement on how to choose one.Having a Palestinian leader opposed to violence is key to U.S. policy in the region, and Abbas has filled that role for the past six years. A turbulent transition could seriously weaken any new leader.The issue of succession is so sensitive it's rarely discussed openly by the Palestinian elite, and Abbas is touchy about it.When a U.S. newspaper wrote about the leadership ambitions of key players in his Fatah movement, the official Palestinian news agency ran a scathing statement directed at one of those mentioned in the article, former Palestinian envoy to the U.N., Nasser al-Qidwa.Abbas also went after another Fatah prince, Mohammed Dahlan, stripping him of privileges and shutting down his TV station earlier this month, after Dahlan criticized the president in meetings with activists.Abbas aides play down concerns about his health, prompted by his smoking and recent weight gain. They say he's fine and that getting dental implants was his only recent medical procedure. Occasional threats to step down are simply attempts to create leverage vis-a-vis Israel and the U.S., they say.At the root of the succession problem is the split of the Palestinian territories between Fatah, which now controls the West Bank, and the Islamic militant Hamas movement, which wrested control of the Gaza Strip from Abbas in 2007.Fatah and Hamas have been unable to reconcile, and their rivalry has prevented presidential and legislative elections, which should have taken place by this year.Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005. The Hamas-dominated parliament stopped functioning long ago, in part because Israel arrested many Hamas legislators.Palestinian law calls for the speaker to serve in a 60-day caretaker capacity until elections to replace a president. This arrangement was used in the transition from Yasser Arafat, who died in November 2004, to Abbas two months later. However, the current parliament speaker is from Hamas, and it's unlikely Fatah would agree to let Hamas take over the presidency, even temporarily.Elections also are seen as improbable since they are tied to elusive reconciliation. In this case, Fatah would have to appoint a successor, though the nominee would be vulnerable to claims by Hamas and others that he has no legitimacy.Fatah, which has long dominated Palestinian affairs, has been in disarray since it lost parliament elections to Hamas in 2006, with voters punishing the former ruling party for arrogance and mismanagement. Fatah's troubles have been compounded by its failure to establish an independent Palestinian state. If elections were held, it's not certain Fatah would defeat Hamas.
The most popular Fatah leader of the middle generation is Marwan Barghouti, who is in his late 40s, but he is serving a life sentence in Israel for his role in the armed Palestinian uprising earlier this decade.Among the remaining contenders, rivalry is so intense they might be unable to agree on a consensus candidate or settle on a weak one.
