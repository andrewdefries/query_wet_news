Just wondering. Some goof named Hansen on Vancouver, gives Hossa a fore-arm wack to the back of his head and knocks him out of the game. The guy has to know who it is, and yet does it to him anyway. So the question is, is this just a regular, rough play on a guy that has scored 2 goals that night, or did someone say to this lesser light, wack him if you can? My take is that the coach or previous coaches have said to do this to a vulnerable guy, therefore this is intentional. I dont' know if anyone cares, but I hate seeing the talent get taken out of the game by trash, and not the other way around. You have chosen to ignore posts from hangnail.

Better to take a deal on your terms and not be dictated to when you have what the other guy wants. This post has been removed.

The Clippers said no to 3 different scenarios...what does that tell CP3. LOL! Good luck building around Griffin.

The Clips aren't the Clips for no reason. They have a chance at a good coach and they try to dictate the terms of the deal? I am sure the media will say that Sterling walked, but if I'm Ainge I'd really question just how much the Clips wanted that deal and I'd move on knowing that you did the right thing. Again, you can't dictate the terms on three variations of a deal when you're the guy who's 1) tampering for a head coach under contract and 2) desperate to bring in a coach whose hiring would mean you retain your star PG.

In response to Fierce34's comment: In response to CablesWyndBairn's comment: Better to take a deal on your terms and not be dictated to when you have what the other guy wants. So true. Agree with you both. &nbs

It's October, with the division locked up in a 4 way tie at 3-3, big division game Sunday. This is going to be a very interesting game, it could be a flat out Patriot blow out win, but on the other hand it could turn out to be another frustrating game. In my mind we blow them out big! I'm ready for this game, I'm excited for this game. The Patriots have a point to prove that they are better then the 3-3 record they have going into this game. And who better to prove it against then Rex Ryan and the Jets!! With that said.....
