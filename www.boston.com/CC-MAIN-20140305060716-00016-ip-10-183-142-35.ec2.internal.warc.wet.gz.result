An "Aha" moment - just made a batch of cranraisin scones to go with soup - "Aha!", said I, now I know what was wrong with that last batch of scones. It calls for a tbsp of b.p. and I forgot to put any in! AHA!

Yes, babies and toddlers galore, here and on way. There was a poster a while ago who loved Gone with the Wind - the happiest days are when babies come... TT, that would do it! I keep my baking powder, soda and vanilla in a plastic bag in the cupboard above my counter, and the first thing I do is take that out...most anything you bake has one, two or all three of those ingredients....and I often put in a little vanilla when it's not called for....like pancakes and waffles and french toast and banana bread....

Yes, as I was putting the dry ingredients in, I thought, there must be b.p., and then realized, last time I never put any in. Explains flat, hard hockey pucks! Tonight's were their usual delicious selves, good with the chicken soup I had. You and your vanilla, me and my Miracle Whip - I put a spoonful in most everything for a little extra tang.

The leafs have 11 points in their first 7 games and are on top of the division. The Bruins have played reasonably well, but only above Ottawa (last time I checked).The early season is not usually a good indicator of how things pan out.The Leafs started really strong last year as well and you know how they ended up.I think 20 games is a good yardstick for finding out how teams are really doing.The natural order should re-assert itself (give or take a couple of teams) by then.I expect the Bruins to win their division and make it to the at least the conference finals. Washington and eventually Pittsburg may have something to do with whether or not the Bruins make it back to the finals but I wouldn't over-react to what you see in the 1st month of action.Leafs will struggle to make the playoffs again this year, but should be in the mix.

What if you are the defending SC champions and you start 7-13? What if you are the Habs? Canucks? I think panic buttons are getting close all over the league. I don't think 20 games is an indicator of anything. These games can make or break pole position for the playoffs or force you to watch them. We just had two extended home stands. When the dog days of january-february kick in we have already used our mulligan.I won't lose sleep over a loss or two. But we need to string a nice little streak together. Wonder if Pouliot and ST could have landed us Booth. Did they even shop him around. Is that all they could get? Really? Wow. You have chosen to ignore posts from bogie6.

I'm still confused on Pouliot who makes both good moves, and terrible gaffs. IMO Thornton's value has totally diminished in all aspects except for stirring up the Boston crowd. That has some value, but won't win any games for them. Claude has tinkered pretty well with what he has, except for replacing Thornton, and he is probably thinking of the home crowd value, but has now noticed the lack of capability. Like Kelly's performance for the most part, but he could use better hands; Peverly with kreji has not really clicked, and Pouliot hasn't helped. I've been zapped for noting Bo

The Jets are a very good team. They are a legitimate threat. Their defense is top notch the best in the league. Darrele Revis is a stud. I wish we could have their defense and Revis. If they had a decent QB , they might have a chance to win it all this year.Although I hate Ryan and his bravado, you cant dismiss what he has done with this defense in only 1 year.

In response to 49Patriots' comment: So you'd dump the best DB we have and keep Welker, a reciever that doesn't stretch the field and doesn't have the ability to make a play when it matters most? Are you Welker's brother or something? How many SBs have we won with Wes Welker? 0-2 How many did we win with a GOOD defense? 3-0 You need someone who can stretch the field and someone who can work the short to middle stuff. Welker does the short field better then anyone. Dump Lloyd and pick up someone up who can work the middle to deep field. Wellker opens up the deep ball and and a deep threat will open up the short to mid field. Need both! TE's Gronk and Hernandez are icing on the cake. Need all 3 aspects to be a dynamic passing attack. The best DB in the world can't help you if he can't stay health for a season. Talib hasn't yet. When they needed him most he was on the sidelines.

Ladies and Gentlemen, this your captain speaking: please fastenyour seatbelts... Here Come The Red Sox.The Red Sox have won 8 of their last 9 games despite a very slowstart from both Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez. And the amazingSox are trouncing the big boys like the (Angels) no the bad teams... like the....The new Sox nuclear SP rotation is apparently too much for the American League hitters: (Lester, Dice, Beckett, Lackey, Clay). The ERA of the Sox Nuclear Sox SP rotation is lower than a freezing temperature in Canada.On the other hand, we`re expecting the Yanks to run out of gas...They have too many lottery tickets in their SP rotation. And theRays aren`t going anywhere... Johnny Damon is too old for mamboand Evan Longoria is ailing.I repeat: this your captain speaking: please fasten your seatbelts...Here Come The Red Sox. Trust me.Thanks for Reading...-SB.
