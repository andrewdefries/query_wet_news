That's cute. He lied and people died, especially cute considering the GOP plan was nonexistent. Couple of facts The plan that is being wound down was always a temp solution until ACA can be fully implemented. People with pre existing conditions will not be turned away by insurance companies under the fully implemented law because it will be illegal to do so The people currently on the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan will retain their current temp coverage until Jan 1 2014 This post has been removed.

Good afternoon to my good friends on Red Sox :On the front burner. I am glad you realize that my Yankees are playing like one of the elite teams in the AL.Entering July, My Yankees have compiled the best record in the American League and built a 2 and a ½ game lead over your favored Red Sox. They lead the majors in runs per game. My Yankees current ERA of 3.51 ranks fourth in the American League. My Yankees are 15-4 in their last 19 games. My Yankees pitchers have a 2.98 ERA in their last 19 games. And the good news keeps coming.Derek Jeter should be activated for the series with Cleveland beginning on Monday.Bartolo Colon is returning to the mound on Friday, while Phil Hughes with his 94 mph fastball appears poised to rejoin the club soon.

While the Yankees are good, this is certainly the weakest team they've fielded in the past 10 years or so. Unlike teams in the past, this one has glaring weaknesses. While you never want to count them out, it's the least intimidating Yankees squad i've seen in years. It's the first time in forever I absolutely don't fear them in a seven game series.
