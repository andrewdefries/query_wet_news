Your company is hit with an unexpected blow: a key business partner departs, you lose a lucrative account, or a “green lighted” contract runs into a snag. The result of the blow may be financial, organizational, emotional, or all three – requiring a period of rebuilding.
Once the shock, disappointment or anger begins to subside, perspective will largely drive what happens next. Ask:
• What’s the opportunity in this situation?
• How can we use these circumstances as an opportunity to thrive?
While the urge is to jump into action immediately, a brief period of reflection will steer you toward more innovative, lasting solutions.
Use these five steps to guide you through the process of determining what’s next:
1. Assess your circumstances realistically. What are your available resources and strengths? What are your current liabilities? Get a clear picture of resources and strengths – note everything that comes to mind, not matter how small it may seem. Examples: we have great relationships with the rest of vendors, our brand is well-recognized, and our investors are committed to us. When you make a list of your liabilities, check whether any can be converted into assets. 2. What is the opportunity? Opportunities are embedded in almost all obstacles. Stories abound of entrepreneurs who take an obstacle and turn it into asset. You can too – all it takes is a shift in mindset. Sit your team down for a brainstorming session and ask the question: Now that we’ve lost that contract, what is available to us? Although it may sound counterintuitive, this question stimulates the creative, problem solving part of the brain. Make a list of every opportunity that comes to mind, whether it seems realistic or crazy. Sometimes what seems initially off-the-wall might be exactly what you need to rebuild.
3. What have you learned? Many unexpected losses, departures or disappointments are opportunities for “course corrections”. Too often companies, teams and leaders react to solve the immediate problem – the lost account, the unexpected departure of a key player or the late product shipment – while forgetting to examine the larger picture. “What have we learned?” is a great question to ask. Even if a situation requires immediate action, it’s important to incorporate an opportunity for stakeholders to reflect collectively on the bigger picture. 4. Identify your

In response to jedwardnicky's comment: Keep in mind this "kid" you keep referring to was in a bit of trouble from time to time. I think there is a point where the imprimatur of the term "kid" doesn't apply. I think Trayvon reached that point. He was 17 yrs old. Yet you suggest that Rachel Jeantel being 19 might be too young to be a credible witness. [/QUOTE]I suggested no such thing about the 19 year old witness. As I stated several times, she was a good witness. She is also apparently illiterate and a racist. Trayvon was adult enough to smoke dope and get kicked out of school. [/QUOTE]"I think she did quite good as a witness, considering she's 19, illiterate, and a racist. " [/QUOTE]Like the quote says, she did a good job as a witness. She also demonstrated that she was illiterate, and a racist. You having a comprehension problem, or something?

I know people under 30 don't take fox news seriously. Why should they, when they have the Daily Show to feed them the news? Sigh. Keep in mind this "kid" you keep referring to was in a bit of trouble from time to time. I think there is a point where the imprimatur of the term "kid" doesn't apply. I think Trayvon reached that point. [/QUOTE]He was 17 yrs old. Yet you suggest that Rachel Jeantel being 19 might be too young to be a credible witness. [/QUOTE]jed, Good point! Also, he talks about people under 30 as " they", as if they were another demographic. Kinda does not ring true. Seems many of us have put him in the same demo from his original avatar, etc. [/QUOTE]So, the standard is that someone else can bring up people under 30 not trusting fox, but when I bring it up, it is a problem? I thorugh we settled this intellectual honesty thing. You and Jed might want to review your notes. [/QUOTE]skeeter, I only commented on his looking from the outside at those under 30 in that post. I know when we hit the reply button we pick up ALL the commentary. Perhaps in this case I should have just copied and pasted just the point I wanted to address to make it crystal clear to anyone who read that post what part I was taking issue with in that stream of comments. Looking at the history of this poster who is now down to one active name, every poster who has commented on where he falls age wise has put him in his 20s. Also as a very immature 20 something. So, my point was the lack of intellectual honesty on his part in fact. Full circle from your query. Perhaps this is just a "failure to communicate"? ("Cool Hand Luke") :) I do not see any lack of intellectual honesty on my part in this narrow but important point regarding our anti-US poster of the forums. I could say "wild child" of the forums but that is too benign. [/QUOTE]cool hand luke. Paul Newman's best movie. The egg eating contest was great.

In response to Sistersledge's comment: Zimmerman was an armed "want to be cop" with a history of violence living out a fantasy .... does that make him guilty .. no .. it makes him a strange person who was able to get an firearm I think you might be applying Cantabridgian values to this situation. Crime in Florida is off the charts compared to Massachusetts. Home break ins, car theft, etc. all unbeleivable high in comparison to the great state of Mass. Carrying a gun in many parts of Florida is nothing more than a wise idea, as the response of the police is often slow and sometimes less than useful, given that they are overwhelmed. However, I am not familiar with this particular area. It is possible that it is different.

One on ones - he doesn't take advantage of his speed, it seems like he always slows down and tries to mesmerize the defenseman with his stickhandling. Or he should do the Kessel thing every now and again and just make enough room to get off the quick shot.
The hopeless situations where he's 1 on 2, 3, or even 4 - (re: 4 he's actually tried to get passed all of them, that didn't work). Once I noticed he just dumped it, but it was a bad dump in and rebounded out far, I like to see the puck dead up against the backboards giving the next line just a little more time as the defenseman have to go all the way back to get it.
Sometimes it seems like he's expecting his line mates to be reading his mind and throws out this really awesome pass to this nice big space - that doesn't have a Bruin in it.
Is anyone else noticing similar kinds of things? He has the skills all the way, 100%. I think it's just a matter of experience. I notice the Leafs fans jump out of their seats each time Kessel touches the puck, I'd like to see Seguin have more of that kind of an effect. Right now I think Marchand is the one who is the danger man in the offensive zone

Right now I think Marchand is the one who is the danger man in the offensive zone BH, I was going to mention something similar over the weekend as lately it seems he's intent on trying to do exactly what you described usually without success. Initially I was thinking he's still young, he has to make more use of his linemates, that it was something he'd learn to do. But after seeing it again vs the Caps last Saturday I wondered if these solo missions happened during a line change leaving him the last of the Bergeron line on the ice. At that moment he was the only Bruin I could see on screen attacking the Caps' blue line. His dekes didn't work usually the result of a poke check, giving Washington possession headed in the opposite direction. Not a criticism. Just something that caught my eye lately.

Julian Edelman - WR - Patriots
Free agent WR Julian Edelman is visiting the Giants.
It's the first we've heard of Edelman since the start of free agency. The local media has been expecting Edelman to re-sign with the Patriots, but ESPN Boston believes the broken foot that landed him on injured reserve last December has been stalling his market. Edelman may be steamed the Pats signed Danny Amendola to replace Wes Welker instead of giving him a chance in the slot, but he'd have more depth-chart climbing to do in New York than New England.

There were a lot of miscues that went on today but some of the things that stood out to me - the defensive line played okay but can't seem to get pressure on the QB, Adalius Thomas is just going through the motions, never seems to make a play, at least not for the amount of dough he's earning. The secondary is either playing off the receivers or they can't cover, anyway, you have to pressure the QB or you have to cover. C'mon, Kyle Orton shouldn't be able to torch anybody like he did today, he's a career journeyman at best. Brady is not back to himself yet, give it time - but, we need another receiver. Maroney looked like he was going to play with some attitude, until he missed a blitz pickup and then got sat for the rest of the game. The Pats had their chances, just couldn't capitalize. Like I posted before, Denver has always been a tough place for N.E. to play - and get rid of those throwback uniforms, they are a jinx. You have chosen to ignore posts from NickC1188.

In Response to Re: Why did we loose today?:[QUOTE]Typical game at Mile High - flat, with no emotion. Everything looks soooo predictable on both sides of the ball. I hate to think what Peyton is going to do to the Pats if they can't muster a decent pass rush. Guess the Matt Light haters are going to see if Sea Bass is up to the challenge. Let's hope he's a quick study.Posted by RantinRaven[/QUOTE]Me too, but that's weeks away.It's not for lack of tipping/defending passes, it's for lack of coming up with interceptions from those tipped passes.

Hi Barbara,
My daughter is almost 17 months old and has always been very fussy about food. Mealtimes are a struggle and even though I know that we shouldn't force a child to eat it would sometimes come to that because she just wouldn't take anything and her doctor would show us how her percentile was dropping. She was in the 33rd percentile when she was born and now she is under the fifth. But she is a happy, very active, sassy and bright baby who is developmentally up to date. Currently she won't take any milk or vegetables. The only thing she seems to eat, and that too very little, is bread and fruits. This often entails me or my husband singing or dancing or trying anything possible to distract her while the other tries to slip some food in her mouth - exhausting as you can imagine! Should we keep this up or should I just completely leave it up to her once I have offered her food. (PS - She also has a lot of trouble pooping probably because she doesn't like to drink either and doesn't eat enough...)
From: Mili, Boston
Hi Mili, Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but I get the sense you are not getting enough help from your pediatrician. You know you can change pediatricians, right? Right?
In consulting with Brunswick, Me., pediatrician & picky-eater specialist Will Wilkoff, author of "Coping with a Picky Eater," his first bit of advice was to go back to your pediatrician and ask for more information. He has found that constipation and picky eating often go hand in hand. "You get into a vicious cycle," he said in a phone interview. "The child doesn't want to eat because she's full of poop, and she doesn't want to poop because it hurts." (The second most common cause of picky eating is over-drinking, which keeps her from getting hungry. But it doesn't sound like that's a problem here.)
The other question for your pediatrician is this: Is he/she concerned about any aspect of her health? It's not unusual for a child to drop in percentiles at about this age, but because this is a significant drop, Wilkoff would want to know that the pediatrician is confident there's no underlying medical issue. Assuming that's established, his advice is to present your daughter with a balanced diet and leave it up to her to eat or not. "Put a balanced, healthy diet in front of her and let her pick off it and trust that her natural appetite will take over," he said. No dancing around, no coaxing, no pleading. That adds tension to mealtime and that make the problem worse. "The fact of her eating or not needs to be a non-issue."
Here are Wilkoff's other recommendations: (1) Be sure the food on her plate is in appropriate bite-size and that she can manage it on her own; (2) Establish meal-time rules prior to the meal time. The best rule: "If you want more of something, you need to finish everything else on your plate first." If she doesn't want to, there's no negotiation; she can leave the table.(3) Make mealtime a pleasant social occasion with no tension, enjoyable company and no discussion of food. (4) Don't make special food for her. If she doesn't like anything, oh well. For those times when she eats nothing, be patient and calm and continue not to make an issue of it. "Over a period of several weeks, it will balance out," he said.
Here's the other thing: Don't give up! Don't stop presenting the balanced meal just because she isn't eating. And don't resort back to your acrobatic tactics. The danger in those tactics is that they can lead to disordered eating which is what leads to eating disorders. "Even at this young age," Wilkoff said. One other tip: evening is often when children eat the least. "Front-load the diet with good variety at breakfast and lunch and lower your expectations for dinner," he said. For more on picky eaters, click here for a column I wrote, and here, for a story in yesterday's New York Times.
I answer a question from a reader every weekday. If you want help with
some aspect of child-rearing, just write to me here.

CHICAGO—Ritalin and other drugs used to treat attention deficit disorder are safe for adults' hearts, even though they can increase blood pressure and heart rate, according to the largest study of these medicines in adults.The results echo findings in a study of children with ADHD, by the same researchers, published last month.The review of health records for more than 440,000 adults aged 25 to 64 showed those taking ADHD drugs had about the same number of heart attacks, strokes and sudden heart-related deaths as adults who didn't use those drugs.Although attention deficit disorder is usually thought of as a condition in childhood, many continue to have symptoms as adults, including impulsive, fidgety behavior and difficulty focusing or paying attention. ADHD affects about 4 percent of U.S. adults, roughly 9 million. About 8 percent of U.S. children aged 3 to 17, or 5 million kids, have ever been diagnosed with the disorder, government statistics show.More than 1.5 million U.S. adults were taking stimulants used for ADHD in 2005, and use of ADHD drugs increased more rapidly in adults than in kids over the past decade, the study said.The research will be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Dec. 28 print edition, but was released online Monday because of its public health importance, journal editors said.More than 150,000 ADHD medication users were involved in several states. Their health records over up to 20 years were compared with similar adults who did not use those drugs.Overall, there were 1,357 heart attacks, 575 strokes and 296 sudden cardiac deaths. Roughly equal numbers occurred in ADHD drug users and nonusers.Study participants used the drugs for an average of less than a year, which is short, but the upper range of use was almost 14 years, and there was no sign of increasing risk with longer use, the authors said, led by Laurel Habel of the research division at

If not for referee Walt Coleman’s interpretation of Brady’s fumble, Jon Gruden’s Oakland Raiders might have written an entirely different chapter.The Patriots began coming together the day Brady took over as the starting quarterback and since have authored a decade of excellence.The season unfolded in the backdrop of Sept. 11. The Patriots were greatly affected by the tragedy, as guard Joe Andruzzi’s brothers, New York City firemen, were on the scene at the Twin Towers.For the longest time Andruzzi had no idea whether his brothers had survived - only to find out they emerged safely and were true heroes.Other sidebars, perhaps insignificant compared with the nation’s tragedy: Terry GlennR
