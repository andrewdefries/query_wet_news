WASHINGTON - Senator John F. Kerry is no stranger to seemingly intractable diplomatic snarls. He flew to Islamabad to soothe tense Pakistani-US relations after the killing of Osama bin Laden. He walked the palace grounds of Afghanistan’s President Hamid Karzai to help persuade him to allow a runoff election in 2009. He flew to Sudan to assist in laying the groundwork for the country’s war-torn south to declare independence.But Kerry’s appointment to a congressional committee charged with further cutting the deficit will require him to deploy his negotiating skills on a singularly domestic dilemma: finding a way to untangle the knot of partisanship and policy over federal spending.“It’s going to take a lot of hard work. It’s going to take compromise. I think the urgency of our economy is such that hopefully it will sink in to every member that the nation is waiting for a responsible set of choices,’’ the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview last week, as prospects for a double-dip recession have been rising and markets tumbling.Kerry is one of 12 members - six Democrats and six Republicans - of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The panel is the product of torturous talks that eventually allowed the government to borrow more immediate funds in exchange for almost $1 trillion in long-term budget cuts. The committee is not expected to hold its first meeting until Congress reconvenes after Labor Day.The pressure on the committee will be high, its prospects for success significantly lower. The group has until Nov. 23 to recommend at least $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reduction measures, and Congress must approve the plan by Christmas. If it fails, further long-term cuts up to $1.2 trillion would begin in 2013, split between defense and non-defense spending.Kerry acknowledges that the committee will be in the eye of a lobbying hurricane over what to cut and what to spare that will “come from everywhere in the United St

By chance, I was in New Jersey on Saturday, so it seemed fitting to watch the game at the home of a Giants fan.John Wilpert, an engineer by profession, a football fan by avocation, was a gracious host. We got takeout from Romeo's, a large plain cheese, a large pepperoni, and Buffalo wings for the kids.At half-time, with the Giants holding a 5-point lead, Wilpert's stepson Greg called from an Army base in Alaska, where he and his St

Europe Sampling the motherland
An Italian odyssey wends through city, countryside, and kitchen, finding marriages of subtle and surprising ingredients

RAGUSA IBLA - The way homes cling to the hillsides in southern Sicilian cities often looks like an M.C. Escher drawing: Look up and there's a stairway, look down and there's a stairway, forget to look and you fall down the stairs.Contrast that tightly-packed beauty with the Ragusa region's endless fields of fruits and vegetables, almonds and olives, all neatly delineated with mile after mile of white stone walls. It's Baroque and Liberty architectural styles brought to a high point, juxtaposed with pastoral perfection, all joined and made human by the history of the table."When you look at it from far away, you feel the harmony that's been created, but there's nothing casual in that harmony," says Ciccio Sultano, who runs the kitchen at Ragusa Ibla's Il Duomo restaurant and is arguably the island's best chef. He's talking about Sicilian architecture, particularly his Baroque hometown on a hill, but this is also a key to understanding his philosophy on cuisine. "Even from the inside you feel it. . . you feel the layers of architecture piled atop one another. From past to present, history made them harmonious," he says. "When I make a recipe, I don't hide ingredients. I build upon them. It's stratified."Now, a year after my first visit to Sicily, Sultano officially restarts the tour by coming at me with a layered spoonful of contrast."This," he says cryptically, "is Sicily."Sultano had just spent a lot of time drawing a diagram of his one-bite course to explain the key contrast between sweet and bitter so that I would understand the idea. Finally, he threw in the towel and prepared the real thing.The spoon combines a rectangle of raw snapper floating on a cloud of fresh ricotta with flecks of raw spring onion, all posed under a tiny dollop of caviar. The secret weapon, represented by a black dot on his diagram, is on the bottom of the spoon - a smudge of local Corbezzolo honey.The honey is beguiling, more bitter than sweet and thick enough to be almost rough on the tongue. The textures and flavors mingle: raw milk cheese, raw fish, raw onion crunchiness, caviar's sea-saltiness. It's a mouthful of the Motherland.I began traveling to Sicily and learning about its layers last year in a three-month effort to connect with my Sicilian heritage. Francesco Padova, who works for his family's almond and olive oil business, Mastri di San Basilio, became a friend and guide, highlighting the contrasts that make this island famous: old and new, bitter and sweet, and, above all, a culture unto itself."Ciccio looks at Sicilian cooking from a simple, straightforward angle. Sometimes you have the feeling his kitchen is the only place where rural and sophisticated cuisines find common ground," says Padova. "Centuries ago, this same attitude created arancini [literally "little oranges" - cooked, stuffed rice balls], cannoli, and other Sicilian cooking staples."
At Il Duomo, placing perfect products together has magical results, like a "prosciutto" of house-smoked grouper combined with ultra-sweet melon from the nearby town of Pachino. There's also octopus, softened in a 40-minute boil before being grilled, with an orange salad. Inspired to up my cephalopod consumption, my tasting notes read simply: "Cook more octopus."After lunch, Padova and I make the short drive from Ragusa Ibla to Ragusa to meet photographer Giuseppe Leone. Compared with the region's rolling hillsides, populated mostly with sheep and lonely shepherds, the adjoining cities are compact doses of urban Sicilian culture. Old men, typically wearing driver's caps and thick glasses congregate in the town squares, their wives gathered elsewhere in smaller groups, to cook or knit in the front windows of street-level apartments.Outside, fruit and vegetable hawkers comb the city's warren of st
