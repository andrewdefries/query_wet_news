Aceves is what he is. If he was so good he wouldn't be a journeyman 5th starter.

Aceves has been awesome. There is only one slight downside to his season:21 Inherited runners8 Inherited runners scored (4 of them were Wake's runners)I think Aceves does very well following Miller and others, but perhaps someone else should relieve Wake.

In Response to Re: Aceves:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Aceves : you often question anyones motive that expresses some sort concern, thats what it predictable.Posted by Mikeyinthebronx2[/QUOTE]Not true. I respond to chronic behavior only and you don't like it because you like to see the BDC forum in a state of bickering, cat fights, and pizzin contests. You come here for entertainment and hope for the Jerry Springer Show. You prefer pot stirring, controversy, name-calling, and trolling. If it were all baseball talk then you, Yazzer, and Babe would find it to be boring and leave. You won't let Sox fans talk Red Sox baseball but need to bring up comparisons to the Yankees and and annoy like Babe does. Do you condone Babe's routine? I never hear you criticise Babe for his trolling ( to flame, incite, annoy).
