Business Italy's borrowing rates skyrocket, Monti scrambles
European Commissioner for the Economy Olli Rehn, left, is greeted by Italian Premier Mario Monti as they meet at Chigi's Premier palace in Rome, Friday, Nov. 25, 2011. Italy had to pay sharply higher borrowing rates to entice investors to part with their cash during a couple of auctions Friday, in an acute sign that Europe's crippling debt crisis is laying siege to the eurozone's third-largest economy. The auction results are another sign that the country's new technocratic government, faces a big battle to convince that it has a strategy to get a grip on the country's massive debts.

I do not think they will do any better with Gasol and/or Nash. I am ok with the idea of trading Rondo but not for someone like Gasol who comes with several years of FAT-contract. There is a reason Lakers wants to get rid of Gasol, they like to create enough cap space to bid for DH and/or DW. If we trade Rondo for draft picks or for someone whom we can dump after this year, we will have enough cap space to bid for both DH and DW. We can re-sign KG and ray-ray, mix old and new players. There is no question "THERE IS NO RING FUTURE IF THEY REBUILD AROUND RONDO" and we need to trade him.

Source: Academy of Nutrition and DieteticsElizabeth, a married 35 year old, was continually feeling exhausted. At first, she thought it was the typical fatigue that accompanies a busy schedule of raising three active adolescents and juggling her own life. Her daily fatigue caused her to minimized the times that she climbed the stairs to the second floor of her home as she found that the mere 14 steps took her breathe away. One afternoon, she dozed off at 4 pm while folding the wash only to be awakened by her son at 6 pm asking about dinner. At this point, she nervously knew something was very wrong. Thinking the worse, she made an appointment with her physician. After a number of tests, her doctor diagnosed her as having celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder. Elizabeth isn’t alone in her disorder. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more than 2 million people have the di

Dr. Mark Post with cultured burger. Courtesy of Maastricht UniversityWhen buying ground beef in future, you may need to not only look on the label to make sure that it is lean but you may have to also decide if you want the variety that came naturally from a cow or the one that was grown in a petri dish. Today in London, Professor Mark Post MD, PhD, from Maastricht University in Netherlands unveiled the first lab meat produced using stem cells from cows and grown in his lab. The stem cells were fed protein, fat, and carbohydrates and cultivated to grow muscle meat. For more on the process of creating cultured beef, click here.His goal was achieved today by taking this laboratory grown muscle meat and creating a hamburger.
