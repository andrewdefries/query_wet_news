I agree, It has now been 5 months since this contest ended. I know I got all 28 shots. Sounds like someone really dropped the ball on this one. Please give us an update.

I have been wondering the same thing for months. This contest got me interested in photography and I took all 28 photos. It has been very disappointing to never have seen a resolution and winner.

The February contest was the first I entered, I got all 28 photos as well. I watched as March and April were judged pretty quickly, so I entered May's contest. Now I am still waiting on the results for February and May. I don't know if this is even worth it anymore...My biggest issue is that no one has even posted an update to let us know what is going on, I understand the February contest was a lot to go through, but I just think some type of update is just common courtesy.

So the first three lines have been discussed over the past week or so but what about the make up of the 4th line? It was integral in our cup run so what do you think it will look like. Campbell? Soderberg? Does Thornton finally sit and we bring up someone with a smidge of talent? You have chosen to ignore posts from DaveyN.

It will likely be the same, though I wouldn't mind seeing Fraser replace Thornton. From the sounds of it he can do what Thornton does and more.

Just wondering what the forum thinks: does Gronk get in there against the Bills? Or does he need another week or so of practice/recuperation?
