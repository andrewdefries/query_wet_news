The Economy's
'Dolt Factor'
By Robert
Parry
September 9, 2001
George
W. Bushs public relations strategy in the face of a slumping economy is to
convince the American people that hes personally concerned about the
depressed stock prices and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The word concerned has become a staple of Bushs
remarks, whether at Labor Day rallies or on the White House lawn. Bush has even declared his strong affection for the
American people. During an appearance in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday with
Mexicos President Vicente Fox, Bush announced that Fox loves the people of
Mexico, and I hope by now theres no question that I love the people of
America as well.
Bush elaborated on his concern Friday in comments about the
sharp increase in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent. Any American out of
work is one too many Americans out of work, Bush said.
Clearly, the younger Bush doesnt want to make the
mistake his father made when he seemed to be insensitive to the suffering of
Americans during the last recession in the early 1990s. So Bushs
speechwriters have inserted frank rhetoric about the existence of an economic
problem  the slowdown is real, Bush said Friday  combined with
expressions of sympathy for the average guy  its affecting too many
lives, and were concerned about it.
As for how the White House will address these deepening
economic woes, Bush reaffirmed his commitment to his legislative agenda:
maintain the $1.35 trillion tax cut, open new government lands for oil and
natural gas drilling, and grant the president more power to speed trade
agreements.
But Bushs words did nothing to boost the spirits on Wall
Street.
Prior to Bushs talk, the stock market had been making a
modest rally, reversing some of the heavy losses earlier in the day. As Bush
spoke, however, the Dow Industrial index slipped lower again, eventually
dropping about 30 more points before trading ended with the Dow at 9,605.85,
matching lows not seen since March and April. The broader Standard &
Poors index of 500 stocks fell to its lowest point in three years.
The markets reaction to Bushs talk was so striking
that the CNBC anchor asked one of the networks floor reporters what traders
were saying. The reporter recounted how the traders simply shrugged their
shoulders at Bushs remarks, with one trader dismissing Bushs comments as
just words.
Hollow Ring
To other Americans, Bushs protestations of concern may
have the hollow ring of his fathers famous recitation of a talking point
during the 1992 campaign, Message: I care. Or the younger Bush's own
garbled expression of sympathy for the average Joe in the 2000 campaign: I
know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.
The younger Bush might be missing another important point.
During an economic slump, Americans expect more from a president than sympathy
and awareness of the obvious. They want someone who can rally the nation out of
its economic doldrums and instill a confident can-do spirit.
The historic benchmark is Franklin Roosevelts
exhortation that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Voters saw
some of that uplifting rhetoric in presidents from John Kennedy to Ronald
Reagan. For boundless optimism, few presidents could match Bill Clinton who
convinced many voters that he really did wake up every morning thinking about
what he could do to make their lives better.
Clinton also surrounded himself with shrewd thinkers 
the likes of Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers  who understood the complex
three-dimensional nature of modern world economics. One could disagree with
their strategies but few questioned their subtle appreciation for business
intricacies as they navigated economic threats, from the Asian flu
financial contagion to credit crises in Mexico, Russia and Brazil.
By contrast, Bushs economi
