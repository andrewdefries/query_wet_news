Pushing Obama to Confront Iran By Ivan Eland June 22, 2009
Editor’s Note: There is a growing consensus across the American political spectrum that the Iranian election was rigged, that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s reelection was fraudulent and that the U.S. government must do more to support the “green” revolution of Mir Hossein Mousavi.
But the facts are much less clear (it remains entirely possible that the rural and urban poor rewarded Ahmadinejad for his social programs by backing him in large numbers). It’s also unclear what President Barack Obama’s best policy option might be, as the Independent Institute’s Ivan Eland notes in this guest essay:
When massive turmoil occurs in an important country, U.S. policymakers struggle to make heads or tails of it and arrive at an appropriate reaction. Kibitzers and pundits, however, have no trouble reaching immediate and sweeping conclusions and egging on the policymakers to further their own agendas.
So far, President Obama has done a reasonably good job in resisting such on-the-spot analyses and advice on the massive protests over the election in Iran.
Hawks on the Right have criticized Obama’s engagement policy with a country they nostalgically remember in the “Axis of Evil” and have urged him to speak out forcefully about alleged election fraud by the Iranian government. Sen. John McCain fumed on the Today show, “He should speak out that this is a corrupt, flawed sham of an election.”
Danielle Pletka and Ali Alfoneh of the neo-conservative American Enterprise Institute argued that you don’t have to be paranoid to wonder if the crude vote rigging was done on purpose to trigger massive protests so that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard could launch a military coup against the theocratic regime.
