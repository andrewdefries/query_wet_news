Million Mask March Tags
Anonymous, Protest Members and supporters of hacktivist collective Anonymous marked Guy Fawkes Day with a global ‘Million Mask March’ designed to protest against government corruption, corporate malfeasance and the expanding surveillance state.
Read RT's live updates on the march protests.
The global action on November 5 is Anonymous’ annual
commemoration of Guy Fawkes Day, a British holiday celebrated
with fireworks and bonfires. Fawkes is remembered today as the
most prominent member of the failed Gunpowder Plot, a 1605
attempt to assassinate King James I of England. The notorious
plotter, and his facial likeness, in particular, has become a
symbol for the fight against tyranny for the Anonymous hacking
collective.
Event organizers used social media to plan rallies and marches at
more than 450 locations around the world. Hundreds of people
turned out in each New York City, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and
other US cities.
A small number of protesters were arrested in Washington, the
first coming before 10:00 am local time when a marchers stepped
off the sidewalk and into the street. A focal point of the DC
protest was the ongoing, invasive surveillance methods employed
by the National Security Agency as well as lingering American
inequality.
The Washington rally began with a meet-up near the Washington
Monument before marching up the street and dispersed after
spending some time at the White House.

“We want President Obama to hear that five years after the
financial crisis – the banks being bailed out – we’re still
suffering, people are still suffering, we’re drowning in
debt,” one participant told RT from near the White House.
“We live in a country that is fundamentally unfair, we no
longer have the rule of law,” he continued. “From the
NSA, to Edward Snowden, to Chelsea Manning, all over the world,
people are speaking out, whistleblowers are speaking out, regular
people are speaking out and saying enough is enough. We want
justice and we want it now.”

Thousands showed up for a rally in London’s Trafalgar Square,
where supporters of Anonymous have traditionally congregated in
huge numbers on past Guy Fawkes Days. Marchers could be heard
chanting “Here we come, Tory scum” as they made their
way through the city and toward Parliament.
RT Correspondent Sara Firth reported that 11 people were arrested
throughout the day in London, where demonstrators, joined by
actor and comedian Russell Brand, eventually made their way to
Buckingham Palace before splintering into smaller groups.

On the website for London’s OpVendetta event, an administrator
wrote, “Anonymous have changed the rules by turning this
morality of petition into more of a festival of ideas and new age
discussion that has formed the political views of the youth of
today. Anonymous understand now that we have filled the void in
the protest world that others have failed Anonymous have managed
to hold on to the system of having no system which allows
everyone's beliefs to join the great debate.”

“To remind this world what it has forgotten, that fairness,
justice and freedom are more than just words,” is the stated
aim, according to the gathering’s Facebook page.

Often described in the media as a loose-knit collective,
Anonymous was propelled to public prominence over the last years
for a series of politically-motivated cyber-attacks on businesses
and government institutions. Groups calling themselves by that
name targeted entertainment industry, financial institutions,
websites of governments from Latin America to Asia and
international organizations.
The agenda of those behind Tuesday’s protests was wide-ranging.
The movement is said to be growing in strength as global citizens
report greater dissatisfaction with their local governments and
because of the perception that corporations have a stranglehold
on international politics.
The deeply unpopular Monstano corporation, which champions the
benefits of genetically modified food, was among the favorite
targets of those who were demonstrating Tuesday.
“We are not slowing down, we are speeding up,” John
Anthony Fairhurst, one of the organizers of the Million Mask
March in Washington, DC, told RT. “These people all over the
world need some serious change.”

As a worldwide movement, Anonymous-at-large has in the past
rallied in support of the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and Army
soldier-turned-whistleblower Chelsea Manning. They supported Arab
Spring anti-dictatorship protesters in the Middle East as well as
the Occupy Wall Street movement, which started in New York City
two years ago, but has since spread across the world as a means
of addressing the overt, allegedly corrupt ties between
corporations and the authorities.

Progressivism = Communism
The Problem is the greed at the top, the culture of corruption amongst the 1percent and their stranglehold on power, and in America we need to halt the march towards communism. The global banking cabal is focused on ruining our Republic!!!!!! 0
