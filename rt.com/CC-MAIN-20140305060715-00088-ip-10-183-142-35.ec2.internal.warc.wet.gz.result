EU, France, Politics, UK Britain should be a player in the EU, but can’t ‘cherry pick’ what part of Europe to take or to leave, Denis MacShane, former UK Minister for Europe told RT, as the debates of the nation’s membership in the union continue.
Addressing the euro skepticism growing throughout the UK,
British Prime Minister says he intends to let British citizens
decide if they want to be members of the EU in a vote in
2017. French President Francois Hollande, criticizing Britain's
antipathy, reminded the UK that France, Germany and other nations
made up the European Economic Community (EEC) long before Britain
signed on fully in January 1973. “Europe existed before Britain joined it,” Hollande said
during a nearly three-hour press conference Thursday. MacShane stressed that the current EU is worse than a
“playground” with the way nations continue to blame each
other for the coalition’s troubles. No member state has ever left the EU, although the British did
hold a referendum on whether to continue their membership in 1975,
two years after the country’s initial entry into the collective.
Imminent structural change to the EU, spearheaded by France’s
Hollande, has reignited British debate over the country’s place in
the bloc.RT: The French President had harsh words for
Britain... deserved, do you think?Denis MacShane: I think you’d find a lot of British
politicians who’d agree with him, that Britain would be better off
outside of the European Union. And almost every day you see papers
writing here or go and listen to debates in the House of Commons
where people are lecturing the French and everybody else in Europe
on what to do. Sadly, the EU at the moment is a giant blame game,
finger pointing - ‘it’s you’, it’s not me, I’m the ‘good boy, I’m
going to get better!’ Brits blame the French, the French blame the
Germans, the Germans blame the Spanish. Frankly, playgrounds have
got more adults these days then the top leadership of
Europe.RT: In the past you've called for Britain to join the
Eurozone - what's your position on that now?DM: We should be fully integrated. We have a heavily
devalued pound and yet the balance of trade, what we export, is
getting worse and worse. Either we should be properly in, or
perhaps, I’m coming to the conclusion and many people are in this
country, thanks to the kind of political leadership we’ve had in
the recent years, it’s likely we may decide to leave. And
then Europe will be split asunder and every European country, not
just Britain will be much weaker as a result. RT: You've been an outspoken Europe-supporter for
years, are you actually supporting exit now?DM: Not at all. I think Britain should be a player, we
can be a player. A lot of the points put forward by Mr. Cameron and
other British political leaders have a lot of good sense in them,
but I also think that points put forward by Mrs. Merkel and
François Hollande have sense - that Britain can’t ‘cherry pick,’
Britain can’t come in and say we take this little bit of Europe not
all the rest. We are moving after the catastrophe of the banking
crisis where the banks were run by all these people who destroyed
the economy in 2008 and we are still living with the disasters of
their incompetence. I think we should have more banking
supervision, what is called a banking union. I think Britain should
be part of that.RT: In the past, you've said the Euro would not lead
to a European super-state - but doesn't the European Central Bank
now having oversight over Eurozone banks contradict this?DM: No, what I’m saying is that we need a much tougher
regulatory systems for banks. We’ve got them in place for trade. We
had them in place 60 years ago for the coal and steel industries of
Europe. Britain said no to that. It made no difference; it wasn’t
the arrival of a super state. What Europe needs, what we all need
around the world is to do away with tax havens, tax dodging, to do
away with people parking their money in London, Switzerland,
Luxemburg or whatever to dodge taxes - we need to have much
tougher supervision. More broadly speaking, my country, Britain has
been going through 20 years of non-stop campaigning. We have just
seen the death of Mrs. Thatcher, she contributed to this, and Mr.
Cameron and all of the political leadership at the moment on the
conservative side are the children of Mrs. Thatcher. And
they’ve been telling us for years that Europe is a terrible thing
with awful people and we have to do as little with it as possible.
Now, I think the British people are believing it and saying, ‘ok,
give us a vote, maybe we’ll leave the EU’. And France, Germany,
Poland and France are saying ‘ok, we’d rather you stay, but if you
really want to go – bye-bye!’
