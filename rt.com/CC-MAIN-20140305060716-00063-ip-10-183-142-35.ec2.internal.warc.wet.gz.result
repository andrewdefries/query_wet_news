Conflict, India, Politics, USA The US has double standards when it comes to diplomatic relations, dean of Jindal School of International Affairs, Sreeram Chaulia, told RT while commenting on the humiliating detention and strip search of a female Indian diplomat in New York.
RT: It seems that India and the US are in
the middle of a diplomatic spat. New Delhi is being very specific
regarding its retaliation – arresting same sex partners of
foreign mission employees and stripping US diplomats of immunity
and privileges. Where will it end? Are we just going to see this
go back and forth?
Sreeram Chaulia: I hope not, but diplomacy
operates on the principal of reciprocity and I’m afraid the
Americans have not shown the basic courtesies to our diplomat in
New York. And we have every right to retaliate with appropriate
measures of our own. This has not been savory at all. It’s been
rather nasty and we would have never wanted this in the first
place, but the US State Department has always applied double
standards. Think about the Raymond Davies case involving a US CIA
contractor undercover as a diplomat in Pakistan who killed two
citizens. President Obama came out at the time and put a lot of
pressure on Pakistan to save their so-called diplomat who was
actually a spy - and a killer to boot - and said “you know
there’s a broader principle at stake. This is diplomatic
immunity." We use the same logic with this case. It was a far
smaller offense, it was a much less grave crime, it was a
domestic dispute between our diplomat and her domestic helper.
But they escalated it to a point where you know she was strip
searched and humiliated, so we have every right. US diplomats
often get away with a lot in many foreign postings and we have
been extending these courtesies because in diplomacy, you need to
do it in order for the relations to go ahead. But unfortunately
the Americans seem to have thought that India is a banana
republic and doesn’t have the spine to hit back. So we have taken
measures, but we hope that the Americans will see sense. US
Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed regrets, but that is
actually insufficient because we have been demanding a firmer
apology. But nonetheless, I think they will see sense because
reciprocity means if you do bad you will also get bad. If You
give respect, you get respect.
RT: You mentioned John Kerry’s statement.
The diplomat’s lawyer also says that investigators made certain
mistakes when looking into the actual claim of visa fraud. Why
won’t the US back down and review the case? Especially after
hearing such words as “regret” from such high-ranking
officials?
SC: They should. I mean, the argument that they
have their own independent legal process does not apply here,
simply because the issue of bilateral relations takes precedence
over the nitty-gritty of legal legalia. And in this case, it
could very well be true that our diplomat made a mistake or
otherwise. But that is for the technical issues. We are more
incensed about the lack of sensitivity on the part of the US
government and the State Department, which initiated the
complaint in the first place, and all its unsavory business.
RT: This is really the first strong action
by New Delhi against the US in years. What does it mean for the
bilateral relationship between the two, as you see it?
SC: It is a relatively robust bilateral
relationship with both economic and security aspects…remember
this lady was not just a private citizen who just committed some
small infraction; she was a representative of the state, a
diplomatic symbol of the bilateral relationship. And I don’t
think she should have been dealt with in the manner she was, no
matter what her fault was. And I think the Indians are sending a
clear message that we want to be with the US as equals; not as
superordinate and subordinate. The world has changed and it needs
to adjust its lenses; [the US] cannot have double standards - one
for its diplomats and the other for diplomats from what they
possibly consider to be third world countries. We want respect,
and I think that has been the overall message of stronger
measures and reactions in India.

USA do not need india at all. They just want to use india as irritant against china just like china use pakistan. Thats about it. India is unevolved country full of upper caste racists. If there is one country needs to be nuked out of extinction , it should be india. The funny part is 80% live in poor , 20% robbing the 80% and enjoying. India is one pathetic country.
