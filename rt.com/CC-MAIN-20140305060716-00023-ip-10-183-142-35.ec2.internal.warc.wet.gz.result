Children, Crime, Health, USA The foster mother of a 2-year-old Texas girl has been charged with murder after the toddler she brought into her home earlier this year died last week from a severe head injury.
Alexandria Hill was placed into the custody of 54-year-old
Sherill Small in January after the Texas Department of Family and
Protective Services determined she was being neglected by her
previous foster parents. Now Small is being held on $100,000 bond
after Hill passed away last Wednesday while in her care.
The girl’s biological father, Joshua Hill, told KVUE-TV that he
and Alexandria’s mother lost full custody of their daughter last
November after the DFPS accused them of “neglectful supervision.”
Mr. Hill said the agency made that determination "because her
mother and I smoked pot at the time." According to the
father, the parents only smoked while their daughter was asleep.
“We never hurt our daughter,” Mr. Hill told KVUE on
Thursday. “She was never sick, she was never in the hospital,
and she never had any issues until she went into state care.”
It was only then, Hill said, that things started to go wrong.
“She would come to visitation with bruises on her, and mold
and mildew in her bag. It got to a point where I actually told
CPS [Child Protective Services] that they would have to have me
arrested because I wouldn't let her go back," he told KVUE.
Then seven months ago, Alexandria was placed into Small’s house
in Rockdale, Texas, where her biological parents were allowed to
make occasional visits. That all ended last week, though, after
the girl died at an area hospital.
Hill told KVUE that he got a phone call Monday night telling him
his daughter was on life support at the Scott and White
Children’s Emergency Hospital in Temple, Texas.
“They wouldn't tell me what condition she was in or what was
wrong or what had happened. The only thing they would tell me is
I needed to be there. When I got there, I found out that Alex was
in a coma,” he said.
To make matters even more confusing, the adopted mother altered
her story after Alexandria was admitted to the hospital. First
Small told investigators during a routine police report that she
had been spinning the girl around in circles when she
accidentally let go of Alexandria’s hands, sending the child to
the ground where she hit her head on the carpet. During a
physical examination, however, doctors found three symptoms of
traumatic brain injury and began asking more questions. The
foster mom later admitted to being frustrated with the girl and
swinging her over her head and down near the ground with a
“lot of force” three times. On the third time,
Alexandria’s head hit the floor.
Police arrested Small on Thursday after her foster child’s death
and charged her with criminal homicide, a first-degree felony in
Texas. An autopsy report released the following day concluded
that blunt-force trauma to the head caused the girl’s death.
A spokesperson for the Texas DFPS told KXAN News that Small was
previously accused of neglect after a child in her care was
reportedly suffering from bruising and lead poisoning, “but no
deficiencies were found.” A second foster child was removed
from her care on Monday.

We are sharing our family's abduction by our county of our children. It's all true and now the courts and CPS are attempting to end our daughters life by forcing her to take adult Psychotropic drugs. Over 20 court hearing transcripts have vanished. Our daughter is sharing the truth about our case and this is threatening the foster parent's pocketbook. The Foster dad left his wife after understanding what has taken place. For our interviews, please see them on Youtube at, Santa Clara County Corruption EXPOSED 1....and Santa Clara County Corruption EXPOSED 2 ....Thank You!

Someone needs to investigate child protective and Foster parents because this is a racket. This is all about the money that people are making from taxpayers. Obviously, the people in positions of authority are incompetent vile evil people professing to do good. Unless a child is suffering server physical abuse no child should ever be removed from their parents. Child protective services is another emotional political tool used to deprive you of your rights as parents and to elect another idiot to office. +1
