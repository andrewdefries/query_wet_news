What do you mean by 'gold peg' - is that different from gold backed. Many years ago US dollar was a silver certificate - you could actually go to a fed bank and turn them in for silver. I really doubt the Chinese would be stupid enough to issue a real gold peg currency. If they do, there will be lots of questions, first and foremost: do they have the physical gold reserves to really back the currency. And will you be able to exchange the paper for gold. If not, it is a meaningless sham.
