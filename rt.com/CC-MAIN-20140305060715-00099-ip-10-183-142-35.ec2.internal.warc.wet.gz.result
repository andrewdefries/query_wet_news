Intelligence, Military, Opposition, Politics, Syria, Terrorism, USA Washington knew Syrian rebels could produce sarin gas but “cherry-picked” intel to blame President Assad for the Aug. 21 attack on Ghouta, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has revealed, citing senior US security sources.
The report was published in the London Review of Books after
two of Hersh’s regular publishers, The New Yorker and The
Washington Post, turned the article down.
Hersh, whose Pulitzers were for his exposes on American military
misconduct in the Iraq and Vietnam wars, got his information on
Syria from whistle-blowing acting and former intelligence and
military officers, who for security reasons were not identified
in the report.
According to Hersh’s findings, months before the chemical weapons
attack on the outskirts of Damascus, which almost prompted US air
strikes on Syria, “the American intelligence agencies
produced a series of highly classified reports… citing evidence
that the Al-Nusra Front, a jihadi group affiliated with Al-Qaeda,
had mastered the mechanics of creating sarin and was capable of
manufacturing it in quantity.”
The attack took place on August 21, the same day UN inspectors
arrived in Damascus to investigate allegations of use of chemical
weapons. The casualty figures have ranged from several hundred to
more than 1,400 deaths.
Before the attack, the Obama administration repeatedly described
the use of chemical weapons in Syria as a “red line,” which would
signal the US could intervene in the conflict.
Hersh wrote that he does not believe the intelligence data,
pointing at the rebels’ having capability for making sarin, could
have in any way escaped the White House’s attention.
“Already by late May, the senior intelligence consultant told
me, the CIA had briefed the Obama administration on Al-Nusra and
its work with sarin,” he wrote.
Obama’s laying the blame for the nerve gas attack on Assad’s
forces, completely disregarding Al-Nusra as a suspect in the
case, is thus described in the report as the administration’s
having “cherry-picked intelligence to justify a strike against
Assad.”
“The cherry-picking was similar to the process used to
justify the Iraq war,” Hersh wrote.
It’s because of the lack of sufficient evidence against Assad
that Obama quickly abandoned his plan for military strikes.
“Any possibility of military action was definitively averted
on 26 September when the administration joined Russia in
approving a draft UN resolution calling on the Assad government
to get rid of its chemical arsenal,” the report reads.
“Obama’s retreat brought relief to many senior military
officers. (One high-level special operations adviser told me that
the ill-conceived American missile attack on Syrian military
airfields and missile emplacements, as initially envisaged by the
White House, would have been ‘like providing close air support
for al-Nusra’.)”
The investigative journalist then points at an annual budget for
all national intelligence programs, leaked to the media by Edward
Snowden and partly published by The Washington Post. According to
the document, by the time of the Eastern Ghouta chemical attack,
the NSA “no longer had access to the conversations of the top
military leadership in Syria, which would have included crucial
communications from Assad, such as orders for a nerve gas
attack”. That puts to question the confidence with which
Obama spoke of Assad’s responsibility for the deaths.
The same document described “a secret sensor system inside
Syria, designed to provide early warning of any change in status
of the regime’s chemical weapons arsenal”. Hersh wrote it
was suspicious that the US intelligence received no alarm, if the
Assad forces really prepared for an attack.
Hersh also analyses the news coverage of the chemical gas attack
investigation, pointing to instances when the media outlets
omitted the information that suggested there could be other
suspects, beside Assad.
The UN September 16 report, confirming the use of sarin,
contained one part that noted that the organization’s experts did
not have immediate access to the attack sites controlled by
rebels, so potential evidence could have been manipulated there.
The passage was largely ignored in the news.
Following the release of the report, the spokesman for Director
of National Intelligence, Shawn Turner, denied the report’s major
point – that the US knew of the rebel group being capable of
creating sarin.
“We were clear with The Washington Post and Mr. Hersh that
the intelligence gathered about the 21 August chemical weapons
attack indicated that the Assad regime and only the Assad regime
could have been responsible,” Turner told Buzzfeed. “Any
suggestion that there was an effort to suppress intelligence
about a nonexistent alternative explanation is simply
false.”
Hersh has remained unconvinced by the denial and has summed it up
with a warning against ignoring alleged Al-Nusra’s chemical
weapons potential.
“While the Syrian regime continues the process of eliminating
its chemical arsenal, the irony is that, after Assad’s stockpile
of precursor agents is destroyed, Al-Nusra and its Islamist
allies could end up as the only faction inside Syria with access
to the ingredients that can create sarin, a strategic weapon that
would be unlike any other in the war zone. There may be more to
negotiate.”

The Golan Heights should be given back immediately to Syria and Palestine should absorb Israel back into the Palestine pre 1948 (1984 citizen cane) when all people regardless of race or creed lived and worked together in peace. 0

fish ghuts 10.12.2013 13:02 j ust go read brown moses blog. none of us, including Hersh, are as smart or as obsessive as Elliot Higgins. He is like the little internet guy who is single handedly smarter than the entire CIA and MI5. A tubby little British media school dropout who relies on watching videos smarter than Pulitzer Prize-winning Seymour Hersh? No thanks, lol

This is old news. We all know that they always carefuly pick what they let their media publish, and even fabricate the evidence if they think that they need to.
