Fighting, Hockey, Juniors A video of mass brawl between two Russian junior ice hockey teams has become a blockbuster in the Russian part of YouTube.
A game between two junior teams, Moscow’s White Bears and Metallurg Novokuznetsk, was supposed to be the jewel of the Yamaha Cup being held in the Moscow region. Both squads, made up of players born in 2002, were unbeaten going into the game, but it turned into a non-stop brawl and was suspended long before the final whistle.At the time it was stopped the Muscovites were leading 3-0. The run of play had annoyed their rivals; however, instead of trying to change the situation for the better they embarked on a less estimable way of settling scores. When 30 players from each side found themselves in the penalty box the referee had no other option but to stop the game.No surprise, the video of the brawl-packed action got around 100,000 hits in just a few days.As the American sports website deadspin.com put it, Russian players don't have the best reputation as fighters in the NHL, but the next generation of Russian hockey stars seems set at changing that.
