Why the rom-com is almost extinct
View Photo Gallery — Ann Hornaday’s top romantic comedies: Romantic comedies have been missing from movie theaters recently, but Joss Whedon’s soon-to-be-released “Much Ado About Nothing” might create a comeback for the genre. Like Shakespeare’s Beatrice and Benedick, here are 11 other romances that stand the test of time. By Ann Hornaday, E-mail the writer
The romantic comedy is back.
It took only 400 years.
“Much Ado About Nothing,” Joss Whedon’s larky adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play that opens Friday, transposes the action from 17th-century Sicily to modern-day Santa Monica, where in Whedon’s sprightly re-imagining, the verbally sparring Beatrice and Benedick fall in love in the director’s own modern mission-style home, amid shots of tequila, beeping iPhones and scads of political intrigue.But Shakespeare’s play — with its deceptions, schemes, setbacks and ultimate victory of true love — also serves as a sobering reminder of how romantically impoverished mainstream American cinema has become. “Much Ado,” which for decades served as the classic template for bickering couples such as Hepburn and Tracy, Day and Hudson and Ryan and Hanks, has gradually devolved into “Nothing.” Ask hard-core romantic comedy fans for the best recent example of a big-studio romantic comedy and they’re likely to squint and strain before maybe mentioning “The Proposal,” a creaking Sandra Bullock-Ryan Reynolds vehicle from 2009.Summertime used to be a season in which audiences could take a break from their seasonal diet of special-effects spectacles with a shiny, star-driven romantic comedy starring America’s Sweetheart du Jour. But lately, that cinematic palate cleanser has been mysteriously off the menu. Last year, the closest thing to a summer rom-com hit was “Ted,” about a romance between a man and his . . . teddy bear.This summer, we have equally male-driven wish-fulfillment fantasies like “The Hangover Part III,” “This Is the End” and “The Internship,” in which boy-girl stuff — if present at all — is strictly an afterthought. (The sisters, too, are doing it for themselves: In the beguiling comedy “Frances Ha,” the title character’s most ardent romance is with her female best friend, her third-act triumph arriving when she moves into her own apartment, alone.)The reasons for the current dearth of frothy, funny, sigh-inducing entertainment are what an economist might call over-determined. For one thing, at a time when issues like gay marriage, women’s role as (underpaid) breadwinners and the morning-after pill are in ascendancy, old-fashioned stories that confect ways to keep their heterosexual couples apart until a suitably dewy third act seem hopelessly retrograde. Meg Ryan playfully scandalized audiences when she faked an orgasm in “When Harry Met Sally”; today, production is ramping up for a movie version of the steamily explicit bodice-heaver “Fifty Shades of Grey.” As CIA deputy director — and former independent bookstore owner — Avril Haines once noted in a recently unearthed quote, “Erotica has become more prevalent because people are trying to have sex without having sex.”Sex-free sex might be the ultimate symptom of a millennial generation that is hooking up, de-friending and otherwise avoiding long-term commitment while it rides out a rocky and uncertain economy. It wouldn’t be that surprising if, instead of using their discretionary income to watch rich, attractive people engage in courtship rituals they themselves can’t afford, young adults might instead seek refuge and reassurance in stories predicated on same-sex friendship: Goodbye, “Annie Hall.” Hello, “Bridesmaids.” If the current absence of big-screen romance reflects trends at play in society at large, it also reflects a broader realignment in Hollywood, where in a desperate attempt to minimize risk and maximize profits, studios are throwing everything overboard that isn’t based on a best-selling novel or game or comic book. It bears noting that, just before Whedon made the charmingly lo-fi “Much Ado About Nothing,” he wrapped production on the mega-budget Marvel Comics extravaganza “The Avengers.”To further hedge their bets, studios in recent years have cravenly sought to make movies that appeal across all four demographic quadrants (young men and young women, older men and older women). Like the “romaction” genre that fuses relationships and car crashes (think “Date Night” and “Knight and Day”), hard-R comedies like “The Hangover,” “Bad Teacher” and last year’s “Ted” appeal both to young women and their male companions, a “two-quadrant” win that made studio suits swoon. But even that brand of demographics-as-destiny thinking is being retooled as huge new markets in China and beyond begin to show American movies in their spanking-new multiplexes. With the international box office now accounting for up to 70 percent of a film’s revenue, studios are looking for anything that transcends language and cultural mores. In other words, more pow, bang, boom, less kiss-kiss, blah-blah. Mike Tyson and a tiger — or Maya Rudolph relieving herself in the middle of the street — speak volumes in any vernacular.As the veteran producer and Hollywood explainer Lynda Obst writes in her witty and wise new primer “Sleepless in Hollywood: Tales From the New Abnormal in the Movie Business”: “Humor is local. People like their hilarious indigenous customs, built around their own private jokes.” The emerging markets that Hollywood most covets might still rely on the United States for big, expensive franchise pictures. But they’re increasingly producing their own rom-coms. One of the most successful movies in China this year has been Xue Xiaolu’s “Finding Mr. Right,” a Ryan-and-Hanks-worthy tale of star-crossed romance set in — where else? — Seattle.Historically, big stars like Ryan, Julia Roberts and Bullock have been able to overcome cinematic localism. The question is whether the next generation is up to the task. One unforeseen upshot of Hollywood’s Franchise Culture is that it’s not minting the kind of actresses who can take up the girl-next-door mantle with convincing ease or instant appeal. Emma Watson and Kristen Stewart both starred in huge franchises (“Harry Potter” and “Twilight,” respectively). But neither has the range, approachability or sunny sexiness to successfully pull off the all-American rom-com heroine.Happily, there are glorious exceptions that prove the rule: Jennifer Lawrence (“The Hunger Games”) and Emma Stone (“The Amazing Spider-Man”) possess just the right relatability, physical charm and acting chops to have the makings of ideal romantic leads, and both have already acquitted themselves well within the genre, in “Silver Linings Playbook” and “Crazy, Stupid, Love.” And, like the adult dramas that Franchise Culture has made virtually obsolete on the big screen, the classic opposites-attract rom-com can still be found on television, whether by way of Lena Dunham in “Girls,” Zooey Deschanel in “New Girl” or Emily Mortimer and Jeff Daniels trading screwball barbs in “The Newsroom.”Meanwhile, from the American sweethearts who remain, precious little is being heard, at least this summer. Granted, Bullock does have a new movie coming out next week. It’s an opposites-attract comedy, in which her Beatrice is a by-the-book FBI agent who pursues an unlikely relationship with a rough-and-tumble city cop. Sandy’s Benedick, it will surprise few to learn, will be played by Melissa McCarthy. Reprints

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try

Do we have to wait 30 years for human rights in China?
By Fred Hiatt, When President Obama on Wednesday expressed the hope that "30 years from now, we will have seen further evolution" in China's respect for human rights, I thought about Geng He, who had come to visit me the day before.
Geng He, 43, is a soft-spoken woman who doesn't know whether her husband, Gao Zhisheng, is dead or alive. She knows that over the past five years, he has been repeatedly tortured by Chinese security agents. She knows that he was last seen nine months ago, when some of those agents spirited him away. She's pretty sure that he has not been charged with a crime, but the government will not say where he is.

Why I’m running for Congress
Gao is not a dissident. He is something China's government apparently finds even more threatening: a lawyer who has sought, while adhering scrupulously to Chinese law, to represent dissidents, members of religious minorities and other victims of Communist Party repression."For him, being a lawyer is more than just a profession," Geng told me. "He's tried to educate the public about justice, about the law, and about what's right or wrong. Now, there seems to be no room for someone like that to survive in China."Geng had hoped that Obama would speak out about her husband's case, both because such attention might help him and because Obama's words could have a big impact more broadly in China. As she wrote in a Post op-ed last year:"I worry about the next generation of Chinese lawyers. Will disappearances like my husband's deter them from becoming rights defenders? I imagine so. But if the United States were to speak out on my husband's behalf, perhaps this would change."And also:"My 8-year-old son, Peter, was surprised to discover last week that President Obama is a lawyer. To him, lawyers are people the government throws into prison, not leaders of the government itself. He asked me whether this meant that President Obama could help free his father. I told him that I hoped so. We are waiting to see."Obama said in a prepared statement, leading off a White House news conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, that the two leaders had discussed human rights in their private meeting. I hope those discussions will help Gao as well as other individuals Obama chose not to mention publicly, such as imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia, who is under de facto house arrest. When I asked whether Obama had raised Gao's case with China's president, a White House spokesman e-mailed me that "the President referred to the list of names he had raised in the past that included Gao."What may have a bigger impact is Obama's apparent acceptance, in his off-the-cuff answers, of China's own rationalizations for repression: that "China's at a different stage of development than we are"; that "part of human rights is people being able to make a living and having enough to eat"; and, most of all, that "there has been an evolution in China over the last 30 years. . . . And my expectation is that 30 years from now we will have seen further evolution and further change."What's alarming is not just that 30 years is a long time to ask Gao's two children to wait. It's the assumption that China is moving, perhaps too slowly but inexorably, in the right direction, because that's how nations evolve as they become more prosperous. The statement uncannily echoes Bush administration comments about Russia over the past decade, as President (now Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin chipped away at freedom there.Of course, the Bush officials were right that Russia remained freer than it was in the days of the gulag, and Obama is right that China is freer today than in the lunatic days of the Cultural Revolution. But as Freedom House documented in a report last week, the world has become, on balance, less free over the past decade, with China and Russia leading the retrenchment. In China, as the most recent State Department annual report noted, "The government's human rights record remained poor and worsened in some areas."Since Hu became Communist Party secretary in 2002, in fact, repression has intensified steadily - against Internet freedom, democracy activists, religious liberty, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, and, perhaps most notably, against lawyers such as Gao who tried to work within the system. Much like Russia in its neighborhood, China also has flexed its muscles to protect autocracies and stymie democracy from advancing in smaller nearby countries such as Burma and Cambodia.The question is whether the United States and other democracies will acknowledge the dictators' successful push back and seek strategies to counter it. Such strategies would be difficult. They would demand trade-offs against other goals. They might fail.The alternative - to assume that in 30 years things will be better - comfortably absolves the United States of having to do anything. That removes any risk of failure - but also any chance of helping to steer things Gao's way.
