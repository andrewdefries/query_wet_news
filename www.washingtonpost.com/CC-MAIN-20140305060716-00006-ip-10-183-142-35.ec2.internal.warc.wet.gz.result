Is that so, Chancellor Rhee?
By Valerie Strauss
So, it turns out, the problem with school reforms in D.C. -- which contributed to the defeat of D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty in the Democratic primary -- wasn’t that some of them were punitive and nonsensical. Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee said in an interview today that the people just didn’t get it. It’s the people’s fault.

Metrorail riders: Which work-around is less annoying?
By Robert Thomson
For many Metro riders, what I’m about to ask is the equivalent of “Would you prefer to be shot or burned at the stake?”
Well, maybe it’s not quite that bad. My question is: During Metrorail’s weekend maintenance, is a rider better off with the single-tracking system to get around work zones, or the system that shuts down entire sections of lines and uses shuttle buses to span the gap? I raised the issue during my online chat Monday in response to a traveler who had seen several letters in my Sunday column. The letters praised Metro’s performance during late-January shutdowns that affected the writers’ weekend trips.
In Monday’s chat, the commenter wrote: “To echo your recent letters on prior shuttle service for scheduled shutdowns, the shuttle service at Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom [this past weekend] was marvelous, with understandable signs and helpful staff. Metro can behave very well when it can schedule its behavior.”
In response, I said that I understand why Metro wants to do these weekend shutdowns. “They create more space for workers and several projects can be tackled during the same weekend. And from the riders’ side, Metro has a pretty good record when it can schedule the bus bridges, as opposed to the ones it tries to create on the fly to deal with emergencies.
“It’s unclear to me whether riders prefer this style to the single-tracking style. At least with single-tracking, they can stay on the trains or in the stations, rather than having to get off, go out in whatever the weather is, and board a bus.”
It’s not that Metro is offering to let riders pick their poison. But given that the maintenance disruptions will continue for years, we could at least discuss how we feel about these facts of life.
Pro station shutdowns: The trains can be set up to offer something close to normal weekend service on either side of the disruption. Metro generally has enough buses ready to handle the crowd getting off a train where the disruption starts. The amount of extra travel time is pretty well known.
Anti-station shutdowns: You have to get off the train, walk out into all sorts of weather to board a bus, get off the bus and get back on the train. Pro single-tracking: Once you get on a train, you get to stay on the train.
Anti-single-tracking: Riders often find single-tracking a less predictable way of traveling. It can throw them off schedule up and down the line and at transfer points. It really messes with the electronic train-arrival displays on the platforms. What’s your view? And is there a third way?
Here’s how the letter writers in my Sunday column described their experiences.
Dear Dr. Gridlock:
On Saturday, Jan. 28, my 8-year-old grandson and I left my home and walked to the Bethesda Metro station headed for the Monster Truck show at Verizon Center. I had heard on the TV news that the Red Line would be closed and a shuttle bus trip required, so we left home at 5 p.m. for the 7:30 show.
Our train stopped at Van Ness, and we all had to get off. There were plenty of Metro employees on the platform to answer questions and direct us. And there were three empty buses waiting for us with more Metro employees to line people up and move us along.
We arrived at Dupont Circle, and more Metro employees were waiting to herd us to the entrance and explain not to swipe our cards until we reached our final destination. We got to the Gallery Place station about 7 p.m., walked into Verizon Center, got food and drinks, got to our seats and enjoyed the show.
After it ended at 9:30 p.m., we reversed the process, again with plenty of Metro employees and plenty of buses. We got back to the Bethesda station about 11 p.m. and home before midnight. No problems!
Nobody likes to have Metro stations shut down for scheduled repairs when we want to use it, but Metro did a great job and our local media did a great job getting the word out. Thanks to all.
— Charles Morris Pelham,
Chevy Chase
That was unusual. I write frequently about the difficulties riders have with the maintenance disruptions on Metrorail. Yet here was a traveler telling me the transit authority did something right.
And here it is again.
Dear Dr. Gridlock:
On Sunday evening, Jan. 29, we were at first dismayed to learn that our train would terminate at Van Ness because of Red Line closures. We were concerned that we would be late for a work event. Instead, station personnel and others could not have been nicer, the shuttle system worked smoothly, and we arrived at our destination near Dupont Circle no more than five minutes later than we would have if the trains had been running.
Yes, it’s inconvenient to live through any kind of system upgrade (even in our own homes and offices), and I look forward to when we have our old reliable Metro system up and running again. At the same time, Metro seems to be taking extra steps to ensure that the work-arounds are easy.
— Angelica E. Braestrup,
The District
Now, neither of these writers is a Pollyanna about the passengers’ plight. Both note the inconvenience of having to get on and off buses and trains when Metro splits a line for weekend maintenance. Braestrup also said in a follow-up exchange about Metro that “there’s a lot to be critical about.” She highlighted the jerkiness of manually operated trains.
But Metro does tend to perform well on weekends when it builds bus bridges to span the gaps between closed stations. Many riders tell me they think Metro is getting too much experience at it. They don’t want shutdowns to become any more routine than they already are.
Yet Metro officials tell us that the shutdowns and the disruptions caused by trains sharing tracks will continue for years. If transit officials know we’re locked into this, they could make improvements in communications about the delays.
How about upgrading the electronic information displays on the platforms so schedule disruptions don’t fry the little computer brain they rely on? Metro Deputy General Manager Dave Kubicek tells me there’s a way to do that, by creating a system that uses train location data coming through the operations control center.
That wouldn’t take away the pain of delays, but we’d have a better idea what to expect.

At Polar Bear Plunge, thousands jump into bay
(Marvin Joseph/ The Washington Post ) - Thousands participated in the Polar Bear Plunge in 2012 at Sandy Point State Park, running into the icy waters of the Chesapeake Bay.

Put on a bathing suit and jump into the frigid waters of the Chesapeake Bay.If you chose C, you’re a great candidate for the Maryland State Police’s 18th annual Polar Bear Plunge, to be held Saturday at Sandy Point State Park near Annapolis. Police spokesman Greg Shipley said he expects about 13,000 people — including kids — to brave the cold waters near the Bay Bridge while 10,000 others hold their towels, cheer them on and enjoy the bands, food and festivities at PlungeFest 2014.“It really is a party on the bay,” says Jason Schriml of Special Olympics Maryland, which expects to receive more than $2 million from sponsors supporting plungers. The money will be used to provide free, year-round sports training and competitions for 6,500 Maryland children and adults with intellectual disabilities.While plungers are enthusiastic about supporting Special Olympics athletes, they also get a kick out of running into the cold water, especially if they do it with friends. “Just the fact that you’re with your friends is such a motivation to jump in the water,” said Calli Yancey, a senior at South River High School in Edgewater who plunged two years ago.Most plungers get in and out of the water as quickly as they can, usually in about 30 seconds. Others run out to a line of 70 water-rescue divers wearing wet suits and standing chest-high in the water. Some plungers high-five one of the divers, and others force themselves to dunk their heads underwater. Sixteen-year-old Savannah Boyd of Anne Arundel County is a dunker. “As soon as you go under, you need to get out [of the water] immediately,” said Savannah, who has plunged twice. The water at Sandy Point hovers around 37 degrees this week. In past years, the water sometimes has been so cold that volunteers had to break through ice and slush before the plunge could begin.Last year, more than 1,300 of the plungers were between the ages of 11 and 18. Some were even younger: Savannah’s sister, Natalie, was 9 in 2013 when she made her first plunge. As thousands of people rushed in and out of the water, Natalie lost sight of her parents on the beach, but she managed to stay near Savannah. When she plunges again Saturday, she has a plan. “Now I’m going to know exactly where my parents are,” Natalie said. Tips for taking the plunge
Wear sturdy shoes. Greg Shipley, who plunges every year, recommends wearing old athletic shoes — the kind with shoelaces — to protect your feet. Flip-flops don’t offer enough protection and might float away in the churning water. Every year volunteers find hundreds of lost shoes after the event. ●Remove your glasses! If possible, leave glasses with a friend or parent on the beach. (If you’re lucky, that person also will be waiting with a towel or blanket when you get out of the water.)●Wear warm clothes over a swimming suit. Then — as hard as it is — take off everything but your suit before you get into the water. “You’ll get drier and warmer faster if you have fewer clothes and looser clothes,” says Jason Schriml, another experienced plunger.●Remember why you’re doing this. Adam Hays, a Special Olympics athlete from Frederick, has been plunging for 10 years. “It’s cold, but it only lasts a few seconds or a few minutes, and I’m protected by the love and the warmth of those around me,” he says. “And I know there’s a warm towel waiting for me when I run back out.”
More information: The Maryland State Police Polar Bear Plunge
When: Saturday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. A second plunge, called the Cool School Challenge, will be held March 5. It’s just for school teams. Where: Sandy Point State Park, 1100 East College Parkway, Annapolis.
How old: All ages. There is a Pee Wee Plunge (age 8 and younger) and Family Plunge (for families with children age 12 and younger) at 11 a.m. Permission from a parent or guardian is required for age 17 and younger. How much: Each plunger must raise at least $75 for Special Olympics. Kids in Family Plunge must raise at least $50.
For more information and forms: A parent can call 410-242-1515, ext. 503, or go to www.plungemd.com.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Gangs in Northern Virginia increasingly selling children for sex
By Matt Zapotosky, E-mail the writer
She was a month shy of her 17th birthday when the gang’s leader approached her outside a Tennessee hotel, engaging her in playful banter. But soon “Chyna,” as she would come to be known, was traveling up and down the Eastern Seaboard with the gangster and his friends, having sex with strangers for cash.
At a trial in federal district court in Alexandria this month, prosecutors said Chyna was one of at least four teenagers sold as sex workers by the “Cold-blooded Cartel,” a Georgia-based gang that found Northern Virginia to be an especially lucrative territory to prostitute children. Their case, prosecutors say, is indicative of a disturbing phenomenon in the Washington area. More and more gangs are prostituting teens, finding it a bigger moneymaker than drugs or weapons.

5 alleged Crips members charged in Fairfax Co. teen sex ring
Justin Jouvenal Five alleged gang members are charged with sex trafficking in connection with a underage prostitution ring, according to court records.
Founder of prostitution ring sentenced to 25 years in prison Matt Zapotosky Edwin Barcus Jr. founded a prostitution ring that operated in 7 states, including Md. and Va.
“The profit margin, the income stream that comes from selling the bodies of children . . . is enormous,” said then-U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride in an interview before he left the post this month. “Sort of like capitalization welcomes all comers to the marketplace, criminal activity is the same way.”Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia have recently handled several cases involving gang members and juvenile prostitutes. A leader of the Cold-blooded Cartel was sentenced to 25 years in prison in June, before the trial this month of two others involved in his prostitution ring. A member of the Mara Salvatrucha street gang, also known as MS-13, was charged last month and accused of helping others in what prosecutors called an “underground prostitution business” involving four female runaways.The office has prosecuted 27 defendants in gang-related trafficking cases since 2011 and at least 28 juvenile victims have been identified, authorities said.“This is an emerging trend, and the gangs, we think, have made a horribly wrong business calculation that they can make a lot of money and get away with it,” MacBride said.Prosecutors say that members of the Cold-blooded Cartel plied the girls with marijuana and ecstasy to make them more receptive. The gang exerted control through a combination of violence — at least one member carried a gun — and affectionate overtures. Two of the girls had tattoos of a gang leader’s nickname, “Boo.”Prosecutors and advocacy groups say that MS-13 seems to have pioneered juvenile sex trafficking as gang business — even stepping away from traditional violence and turning to prostitution. MacBride said the endeavor is especially profitable because girls, unlike drugs, can be sold more than once, and the costs to recruit and prostitute them are minimal.The concern, though, is that other gangs have started to follow MS-13’s lead, and they have started using more sophisticated online recruitment through social networking sites. Last year, a man affiliated with the Underground Gangster Crips was sentenced to 40 years in prison for running what prosecutors described as one of the largest underage prostitution rings in the Washington area’s history. And that apparently did not deter the Cold-blooded Cartel.By prosecutors’ account, the group prostituted women and high school girls in at least seven states, including Maryland and Virginia. It advertised services on the Web and had girls meet clients at hotels including the Homestead Studio Suites in Sterling, the Aloft hotel in Ashburn and the Washington Dulles Marriott Suites in Herndon.Chyna testified this month that she advocated moving the operation to Northern Virginia, saying Herndon was the most lucrative place she ever worked.“There is a lot of money here,” she said.Experts say it is difficult to pinpoint the number of children trafficked for sex in the United States, and it is even more difficult to determine how many are trafficked by gang members.Bradley Myles, chief executive of the advocacy group Polaris Project, said his organization responded to more than 2,700 cases of child sex trafficking in the past five years stemming from calls to a national hotline it operates for victims and tipsters to report suspected human trafficking. Calls addressing all types of trafficking have increased from about 400 a month in 2007 to about 3,000 a month now, but it is unclear whether that is because trafficking is more prevalent or just better publicized, Myles said.Melissa Snow, a child sex trafficking specialist at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said her organization estimates that one in eight “endangered runaways” in 2012 were likely sex trafficking victims, and officials are “certainly seeing that gangs as a trend are expanding to include child exploitation or child sex trafficking.”That is especially troubling, experts say, because of the control gangs are able to exert over children through fear and ma­nipu­la­tion.Chyna, who wore khaki pants and a plaid shirt in court, bit her lip as she testified. She told jurors that she followed strict rules, such as “Get the money upfront,” and “Don’t tell nobody my age.” And when Fairfax County police sent an undercover officer to the Hyatt House hotel in Herndon in a December sting, Chyna testified that she insisted others make sexual contact with the man they suspected was working undercover, just as his colleagues burst into the room.“I’m like, ‘One of y’all need to touch him,’ ” Chyna testified. “ ‘I need to see y’all touch him.’ ”At the time of the trial, Chyna said she was living in Indiana.The issue has drawn some attention on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) has pushed the attorney general to provide guidance on prosecuting Web sites that allow pimps to advertise girls. And though prosecutors have not launched efforts to shutter the sites, they have been especially aggressive in Northern Virginia in going after site users.After two leaders of the Cold-blooded Cartel pleaded guilty to engaging in a child-exploitation enterprise — a serious and hard-to-prove charge that carries a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence — prosecutors asked that they spend life in prison. One was sentenced to 25 years, the other to 20.And prosecutors pursued the same charges against two much-lower-level members of the ring — a woman whose attorney said was also being prostituted and her boyfriend, whose attorney said was not part of the juvenile prostitution enterprise. A jury convicted them of sex trafficking of a child, an offense that carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.MacBride, the former U.S. attorney, said prosecutors in Virginia might not bring the most onerous charges in every case, but they are aggressive in prosecuting those who sell children to try to keep the “emerging” phenomenon from becoming “systemic.”“It’s one thing to sell a bag of drugs,” he said. “It’s a whole different deal when you’re selling the body of a 12-year-old.”

Tucker Carlson and Ana Marie Cox
Daily Beast Contributors
Tuesday, December 23, 2008; 2:00 PM
Conservative MSNBC political correspondent and Daily Beast contributor Tucker Carlson and liberal Time Magazine blogger and Daily Beast contributor Ana Marie Cox were online Wednesday, Dec. 23 to dissect and debate the latest political developments in this post-election, pre-inauguration liminal time.
A transcript follows.
____________________
Ana Marie Cox: Greetings from La Plata, MD, where the entire town is encased in silver. Nice effect, hard to get a decent cup of coffee.
_______________________
Chicago: Presuming he wins the Senate seat, Al Franken will go a long way towards replacing the comic fodder that Bush has so dutifully supplied. Is any chance Franken will surprise and be a boring Senator? In addition to Bush, Larry Craig, Ted Stevens, William Jefferson, Dick Cheney and Tom Tancredo will be missed.
Tucker Carlson: Merry Christmas! And happy Tuesday. If Franken turns out to be a totally conventional blowhard in the Senate, it won't be surprising. He already is. He's funny as hell on a lot of subjects, and smart, but on politics he's insufferable. The worst. What a shame. Anyone can be a senator, but Franken's got so much more to give as a comedy writer.
I love your selection of politicians we'll miss. Couldn't agree more.
Ana Marie Cox: I think Franken's goal is to be boring, in a way. He really re-made himself in to something of a scold rather than a satirist as a candidate. As for comedic targets on the Hill, we really don't know just yet, but there's always Inhofe, and Jean Schmidt has somehow managed to hang onto his seat. Vitter is still good as a punchline and Barney Frank sometimes even intends to be funny.
_______________________
Warren!: Hi there.
I think the intense backlash to Pastor Warren is a bit, well, un-Obama. Do you think Obama is just setting the board up to allow gays finally to serve with honor in the military in his first six months?
Ana Marie Cox: Ha, THAT'S FUNNY! No. That is not what I think Obama is doing, nor do I think that's what gays think he's doing. (That it is a possibility sort of boggles the mind. Wouldn't the same logic -- double triple fake out knee-jerk behind the back FOOLED YA -- eventually get us to his actually being on the road to appointing Orrin Hatch to the Supreme Court?)
Oh, and I'm sure you realize this but just to be clear: Gays have been serving in the military with honor for generations, just not openly. Obama probably could change that but I don't see it as a first-term agenda item for him.
Tucker Carlson: It's not like Obama's going to lose a lot of gay votes to Republicans, so it's hard to see why he'd feel compelled to start a fight over changing don't ask/don't tell. Not to be too cynical about it.
_______________________
Wye River, Md.: I have been amused by many on the Left with their hysteria regarding Homosexual "Marriage", a concept that would have brought guffaws if hinted at only a few years ago. No great American, from George Washington to the Roosevelts to Martin Luther King have supported such a context. Even Barack Obama is against gay marriage. What accounts for all the hatred the Left has for believers in traditional marriage?
Tucker Carlson: It is amusing, especially since as you point out, Obama himself is opposed to gay marriage. So it's a litt
