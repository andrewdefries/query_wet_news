Santorum can surge again
By Jennifer Rubin
There is plenty Rick Santorum can learn from his disappointing finish in New Hampshire. Heading into South Carolina he needs to put the loss behind him but take in lessons about advertising, message and focus.
In New Hampshire, Santorum was invisible on the air. His super PAC is already up in South Carolina, but he’ll need to spend directly to compete with the avalanche of ads coming from Mitt Romney. The good news is that the Newt Gingrich super PAC campaign is so counterproductive that it undermines Gingrich’s claim to be a movement conservative, leaving Santorum to claim the spot. The bad news is that it may generate more support for Romney.
Jennifer Rubin live chatted with readers on this topic. Read the chat transcript now.
More important, Santorum needs to refine his message of economic growth and traditional values. South Carolina has plenty of evangelical voters, but the secret of his success in Iowa was pairing up a hopeful economic message of inclusiveness with a strong pro-life and family appeal. The state is too big to knock on every door, and time is too limited to spend hours on tangential issues. He needs a crisp, clear enunciation of his economic plan, an argument for his electability and an argument as to why he is ideologically more representative of the party than Romney. And then he needs to repeat all of that over and over again. He’s got the economic plan; he just needs everyone in South Carolina to know what’s in it. He can talk about his grandfather and his desire for upward mobility a little, but then he’s got to put meat on the bones. If he can’t frame his plan in a 90-second interview response or a 60-second debate answer he’s in trouble.
His electability argument, which he began to sketch out last night, is this: Only he can energize and unite the party and then bring in voters in Rust Belt states and, more generally, working-class people (although he doesn’t like using “class”). This was the demographic that Tim Pawlenty tried to reach — the workers in “strong back” jobs and the middle-income Americans who are falling behind. It’s not surprising that Santorum has begun to refer directly to those voters. (“We are Sam’s Club and Costco folks, ” he told voters about his own family.)
He also needs to focus on the differences between him and Romney that really matter. They are both resolute on Iran and, frankly, voters don’t care if Santorum was on the Senate Armed Services Committee years ago. What is significant is the difference in their tax plans and their track records on health care. It’s wasted time to quibble with Romney as to whether he was a “manager” or a “leader.” When Santorum engages Romney he’s got to make it count and make it on substance.
His task in South Carolina is made easier by Gingrich’s self-inflicted wounds and Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s increasingly pathetic campaign. It is becoming easier to argue that Santorum is the last consistent conservative rival to Romney. And while his showing in New Hampshire isn’t what he wanted it to be, he will surely improve his standing in South Carolina, where Jon Huntsman is a non-factor and Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) has less appeal. If he gets ahead of Paul, Gingrich, Huntsman and Perry (which is very doable), he’ll have the “Santorum comes roaring back” headlines that he’ll need to stay in the mix.

Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev indicted on 30 counts
View Photo Gallery — Boston Marathon bombing: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother, is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of death or life in prison. By Peter Finn, E-mail the writer
A federal grand jury Thursday returned a 30-count indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspect in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings, providing new detail about his interest in radical Islamist literature and describing for the first time messages he scrawled inside a dry-docked boat just before his capture.
“The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians,” Tsarnaev wrote on the walls and beams of the boat, which was in a back yard outside a police cordon he had slipped through in Watertown, Mass. Graphic

Full coverage: NSA Secrets
Read all of the stories in The Washington Post’s ongoing coverage of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs.
He also wrote: “I can’t stand to see such evil go unpunished.”
Tsarnaev, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged with the use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death; the bombing of a public place that resulted in death; and the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, among other crimes. Seventeen of the charges carry the death penalty or life in prison, the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston said. The Justice Department will have to decide whether to pursue a capital prosecution, a decision that ultimately rests with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., according to Carmen Ortiz, the U.S. attorney in Boston. “I do want to say that I have met several of those that were injured on April 15th as well as members of the deceased families,” Ortiz said Thursday at a news conference in Boston. “Their strength is extraordinary, and we will do everything that we can to pursue justice not only on their behalf, but on behalf of all of us.”Tsarnaev, who was hospitalized with a throat wound after his arrest, is scheduled to be arraigned July 10 in federal court in Boston.The indictment describes how Tsarnaev, 19, and his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed after a shootout with police April 19, allegedly moved toward the finish line at the Boston Marathon, carrying improvised bombs in black backpacks. At 2:40 p.m. Tamerlan, 26, walked to the front of Marathon Sports on Boylston Street as his brother moved to a position in front of the Forum restaurant, according to the indictment. The bombs were placed by low metal barriers along the edge of the street where hundreds of spectators were watching the runners.At 2:48 p.m. Tsarnaev called his older brother on a cellphone; they communicated for just a few seconds, the indictment says. Seconds later, Tamerlan detonated the first bomb, killing Krystle Marie Campbell, a 29-year-old native of Medford, Mass., who was cheering on her boyfriend. After a few more seconds, Tsarnaev detonated the second device, killing 7-year-old Martin Richard, who was attending the event with his family, and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese citizen and graduate student at Boston University. More than 260 people were injured in the blasts, many of them seriously. More than a dozen amputations were performed in area hospitals.Preparations for the bombings began at least as early as Feb. 6, when Tamerlan purchased 48 mortars containing eight pounds of low-explosive powder at a fireworks store in Seabrook, N.H., according to the indictment.In March, the ethnic Chechen brothers traveled to a shooting range in Manchester, N.H., rented two 9mm handguns, bought 200 rounds of ammunition and practiced shooting for an hour.The instructions for the bombs — made of pressure cookers, low-explosive powder and shrapnel — were downloaded by Tsarnaev from the magazine Inspire, an English-language publication produced by al-Qaeda’s Yemeni affiliate, the indictment alleges. The indictment says Tsarnaev had downloaded a number of radical publications, including a digital copy of a book titled “The Slicing Sword,” which calls on Muslims not to offer allegiance to governments that “invade Muslim lands.” A foreword to the book was written by Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born propagandist for al-Qaeda’s Yemeni affiliate who was killed in a joint CIA-military drone operation in Yemen in September 2011.Tsarnaev also downloaded publications such as “Defense of the Muslim Lands” and “Jihad and the Effects of Intention Upon It,” the indictment says.The indictment suggests that the brothers were self­radicalized by way of the Internet. There is no mention of a wider conspiracy or of direct contact with a terrorist organization. After the bombings, U.S. investigators traveled to Russia to see whether Tamerlan had formed any kind of alliance with radicals there during a six-month stay in the Russian republic of Dagestan in 2012. Tsarnaev and his brother were identified as suspects from video footage that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies searched through after the attacks and released to the public in order to get the bombers’ names. On April 18, the night their pictures were released, Tsarnaev and his brother armed themselves with five bombs, a 9mm semiautomatic handgun, ammunition, a machete and a hunting knife, according to the indictment. At 10:25 p.m. they shot and killed Sean Collier, an MIT police officers, in an unsuccessful attempt to get his weapon, the indictment says. Then they carjacked a Mercedes SUV, but the driver escaped early the next morning. About 12:50 a.m April 19, the brothers shot at and threw bombs at Watertown police officers. Tamerlan, who was shot, was tackled by three officers who attempted to handcuff him. Tsarnaev then drove the Mercedes at the group of officers and ran over his brother, “seriously injuring him and contributing to his death,” the indictment says.Tsarnaev drove off and quickly ditched the Mercedes. He smashed his cellphones and found his way to the boat. Police eventually surrounded the boat, and Tsarnaev, who was by then unarmed, survived a volley of gunfire into the vessel before he was apprehended.
