Claim check: ‘Every reporter’ knows source for NYT scoop
By Erik Wemple
Surrogates from the Romney and Obama campaigns faced off yesterday at the Brookings Institution on pressing foreign policy issues. A key topic was the famous national security “leaks” that led to New York Times reporter David Sanger’s great scoop on federal efforts to disable the Iranian nuclear program via cyberattacks. Richard Williamson, an advocate for Romney, pushed the campaign’s viewpoint that the Obama White House leaked to the Times for political ends. He said this, among other things, as reported in Foreign Policy:
“I believe every reporter in this town knows that at least one of the sources is in the White House,” Williamson said. “I think the Obama administration has figured out how to do [intelligence sharing]: Have the national security advisor talk to David Sanger and then all intelligence is shared.”
First things first: Williamson should check the record. As explained by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, Sanger’s book, “Confront and Conceal” carries a note saying, “Almost every senior member of the president’s national security team was generous enough to sit down and talk through their experiences, some more than once.”
Does that mean that Sanger’s tip, his first break in the story, was a White House official? No, it doesn’t. He may well have gathered the tip in “bits and pieces,” to use Ignatius’s words, and placed the matter before the White House once the reporting hardened up. For the record, New York Times Managing Editor for News Dean Baquet says, “We don’t comment on sources.” National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor declines to answer a question about Williamson’s contention, noting that an Obama campaign surrogate, Michèle Flournoy, was at the Brookings event to rebut Williamson. Whatever the case, Williamson has thrown out a claim that’s checkable. That claim, to repeat his words, is that “every reporter in this town” knows a detail or two about Sanger’s sourcing. So I put the question to a bunch of Washington reporters today. Some responded that I absolutely couldn’t quote them; some didn’t respond; some did, and here’s a look: *Julie Mason, veteran White House correspondent and host of Sirius XM Radio’s “The Press Pool”: It’s unfortunate to see the campaign trying to co-opt news reporters to bolster an unsubstantiated case like this. David Sanger is a law and a universe unto himself, with his own superior source network. I don’t know who his sources are — I wish I did. I suspect they would surprise me. It sounds like Williamson is banking on — what? Professional jealousy? A general reluctance to admit we’re not as well-sourced as Sanger? — to make a speculative argument. Fail.
*A prominent political reporter: I think it’s widely assumed that one of Sanger’s sources is [National Security Adviser Thomas] Donilon. But my experience with the source-guessing game is that the guessers are often off the mark or at least incomplete with their guesswork. Nobody knows for sure who Sanger’s sources are except Sanger, the sources and perhaps some Times editors. *Wall Street Journal Senior Writer James Grimaldi: I have no idea who David Sanger’s sources are. I could guess and it was a damn good story and I look forward to reading his book. *Ignatius: I can guess some of the people in the White House Sanger ran his info by, but they’re not the “sources.” I suspect by the time this stuff gets to the White House there’s very little officials there can do to stop it.
So perhaps Williamson should amend his assessment. Every reporter in this town — except for four — knows Sanger’s sources. By	Erik Wemple

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Correction:
An earlier version of this story said the Robinson Terminal that The Washington Post Co. owns in Alexandria was part of the sale to Jeffrey Bezos. While the corporate entity that owns them is to be transferred, the actual warehouses and wharves there are not part of the transaction. The article also incorrectly identified the holding company through which Bezos will take ownership. It is Nash Holdings LLC. The holding company named in the article, Explore Holdings LLC, is the guarantor of the transaction. This version of the story has been updated.
Washington Post sale: Details of Bezos deal
Video: Donald Graham, the Post Co. chairman and chief executive, explains why he came to believe Amazon founder Jeff Bezos offers the Post the best chance to thrive after 80 years of Graham family ownership.
By Neil Irwin and Ylan Q. Mui, E-mail the writers
The purchase of The Washington Post by Jeffrey P. Bezos ends 42 years in which The Post has been part of a publicly traded company, creates a small windfall for the company’s shareholders and will leave the stewardship of the newspaper in the hands of a privately held firm.
When Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, closes on the $250 million purchase of the paper in about 60 days, it will be the latest in a series of purchases of “legacy” print media properties by wealthy individuals and small groups, a list that also includes the Boston Globe, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Newsweek.
Timeline
The major events that have shaped the Washington Post Co.
For Bezos, a demanding style behind that patient approach
Craig Timberg and Jia Lynn Yang One thing the Amazon chief and incoming owner of The Post has little patience for? Hoop-jumping.
The Post sale: From unthinkable choice to the clearest option
Craig Timberg and Jia Lynn Yang How the decision to sell the heralded newspaper quickly became reality after it was proposed late last year.
After Post sale, Graham is likely to continue to diversify company
Thomas Heath Company owns various businesses that have little in common.
Amazon’s Washington presence surges along with its business
Holly Yeager and Carol D. Leonnig The Internet giant has sharply boosted its lobbying efforts to shape policy on taxes and other issues.
With The Washington Post sold, will New York Times be next?
Paul Farhi Family that owns the paper insists it’s not selling. That was unthinkable for The Post, too. Until it happened.
An open letter to Jeff Bezos
Gene Weingarten Welcome to The Post. I hope you have a clear vision of where to take this remarkable enterprise. An Amazon-style model could reboot the newspaper industry
Matea Gold and Cecilia Kang Analysts say technology perfected by the online retailer could give Post readers personalized news feeds. Why Bezos usually buys things
Lydia DePillis Amazon has always expanded by accretion, but its purchases have very different fates. Details of Bezos deal to buy Post Neil Irwin and Ylan Q. Mui The $250 million purchase price is richer than many of those received by other legacy print media properties in recent years.
Bezos is known for his patience
Peter Whoriskey, Jia Lynn Yang and Cecilia Kang His willingness to pursue a long-term vision was critical to the rise and persistence of Amazon.
The purchase price is richer than many of those paid for other legacy print media properties in recent years.The New York Times Co. agreed to sell the Boston Globe to Red Sox owner John W. Henry for only $70 million. Newsweek sold for a symbolic $1, plus assumed pension liabilities, to billionaire Sidney Harman in 2011.The Post “has a much stronger position in its market than the Boston Globe does,” said John Morton, an independent newspaper industry analyst. “It doesn’t surprise me that it would command a much higher price.” Still, Morton suggested that the prominence and the visibility of The Post made Bezos willing to pay a higher price than would be justified by the paper’s finances alone. “I think probably Jeff Bezos was willing to pay a premium to make this happen,” Morton said. “. . . Bezos has enough money that if he wants to make it a hobby, he can.”The deal was announced after the end of trading Monday. In after-hours trading, Washington Post Co. shares rose about 5 percent to $568. The company’s stock is up nearly 57 percent this year. The purchase price works out to $40.32 a share for Post shareholders.The transaction is a reflection of how much has changed in the news industry in just a short time amid the rise of online media that have put print advertising business models under steep pressure.“This newspaper would’ve sold 10 years ago for $2 billion,” said Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.Notably, Bezos — through a new holding company called Nash Holdings LLC— will be buying only the Post newspaper and closely held related ventures.The purchase does not include The Post Co.’s downtown Washington office buildings (currently on the market as The Post considers leasing new space in a cheaper neighborhood) or the wharves and warehouses owned as part of the Robinson Terminal facility in Alexandria.It also does not include some of the cash-cow media-related businesses owned by The Post’s parent company. For example, the Post Co. subsidiary that owns local television affiliates across the country, Post-Newsweek Stations, is not part of the deal. Stand-alone ventures the Slate Group, The Root and Foreign Policy are also to remain part of the legacy Washington Post Co. It is the end of an era for The Washington Post Co., which will change its name. It had already shifted its identity from that of a media company to an “education and media company,” as the education unit Kaplan grew, the Post newspaper shrank and the company sold Newsweek. The company first issued shares to the public in 1971 and has more recently expanded into a grab-bag of seemingly unrelated businesses, including a hospice-care company and a maker of industrial boilers.Bezos’s new private company will own the Post newspaper and Web properties, along with Express, the Gazette Newspapers and Southern Maryland Newspapers in Washington’s suburbs, El Tiempo Latino, and specialty publications including New Homes Guide and Apartment Showcase.The Post newspaper division had $582 million in revenue in 2012 and a $53.7 million operating loss. Still, for Bezos, the purchase should be financially manageable. He is worth about $25.2 billion, according to estimates by Forbes, which means the $250 million purchase price is about 1 percent of his net worth.And industry analysts do not see any easy fixes Bezos might make that could make The Post dramatically more profitable soon.“I don’t think there’s any low-hanging fruit on the revenue front or the cost front, or else The Post would’ve done it already,” Huber said.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Q&A with Imani Temple founder George A. Stallings Jr.
Video: Bishop George Stallings, founder of the Imani Temple African Catholic Congregation talks about his controversial ministry and allegations that he abused altar boys while a priest in the Roman Catholic Church.
By Hamil R. Harris and Mike DeBonis, E-mail the writers
Imani Temple African American Catholic Congregation was founded in the District 23 years ago after rebel priest George A. Stallings Jr. broke from the Roman Catholic Church to minister to African Americans with a doctrine and liturgy incorporating Catholic, African and evangelical elements. Now Imani is preparing to follow many of its 600 members out of the city, to Prince George’s County, and its building, on the northeast corner of Stanton Park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, has been listed for sale.
Stallings, 64, was the subject of newspaper headlines in the 1980s and 1990s as he battled the Archdiocese of Washington over allegations that he had sexually abused two altar boys. Stallings has strongly denied the allegations. A lawsuit claiming that he played a role in the abuse of a seminarian in 1984 was settled by the archdiocese in 2009. He broke from the church in 1989 and was excommunicated in 1990.
(Hamil Harris/The Washington Post) - George A. Stallings Jr., founder of the Imani Temple African American Catholic Congregation stands in front of its building in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which has been listed for sale Video
Bishop George Stallings, founder of the Imani Temple African Catholic Congregation talks about his controversial ministry and allegations that he abused altar boys while a priest in the Roman Catholic Church. Stallings has occasionally been a figure in city politics, and he ran unsuccessfully for the Ward 6 D.C. Council seat in a 1997 special election. Although never a member, he collaborated with the Unification Church. The founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, picked Stallings’s wife, Sayomi Kamimoto, with whom he has two sons.This week, Stallings talked to Washington Post reporters Hamil R. Harris and Mike DeBonis about the move, his break with the Catholic Church and more. Below is a condensed version of the conversation.
When and why did you come to the decision to sell your building on Capitol Hill?
In our 23-year history, we were never able to anchor our ministry in a predominantly African American community. It was just a coincidence that led to [being at our current] location. The congregation that had occupied that space had to move out because the bank had foreclosed on them, and we were in need of a physical location to have a full-fledged ministry. We knew when we purchased the property back in July of 1994 that it wasn’t the ideal property. We are selling that building because that is not the ideal location for an Afrocentric expression of the Catholic faith. Jesus said cast your net upon the waters, and we are saying that the the fish have moved.
Why did you leave the Catholic Church?
I left the Roman Catholic Church because that institution was not willing to embrace the unique spiritual and cultural gifts of African Americans in such a way that we felt that we had ownership and control over our own destiny within Roman Catholicism. I still believe to this day that Roman Catholicism only offers token expression to black people.
Some pretty heavy charges were levied against you [at the time Stallings’s ministry broke away from the Catholic Church], charges of you having an inappropriate relationships with boys.
One has to understand the politics of the Roman Catholic Church. When someone such as I would step out and do something that had never been done in the history of Roman Catholicism in regards to black Catholics. What really concerns me about those charges is that not one of them surfaced while I was a Roman Catholic priest. [The Post published a front-page story about the allegations three months after Stallings broke with the church in 1989, but sources in that story said allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Stallings had surfaced within the archdiocese years earlier.].
At what point did you become involved with [Unification Church founder Sun Myung] Moon?
I didn’t become involved with the Unification movement until January 2001, and the involvement was not with Rev. Moon or the Unification Church but with the American clergy leadership conference, which is an interreligious and interracial coalition of ministers who were focused on rebuilding the family, restoring the community and renewing the nation and the world. That organization was founded as a result of the inspiration of Father Moon.People in general didn’t understand the relationship that Rev. Sun Young Moon had with the African American church and African American ministers. It was . . . the result of a commonality that existed between Rev. Moon and the black church when it came to the whole concept of suffering, being denied access and being accepted for who one is.
One new chapter in your life was when Rev. Moon arranged for you to meet a young lady who would become your friend, then your wife.
My wife and I were married May 7, 2001. Our first child [Shin Young] was born April 15, 2002, and our second son, Young Pal, was born exactly 23 months to the day later on March 15, 2004.
Why did you make the decision to get married and what has that relationship meant to you?
My life, besides my parents, has been my wife and my children.I look at marriage as being a powerful expression of healing and God’s love. What convinced me was when Rev. Moon and I had a discussion about lineage and the importance of the DNA and blood line. Rev. Moon would ... say: “Which is most important? Life, love or lineage?” People say love, and he would say, “No, lineage.”If there is no lineage, there is no love. I began to realize the number of Catholic priests who are not married and can’t acknowledge the Catholic children who they have fathered themselves because they have not been faithful to their vows. Pope John Paul II has no lineage. No matter how great is, there is no one after him. His life line is dead.

Lamar Alexander’s chief of staff arrested on child pornography charges
Video: Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn) has placed his chief of staff, Ryan Loskarn, on leave after learning his home was being searched as part of a child pornography investigation.
By Ed O’Keefe and Matt Zapotosky, E-mail the writers
The chief of staff to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) was arrested Wednesday on charges of possessing and distributing child pornography and was swiftly fired by the senator.
Jesse Ryan Loskarn, 35, was arrested at his D.C. home Wednesday afternoon by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and is expected to appear in federal court in Washington on Thursday to face charges, the Justice Department said.

Word of the investigation was first revealed in a statement issued by Alexander, who said he was “stunned, surprised and disappointed” by the news and would be placing Loskarn on unpaid administrative leave. The news spread quickly across Capitol Hill among Loskarn’s colleagues and friends in the close-knit worlds of congressional staffers and Capitol Hill reporters with whom he worked for years.Alexander later announced that he had “removed” Loskarn from his staff and replaced him with another longtime aide, David Cleary.Like many longtime congressional staffers, Loskarn climbed the ranks on the House side of Capitol Hill before moving to senior positions in the Senate. He began as an aide to then-Rep. Wally Herger (R-Calif.), moved to the press staff of the House Rules Committee and spent four years as a spokesman for Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). He moved next to the Senate Republican Conference — the messaging shop for GOP senators — and became staff director when Alexander assumed control of the office in 2009. He later became the chief of staff of Alexander’s personal office when the senator stepped down from his leadership perch, announcing that he hoped to work on building more bipartisanship in the Senate.
