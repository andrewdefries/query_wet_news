Ron Paul lays bare hypocrisy in clash with CNN
By Erik Wemple
The Ron Paul folks have a Goldilocks issue with respect to the American media. There was a time when the press was too cold. That was before the candidate’s strong showing in the Ames straw poll back in August, when there was something known as a Ron Paul “media blackout.” His supporters screamed about it. He went on cable TV to address it. How things have changed. As the actual voting neared, the press became too hot. It started covering how Paul had somehow allowed
racist, homophobic and downright kooky scribblings to go out under his name in a series of newsletters decades ago. Old news, asked and answered, Paul and his supporters cried. Now, in the midst of New Hampshire politicking, the porridge is still scalding. That, anyway, is the impression that the candidate gave in a revealing interview yesterday with CNN’s Dana Bash. In tight quarters with aides looking on, Bash pressed Paul on his Florida strategy, where the campaign isn’t going to make a big play. That went fine. The next part didn’t, despite its banality. Bash asked a routine campaign question in a professional manner. It went like this: At the last stop where you just were, it was it was just madness. But there was a woman there who was a New Hampshire voter. She voted for Barack Obama in the last primary.. . .She told me that if she would have been able to shake your hand and look you in the eye, you would have gotten her vote. But now she’s turned off because you left. Does that say anything about your ability to connect?
From the reaction of Paul and aide Jesse Benton, you’d have supposed that Bash had asked the candidate about “Hate Whitey Day.” Benton rushed in to tear Paul from Bash. “These are junky questions,” he said. Paul, meanwhile, resorted to bashing the media via Bash: “You, the media, did that to her,” said the candidate, referring to the nameless woman who wanted face time with Paul. “She should have been furious with you.”
Shuffling ensued, as Benton and the candidate slid over to an interview with Fox News. To the question how or why the media was responsible for the woman’s view of Paul, Benton said this: ”Because there were 100 reporters just like you and your crew” at the event. The New York Times throws a different spin on things, saying that the woman “even approached Mr. Paul’s S.U.V. as he prepared to drive off and began shouting at him through the closed car door to return to the diner and meet her and her mother.”
A statement from the Paul campaign explains its version of events: “This morning, [Paul] attempted to hold an event at Moe Joe’s Diner in Manchester, to speak with patrons and supporters in the last push before the New Hampshire primary. Unfortunately, Dr. Paul and his family were forced to leave early after over 120 members of the press created a mob-like atmosphere that was deemed to be unsafe for the candidate, Moe Joe’s customers, and reporters themselves.”
Reading that, you might just suppose that the Paul campaign is at the mercy of its own campaign events. That somehow these events can grow fangs and endanger the principals. Reality: The Paul campaign controls its events; if it wants to make sure the media doesn’t crush everyone, set aside an area for the cameras or choose a more hospitable spot. Just don’t complain about your own event. Whatever their organizational capabilities, Paul and his handlers want a level of media attention that’s just right. Let’s see whether South Carolina delivers. A footnote: Isn’t there a class in Political Handler School that teaches up-and-coming operatives not to bigfoot an interview between your candidate and a member of the press while the cameras are rolling? The sum total of impressions cast by Benton’s intervention between Paul and Bash: 1) He looks like a thug; 2) Paul looks like a creature of his handlers and not someone who’s in charge of his own campaign; and 3) The entire enterprise looks defensive.

Daniel Domolky/The Kennedy Center - ‘Gypsies’ runs Mar. 15 - 17 at 7:30 p.m. at the Kennedy Center.
By Roger Catlin, E-mail the writers
For centuries, they have been figures of fear and fascination, in their colorful clothes and seemingly carefree lives. And while gypsies, as they are called, have left their mark on society with their music and verve, ignorance and stereotypes remain.
On reality TV, splashy imported shows of extreme nuptials such as “My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding” are soon to be joined by two shows about American gypsies.

Free admission Get ideas In bookstores, “Gypsy Boy” by Mikey Walsh is the first of four gypsy memoirs on bestseller lists in England to be released in the States.And this month at the Kennedy Center, amid a festival of “The Music of Budapest, Prague and Vienna,” where gypsy music is represented as deeply ingrained in the region’s folk music, a retooled play presented by the Katona Jozsef Theatre of Budapest at the Kennedy Center raises contemporary issues of the Romany people also known as gypsies Thursday through Sunday.“Gypsies” was adapted from the original 1931 version by Jeno J. Tersanszky, but adapted to reflect the modern situation, its company director says. The old play was “a wonderful piece especially its first half,” says Gabor Mate, through an interpreterfrom Budapest. “My idea was that after the first half of the old play, we just switch to the modern world to another play. And as there were several murders of gypsies in recent years in Hungary, it was quite obvious that we decided to kill one of the characters of the old play.”A rash of killings in the Romany settlements in Hungary in 2008 and 2009 left six dead. Just last week, Hungarian gypsies commemorated the third anniversary of the murder of a gypsy man and his 5-year-old son in Tatarszentgyorgy, a village south of Budapest.Though they had been a source of tension for years, the plight of the Romany people — called gypsies because some erroneously thought they originated from Egypt — has not improved much in Central Europe, says Mate, who is also deputy president of the University of Theater, Film and Television in Budapest. “There is an idea about them that is in the Hungarian people’s minds that they don’t work, they are lazy and they steal,” he says. And there may be less understanding and tolerance of the people by the mainstream than there was before, he adds. “During the socialist regime, the gypsies had work, they were taken to be soldiers also, and, in this way, they could be part of the society. Now they are unemployed, and there is no obligatory army service. So they don’t have to do anything basically. There is no obligation for them to be part of the society.”The veil was lifted on modern gypsy life for TV audiences through the popularity of the English reality shows showcasing their sometimes extravagant wedding ceremonies.“After the great success of the import ‘My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding’ last year on TLC, we announced that we’d be exploring the secretive gypsy and traveler community right here in the U.S.,” TLC General Manager Amy Winter said in announcing the forthcoming “My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding” at the TV Critics Association winter press tour. “TLC lives where the extraordinary meets the everyday, and we are at our best when we take our viewers inside worlds that they might not otherwise get to experience,” says Winter of the Silver Spring-based network.Coming next month from Washington-based National Geographic Channel is “American Gypsy,” chronicling a Romany family in New York .“This is much more than just a wedding,” says Bobby Johns, whose family is depicted in the series. “This is about our family, our culture, our beliefs, our traditions.”“American Gypsy” is being produced in part by former “Karate Kid” Ralph Macchio.“I was just fascinated by the fact that the subculture existed,” Macchio says. “It was nothing I’ve ever seen before or believed that it existed, right in New York City.”Over the years, gypsies “have changed dramatically,” says producer Steve Cantor. “Particularly in the last 30 years, to the point that they have really assimilated into our culture. They’re no longer so different, nomadic, wandering, and yet they still have every phase of their life, from education to marriage, to the way they do their weddings, their rituals, funerals, the way they settle disputes — everything is completely different than the way we deal with it.” “We’re a culture that nobody really knows that much about, and this is why my father decided to do this,” says John’s brother, Nicky. “Because at this time we need to preserve our culture and let people know who we are as a people.”But according to Mate, such shows help perpetuate “absolutely a stereotype” that won’t lead to greater understanding of the Romi people.i.A better avenue to understanding the Romany culture may be through music, as its improvisational, freewheeling style and melodies have made their way into works by Bartok, Kodaly, Strauss, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Haydn and Brahms.“The music of these people gave composers of the West access to a kind of expression that was not part of their vocabulary,” music scholar Saul Lilienstein told a crowd at a Kennedy Center lecture Saturday titled “Intoxicated by Gypsies.”The clarinet in particular became part of the music of Mozart near the end of his life, perhaps due to the Romany. “The clarinet didn’t exist in orchestras until it was brought to the West mainly by gypsies,” Lilienstein says.But while “its music has been absorbed” by the wider culture, Mate says, “It would be nice if [the gypsy people] would be present at all levels of life.”Mate says he hopes “Gypsies” will spark discussions here as it did in Hungary.“I want that this question doesn’t leave them quiet,” Mate says. Catlin is a freelance writer.

Climate change is here — and worse than we thought
By James E. Hansen, James E. Hansen directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
When I testified before the Senate in the hot summer of 1988
, I warned of the kind of future that climate change would bring to us and our planet. I painted a grim picture of the consequences of steadily increasing temperatures, driven by mankind’s use of fossil fuels.
But I have a confession to make: I was too optimistic.
Gallery
Tom Toles goes green: A collection of cartoons about the environment and global warming. My projections about increasing global temperature have been proved true. But I failed to fully explore how quickly that average rise would drive an increase in extreme weather.In a new analysis of the past six decades of global temperatures, which will be published Monday, my colleagues and I have revealed a stunning increase in the frequency of extremely hot summers, with deeply troubling ramifications for not only our future but also for our present.This is not a climate model or a prediction but actual observations of weather events and temperatures that have happened. Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly linked to climate change. To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change.The deadly European heat wave of 2003, the fiery Russian heat wave of 2010 and catastrophic droughts in Texas and Oklahoma last year can each be attributed to climate change. And once the data are gathered in a few weeks’ time, it’s likely that the same will be true for the extremely hot summer the United States is suffering through right now.These weather events are not simply an example of what climate change could bring. They are caused by climate change. The odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly small. To count on those odds would be like quitting your job and playing the lottery every morning to pay the bills.Twenty-four years ago, I introduced the concept of “climate dice” to help distinguish the long-term trend of climate change from the natural variability of day-to-day weather. Some summers are hot, some cool. Some winters brutal, some mild. That’s natural variability.But as the climate warms, natural variability is altered, too. In a normal climate without global warming, two sides of the die would represent cooler-than-normal weather, two sides would be normal weather, and two sides would be warmer-than-normal weather. Rolling the die again and again, or season after season, you would get an equal variation of weather over time.But loading the die with a warming climate changes the odds. You end up with only one side cooler than normal, one side average, and four sides warmer than normal. Even with climate change, you will occasionally see cooler-than-normal summers or a typically cold winter. Don’t let that fool you.Our new peer-reviewed study, published by the National Academy of Sciences, makes clear that while average global temperature has been steadily rising due to a warming climate (up about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past century), the extremes are actually becoming much more frequent and more intense worldwide.When we plotted the world’s changing temperatures on a bell curve, the extremes of unusually cool and, even more, the extremes of unusually hot are being altered so they are becoming both more common and more severe.The change is so dramatic that one face of the die must now represent extreme weather to illustrate the greater frequency of extremely hot weather events.Such events used to be exceedingly rare. Extremely hot temperatures covered about 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent of the globe in the base period of our study, from 1951 to 1980. In the last three decades, while the average temperature has slowly risen, the extremes have soared and now cover about 10 percent of the globe.This is the world we have changed, and now we have to live in it — the world that caused the 2003 heat wave in Europe that killed more than 50,000 people and the 2011 drought in Texas that caused more than $5 billion in damage. Such events, our data show, will become even more frequent and more severe.There is still time to act and avoid a worsening climate, but we are wasting precious time. We can solve the challenge of climate change with a gradually rising fee on carbon collected from fossil-fuel companies, with 100 percent of the money rebated to all legal residents on a per capita basis. This would stimulate innovations and create a robust clean-energy economy with millions of new jobs. It is a simple, honest and effective solution.The future is now. And it is hot.
