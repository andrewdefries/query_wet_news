Dan Uggla extends hitting streak to 31 games for Atlanta Braves
By Matt Brooks
It’s a great time to be Uggla.
(Marc Serota - GETTY IMAGES)
With a first inning single Wednesday night in Miami, Atlanta Braves second baseman Dan Uggla extended his hitting streak to 31 games — matching the longest streak in team history — as the Braves completed a three-game sweep of the Florida Marlins.
Atlanta’s offseason acquisition of the perennial 30-homer middle infielder was lauded as one of the best moves of the offseason, but Uggla’s early production was a far cry from what the Braves thought they were getting.
During the streak, Uggla is hitting .345, yet his season average is still a paltry .224. But with 12 home runs and 27 RBI over the last month, he’s heating up at just the right time for a team looking to lock up the NL wild card if the Philadelphia Phillies prove too difficult to catch in the NL East.
Uggla’s streak is the longest in the majors this season and matched Rico Carty’s 31-game streak for the Atlanta Braves in 1970. The Braves franchise record is held by Tommy Holmes who hit safely in 37 consecutive games for the Boston Braves in 1945.
According to Baseball Almanac, there are 54 hit streaks of 30 games or longer in Major League Baseball history. Only 10 players have hit safely in 36 or more consecutive games.
The Braves are off Thursday, which prompted manager Fredi Gonzalez to jokingly propose sending his second baseman down to the minors to keep his bat blazing.
“Let’s find a game for him to play tomorrow so he can stay hot. We’re going to send him to Gwinnett or Mobile or one of those places so he can keep swinging it.”

Wizards adjusting to boos for Andray Blatche
By Michael Lee
Coach Randy Wittman isn’t sure if there is anything that he can do to help Andray Blatche ease his way onto the floor during games at Verizon Center. When Wittman sent Blatche to the scorer’s table to check in for JaVale McGee in the first quarter of the Wizards’ loss to Golden State, Blatche was serenaded with boos and was obviously shaken by the response. Checking in ain’t easy.
(John McDonnell - THE WASHINGTON POST)
He put Blatche in during a timeout in the third quarter, fans didn’t boo him until he touched the ball. But Blatche was ineffective, no matter how he was inserted. Wittman said all that he can really do is push him to keep fighting through the jeers. “I talk to him every day. I’m just trying to encourage him. His play is going to get up there. It’s getting better. Sitting out that long, he wasn’t going to come back and be the Dray of old, and we knew that, he knew that, and it’s tough. Hey, that’s a tough situation, and I’ve just got to encourage him as much as I can and he’s doing some good things while he’s on the floor, from a defensive standpoint, rebounding. His offense, he’s got no legs right now, and if have no legs, you’re going to struggle scoring the ball. I think that’s what everybody is just kind of looking at right now, but I’ve just got to be there to encourage him.”

With the Wizards set to host the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, the arena will surely be filled with purple-and-gold, as usual, so it could feel like a road game in many ways. Veteran Maurice Evans added that while Blatche has been singled out by fans, he believes there is a message behind the mocking. “Those boos aren’t just for him. They are for the team in general. We’re not performing. We’re underperforming and consistently underpeforming and now, there has to be some changes made. This is just something we have to rally around him.” The Wizards have tried to move Blatche in advance of the March 15, with his $28-million extension coming back to haunt them. In the meantime, Evans said the Wizards need to do more to make the game easier for him. “I told him to go into the post. I don’t care if you miss shots down there as a post player,” Evans said. “That’s his best asset, is his post game. Not so much his perimeter game and I think we’re doing him a disservice by putting him in a lot of pick and rolls where he’s far out from the basket. Now he’s being expected to make a play, under duress with the fans, and with the pressure and things aren’t already going well on a night when we’re down 20 points, putting him in the post and letting him get back into a comfort zone, because he can help us.”
Wait, isn’t that what Blatche complained about after the season opener? Blatche had nine rebounds and five assists in his return last Saturday against Cleveland, but he has struggled with his shot since coming back. He has gone 2-for-9 from the field (22 percent), getting his two made baskets on dunks against the Warriors.
“We’ve got to stick in as a family in this locker room,” Wall said. “We’d love the support from the fans, but at the same time, if they are going to boo him, we’ve got to stay strong and stick with him and that’s what we’re doing.”
Former Wizards Kwame Brown and Juwan Howard had to endure catcalls in their final months with the organization, but Rashard Lewis said he has never seen a player experience the jeers that Blatche has had to endure. “That’s most definitely tough, especially being booed in front of your home crowd fans, but you know he’s got to play through it,” Lewis said. “You got to turn those boos into cheers. The only way you can do that is going out there and playing hard on both ends of the court.”

Baltimore Ravens getting a kick out of Justin Tucker
Duane Burleson/Associated Press - Justin Tucker capped a 6-for-6 performance against the Lions during Week 15 with a 61-yard field goal.
By Dave Sheinin, E-mail the writer
BALTIMORE — Early Sunday evening, on his 38th field goal attempt of the season, under optimal conditions at M&T Bank Stadium — warm temperatures, dry field, wind at his back, a mere 37 yards to the goal posts — Justin Tucker did something remarkable and stunning, arguably as remarkable and stunning as the game-winning 61-yarder he had hit the week before to beat Detroit and cap a 6-for-6 night.
The snap was fine. The hold was fine. It was the Baltimore Ravens’ biggest game of the season to that point, late December against the New England Patriots, and the man who has become a Baltimore cult hero for both his kicking prowess and his colorful personality swung his right leg through the ball — and missed.
And with that, his first miss in more than three months, Tucker could be sure of one thing: The week that followed would be nothing like the week that had just passed.There would be no mid-week news conferences in front of a horde of reporters, no awards for AFC special teams player of the week, no fluffy features on the local newscasts. There would be nobody printing up T-shirts with Tucker’s face and the phrase “I Got It” — his words to Ravens Coach John Harbaugh just before the winning kick in Detroit — and no talking heads blabbing breathlessly on ESPN, as Skip Bayless did on “First Take” the week before, that Tucker was the “most spectacular weapon in football.”“I look at it pretty simply,” Tucker said following the Ravens’ 41-7 loss, in which his 0-for-1 performance on field goals was hardly their biggest problem. “I missed a kick. Just move on, and I’ll make the next one.”Perhaps the problem with Sunday’s miss against the Patriots was that the stakes and the degree of difficulty simply weren’t high enough. The Ravens were trailing 20-0 early in the fourth quarter, and a make wasn’t going to drastically improve their odds of winning.Had it been later in the game, and a closer score, perhaps things would have gone differently. In the past two years, Tucker has had six attempts in the final two minutes with the Ravens trailing by three points or fewer, and he has made all six — including the 61-yarder with 38 seconds left to beat the Lions on Monday Night Football. He is also 10 of 11 from 50-plus yards in his career — his 90.9 percent success rate from that distance far exceeding this year’s league average of 65.2 percent — and had converted 33 straight attempts overall before Sunday’s uncharacteristic miss.But Tucker’s success at booting footballs through the 181
/
2 feet of space between the uprights is only half of his appeal. While other players grumble about fantasy football owners hounding them on social media, Tucker actually took a moment after his game-winner in Detroit to give a shout-out to those who own him in fantasy leagues.“Thank you for picking me up,” he said that night. “It means a lot to me. And hopefully I can continue to contribute to the successes of your respective teams.”He is also a former music major at the University of Texas who trained as an opera singer and has dabbled in hip-hop production. His agent says he has standing offers to appear with two local opera companies when the season is over. A recent Dr. Pepper commercial showed Tucker, a baritone, alternately belting out an aria from Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” on a spot-lit stage and booming footballs off a tee from the same stage into the balcony.The Ravens may not have known exactly what they were getting when they signed Tucker as an undrafted free agent out of Texas in 2012, and invited him to compete against incumbent Billy Cundiff in training camp. Four other place kickers were drafted that year, while Tucker’s phone never rang, a slight that still motivates him. In training camp, he beat out Cundiff for the job, then hit 30 of his 33 field goal tries that season, the second-best performance by a rookie in NFL history, and capped his year with a 47-yard, double-overtime game-winner at Denver in the AFC Divisional playoffs.“He was competing for a job, and he never wavered,” Harbaugh told reporters last week, recalling Tucker’s training camp vanquishing of Cundiff. “He made kicks, and every one of those kicks was a pressure kick because he was trying to establish himself and win a job. I don’t think anything has changed.”The closest thing to a crisis of confidence that Tucker has experienced came this season in Week 2, when he missed a pair of kicks against Cleveland. But the crisis, such as it was, passed quickly. He hit all three of his tries the next week against Houston and didn’t miss again until this past Sunday against New England, snapping a streak of 33 straight makes.“I’ve got experiences, personally, I can draw upon,” Tucker said after Sunday’s loss. “I go back to Week 2. I struggled in one game, had a couple of misses. And just like anyone else in here, the focus is on next week and bouncing back.”The Ravens’ loss Sunday means they no longer control their playoff destiny. They travel to Cincinnati this week for their season finale, needing a victory and some help — a loss by either Miami or San Diego — to sneak into the playoffs as the second wild card.Sunday’s blowout loss notwithstanding, the Ravens are accustomed to playing in tight games this season; entering the New England game, nine of their previous 11 games were determined by three or fewer points. There is every reason to suspect this Sunday’s finale at Cincinnati — and with it, the Ravens’ playoff hopes — will come down to the final seconds, and to Tucker’s right foot.It is a scenario the Ravens — and one suspects, a good many fantasy owners — would gladly take every time.
