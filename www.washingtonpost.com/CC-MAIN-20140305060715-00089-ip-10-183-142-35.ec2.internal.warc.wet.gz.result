McConnell, McCain will block future stopgap bills unless they include long-term defense funding
By Felicia Sonmez
The Senate Republican leader and a leading GOP voice on defense issues said Wednesday that they will block any short-term bills funding the federal government after the one being considered this week unless they are accompanied by a resolution funding the Defense Department through the end of the fiscal year in September.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced the move during an exchange on the Senate floor Wednesday morning.
“We can’t do this to the men and women who are serving to deprive them of the equipment, the training and the wherewithal when we’re in two wars, and it’s vital in my view that we not allow another continuing resolution without addressing the defense appropriations bill ... and we should be for the remainder of the year,” McCain said.
McConnell said he agreed with McCain and added “with total confidence” that both the House and the Senate will not pass any further stopgap funding bills without a longer-term defense appropriations bill.
“I don’t intend myself to support another continuing resolution that does not contain the full-year defense appropriation bill,” McConnell said. “I think everybody understands the urgency of that. My friend from Arizona, our leader, on these issues has been very clear and articulate about it, and I can say with total confidence that the House and Senate are not going to be passing another continuing resolution without the funding for the Defense Department for the remainder of this fiscal year.”
A measure funding the government through April 8 – the sixth such stopgap this fiscal year -- cleared the House on Tuesday and is expected to be approved by the Senate before Friday, when the measure currently keeping the government in operation is set to expire. McCain and McConnell were referring to short-term measures proposed after the one being considered this week.
The next step in the spending battle remains unclear; House Republicans say the Senate must pass a funding bill, while Democrats say the House GOP leadership must come up with a proposal that shows its willingness to compromise.
Members in both chambers have increasingly voiced opposition to any additional stopgaps, as evident in Tuesday’s House vote, when 54 Republicans and 104 Democrats voted against the latest short-term plan. Many of those who have criticized the recent two- and three-week funding bills have argued that such actions create uncertainty and endanger national security; the Defense Department has reportedly put off equipment repairs and enacted hiring freezes, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called for the longer-term defense appropriations bill to be passed even as the broader budget debate continues.
McConnell said Wednesday that he believed his and McCain’s position was shared by House leaders. “I think there is no chance that we will not complete work on the defense appropriation bill in the next few weeks,” he said.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also on Tuesday emphasized the urgency of approving a longer-term defense appropriations bill, saying that the measure needs to be part “of the conversation.”

‘THOR: THE DARK WORLD’: As trailer lands, new director brings the hammer down with dark menace
By David Betancourt and Michael Cavna
AS THIS GAME OF TRAILERS goes, Marvel Studios sees DC Entertainment’s two Oscar-winning narrators — and aims to raise with Chris Hemsworth’s voiceover.
Last week, Warner Bros./DC released a “Man of Steel” trailer that heavily featured the distinct voices of Academy Award-winning grizzled veterans Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner. On Tuesday, almost as if cribbing from a similar playbook, Disney/Marvel released its “Thor: The Dark World” trailer — and relied on the Oscar-winning throats of stars Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman.
On that score, we’ll call it a draw between the dueling sneak-peeks.
The “Thor” sequel trailer is a full minute shorter, but there’s still plenty to take away from all the action. Let’s break it down:
As the Thor franchise loses Kenneth Branagh from the director’s chair and gains Alan Taylor, the God of Thunder appears to be in good hands. And judging, at least, from this mere two minutes of footage, Marvel Studios is comfortably in cruise control with the launch of Phase 2.
In this peek is any indication, Taylor is applying a darker tone overall. With any luck, Marvel Studios may have hit one out of the park by handing the reins to a man who has directed multiple episodes of HBO’s “Game of Thrones.”
So what do we see in the trailer?
Hemsworth returns, hammer in hand.
(Mark Fellman / MARVEL - .)
An ancient evil threatens everything. Thor (Hemsworth) comes back for Jane (Natalie Portman) and brings her to Asgard — though Darcy (Kat Dennings) returns for the sequel, as well. Sif (Jaimie Alexander) doesn’t seem to be too pleased with Jane’s presence (casting a pretty intense evil eye). And Jane — to Thor’s great displeasure — may be in grave danger. There’s also, of course, a battle for Mjolnir. Bring down the hammer.
The trailer culminates with a desperate Thor turning to his imprisoned adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), for help.
“You should know, that when you betray me. I will kill you,” Thor says.
“When do we start?” says an unflinching Loki.
Most of the trailer teases the possibilities of providing what everyone wants in a sequel: a better movie. We get a more menacing tone, more action — and Taylor apparently won’t sell us short with that core conflict between Thor and Loki.
The trailer’s closing moments convey the love and hate between the Asgardian bros, and Hiddleston appears primed to steal a few scenes. With that, we have hope — because watching Thor and Loki go at it never gets old.

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Washington Master Chorale first-rate in performance of 20th-century works
Jonathan Black - Washington Master Chorale.
By Cecelia Porter, E-mail the writer
If you want great choral music, Washington is the place to go, with its half-dozen or more massive symphonic choruses and plentiful supply of chamber ensembles. And they all come equipped with splendid orchestras. Founded in 2009, the Washington Master Chorale gave a first-rate performance — including a world premiere by Donald McCullough — at the National Presbyterian Church on Sunday. Over 60 voices strong, the WMC adds another dimension to the choral scene with a group fitting in between the grand and small-sized chamber groups.
The WMC focused on some lovely 20th-century works set to texts by such well-known poets as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman. Besides McCullough, the composers included Daniel Pinkham, Cecil Effinger, Ross Lee Finney, Samuel Barber, Adolphus Hailstork and Stephen Chatman. Throughout the program, the chorus responded to director Thomas Colohan’s exacting gestures, intonation was superbly stable — even in unaccompanied works — while all the sections paid close attention to each other in nearly perfect ensemble. The single flaw was imprecise, fuzzy diction, even though all the texts were in English.

Free admission Get ideas All the musical settings were solidly tonal, making them accessible, audience-friendly and performable by all well-trained choral groups. The centerpiece of the day was the premiere of McCullough’s “The Eye Begins to See.” The composition, which expressed the confession of an oppressed soul drowning in pathos, voiced many shades of darkness but was relieved ultimately by light and hope. Dissonant outbursts in this piece were effective. Colohan drew dramatic power from his singers, joined by the vocal quartet Words & Music along with cellist Kacy Clopton and pianists Mark Vogel and Virginia Sircy. Oboist Alison Lowell lent a mournful tone to Effinger’s “Four Pastorales.”All in all, the concert was skillfully wrought and moving. But the sad fact is that, apart from the scores of major composers such as Bach, Handel, Verdi, and Monteverdi — choral music such as that heard Sunday rarely reaches the general public and major concert halls.
