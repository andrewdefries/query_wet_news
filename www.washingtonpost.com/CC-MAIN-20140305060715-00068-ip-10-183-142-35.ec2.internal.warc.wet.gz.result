Morning Bits
By Jennifer Rubin
Fertilizing the soil? The obscene tribute to violence care of Fatah, which is now officially in league with Hamas. Tell me, why we are still funding Mahmoud Abbas?
Bringing people together. “Theological doctrine has split Catholics, Protestants and Jews for centuries, but President Obama has found a way to unite them in America. The problem — for Obama and his reelection prospects — is that he’s united them against him. And they are ready to go to war.”
Leading from behind has its drawbacks. Doing nothing means Bashar al-Assad and his patrons win. “The key issue in Syria today is who will win — our side or the opposing side, which is a real axis of evil. This isn’t about the exact confessional balance of those opposing Assad, or the exact provisions of the next Syrian constitution. All those questions will come with victory against the bad guys — but only with victory. The goal today is more simple, and more old-fashioned: to defeat our enemies. Iran and Russia appear to see this very clearly. So should we.”
Making hay.“‘Just another broken promise,’ [Speaker John] Boehner told reporters at the Republican National Committee when asked about the Obama campaign’s decision to give its blessing to Priorities USA Action, the super PAC founded by a pair of former top White House aides.”
Giving him his due. Larry Kudlow: “For one time in a row the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, got the story right. No, it wasn’t King Dollar. It was taxes. Testifying before members of the Senate Budget Committee today, Mr. Bernanke referred to the scheduled repeal of the Bush tax cuts. He said, ‘If no action is taken by January 2013, there will be a very sharp change in the fiscal stance of the United States government.’”
Calling the media out. “The Media Is Really Hoping For A Santorum Surge Right Now.” Well, what else are we going to write about?
Decrying the infringement on freedom of religion. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): “Make no mistake: the Obama Administration’s decision to force religious hospitals, charities, and schools to comply with a mandate that violates their religious views is abhorrent to the foundational principles of our nation. No one in the United States of America should ever be compelled by their government to choose between violating their religious beliefs or be penalized for refusing. Yet that’s precisely what this mandate would do.” The only issue now is how fast Obama can backpedal. Maybe a memo in the middle of the night? Oh, that was the other broken promise.
Retreating already? “A political adviser to President Barack Obama said Tuesday the administration didn’t intend to ‘abridge anyone’s religious freedom’ with its regulation requiring church-affiliated employers to cover birth control for their workers. ‘This is an important issue. It’s important for millions of women around the country,’ said Axelrod, the political adviser to Obama’s reelection campaign. ‘We want to resolve it in an appropriate way and we’re going to do that.’”
