Lindsay Lohan stands up ‘Today’s’ Matt Lauer [Updated]
By Lisa de Moraes
Lindsay Lohan
(Evan Agostini - AP)
NBC News’s Matt Lauer returned to “Today” show Thursday morning, minus the interview with Lindsay Lohan he flown to Los Angeles to land, and looking plenty peeved. Look who’s back!” “Today” show sweetheart Ann Curry said at the top of the show – right after mentioning the overnight capture in Santa Monica, CA of a notorious mobster who’d been on the lam for nearly 20 years, and the evacuation of 11,000 from flooded regions of North Dakota -- but before mentioning plans for troop draw-down in Afghanistan as detailed by of President Obama in his address to the nation on Wednesday night. “Yeah…back from a shoot that didn’t happen. We’ll have a bit more about that a little later on,” Matt said somberly. After testing positive for alcohol right around the time she threw a barbeque during the house arrest she’s been sentenced to in the wake of her unending stream of DUIs, probation violations, and maybe necklace thefts -- she pleaded no contest on that one -- the Disney kid star turned tabloid darling is once again the Diamond-Spangled Unicorn of Infotainment Show Gets. “Today” show could use one of those. Last week -- the first full week of The Ann Curry Era at “Today” -- only 626,000 viewers separated the show from ABC’s “Good Morning America.” After landing this Super-Big Get, Matt flew to Los Angeles to sit down with La Lohan in her home. But LiLo 86’d the sit-down at the last minute. What caused her to do so is still a matter of some debate. One camp says Matt blindsided LiLo and her camp with word the interview would last longer than 15 minutes, to give him enough material for both “Today” and “Dateline.” Indeed, a “Today” rep told the press Lohan’s last-minute change of heart happened because she “wasn’t prepared to talk for more than 15 minutes.” But another camp insists Lohan changed her mind after learning she’d failed the drug test -- would have been tough for even a thespian of Lohan’s stature to pull off a “turning my life around” performance with Matt after that. Anyway, the top of Thursday’s show, Ann noted that LiLo may have once again violated terms of her probation, and was scheduled to be in front of a judge that very morning After an utterly adequate report on the story, sadly lacking the intimate little chat with Matt that would have made all the difference in the ratings, Matt put on his “of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: it might have been” face and began: “By the way, some of you may have heard that I was actually with Lindsay on Tuesday afternoon at her home in Los Angeles. We were supposed to sit down for an interview to talk about her current situation and her plans for the future. At the last minute, Lindsay and her people did express concern about the timing of the interview and it was canceled. I think we’re learning more this morning about the reasons for their concerns.” “Okay, well, let’s move on, shall we? Let’s talk about something else,” Ann suggested maternally to Matt. And they did. But, does this story sound naggingly familiar to you serious students of television? If so, you’re probably thinking about two years back, when original “Survivor” champ Richard Hatch, finishing up his prison sentence for tax evasion on his “Survivor winnings” with home confinement, gave an exclusive interview to “Today” -- only the “Today” interview turned into an interview for “Today,” AND the NBC-owned celebrity suck-up-show “Access Hollywood,” AND the local NBC TV station -- which wound Hatch back in the hoosegow. Authorities who gave Hatch permission to do the interview said they had been led to believe by NBC they were interviewing him for “Today” only. Hatch’s attorney said she thought the permission granted for the “Today” interview would extend to all NBC properties. But Federal Bureau of Prisons does not subscribe to this vertical integration notion, and sent Hatch to solitary because NBC had not secured permission for the interviews with the celebrity suck-up show or local station. “Richard Hatch is back behind bars!” Lauer had said breathlessly on “Today” in August of ’09 the morning after successfully landing, conducting, and airing that interview. “He was arrested just a couple of hours after we aired our exclusive interview,” Matt continued. “The question this morning, ‘Why?’ Was it something he did, or was it something said in that interview?” Lohan, meanwhile, appeared in court today but did not get sent back to the Big House over the alcohol test, though she was ordered to knock off the parties during house arrest and instead confine her socializing to just one pal at a time, or family. After which, she tweeted, “Thank you to all of my fans for your support. Sending you Love and Light.”
Which is probably no comfort to Matt.

Online-only wine store grows local customer base
By Mohana Ravindranath, E-mail the writer
Tom Natan’s wine shop is not really a store at all. A chemical engineer and oenophile himself, Natan’s business brings imported French, Spanish and Maltese wines directly to customers — but he operates entirely without a storefront.
Natan didn’t exactly plan it that way.
(MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP/GETTY IMAGES) - First Vine is highly selective in its imports — it currently only carries wines from Spain, Malta, and France — and sells exclusively online. Six years ago, he was introduced to a co-worker’s husband who owned a vineyard in Provence, France. The grapes from that vineyard were sent to a nearby winery run by a village cooperative, and Natan discovered the resulting vintages had yet to make their way to the United States.So he reached out to several winery owners, and leveraged his personal relationships to exclusively import their wines to the Washington, D.C. area.When he applied for his wine retail license, he had planned to open a brick-and-mortar specialty wine and food shop. Then he noticed an important loophole in the D.C. liquor code allowing him to save on the overhead costs and rent. “There’s no requirement that you have a physical storefront [for a liquor store],” he said. The code did, however, require that the retail license be associated with a particular location, so Natan registered the license to a Security Storage Warehouse in Adams Morgan where he keeps all his imported wines. The unconventional arrrangement means Natan cannot access his own inventory without calling in advance, and he is then escorted to his storage space. Warehouse workers load his car with bottles of wine for him — he then personally delivers the wine to his customers within the District, often paying for the transportation cost himself.Most of his customers buy their bottles from his Web site, FirstVine.com, after having sampled the wine for free at local retail shops and restaurants like Mount-Pleasant dress shop Nana, U-Street’s GoodWood, and Hill’s Kitchen near Capitol Hill – all businesses Natan has approached and asked to partner with. First Vine delivers usually within 48-hours of an online order, depending on the availability of the customer. But as liquor laws generally vary by state, Natan must tailor his delivery model outside the District depending on the home state of the customer. State liquor laws sometimes require out-of-state liquor to be shipped by a “common carrier” – for example FirstVine uses FedEx, an approved common carrier, to ship to Virginia. First Vine can deliver to D.C., Virginia, California and parts of Alaska – shipments to 17 other states can be made through Vinoshipper, an online wine-shipping site.Despite the complex state liquor laws, Natan prefers online retail to a brick-and-mortar storefront. In a good month, FirstVine receives 50-60 orders, each generally for six or more bottles. “I don’t have to be sitting in a retail shop. I process the orders as they come in, and make deliveries when it’s convenient for the customer,” he said. Most of his customers are people who enjoy wine with dinner multiple times a week and want to buy several bottles of wine for $10-15 each—this pattern accounts for 75 percent of sales, he explained. Another significant chunk of his orders come from local caterers. Natan has created a multi-pronged marketing strategy. Though his retail license prevents him from selling his wines on the spot at the free wine tastings, which usually happen twice a month in the summer, Natan draws some orders at these events. (He noted that July and August are his slower for business because potential customers are on vacation – February and November months are busiest.) First Vine participates in the Washington Wine and Food Show in February, where his retail license allows him to sell on site. Additionally, First Vine offers wine tasting at events through the Alliance Française, a French language and cultural center, to reach the Francophone community who might crave French wine. Natan also maintains a blog about the wines and food pairings on the First Vine site — he keeps about 1,500 customers informed through the First Vine listserv.Yet, Natan noted the downsides of his sales model. For example, First Vine doesn’t get any impulse buyers, and he can’t physically introduce new wines to the customers if they stumble upon his site. He also has to purchase all the inventory in advance before he knows if he can sell them – he usually makes three orders of 25-50 cases each from overseas wineries every year. The shipments take about six weeks, and upon arrival the wines need to sit or settle for another three weeks before sale. As of 2011, his business is just breaking even.He has considered soliciting outside funding, but doesn’t think it will be fruitful. Investors might “have a hard time grasping a store without a storefront,” he said.However, Natan said he doesn’t think he imports enough wine to be a full service brick-and-mortar wine shop. “People would be looking for more variety than we could offer in a wine shop. We would have to amp up our selection, though I’m not averse to doing that,” he said.Follow On Small Business on Twitter.

Obama calls on Libya’s neighbors to arrest fleeing Gaddafi loyalists
View Photo Gallery — After taking Tripoli, rebel fighters close in on Moammar Gaddafi’s last bastions of support. By Karen DeYoung and Leila Fadel, E-mail the writers
The Obama administration on Tuesday urged Libya’s neighbors to arrest fleeing members of Moammar Gaddafi’s ousted government, as at least a dozen senior Libyan military officials arrived in Niger after escaping across the southern desert.
U.S. overhead surveillance observed a convoy entering Niger on Tuesday morning, but U.S. and NATO officials said any attempt to stop the vehicles would have been outside their mandate. The State Department and Libyan rebel officials said there was no indication that Gaddafi was among those who fled.
Video
One spokesman for Libyan fighters claimed Wednesday that opponents of the ousted dictator have Moammar Gaddafi surrounded, although another official said his location was still unknown. (Sept. 7) Conflicting reports from rebel forces placed Gaddafi in various locations throughout his tribal heartland, a triangle between his coastal home town, Sirte; the oasis town of Bani Walid to the west, where Gaddafi’s son Saif al-Islam is believed to be hiding; and the city of Sabha, on the edge of the Sahara in the south.NATO aircraft continued flying strike missions over coastal areas, but officials said that a decreasing number of targets fall within the alliance’s authorized mission of protecting civilians from government forces. That mission has been broadly interpreted to include any massed group of government troops and command-and-control facilities.The current NATO mandate runs out on Sept. 27; its renewal would require a political decision by alliance members. Military mission commanders could also recommend an end to the bombing before then.“The actual operational plan says that the end state is whenever we decide we’ve achieved what we set out to do,” said a NATO official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue. In Sirte and Bani Walid, Gaddafi “still has organized military forces capable of inflicting damages on civilians. As long as air power is still capable of dealing with that threat, we still have a mission. We’re still destroying stuff every day.”Although U.S. “national technical means” — satellites and high-flying reconnaissance aircraft — observed the convoy entering Niger, the area is nearly 1,000 miles south of where NATO strike aircraft are operating, the official said. Hitting such targets “would be a completely different operation. . . . We would have to refuel over Libyan territory.”In addition, he said, the alliance has “no independent means to verify” who is traveling in closed vehicles. “We have no idea where [Gaddafi] is,” the official said. “We really haven’t had a good sense for a while.”NATO spokesman Col. Roland Lavoie, in Naples, said it is not within the alliance’s mission “to track and target thousands of fleeing former regime leaders, mercenaries, military commanders and internally displaced people.”Estimates of the number of vehicles in the convoy to Niger varied from 50 to more than 200. An official for the rebels’ governing Transitional National Council said the vehicles were armed and carried more than 250 people. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so he could talk frankly, said the rebels are worried about security along Libya’s thousands of miles of border because they have no ability to lock it down.Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the head of the council, has asked Niger to stop Gaddafi and his top officials from crossing the border. But according to council members and media accounts from Niamey, the capital of Niger, the loyalist convoy was welcomed inside the country.State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that, based on U.S. conversations with Nigerien officials, those arriving in the convoy appeared to include “some dozen or more senior members of the regime” and “members of the senior military staff.” All of them, she said, were subject to a U.N. travel ban on members of the Gaddafi government, and some may be under indictment by the International Criminal Court.“We have strongly urged the Nigerien officials to detain those members of the regime who may be subject to prosecution, to ensure that they confiscate any weapons that are found and to ensure that any state property of the government of Libya — money, jewels, et cetera — also be impounded so that it can be returned to the Libyan people.”“Our understanding is that they are going to take appropriate measures,” Nuland said, and work with the rebel council in Libya “on what is to be done with both the people and the property.”Nuland said the administration has made similar overtures to “all of the neighboring states . . . about their U.N. Security Council obligations, and those conversations will continue.” Gaddafi’s second wife, his daughter and son, and numerous other family members fled last week to Algeria, whose government has said they were admitted for “humanitarian reasons.”Burkina Faso, like Niger a recipient of Libyan aid over the years, has said it will grant asylum to Gaddafi and members of his family. On Tuesday, however, the Foreign Ministry in Ouagadougou, the capital, said it had received no request for exile from Gaddafi and he was not expected there. Burkina Faso has recognized the Transitional National Council as Libya’s official government.The convoy crossed the border as negotiations broke down over Bani Walid, where the rebels have given a one-week extension to loyalist forces to surrender or face attack. Late Tuesday, however, an al-Jazeera correspondent outside the town reported that talks had collapsed, rebel negotiators had been fired upon and an attack was imminent.As the hunt for Gaddafi continued, his die-hard supporters remained defiant Tuesday. “We are fighting and resisting for the sake of Libya and all Arabs,” Moussa Ibrahim, Gaddafi’s spokesman and the public face of his government, told the Syria-based al-Rai television station, a pro-Gaddafi channel. “We are still strong and capable of turning the tables on NATO.”To counter reports that Gaddafi was planning to flee, Ibrahim told al-Rai that the longtime ruler was in “excellent health, planning and organizing for the defense of Libya.”After he spoke, a video was posted on rebel Facebook pages of fighters who have detained Gaddafi’s deputy foreign minister, Khaled Kaim. The video showed Kaim sitting on a bed, being interrogated by rebels who called him a “liar” and a “dog” and accused him of using foreign mercenaries against them.
Fadel reported from Tripoli.
