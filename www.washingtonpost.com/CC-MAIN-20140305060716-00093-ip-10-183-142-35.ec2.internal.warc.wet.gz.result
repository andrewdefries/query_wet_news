Jimmy Kimmel and Morrissey feud over ‘Duck Dynasty’
Kyle Gustafson/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST - British music legend Morrissey (front) performs at the Strathmore Music Hall with Boz Boorer, Solomon Walker and Anthony Burulcich. His set included solo hits like "Everyday Is Sunday"and "Still Ill" from The Smiths.

When you cancel at the last minute on your late-night talk-show appearance — because you found out the show had paired you with someone to whom you are morally opposed — then assume the show’s comic headliner is going to savage you on-air.
You can always accuse the comic of living in the intellectual fog of the ’50s and not be far off.

Pulitzer Prize winner, Peabody recipient, Medal of Freedom honoree -- Lisa de Moraes is none of these, but she is an authority on the bad direction, over-acting, and muddled plot lines being played out in the TV industry's executive suites. Archive
Live Q&As
@WaPoTeamTV
“Jimmy Kimmel Live” booked the cast of A&E’s “Duck Dynasty” Tuesday night — the same night that former Smiths frontman Morrissey was booked to perform.Morrissey is widely known to be an animal-rights campaigner — the kind of guy who insists that Los Angeles’s Staples Center should be a meat-free zone the night of his performance.That appears to be news to Kimmel’s bookers.“Duck Dynasty” follows the antics of a Louisiana family that has made its fortune selling stuff that people use to hunt ducks — duck calls, decoys, etc. “Duck Dynasty” is an extremely popular cable TV docu-soap.Late Monday, Morrissey — upon learning of the other guests — issued a statement saying that he would love to perform on the ABC late-night show . . . if Kimmel dumped the “Duck Dynasty” gang.If not, he said, he’d have to step away, what with the “Duck Dynasty” clan being “people who, in effect, amount to animal serial-killers.”Makes perfect sense, Morrissey being the guy who co-wrote the Smiths song “Meat Is Murder” — which also may be useful information for Kimmel’s bookers.On Tuesday night, Kimmel was sincerely unapologetic for the snafu, telling his audience that a young band from Denver called Churchill had nicely stepped in for Morrissey. He said that he “respects” Morrissey’s position — as convincingly as Seth MacFarlane would say he respects TV critics.“There’s a very good reason why I didn’t dump ‘Duck Dynasty,’ ” Kimmel explained to his audience at the top of Tuesday’s episode. “It’s because they have guns, and Morrissey doesn’t.”If Morrissey is really serious about this animal-activism thing, he shouldn’t make TV appearances of any kind, Kimmel extrapolated. When Morrissey appeared on David Letterman’s show recently, for instance, “there had to be an Outback Steakhouse ad in the mix,” Kimmel said.Morrissey, Kimmel concluded, “keeps finding ways to depress us.” Even then, Kimmel wasn’t through batting around Morrissey for his devotion to animals.The “Duck Dynasty” guys “feel bad” about what happened and want Morrissey to know that they also make “calls” for people who are opposed to shooting of animals, Kimmel said — by way of introducing a gag ad the show made, for a Duck Dynasty Carrot Call. In the ad, the “Duck Dynasty” hunters are seen blowing into their carrot-callers, causing unsuspecting young carrots to jump out of the soil and into their mouths. “I love yuppie food!” the ad ends.“I was disappointed with last night’s Jimmy Kimmel show wherein our smiling host managed to ridicule depression (70% of Americans suffer from depression according to the National Institute of Mental Health),” Morrissey said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.“He then found time to ridicule healthy eating (the obesity epidemic in the U.S. costs $147 billion per year in medical expenditure), and he also ridiculed the notion that animals should be entitled to the possession of their own lives,” wrote Morrissey, developing his Kimmel’s-a-nincompoop leitmotif.“Furthermore, he found time to jokingly promote gun-ownership — hugely amusing for the parents at Sandy Hook, no doubt. He also promoted his special guests Duck Dynasty — who kill beings for fun.“None of the above issues are, of course, as important as Jimmy Kimmel himself, who has finally revealed his show to have an overwhelming loss of meaning. Tune in and relive the intellectual fog of the 1950s,” Morrissey concluded.
New ‘Dead’ heads
AMC unveils new “The Walking Dead” show runners like FX unveils new “American Horror Story” story lines: nearly every season.On Wednesday, AMC officially announced that “Dead’s” supervising producer, Scott M. Gimple, had been promoted to exec producer and show runner, confirming news reports from January. Gimple is replacing Glen Mazzara on the zombie drama. Mazzara had replaced Frank Darabont, who left early in the second season. That makes Gimple the third “Dead” show runner in four seasons.AMC also announced that it had promoted “Dead’s” co-exec producer (who is also the show’s special-effects makeup supervisor/sometime director) Greg Nicotero to exec producer, and that it had done the same for series producer Tom Luse.Presumably, one of them will replace Gimple when he decides he’s told all the stories he wants to tell and has connected with his fans on a level he never imagined was possible, and feels it is time to move on — like Mazzara did around the end of Season 3. Those two other new exec producers are joining exec producers Robert Kirkman (whose comic books are the basis of the series), Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert.Anyway, the show is festooned with exec producers for its fourth season, which begins production May 6 in Atlanta.AMC exec VP Joel Stillerman — who always seems to be around when a “Walking Dead” show runner decides to pursue other opportunities — said that Gimple’s voice has been integral to the show since he joined the production. It seems Gimple’s the guy who wrote last season’s gripping midseason finale, which revealed Sophia in the barn.Yet Gimple allows himself to be photographed in argyle sweaters over cat neckties.When Mazzara left, he and the network said the parting was a mutual decision, but others fluttering around the show said that Kirkman helped show Mazzara the way out.

Mitt Romney: A nice guy in a season of nastiness
By Kathleen Parker, Most Americans would agree that the most memorable moment from Wednesday night’s GOP debate was when Rick um, um, um, whateverhisnameis couldn’t remember the third leg of his own policy for streamlining the federal government.
With great conviction, Perry asserted that when he becomes president, he’ll eliminate three agencies: “It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone — Commerce, Education and, the, uh, what’s the third one there, let’s see. . . .” Kathleen Parker
Parker writes a twice-weekly column on politics and culture.

Robinson: The GOP’s nonsense debate
Parker: Romney’s greatest weakness
The 53-second eternity has been replayed sufficiently, so we needn’t belabor the cringe-inducing amnesia of the 47th Texas governor. It was so bad that even disciples of schadenfreude ducked under their blankies and prayed for deliverance. “Oops” was all that was left to Perry when he couldn’t recall the third agency he would stomp beneath the heel of his Texas boot. “I can’t,” he said when pressed by moderator John Harwood. “Oops.” Oops, I can’t remember? Oops, “I stepped in it” (as he said after the debate to reporters gathering for his wake)? Or, oops, I don’t really know what I think (as many undoubtedly concluded)? It’s right there on my very own Web site — RickPerry.org — the candidate told several morning show hosts in a desperate media binge to salvage his campaign. As Perry was free-falling into the abyss of lost thoughts Wednesday night, he turned to his fellow contestants as if to say, “Please, someone, can’t you tell me what I think?” Unhelpfully, Ron Paul suggested there were really five agencies he should cut. And then someone did try to help him, and this to me was the most memorable moment of the evening. From somewhere on the panel, a voice reached out to the struggling Texan, a suggestion that might help Perry gather himself and emerge from this utter humiliation. The voice belonged to Mitt Romney. As Perry’s brain was hardening into arctic pack ice, Romney suggested that maybe the third agency he wanted to eliminate was the EPA. Yeah, that’s it! But no, it wasn’t. Pressed by Harwood, Perry said it wasn’t the EPA, but blast if he could remember what it was. (Later he said it was Energy.) Romney’s suggestion when most of the others were squirmingly silent was an act of pure kindness and self-sacrificing generosity. It was not especially noticeable. But if you were Rick Perry in that moment, you were well aware that Romney was the one who tried to save you. When Perry finally said, “Oops,” it was Romney toward whom he looked. Small, but not insignificant, this gesture of active empathy tells much about the man who extended it. He’s a nice guy in a season of nastiness, a trait that may also be his greatest political failing. Michael Medved, trying to figure out why Republicans don’t love Romney, pointed to his lack of anger. These are angry times and people want their leader to be ticked off, surmised Medved. He may be right, both in theory and in his conclusion: This passion for anger is not good for the country. Others insist that Romney can’t earn people’s confidence because he’s too squeaky clean. Few can identify with a man who never touches coffee or alcohol, whose hair is as precise as the crease in his pants. Or, put another way, the figures in his business ledgers? He seems preternaturally unflappable, which to some is too robotic, not-quite-human. We like some fallibility in our leaders and flaws in our protagonists. Perhaps Romney would benefit from a slight imperfection or some other handicap over which he has struggled. Or might kindness and humility be handicaps in a mean, self-infatuated world? Humility is a tough trait to communicate in a presidential campaign that requires confident self-promotion, though it is often apparent in Romney’s debate face. He looks at others respectfully when they are speaking, and his expression betrays patience and even a hopefulness that they will do well. Romney isn’t shy in reminding voters of his own accomplishments, but there are stories out there that tell another side to his character. Here’s one related to me recently by someone close to the campaign: Romney was shooting an ad on a hot day in a staffer’s yard. While the photo shoot was being set up, Romney was asked to bide time in the cooler shade of the staffer’s garage. When the staffer retrieved Romney 30 minutes later, he discovered that the candidate had swept and organized his garage. A small thing. Or perhaps not. kathleenparker@washpost.com

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Obama signs bill to raise debt limit, reopen government
Video: Here are the key moments from the last day before the financial default deadline, when the Senate and House came together to pass a deal to reopen the government.
By Lori Montgomery and Rosalind S. Helderman, E-mail the writers
After shutting down the U.S. government for 16 days and driving the nation toward the brink of default, a chastened Congress voted late Wednesday to reopen federal agencies, call hundreds of thousands of civil servants back to work and raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit.
An agreement struck by Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ended a stalemate created last month, when hard-line conservatives pushed GOP leaders to use the threat of shutdown to block a landmark expansion of federally funded health coverage.

Back at work, a mass of federal workers start prioritizing
Paul Duggan and Leah Binkovitz Across Washington, there’s a lot of business to catch up on and money to be earned.
That campaign succeeded mainly in undermining popular support for the Republican Party, however. By late Wednesday, dozens of anxious GOP lawmakers were ready to give President Obama almost exactly what he requested months ago: a bill to fund the government and increase the Treasury Department’s borrowing power with no strings attached.“We’ve been locked in a fight over here, trying to bring government down to size, trying to do our best to stop Obamacare,” House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told a Cincinnati radio station. “We fought the good fight. We just didn’t win.” The Senate overwhelmingly ratified the deal Wednesday evening, 81 to 18, with more than half of Senate Republicans voting yes. A few hours later, the House followed suit, approving the measure 285 to 144. Eighty-seven Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in approving the measure, allowing Congress to meet a critical Treasury Department deadline with one day to spare. Obama signed the measure into law shortly after midnight,, reopening parks and monuments across the nation, restoring government services and putting furloughed federal employees back on the job, many of them in the Washington region.“Employees should expect to return to work in the morning,” Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the White House budget director, said in a statement.The measure also guarantees those workers back pay for time spent at home, aid flood-ravaged Colorado and provide extra cash for fighting wildfires out West. And it grants the District government, which relies on Congress to approve its budget, authority to manage its own affairs through the 2014 fiscal year.
Enforcement of the debt limit is suspended until Feb. 7, setting up another confrontation over the national debt sometime in March, independent analysts estimated. Meanwhile, federal agencies are funded through Jan. 15, when they might shut down again unless lawmakers resolve a continuing dispute over deep automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) was to have breakfast Thursday morning with her House counterpart, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to start a new round of talks aimed at averting another crisis. Obama repeated his vow to work with Republicans to rein in a national debt that remains at historically high levels.“With the shutdown behind us and budget committees forming, we now have an opportunity to focus on a sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair, and that helps hardworking people all across this country,” Obama said at the White House. Few held out hope that the talks would yield an ambitious plan to overhaul the tax code or restructure federal health and retirement programs, the biggest drivers of future borrowing. But there were signs that Republicans may be more inclined to compromise and less inclined to follow what Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) called “the fringe elements” of the GOP. “The reality is there’s a much larger population within our caucus that recognizes reality for what it is,” said Schock, who represents the iconic middle-America town of Peoria. “At the end of the day, whatever we pass will have to be a bipartisan bill. The sooner that our conference recognizes that we’re going to have to negotiate with the other side, the more we can get done.”The fight over the health-care law that many call Obamacare originated on the Senate side of the Capitol, with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), as well as former senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), who now heads the conservative Heritage Foundation. Cruz and Lee voted against Wednesday’s agreement, as did GOP presidential hopefuls Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Rand Paul (Ky.).However, Boehner and the Republican-controlled House waged the fiercer battle, passing bill after bill to defund, delay and otherwise undercut the Affordable Care Act, only to watch those bills die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Cruz rejected the idea that Republicans had won nothing during the six-week fight. While the measure contained just one small adjustment to the health-care law — strengthening safeguards against fraud among recipients of federal health insurance subsidies — Cruz said the debate succeeded in calling attention to the harm the law is causing consumers, employers and the U.S. economy.“We saw the House of Representatives take a courageous stand, listening to the American people,” Cruz said. “Had Senate Republicans united and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this, I believe, would have been very, very different.”Still, the price the House paid for waging what many Republicans saw as an unwinnable fight was ultimately devastating. Boehner had counseled against shutting down the government as recently as late August, fearing a backlash among voters that quickly materialized in public opinion polls.Yanked to the right, Boehner tried repeatedly to satisfy Cruz and his allies. He made a last-ditch effort Tuesday to rally his troops around a measure that would have eked out two minor health-care victories: repeal of a tax on medical devices that helps finance the Affordable Care Act and elimination of employer-provided health insurance subsidies for lawmakers, their aides and administration officials. The subsidies, long available to all federal workers, have been derided by conservative commentators as a “special exemption” now that lawmakers are required to get insurance through the new health-care exchanges.It wasn’t enough. Conservative lawmakers demanded more concessions. More moderate Republicans complained that the plan would never pass the Senate. On Tuesday night, with House Republicans bitterly divided and Boehner himself badly weakened, the effort collapsed. By Wednesday, Boehner and McConnell had no choice but to seal a deal with Reid or run the risk of inviting economic calamity.In the House, the vote was eerily similar to the last fiscal showdown with Democrats. During the brief debate, not a single member of the GOP leadership team spoke in favor the bill. That left House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) alone among senior Republicans to publicly champion the bill, just as Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) had been during the “fiscal cliff” vote on New Year’s Day.
It ended with a bizarre moment, when a House stenographer ran to a microphone and began shouting religious messages. She was forcibly removed from the chamber.In the Senate, McConnell, a wily tactician unaccustomed to surrender, tried to salvage some sense of accomplishment. As he and Reid announced the deal at midday Wednesday on the Senate floor, McConnell noted that the measure would maintain current spending levels, “protecting the government spending reductions that both parties agreed to under the Budget Control Act” of 2011.“That’s been a top priority for me and my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle,” McConnell said.But Democrats quickly said they would seek to roll back those cuts before the next round of sequester reductions goes into effect Jan. 15. Meanwhile, many Republicans lamented that the misguided attack on the health-care law had cost the party a shot at forcing Democrats to consider a serious debt-reduction plan.“This package is a joke compared to what we could have gotten if we had a more reasonable approach,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) “For the party, this is a moment of self-evaluation. We are going to assess how we got here. If we continue down this path, we are really going to hurt the Republican Party long term.” Democrats, for their part, quietly recorded a partisan victory. But after a shutdown and debt-limit fight estimated to have sucked as much as $20 billion out of the U.S. economy, there was no celebration.“I’m tired,” Reid said after the Senate voted Wednesday night. “Concluding this crisis is historic. But let’s be honest: This was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. “We cannot — we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.”
