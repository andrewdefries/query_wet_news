DiPaula, former Ehrlich official, campaigns for Md. gay-marriage law
Doug Kapustin/TWP - Chip DiPaula, former Gov. Robert Ehrlich's chief of staff, is one of the highest profile Republicans in the state to add his voice to the pro-gay marriage cause.
By John Wagner, E-mail the writer
A decade ago, Chip DiPaula Jr. was the architect of Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.’s unexpected victory as Maryland’s first Republican governor in a generation.
Today, he is part of something that might seem just as unlikely: a political alliance with the Democratic governor who ended Ehrlich’s tenure. DiPaula has been working alongside Gov. Martin O’Malley since this summer on the campaign to uphold Maryland’s same-sex marriage law.

More news about Md. politics
It is a cause, DiPaula says, that transcends partisan politics — and for him is personal.“The current governor and I don’t agree on a whole lot of other issues, but you know what? That’s beside the point for me,” said DiPaula, who talked openly for the first time in a media interview about being gay. “I’m involved to make our lives better.”DiPaula is not on the cusp of marrying anyone himself but said he greatly respects the institution, and he has officiated at the weddings of a few straight friends and family members. “I would like to be able to experience that joy in my life,” he said.DiPaula, 50, who served as Ehrlich’s budget secretary and chief of staff after running his 2002 campaign, is part of a group of advisers that is plotting strategy for the same-sex marriage referendum on the November ballot. He has been involved in fundraising efforts as well, co-hosting an event last week in the District with O’Malley and Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D).DiPaula’s decision to join an effort dominated by Democrats not only speaks to his pragmatism, friends say. It also underscores a reality of the campaign not often discussed: Winning will require Republican votes.Recent polling has shown proponents of Question 6 with a lead, but one modest enough that support from Democrats alone will probably not carry them across the finish line next month. The campaign entered a new phase this week, with opponents airing the first television ads arguing that “no one is entitled to redefine marriage.” DiPaula and other Republicans onboard in Maryland — including Ken Mehlman, a former Republican National Committee chairman — counter that same-sex marriage is consistent with GOP principles of individual liberty and strengthening families. But that is not the prevailing view among party luminaries, including Ehrlich, who has been outspoken in his opposition.“One redefinition will most assuredly beget additional redefinitions: Why not a civil right to more than one spouse?” Ehrlich, who now pens a column for the Baltimore Sun, wrote in April. “Where does one draw the line once the traditional threshold is crossed?”DiPaula said he considers Ehrlich a friend but was let down by the column, as he was on a couple of occasions during his tenure as governor.“I continue to hope that he can continue to evolve on the issue,” DiPaula said during an interview over lunch in Annapolis, where he works as an executive at a global marketing company. “The denial of that right makes for two tiers of society, and it means that government says we have two classes of people.”Ehrlich denied repeated requests for comment on this story. By 2002, DiPaula, a Towson University graduate and Baltimore native, was making a name for himself in Republican circles nationally. In 2000, he managed the GOP national convention in Philadelphia. After defeating Kathleen Kennedy Townsend in 2002, Ehrlich asked DiPaula, whom he had known for years, to be his budget secretary as the state was facing a gaping fiscal hole. Two years later, DiPaula moved over to chief of staff.In Annapolis, he developed a reputation as someone fiercely loyal to Ehrlich but who was willing to engage in a give-and-take with Democratic legislators at a time when they were adjusting to divided rule. And he was often good-natured about it.DiPaula, a Catholic, came out as gay to his family and friends a few years earlier, while in his mid-30s. His orientation wasn’t exactly a secret in Annapolis — Ehrlich “absolutely” knew, DiPaula said — but it was something he did not talk about publicly. “Part of my discretion was if you’re serving a governor, it’s all about him,” DiPaula said.He said he suspects talking about his sexuality now will not come as news to many people, something that his friends aren’t as sure about.“If I can paraphrase Jerry Seinfeld, I’m over 40, I’ve never been married and I’m neat,” DiPaula said with a shrug. “Go figure.”There were times when DiPaula was disappointed in Ehrlich. In 2005, Ehrlich vetoed a bill that would have granted nearly a dozen rights to gay partners, including medical decision-making authority, if they registered with the state. Ehrlich argued that the registry was a threat to “the sanctity of traditional marriage.” DiPaula said he concluded it was better to work within the system than to abandon it, and Ehrlich did help advance some gay rights issues. The year after vetoing the registry bill, for example, he supported a more limited measure expanding rights, and he had a solid record of appointing gay judges, DiPaula said.Though he cannot legally marry in Maryland himself, DiPaula is an authorized nondenominational Christian minister and has officiated at the weddings of a few family members and friends. In 2010, he officiated at the marriage of two longtime Democratic staffers: Kristin F. Jones, chief of staff to House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel), and Joseph C. Bryce, chief lobbyist for O’Malley.Both developed deep friendships with DiPaula during his days with Ehrlich, and both were central to the effort to pass a gay nuptials bill during this year’s legislative session. DiPaula played a behind-the-scenes role in the legislative debate, lobbying several Republican lawmakers. (One senator and two delegates voted for the bill.)As part of the referendum campaign, DiPaula has helped reach out to Republican funders and national groups and brought a more business-oriented approach to the task, others involved say.“He’s helped open doors we thought were closed,” said Del. Maggie McIntosh (D-Baltimore). “He’s smart. He’s strategic. And he’s fun. He’s added a great perspective.”

For Nationals fans, final week of the season isn’t going to be easy
View Photo Gallery — Magic number shrinks to 4: Jayson Werth’s late hit allows the Nats to exhale with a win in Philadelphia. By Thomas Boswell, E-mail the writer
All summer, as the Nationals have amazed everyone except themselves, my view has been simple: If you aren’t enjoying all of this, without surrounding the experience with nervous parameters about what is enough to make you happy, then you are absolutely and totally out of your mind.
But the last week of this season isn’t going to be so easy.

The Washington Post’s Jason Reid joins the Post Sports Live crew to debate which National League opponent the Nationals’ would least like to see in the playoffs. Nationals Journal
Insight on the Nationals and all the latest news from Post reporters Adam Kilgore and James Wagner.
No real pennant race ever is. The Nats, even though they are four games ahead of Atlanta with seven to play, are in a genuine battle. Everything in late-season baseball works against the pursued and in favor of the pursuer. The chaser is forced, by desperation, to focus on one game, one pitch at a time. That’s the right way to play baseball. The team with the lead is often distracted by praise, magic numbers or hoping the other team will lose; instead of (all together) focusing entirely on the next pitch, play or game.If you watch the Nationals these days between your fingers, if you take walks to get away from the TV, if you invent good-luck charms or incantations — who thought Washington baseball fans would ever need such things — you’re not choking. You’re just living in the real world.If you saw the Nats blast three homers in Philadelphia on Wednesday night for a 5-0 lead, but didn’t lose any days off your life as the Phillies clawed back to 5-4 (and the Braves posted another win), then you have better late-inning medications than most of us.When Jayson Werth, with the Phillies crowd booing, singled home a pair of two-out insurance runs in the ninth, then circled the bases for an 8-4 lead on Bryce Harper’s triple, you could almost hear every Nats fan exhale.For countless people, generations of them actually, this has been a summer with a nothing-can-spoil-it glow. “Happy” works when the Nats go 14-4 to start April and lead the NL East for all but 10 days of the season.But these final days, even with that euphemism “a healthy lead,” even when the Nats have already clinched the first wild-card spot, are likely to put fans through a facsimile of the emotional wringer that the players endure.Why take such a cautious view when statisticians say the Nats entered Wednesday night’s game with a 96.5 percent chance of winning the NL East? Because I’ve been here before, 15 years ago, with an exceptional team managed by Davey Johnson. Those 1997 Orioles won 98 games and dethroned the AL East powerhouse Yankees. But I learned that it’s often in the nature of leads to dwindle, even if they never disappear. Those Birds led by 91
/
2 games with 23 left, by 71
/
2 games with 17 left and by five games with only eight games left. You may notice the parallels with the 2012 Nats, who arrived in Philadelphia this week leading by five games with nine to play.What happened? On the next-to-last day of the season, the Orioles’ lead was down to two games with two to play and they trailed 4-2 in the ninth inning on the road. Three more outs and they’d have a one-game lead over the Yankees with one to play. Much tension? Oh, yeah.The Brewers brought in Doug Jones, one of the best relievers in history (303 saves, 21st all-time). He didn’t save that one. Mike Bordick singled, Brady Anderson doubled and Roberto Alomar homered for the clinch.With one day to spare. And that’s a success story. The Birds won the division series and fell just two wins shy of the World Series. Davey got Manager of the Year. (And the boot.)So you might not throw away any tickets to the Phillies series next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at Nats Park. You might even buy some. And the Nats would do themselves no harm to take a lesson and prepare to battle for as many games as necessary. Superb teams often get pushed to the wire.The reason you build the big lead in the first place is for scenarios like ’97. At the very least, the next week will help prepare the Nats, the second-youngest team in baseball, for what comes next month. If they think a four-game lead with eight to play is stressful, wait until they face their best-case playoff scenario: a five-game division series with the first two on the road.Pressure, in all its forms and at all its levels, right up to “almost unbearable” is a central part of baseball and should be.Every great team starts as a lesser club that had to live and negotiate all those levels of stress so they could build coping mechanisms or find their core club leaders. Who stays calm and focused in the moment? Who rattles? Which players just ravenously enjoy competition? Not so much the winning, though everybody likes that, but the instant of competition itself. It’s a personality type. You never quite know who has it until . . . well . . . right now. The Nats know these things and more. Johnson and vets such as Jayson Werth, Adam LaRoche and Edwin Jackson have talked about late-season baseball. That’s not the problem. Even after you hear the words, even if you “get it,” you still have to live it. And everybody experiences it differently.The Nats have to learn what it feels like to walk in your stadium and see it covered in postseason bunting. You don’t know exactly how you feel about total national TV and media exposure until you experience it. And what about those guys on the other side, the older ones who’ve been through it, maybe many times? Is that really a big edge or just a small one?What’s coming at them — and fast — starting right now with their trip through Philly and St. Louis is part of the Nationals’ inescapable future as one of the game’s most talented teams. The first big installment hits now, not some future year. That’s the price of going from .500 to .600 in one season.The Nationals might win the World Series. But Las Vegas will give you 7 to 1 that, at some point, the Nats are going to be thwarted by a better team or their own inexperience or bad luck or no Strasburg. Or something. Between now and then, a month or so if we’re lucky, a week or so if we’re not, the Nats will provide us with almost unbearably tense entertainment and themselves with an education that they can get in no other way.The Nats have an appointment with anxiety. It can’t be avoided. In fact, it should be embraced. It’s part of the process, usually a fairly long one that forges fine teams into eventual champions.Sometimes, it’s pretty frightening. You may want to cover your eyes. But don’t. The scary parts are the best.
