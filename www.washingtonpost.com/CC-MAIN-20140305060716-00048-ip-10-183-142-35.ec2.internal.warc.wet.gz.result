(Astrid Riecken/ For The Washington Post ) - Rosa Argueta prepares pupusas at La Casita Pupuseria and Market. A pupusa is a traditional Salvadoran dish made of hand-made corn tortilla which is usually filled with a blend of cheese, pork, vegetables or refried beans.
CAPTION
By Tim Carman, E-mail the writer
If any dish can play the part of humble immigrant food, it’s the pupusa, the savory masa cake from El Salvador that practically feeds the nation morning, noon and night. When unadorned and arranged on a platter like intersecting circles, pupusas look naked and vulnerable, imminently susceptible to smear campaigns from the roaming trend-seeking hordes who can’t see the simple beauty of this stuffed round.
The pupusa has many humble cousins throughout Latin America, including the gordita and the arepa, both of which are, likewise, stuffed corn-flour cakes that can feel like a sunken sand barge in your stomach if you eat too many (which is only too easy). But the pupusa is different. It aims for a kind of self-contained perfection, in which the filling is neatly encased in a thin layer of griddled masa dough, unlike either the gordita or arepa, whose meat-and-cheese guts can spill all over the plate, frustrating your efforts at the ideal bite.
Those of us who call the Washington area home are fortunate enough to be able to sample pupusas anytime we want, given that the latest Census figures show that more than 240,000 Salvadorans have settled in the region, many of them refugees from the long and bloody civil war back in the home country. These immigrants brought their food with them, of course, which means pupusas hide in plain sight all over the place. You can find pupusas on custom-built trucks squatting next to gas stations in Silver Spring. You can find them in storefront pupuserias along 14th Street NW (the stretch not gentrified into the land of $14 cocktails, that is). You can even find them buried deep in restaurant menus, lost among a mess of “Mexican” dishes cobbled together by Salvadorans who still think they have to hedge their bets with North American diners.But how much do any of us know about pupusas? Personally, I had been eating them for years, not always grasping the finer details of what makes one superb and another sub-par. The more I looked at the pupusa, in fact, the more questions arose. Why, for example, do most pupuserias serve essentially the same ones, like the pork-bean-cheese combo known as the “revuelta,” as if U.S.-style invention were off limits at these joints? I was also curious to know if the cakes were prepared differently in El Salvador vs. the States. And perhaps most important: Why is the “humble” pupusa so unbelievably difficult to make on your own?Finding answers to my questions wasn’t always easy in a world where English is a second language and where my pidgin Spanish frequently results in long silences over the phone, followed by an abrupt click. Which is why I almost wanted to hug Jaime Arbaiza, general manager of the La Casita location in Silver Spring. With Jaime, I had access not only to the inner workings of a modern pupuseria but also to a man who could articulate (in English for Mr. Gringo here) the minute differences between pupusas in the United States and El Salvador.Or at least I had access to a man who could turn to his mother and La Casita co-owner, Leonor Arbaiza, a Salvadoran native who recently visited the home country. Between them, mother and son tell me that pupusas in El Salvador tend to be about an inch smaller — at least when purchased from one of the many street vendors — and considerably thinner than the versions found here. Jaime chalks up the differences to simple economics. “Over there, they try to save as much as they can,” he says.But in the States, where the calories come cheap and everyone always seems to want more, pupuserias tend to build their cakes bigger and fatter, sometimes to the detriment of the filling, which can be overwhelmed by the corn masa shell. That may sound like harsh criticism, but as Jaime points out, many Salvadorans simply prefer their pupusas that way. It’s almost a value equation.La Casita opts for more balance with its pupusas, which is part of the reason why I like the place so much. Standing over a couple of serving trays dotted with pupusas, Jaime reviews the specimens, like a drill sergeant inspecting the troops. Each pupusa should have a pillowy quality, he notes, but avoid messiness. Ideally, the filling should not ooze from any cracks, although as a pupusa apologist like myself might tell you, there’s nothing at all wrong with those little circles of escaped cheese, melted and browned on the griddle.Mostly, though, La Casita’s kitchen aims for thin, intact masa shells, so that when you order a frijol con queso (bean with cheese) or a queso con loroco (cheese with a Salvadoran flower bud whose flavor somehow smacks of green beans, asparagus and artichokes) you actually taste the filling. “To me, it’s better when you have as much masa as you need, no more than that,” says Jaime, almost Zenlike in his philosophy toward his dough.When I ask Jaime why most pupuserias don’t experiment with their fillings, he practically bristles. La Casita, after all, dares to venture beyond the Fab Four of Fillings (beans, cheese, pork and loroco) to test the boundaries of the Salvadoran-American palate. You can buy a cheeseburger-style pupusa here (filled with ground beef and mozzarella); another stuffed with squash and cheese; and even, on occasion, a kind of locavore corn cake crammed with crab meat, shrimp and cheese. This, I cannot emphasize enough, is not the norm at most pupuserias.“What I think is that Salvadorans, . . . they’re used to eating the traditional ones,” says Juan Rivera, a Salvadoran native and chef de cuisine for Bandolero, Mike Isabella’s forthcoming Mexican restaurant in Georgetown. “They’re going to get the pupusa revuelta. The people are not educated to try new things.”Rivera (who usually goes by the handle “Tony Starr,” a nickname bestowed on him by Isabella) understands tradition. He grew up with one of El Salvador’s most ingrained traditions: eating pupusas for breakfast. When he was a teenager back in his native country, Rivera would stop at a pupuseria at 6 a.m. before loading up his gear and heading out on a fishing boat. Per custom, Rivera would down his savory pupusas with a cup of chocolate caliente, a mixture of hot milk and water thickened with melted chunks of rich Central American chocolate.That experience is hard to re-create in the States with the instant hot chocolate mixes found at many establishments. Besides that, a savory pupusa, no matter how well made, may not be the first thing you want in the morning, which is why I decided to develop a U.S.-style breakfast pupusa stuffed with fresh cheese that’s slightly sweetened with citrus zest and heavy cream. I figured I’d top the finished pupusa with a pat of good butter and some local jam rather than the cake’s usual garnishes of curtido (a kind of pickled, fermented cabbage) and a thin tomato sauce. My mouth watered at the very thought of this North American pupusa.Then I began the process of fashioning my pupusas and quickly realized I had the skill set of a Doberman. Making pupusas may look like child’s play — with all that hand molding of dough — but it’s not. With my cakes, the dough was too thick and the filling too thin; more problematic, my homemade cheese was bursting through the ruptured levee that was my masa. So I sought the counsel of Rosa Argueta, one of the pupusa makers at La Casita.Argueta is a minimalist when it comes to shaping masa into pupusas. She doesn’t favor the theatrical slapping and hand-flipping techniques that I’ve witnessed at other pupuserias, like my favorite, La Chiquita, in Takoma Park. Her movements are more compact; you barely notice the dough moving from the center of one hand to the other as the masa ball is quickly and efficiently formed into a disk. Argueta begins each pupusa with about three ounces of dough, but her secret is that after she adds the filling and reforms the ball, she pinches off a good half-ounce of dough, so that her cakes aren’t overwhelmed by masa.Moisture is also key. Like all the pupusa makers at La Casita, Argueta makes her own dough. She uses the Masa Brosa brand of instant masa, which she combines with warm water and nothing else. No salt, no added flavorings, only pure masa goodness. The dough must have the consistency of Play-Doh, and to make sure it doesn’t dry out and crack during the seemingly endless shaping stage, Argueta keeps her hands moist (not soaking wet) with a nearby bowl of water. Likewise, the filling can’t be too wet or the added moisture will start to weaken the walls of the masa shell. That, clearly, was the problem with my initial attempts.I wish I could report that Argueta’s afternoon demo turned me into an instant pupusa master, but it didn’t. My cakes were still a little too wet, a little too thick and a little too unstable. But I took comfort in Argueta’s answer to a question that I posed on the day of my tutorial: How long did it take for you to learn the craft of pupusa making? “Two months,” she answered. Then she smiled sweetly, as if understanding the painful — but rewarding — road ahead.RECIPE:

Study: Drivers still distracted, despite tech advances keeping their eyes on the road
Video: A new study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety shows that Siri and other voice activated apps pose a risky distraction for drivers. Researchers spent two years measuring the brain activity of drivers. This week Post transportation reporter, Ashley Halsey III took a ride wearing the organization’s brain scanning device.
By Ashley Halsey III, E-mail the writer
Your eyes may be on the road ahead, but if you’re on the phone or using a voice-activated app to send a text message, there’s a disconnect between your eyeballs and your brain.
“Cognitive distraction is something that drivers aren’t aware of, so they may go through a red light or a stop sign and be totally unaware they’ve missed it,” said David L. Strayer, whose research team at the University of Utah conducted a two-year study of driver behavior. “They will tell you ‘I never saw it,’ because their brain was focused elsewhere.”
(Jonathan Newton/ The Washington Post ) - Russ Martin of AAA, wearing a EEG-configured skull cap, prepares to drive a research vehicle Tuesday while unveiling research demonstrating that new in-car technologies being marketed by automakers can cause dangerous distractions for drivers.

The study’s most surprising finding is that technology developed to enhance the safety of text messaging while driving is not very effective.
When compared with other diversions inside the car, “interacting with the speech-to-text system was the most cognitively distracting,” the report said. “This clearly suggests that the adoption of voice-based systems in the vehicle may have unintended consequences that adversely affect traffic safety.”Researchers did a series of controlled studies using driving simulators and on-road tests. For two years, groups of test subjects wore a Medusa-like cap of electrode wires to test how their brains reacted to the rapidly increasing number of distractions that sap the ability of drivers to focus on the road. Each distraction-induced change in brain waves was marked by the computer with a squiggly line on a graph.
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety sponsored the study, which was released Wednesday.The data were generally consistent with other recent research that can be boiled down to a simple conclusion: The more complicated and absorbing a task, the greater the distraction from the road. The longer it takes to complete — a conversation, a message, setting a GPS destination — the worse it gets.
‘Inattention blindness’
The study also underscored a problem called “inattention blindness,” which translates into layman’s terms as “I see it, but it doesn’t register.” It takes longer for distracted drivers to connect what they see to an appropriate reaction such as braking or swerving to safety.“It’s very, very powerful,” said the AAA foundation’s president, Peter Kissinger. “The light can register, but the brain is focused on something else.”Federal data show that distracted driving was a factor in about 10 percent of the fatal accidents nationwide in 2011. In addition to 3,331 deaths — a slight increase from the previous year — 387,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver.The AAA foundation’s study is the latest piece in a body of research that has grown exponentially in the five years since Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood elevated a growing public awareness of distracted driving into a national crusade.Though the findings have not been uniform, the research has established that almost anything that distracts a driver from the task of getting down the road creates a risk.Proving something most reasonable people would agree on echoes the era when researchers sought to verify that smoking caused cancer. It demonstrates with science the danger of something that has become an immensely popular habit.Faced with mounting research-based evidence, some drivers may put aside the array of distracting electronic enticements. But the awareness of risk balanced against that desire to chat or text was summed up in a quip at a congressional hearing last year: Everybody wants to keep talking on their cellphone, they just don’t want anybody else on the road to be allowed to.Drivers have been banned from sending and receiving text messages in 41 states, including Maryland and Virginia, and in the District of Columbia. The District and 11 states — including Maryland but not Virginia — also have prohibited conversations on hand-held cellphones while driving, a restriction that research has shown to be of dubious value.One of the first studies, conducted in 2008 by Carnegie Mellon University, found that having a phone conversation of any sort distracted a driver — a finding that has been confirmed by several other studies.The growing body of knowledge has put auto manufacturers in an awkward spot, torn between a desire to produce safe vehicles while still meeting customers’ demand for Internet access, movie screens, GPS innovations, and voice and text communication in their vehicles.What’s more, as the auto industry seeks to install voice-activated and one-touch applications it views as a marriage of demand and safety, there’s a hitch. While federal regulators can dictate what is installed at the factory, it falls to state legislators to set laws governing hand-held devices.“As a result, government policy will likely chill innovation and bias drivers toward the use of hand-held devices, rather than integrating devices with ­in-vehicle systems,” Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, told a U.S. Senate committee last month. “So if a driver looking for live [mapping] guidance is blocked from doing so while his car is in motion, he may predictably pull out his smartphone, fiddle with the keys while looking down and retrieve the desired mapping guidance.”
The ‘genie’ is out
Strayer said he hoped the strength of the new research would open doors to a joint effort with automakers as new technologies emerge.“Cellphones are so commonly used that it’s hard to put that genie back into the bottle,” Strayer said. “This is an important time to get with the industry and talk about dealing with emerging technology before that gets out of the bottle, too.”The AAA foundation briefed other safety agencies on the findings before Wednesday’s release.“The study is a reminder that distracted driving is a huge challenge,” said Jonathan Adkins of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “States should stay on their current path of banning texting and hand-held cellphones behind the wheel. At the same time, drivers need to be reminded that the safest practice is to not use any type of communications device behind the wheel.”

2012 Stanley Cup playoffs: Capitals-Bruins series predictably gets chippy
View Photo Gallery — 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs: Bruins edge Capitals for 2-1 series lead. By John Feinstein, It was Brooks Laich who pointed out late Monday night that one never knows when a Stanley Cup playoff series will turn chippy — or worse — but that it is almost inevitable. “Sometimes it happens right away in the first game, sometimes it takes two or three games,” he said in the quiet of a losing locker room. “Things start to happen. They’re trying to get you off your game, you’re trying to get them off theirs.”
The Capitals forward smiled briefly. “There’s a lot of verbal jousting going on out there.”

Stanley Cup Playoffs 2012: From an intrastate clash between the Penguins and Flyers to a series between the tradition-rich Red Wings and the emerging Predators, the first-round of the NHL playoffs is loaded with intriguing matchups. More Caps and NHL coverageCaps face offseason uncertainty
Tarik El-Bashir The future of Dale Hunter is one of several tough questions facing the team’s decision makers.
Assessing the Capitals’ season
Katie Carrera For all of the steps forward the Capitals took in reinventing themselves as a gritty, hard-working, defensive-oriented team under Dale Hunter’s guidance as coach, the result didn’t change.
Capitals stopped short in Game 7
Katie Carrera New York scores on its first shot of the night just 1:32 in and never looks back as the Capitals fail to generate enough scoring opportunities and fall one victory shy of their first berth in the conference finals since 1998.
Capitals lose series, gain identity
Thomas Boswell OPINION | Though Game 7 was another heart-wrenching defeat for Washington, the Capitals may have finally found what they’ve been looking for: a team identity.

Stanley Cup Playoffs 2012
PHOTOS | Action from the 2012 NHL playoffs.
The verbal jousting continued well into the night Monday after Zdeno Chara’s slap shot from the right point with 1 minute 53 seconds left in the third period gave the Boston Bruins a 4-3 win over the Washington Capitals and a 2-1 lead in the teams’ best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal.Caps Coach Dale Hunter, who answers questions after losses as if a tow truck is about to put a hook onto his car, insisted the match penalty against Nicklas Backstrom, for cross-checking the Bruins’ Rich Peverly as time ran out should not result in the automatic one-game suspension that usually comes with it. “I think it’ll be rescinded,” Hunter said. “If you seen it, it wasn’t bad.”Hours later, Brendan Shanahan, the NHL’s czar of discipline, ruled differently. Backstrom will miss Thursday’s Game 4.Exactly when a cross-check to the face, even from a player with Backstrom’s reputation for clean play, isn’t that bad is tough to say. Bias aside, Hunter may not be the best judge. As a player, he was famous for making plays that he apparently didn’t think were “that bad,” plays that earned him a reputation in every NHL city but Washington as one of the league’s dirtiest players.Bruins Coach Claude Julien’s view of the cross-check was — surprise — different from Hunter’s. While he said he understood that physical play is “part of playoff hockey,” he expressed concern over the fact that three of his players have been cross-checked in the face in three games.This has the feel of a long series, one that is likely to get chippier as it goes along. That said, if you line up Bruins-Caps next to the mayhem that has broken out in some of the other first-round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs, this is peewee hockey with no hitting allowed. Going into Monday night, 11 game misconducts had been handed out in five nights of play. That compares with six in the entire playoffs a year ago.Most series are like this one, with every goal feeling as if it is almost as important as an overtime winner. There were two of those, one for each team, in the first two games in Boston. There, tight checking and good goaltending produced a total of four goals in two games. Seven periods-plus of hockey and the puck went into the net four times.That changed Monday. Both teams found more open ice. The Bruins finally got some people in front of Braden Holtby’s net to make life a lot more difficult for him. Holtby looked human at times, although the winning goal was one of those hockey flukes: Chara’s shot was redirected by defenseman Roman Hamrlik’s stick past a stunned Holtby.“They got a lucky goal,” Hunter said. “It deflected off one of our guys.”That goal is the difference right now. Luck, as they say, is the residue of design and the Bruins clearly had more “net-front presence,” as Julien called it, on Monday than they had in the first two games. The Caps had to be encouraged by the fact that Alexander Ovechkin scored a goal early in the second period on a pretty play in which he controlled a rolling puck and beat Tim Thomas with a quick shot. Backstrom, clearly back to his pre-concussion self, made the game’s most artistic play, caroming a long pass off the boards to a streaking Laich to set up the goal that tied the game at 3 with six minutes left. Still, Monday night’s game was played more in the style the Bruins prefer than one the Caps are comfortable with. There were several post-whistle “rugby scrums,” as Hunter called them, that led to penalties, most notably the one at the end of the game that put Backstrom’s immediate future in doubt.“When you see the same guys every night it gets more intense,” Capitals defenseman John Carlson said. “It’s not like the regular season where you don’t see them for a while and you forget what’s happened the last time you played them. When you see what’s happening around the league, what happened in this game is easy to understand. Things get more tense more quickly. ”There will be plenty of tension in Verizon Center on Thursday night. The Caps need to stay away from silly penalties like the one Backstrom took at game’s end. It doesn’t matter if Peverly got his stick between Ovechkin’s legs — the game had been decided. Skate away in order to skate another day.Shanahan has been unpredictable with his discipline since the start of the playoffs. He somehow let Nashville’s Shea Weber off with only a fine after a vicious hit on Detroit’s Henrik Zetterberg. The cries of dismay seem to have echoed in New York. Perhaps that did not bode well for Backstrom.What the first three games of this series have clearly shown is that the Caps can play with the Bruins. Washington General Manager George McPhee pointed out before the playoffs began how thin the margin in the NHL is between a No. 1 seed and a No. 8 seed. One No. 1 seed, Vancouver, is on the verge of being swept.The No. 2 seed in the East — the defending Cup champions — lead 2-1. They know, as do their opponents, that this series is probably a long way from being over. For John Feinstein’s previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/feinstein.
