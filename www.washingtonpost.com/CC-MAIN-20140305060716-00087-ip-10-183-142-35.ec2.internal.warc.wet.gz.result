Reflections on D.C. love stories: “I always hear that D.C. isn’t a great place for dating”
By Katie Rogers
With only one question in mind — “Where did you find a uniquely Washington romance?” — video journalist AJ Chavar set out on a journey across the District to find love. (Or, at least, tales of it.)
“I always hear that D.C. isn’t a great place for dating, or a very romantic city, and part of me wanted to kind of prove that wrong,” Chavar said about his project “We met in D.C.” Was he successful? Watch the video above, and then read the Q&A with him after the jump: Q: You interviewed a bunch of different couples for “We met in D.C.” But was there any common theme among them? A: If I had to pick a common theme, it would be their professions. Pretty much every couple I talked to met because they worked in the same or complimentary field to their significant other. There were a few exceptions, but I was very surprised that, at least among the people I interviewed, it was the norm.
Did anything about these “D.C.” stories surprise you? I was really expecting to have to push and pry to get stories that had a D.C. vibe or a D.C. “hook” to them. In fact, most of the people said they didn’t have any good “D.C. love stories” at the beginning of the interview, but once they started talking it was pretty evident that EVERYONE did have these great stories; they just didn’t realize it.
You could’ve chosen any topic to frame Valentine’s Day. Why was D.C. the inspiration and backdrop for your video?
Well, for one, I’ve been trying to think of ways to do more local video and this seemed like a fun idea for a feature. I always hear that D.C. isn’t a great place for dating, or a very romantic city, and part of me wanted to kind of prove that wrong, and highlight these little vignettes that show that it can be. (Washingtonpost.com)
Confess: Which couple was most unique and why? Man, that’s hard! I tried to get a very diverse set of couples for the project and everyone had great stories — you wouldn’t believe all of the lovely anecdotes that got left on the cutting-room floor. My favorite couple was probably Adam and Eliza Robinson (the teachers). They had a great chemistry together in front of the camera and they were so witty and funny. My favorite unique stories, though — that’s a tie. Devin and Chris being a same-sex couple, and one of the first to get a marriage license in the District, I loved that story, and to see how happy they were to have their union honored really made me proud to live in D.C. The other, though, was how Sharif and Rudy called themselves a “diaspora couple.” I thought that was kind of beautiful, that they came from such disparate backgrounds and connected in D.C. Its also a very D.C. thing for two transplants to meet each other. This didn’t make it into the video, but after they were dating for some time they found out via Google Maps that their parents actually lived across the street from each other in Egypt — in another time, they said, Rudy could have been the “girl next door.”
Did any couple leave gems of advice for dating in Washington? Do any tips in particular stand out?
Ha! Well, most of the men said the dating scene in the city was biased in favor of women, and the women said it was biased in favor of men, but oddly both sexes said this was because there were more women than men in the city. One specific piece of advice was to take any potential partner at their word, and trust them when you are first meeting. Others weren’t so hopeful. One woman said that dating in the District has a “three-month window” and that if your relationship outlasted that window you were golden, but more likely, she said, you’d end it before then.

‘I Wear the Black Hat: Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined)’ by Chuck Klosterman
By Justin Moyer and — Justin Moyer, Philosophy
I WEAR THE BLACK HAT:
Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined)
By Chuck KlostermanScribner. 214 pp. $25
Before he scored his high-profile gig as the New York Times Magazine’s ethicist, culture critic Chuck Klosterman wrote disarming nonfiction on unexpected topics, including Britney Spears, pro sports and how heavy metal shaped his childhood in Fargo, N.D. His latest book of incisive, funny essays is aimed at a predictably unpredictable target: villains.
In “I Wear the Black Hat,” Klosterman writes of Machiavelli’s signature work that “ ‘The Prince’ can be read like a self-help book for someone who openly aspires to be depraved.”For Klosterman, it’s not Machiavelli’s cynical advice that’s repellent — it’s that he sounds so “cold.” As Klosterman puts it, “In any situation, the villain is the person who knows the most but cares the least.” (Simon & Schuster) - ‘I Wear The Black Hat: Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined)’ by Chuck Klosterman GoingOut

Free admission Get ideas Armed with this definition, he turns to a long list of widely disliked people and fictional characters: among many others, O.J. Simpson, Sarah Palin, Darth Vader and, most memorably, Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. In the twisted saga of sex abuse at Penn State, Klosterman writes, pedophile Jerry Sandusky was the monster, but Paterno, who failed to stop Sandusky’s depredations, was something worse — the man who “had to choose between humanity and sport, and picked the one that mattered less.” “No normal person wants to hate a dead man he once admired,” Klosterman adds about Paterno. “It feels abnormal and cheap. But what’s the alternative?” Klosterman attacks his subjects with intellectual rigor and humor, qualities rarely conjoined since David Foster Wallace hanged himself. Few readers will get everything here — I loved Klosterman’s hilarious comparison of the gangsta rap group N.W.A. and the Oakland Raiders, but couldn’t quite follow his detailed dissection of the team’s running game. Whether you understand all of it or just some of it, though, you should read this thought-provoking book.

Rick Perry, Ron Paul have mixed record on energy subsidies
View Photo Gallery — Solyndra, a California solar company backed by a half-billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Obama administration, announced it was shutting its doors and laying off 1,100 employees. By Paul Kane, E-mail the writer
Two Republican presidential candidates who have spoken out against federal subsidies for energy projects tried to obtain such benefits three years ago.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) pressed the energy secretary in 2008 to approve a federal loan guarantee to help an energy company hoping to expand a nuclear facility in Texas. NRG Energy was among the many firms vying for a slice of $18.5 billion in federal loan guarantees set aside for nuclear production, according to letters obtained by The Washington Post. That led to a rush of appeals from Congress members and other elected officials, including Perry and Paul, hoping to win support for their projects. Gallery

In recent candidates debates, the two have criticized federal energy loan programs. “We don’t need to be subsidizing energy in any form or fashion,” Perry said during a forum on Tuesday night. Earlier this month, he said the federal government should not “be involved in that type of investment, period. If states want to choose to do that, I think that’s fine for states to do.”Paul also urged rugged independence for the energy sector: “The government shouldn’t be in the business of subsidizing any form of energy,” he said during Tuesday’s debate.The issue has taken on political urgency because of how the Obama administration handled a loan to Solyndra, a now-shuttered solar company that won $535 million in loans from the Federal Financing Bank guaranteed through the Energy Department. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in early September, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay the debt.Perry and Paul say now that their earlier advocacy for a specific Texas project does not contradict their fundamental beliefs. The Texas project ultimately was turned down for a loan.Republicans have a history of supporting loan guarantee programs in the Energy Department. The programs were created in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration and were expanded in 2007 and again in President Obama's 2009 stimulus plan. A Washington Post review of Energy Department documents provided by Democratic officials shows that dozens of Republican lawmakers have requested loan guarantees for local projects, including House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.).On Wednesday, Perry spokesman Mark Miner said he thinks loan guarantees are not the same as “subsidizing” corporations, because a well-managed company will not default and leave taxpayers liable for repayment. The governor said energy promotion will be a hallmark of his jobs creation plan during the presidential campaign. Through a spokesman, Paul defended his support for the local nuclear project as an effort to spend already-approved funding. He, along with 30 other Republicans, opposed the creation of the federal account in 2005. He also opposed the 2009 stimulus plan. “As a Congressman and as President, Dr. Paul will work to eliminate all federal intervention in the energy market. However, until that happens, he will do his best to ensure that the money Congress appropriates is spent in the best way possible,” Jesse Benton, his aide, said in a statementPerry wrote to Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman on July 29, 2008, asking him to take “this endorsement into consideration as you consider NRG Texas’ loan guarantee application.”“I am writing to express my strong support for the proposed nuclear power generating facility in Matagorda County,” Perry wrote.Paul wrote to Bodman the next day, saying: “I am writing in support of the loan guarantee application filed by NRG Energy, Inc. for two new nuclear reactors at the South Texas Project.” He later added: “Additionally, the construction and operation of STP 3 and 4 will lead to the creation of thousands of new jobs.”The NRG plant had been among 15 finalists for part of the nuclear loan guarantees, but the project ran into internal financing disputes. The Energy Department decided to grant its first round of loan guarantees to a nuclear plant in Georgia.Last spring, after the Japanese tsunami and the ensuing nuclear crisis chilled the appetite for nuclear investment, NRG Energy abandoned its five-year pursuit of a plant expansion. Last month, in reaction to the Solyndra bankruptcy filing, Paul said that loan guarantees “worked for a short time for Solyndra” but that they covered up the real market problems. “Real venture capitalists make decisions based not on politics and photo opportunities, but on complex economic estimations of risk and reward. They don’t simply throw piles of other people’s money at a factory and expect magic to happen,” he said. Instead of federal loan support or subsidies, Perry cites Texas’s “enterprise fund” for emerging energy companies as a model. He said it has created nearly 55,000 jobs in the state for the energy industry. On Tuesday, Perry said the issue of federal-state involvement in the energy sector needs to be addressed in a national discussion.“We need to have a discussion in this country about our 10th Amendment and the appropriateness of it, as it’s been eroded by Washington, D.C., for all these many years, whether it’s health care, whether it’s education, or whether it’s dealing with energy. We don’t need to be subsidizing energy in any form or fashion, allow the states to make the decision,” he said.
