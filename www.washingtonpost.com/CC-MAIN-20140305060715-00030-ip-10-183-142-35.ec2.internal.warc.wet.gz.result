Lindsay Lohan to reject plea? And Christina Aguilera lets the tweets begin.
By Jen Chaney
The death of Elizabeth Taylor
is obviously the most significant entertainment headline of the day. But it’s not the only one.
TMZ reports that Lindsay Lohan is leaning toward rejecting a plea agreement and attempting to go to trial in the theft-of-a-necklace case. Meanwhile, Us and other outlets report that dad Michael Lohan has been charged with inflicting injury on a cohabitant, stemming from an incident this week.(TMZ) (Us)
Christina Aguilera has finally begun posting to her Twitter account. So far she has noted that she never thought she’d use the word hashtag and shared a photo of Aguilera-themed Russian nesting dolls.
My fans are amazing. Look at what someone made for me in Russia. So creative & artistic. Genius, love it! http://twitpic.com/4cgg7iless than a minute ago via TweetDeckChristina AguileraTheRealXtina Radiohead expresses its gratitude to an unexpected star, and a “Boardwalk Empire” actress reportedly gets arrested, after the jump.
Radiohead thanks Drew Barrymore on the sleeve of its new album, prompting the question: Does Thom Yorke have a thing for “Never Been Kissed”? (NME)
The next season premiere of “Mad Men” will probably be delayed because of ongoing contract negotiations between creator Matthew Weiner and AMC and Lionsgate. Translation: If you plan to spend the month of August drinking too much and acting like male/female gender roles are still stuck in the ’60s, you’ll need to blame that on someone besides Don Draper. (Entertainment Weekly)
Supposedly there is no chance that Charlie Sheen will return to “Two and a Half Men.” (Digital Spy)
Meanwhile, Sheen’s attempt to halt arbitration in his dispute with Warner Bros. and “Men” creator Chuck Lorre
has failed, according to the Los Angeles Times and other outlets. And on the rumor mill front, the New York Daily News reports that Sheen might have another goddess in his life.
“Boardwalk Empire” star Paz de la Huerta was arrested Sunday after an alleged assault on Samantha Swetra, who appeared on the reality show “The City.” (Popeater)

They came here to dance to big sounds, deep into the tiny hours.
So they peel off their bulky winter jackets at the coat check like 2,000 Clark Kents and stride onto the dance floor, faces fixed with sequins, ears pierced with golf tees, garments aglow with chemiluminescent piping.

Free admission Get ideas It’s the second-to-last Saturday night of 2012 at Echostage, a massive new club on Queens Chapel Road NE, just north of New York Ave. In three short months, the venue has already hosted some of the biggest names in electronic dance music — EDM, it’s called — and tonight, the big name is Porter Robinson, a 20-year-old DJ from North Carolina whose dazzling rise mirrors the genre’s global success.Locally, the opening of Echostage feels like physical evidence of EDM’s good health. Nationally, that vitality can be measured in investments by concert promotion colossus Live Nation Entertainment and radio behemoth Clear Channel Communications, as well as hordes of other entrepreneurs lining up to cash in.And while skeptics wonder whether the sudden arrival of monied patrons signals a craze bound to fizzle, it’s the genre’s ecosystem of artists, promoters and fans that they should be watching. For any type of live music to thrive, you need artists to push envelopes, promoters to give them a solid platform and fans to stay engaged. Echostage faithful seem to be experiencing just that, pledging their loyalty to the venue, the acts and especially to each other.“The stage is sick, the lights are amazing and the crowd — they bring good people here,” says Bree Payne, 23, wearing a fuzzy hood fashioned to look like Cheshire Cat pelt. It’s Payne’s third visit to Echostage, and she prefers it to other area venues. “There’s EDM in clubs, but you’re packed into a tiny place. But here, you feel like you’re at a festival, and people come with that festival mentality. Everyone has costumes and glowsticks, and everyone’s ready to party.”Before she can say much more, a friend wraps her in a hug and drags her off into the sparkly masses.
Striving for a ‘full experience’
It’s been a busy December for Echostage. Tiesto, the Dutch trance DJ who made Forbes’s Celebrity 100 list this year, played two consecutive sold-out nights. The club booked Steve Angello of the Swedish House Mafia for Dec. 28. Flux Pavilion and Doctor P are scheduled to co-headline New Year’s Day. And after that, Echostage will go dark until March for renovations. “We really want it to be a full experience on an international tier of quality,” says Echostage general manager Matt Cronin, who was brought in by the club’s parent company, Panorama Productions, in August. Before Echostage, Panorama was best known for its regular Glow parties, which brought world class DJs to packed Washington nightclubs. They’ve also hosted their share of full-blown raves at the D.C. Armory and have collaborated with Live Nation at the annual Identity Festival at Jiffy Lube Live.Management is reticent to describe Echostage’s forthcoming upgrade in detail, but expect big things. This fall, after leasing the venue formerly known as D.C. Star, Panorama transformed the boomy, inhospitable nightclub into something bright and inviting. And in order not to miss out on a busy fall touring season, they did it in a hurry. Now, with the circuit slowing down for winter, they’ll have time to make serious tweaks.Echostages’s capacity stands at 2,000 and that number is likely to rise after renovations, filling the gap between the area’s larger, 1,000-ish capacity nightclubs and Fairfax’s Patriot Center, which can hold 10,000. And Cronin stresses that Echostage won’t host just EDM.“Rock shows, Latin shows, country shows . . . all genres of music are welcome here,” he says. “But we love EDM and we support it. . . And being able to fill a place like this on a regular basis shows that EDM is huge right now.”Edward McMorrow’s attendance speaks to that. The 29-year-old has driven down from Connecticut because he likes Robinson and heard great things about Echostage. “It’s not like the pretentious bar scene with people grinding on each other,” McMorrow says. “It’s about dancing and embracing color and life. . . . It’s Haight-Ashbury for 2012, man.”Appropriately, others in the crowd wear T-shirts that recycle flower power sentiments in Day-Glo fonts: “MAKE LOVE NOT WAR” and “DROP BEATS NOT BOMBS.” Women sport daisies in their hair (fake) and tattoos on their necks (real).Jhoselinne Viscarra and Allisson Amaya, both 18, stroll into the club looking starry eyed, figuratively and literally. With constellations of sequins applied around their eye-shadow, they appear to have discovered Shangri-La off Bladensburg Road. “Raving is supposed to be in a warehouse like this,” Amaya says. “This is amazing. Look at all these people!”
‘Making the music I enjoy’
Robinson is backstage trying to keep out of sight before showtime. He drove long hours to get to Echostage, too — from Chapel Hill, N.C., where he lives with his parents and would likely be a sophomore in college had he not started producing breakout electro-house tracks during his senior year of high school.After nearly two years of nonstop touring, the producer-DJ says his desire to hunker down on new material caused him to cancel four months of tour dates. Except for this one. Glow hosted one of Robinson’s favorite performances at Fur nightclub on Patterson St. NE in February.“Maybe my best show ever,” Robinson says of that gig. “I was able to play cool, weird stuff and people were still down and interested.”He’s as sincere as his fans, which makes recent talk about EDM plateauing in 2012 feel hollow. But Robinson tries not to concern himself with that.“I’m not interested in moving EDM forward,” he says. “I’m mostly interested in advancing my own music and trying to make the best songs that I can make. . . . If EDM goes down, I’m going to keep making the music I enjoy, regardless. I want to convince myself that I can outlast a crash.”That kind of music-first attitude is exactly what an untested genre needs from its young leaders, anyway. Robinson wants more from his music, more from his peers, more from his audience. Whenever he plays his signature track, “Language,” he’s hoping for a deeper response.“I’ll see people cry in the audience to that song,” he says. “And that’s so much more interesting to me than making someone just jump up and down.”
Sensory overload
It’s hard to find any tears spilling when Robinson finally cues up “Language” from the stage. Instead, a young woman in cheetah-print jeggings sings along with the lyrics — “I need room to breathe” — before immediately disregarding them and smothering her dude in a lip lock. Robinson’s music triggers all kinds of physical responses. He’s a moderate maximalist, grafting an arsenal of explosive, ocean-floor bass timbres to a taut, four-on-the-floor grid. Echostage does its part to amplify the sensory overload. With beams of violet light blasting out on the crowd, animated smoke plumes glow on an LED billboard behind the DJ booth while actual smoke plumes come pfff-ing from machines on stage.During “The Seconds,” a song that whiplashes between icy ambience and avalanches of synthesizers, Robinson shadowboxes with the beat, grabbing at melodies in the air in front of him. Fans respond with their own gestures, throwing their arms toward the ceiling as if trying to catch his sounds, or maybe announcing their surrender to them. In an hour or two, when the speakers go quiet and the lights go dim, they’ll all be throwing their arms back into their coat sleeves and heading off into the December chill. But not yet.

Heroes in the war against dummy math
By Jay Mathews, E-mail the writer
As a 13-year-old African American in 1954, Vinetta Jones knew the exasperating letdown of people thinking she was not capable of doing whatever it was she wanted to do. Yet it was still a shock when she, an accomplished math student, walked into her all-white Detroit junior high class on the first day of Algebra I and the teacher asked what she was doing there.
“This is my class,” Jones said. The teacher said: “There must be a mistake. You wouldn’t be able to keep up.”

SAT revisions follow years of gains for ACT test
Nick Anderson The SAT college admissions test will face a challenge in attracting students who are choosing the rival exam.
Prince William may add three days to school year Michael Alison Chandler What do you think? What’s the best — or least bad — way to make up for lost time? Read more
Forced to take Jones, the teacher never called on her even though she got an A on every test. Jones would earn a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of California at Berkeley, become an education school dean and run statewide reform programs in California and North Carolina. With $32 million from College Board benefactors in the 1990s, she led a program that broke the back of U.S. schools’ resistance to letting minorities, poor kids and other allegedly ill-prepared students take algebra and geometry. Jones, a Howard University professor and a former dean of its education school, lives in Prince George’s County. With support and guidance from Montgomery County resident Sol H. Pelavin, until recently president of the Washington-based American Institutes for Research, she and thousands of educators proved that remedial math was largely a waste the way it was taught, that good teaching of algebra and geometry was better. Their Equity 2000 program is the subject of my short new book, “The War Against Dummy Math: How Seven School Districts Changed U.S. Education by Embracing Algebra for All.”
Equity 2000 has not gotten much attention. I was unaware of it until Pelavin asked me if I wanted to write the book. But what Jones and Pelavin accomplished, with the backing of then-College Board President Donald M. Stewart, educates those who want to improve schools. It shows the power of research backed by an independent organization willing to help schools use it. Equity 2000 began with a 56-page paper in 1990 by Pelavin and his colleague Michael Kane, “Changing the Odds: Factors Increasing Access to College.” Their study revealed a correlation between high school course selection and college attendance for black and Hispanic students. More than 80 percent of those who took algebra and geometry in high school attended college, eliminating the usual gap between them and whites. Stewart and the College Board persuaded seven high-poverty, high-minority districts — Prince George’s; Providence, R.I.; Milwaukee; Fort Worth; Nashville; and the adjoining San Jose and East Side high school districts in California — to require that all ninth-graders take first-year algebra and all 10th-graders take geometry. In return, the College Board paid to train teachers and have districts share their experiences. Jones became the executive director of Equity 2000 in 1991. She had made a career of casting doubt on the theory of her Berkeley professor Arthur Jensen that blacks on average were genetically inferior to whites in intelligence. Jensen had told his students that he was not demeaning anyone in class, but Jones said to herself: “Right. Just your mama and your daddy and all your folks.”Equity 2000 made a difference. The portion of ninth-graders taking algebra or above in the seven districts jumped from 50 to 87 percent in six years. Tenth- graders taking geometry or above went from 39 to 67 percent. More ninth-graders (22,579) passed Algebra I in 1997 than were enrolled in the course in 1991 (18,934). More 10th-graders (16,459) passed geometry in 1997 than took it in 1991 (12,524). Few students now take dummy math, but raising math proficiency is still a struggle, as I will explain next Monday with the story of Equity 2000 in Prince George’s.

Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Panetta visits Kuwait to highlight partnership
Susan Walsh/AP - U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, center left, talks with Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheik Ahmad Al-Khaled Al Sabah, center right, after Panetta arrived at Kuwait International Airport in Kuwait City on Dec. 11, 2012. By Ernesto Londoño, E-mail the writer
KUWAIT CITY — Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta arrived in Kuwait Tuesday afternoon for his first official visit to the small Persian Gulf nation, a key Middle Eastern hub for American forces that has gained strategic importance since the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.
Panetta said he wanted to highlight Washington’s partnership with Kuwait, whose location allows the United States to maintain a robust military presence — 13,500 troops — close to Iran.

Max Fisher I’ve searched wide and far for maps that can reveal and surprise and inform in ways that the daily headlines might not.
“Our presence in Kuwait and throughout the gulf helps advance the capabilities of partnering nations, deters aggression and helps ensure we’re better able to respond to crisis in the region,” Panetta told reporters during the flight from Washington. U.S. military bases in Kuwait and Qatar, another gulf nation, became even more valuable after the Obama administration failed to negotiate a deal that would have allowed a continued U.S. military presence in Iraq after December 2011. The U.S. bases in the two countries are pillars of Washington’s deterrence policy toward Iran. Although the Obama administration has been shifting defense resources and personnel toward Asia in recent months, Panetta said the United States is “maintaining a very strong and flexible presence” in the Middle East. He said there are close to 50,000 U.S. service members currently stationed in the area. The top regional concern at the moment is Syria’s raging civil war. After reports early this month that Syria was moving its chemical weapons stockpiles, Panetta said U.S. officials have not seen additional evidence in recent days to suggest that embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is planning to use chemical weapons to blunt rebel advances. “The intelligence has leveled off,” Panetta said. “We haven’t seen anything new indicating any aggressive steps to move forward in that way.” He reiterated that there would be “serious consequences” if the Assad regime were to use such weapons.One of the primary purposes of Panetta’s trip, among the last he will make as defense secretary before retiring in the coming weeks, is to thank deployed U.S. soldiers for their service during the holiday season. “It’s a tough time of year to be away from loved ones,” Panetta said. “Since 9/11, so many have spent so many holidays away from home.”
