Romney’s fiscal policies as governor (Fact Checker biography)
Posted by Josh Hicks
at 06:00 AM ET, 10/31/2011
TheWashingtonPost
(AP)
***
EDITOR’S NOTE: This column will be the first in a series of five columns this week examining how factual former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has been in describing his past achievements. Reporter Josh Hicks has spent weeks examining Romney’s statements and deciding which ones best represent how Romney talks about his past. After this week, he will turn to the other candidates. We welcome suggestions from readers for statements to vet. — Glenn Kessler ***
“We were able to balance our budget all four years without raising taxes. We were able to cut back on government spending and government employment, and so we were able to balance that budget and ultimately build a rainy-day fund much larger than when I took office.”
— Mitt Romney’s remarks during a July 5, 2011, campaign event in Iowa
Romney repeats these lines often on the campaign trail, and it’s easy to see why. He needs to convince the Republican base of his fiscal-conservative credentials. These remarks obviously suggest that Romney reduced spending and balanced the budget without raising taxes. We researched his record in Massachusetts to find out how well his policies match his claims. The Facts
Romney increased the Massachusetts rainy-day fund from $640 million to $2 billion, so he did indeed build a larger reserve for the state. The former governor also balanced the state’s budget each year of his term, but he did so in ways that won’t sit well with tea party advocates who say they’re “Taxed Enough Already.” True to his literal words, Romney didn’t increase taxes, but he admits to raising fees by at least $240 million during his term. Here’s what he had to say about the issue during a 2008 debate in Simi Valley, Calif.: “We audited our fee increase because, of course, we cared. Now, why did we raise fees $240 million? We had a $3 billion budget shortfall. We decided we were not going to raise taxes. And we found that some fees hadn’t been raised in as many as 20 years.” Some conservatives might argue there’s little difference between taxes and fees, since they both dip into taxpayers’ pockets to feed government coffers. Romney gets away with this one on a technicality, but the staunchest conservatives may not differentiate as much as he does between fee hikes and tax increases. (As an example, see this Club for Growth analysis on Romney’s “mixed record” on taxes.) (UPDATE: The Tax Foundation describes fees as targeted charges or payments for specific services, noting that “any assessment that raises money in excess of what is needed to defray costs is a tax.”According to this standard, Romney definitely raised fees that were actually taxes. The New Republic pointed out in a March 2012 article that Romney quintupled the rate of a fee on wholesale fuel deliveries -- despite his Republican predecessor’s recommendation to only double it --and consolidated the dedicated account into the state’s general fund to help close a $3 billion budget gap.)That’s not the only problem with Romney’s tax remarks. The $240 million figure he mentioned represents only one year of his term. FactCheck.org noted during his first presidential run that the former governor raised fees by that much in 2004 alone, not throughout his term. In addition to the first $240 million, Romney also approved $43 million in new assessments to financial institutions and auto-insurance companies between the 2006 and 2007 budgets. Romney also raised new revenue with more than just fee hikes. He closed 22 tax loopholes worth between $850 million and $1.2 billion, according to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent watchdog group. A recent New York Times article reported that the loophole closures generated $370 million per year by his last year as governor. (UPDATE: An earlier version of this column mischaracterized the Times report.) Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul contends that loophole closures are not tax increases.“The ‘loopholes’ he closed ensured that businesses and other entities in the Commonwealth did not evade the spirit of the law,” she said. “Companies sometimes use aggressive accounting techniques to lower their tax liability in ways that were never intended by the law. When that happened, the state closed the loophole. That’s called tax enforcement. This effort was one of the actions taken by Governor Romney that led to a credit rating upgrade for Massachusetts.”The Times report says Romney also asked for his state to be exempt from the 2004 jobs bill requiring states to lower their corporate tax rates. Overall, the combined state and local tax burden in Massachusetts rose from 9.6 percent of total income to 9.9 percent during Romney’s term. The high mark during Romney’s era was 10.3 percent of income in 2005, and the state ranked 17th-highest in the nation by the time he left office.Romney doesn’t deserve all the blame for raising the tax burden, since he didn’t have direct control over local taxes. But he can’t claim innocence, either. The Times article notes that he signed legislation encouraging municipalities to lower residential property tax rates while raising them for commercial properties. It’s not as if he didn’t influence local taxes at all.As for Romney’s claims that he “cut back on government spending,” he’s right. We looked at the state’s total expenditures for 2002 through 2007 and found that they fell by at least $350 million with inflation-adjusted numbers. That’s despite a sizable 10 percent increase during his final year, when the economy was humming. The Pinocchio Test
Romney paints only a partial picture of his Massachusetts fiscal policies when he says he didn’t raise taxes. He fails to mention that he created hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new fees and closed as much as $1.5 billion worth of corporate tax loopholes.The former governor may have a point that his fee hikes and loophole closures were both fair and long overdue, but he should be more upfront about the fact that he boosted the treasury by digging deeper into taxpayers’ pockets. Instead, he talks selectively about the methods he used, talking only in terms that cuts-only conservatives like to hear. The tax comment alone might warrant two Pinocchios, but Romney told the straight truth about the remaining issues: balancing the budget, increasing reserves and reducing government spending. Overall, he earns one Pinocchio.One Pinocchio

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Threat of Capital Beltway shutdown is a hoax, trucker says
Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post - A jumble of roads and signs are seen on the Capital Beltway near Tysons Corner. By Lori Aratani, E-mail the writer
It can be hard to get attention for your agenda in a town like Washington, but Georgia trucker Earl Conlon figured out a way: take the Beltway hostage.
Conlon’s comments in a U.S. News & World Report story that he and thousands of truckers from across the country (and possibly Canada) planned to come to the nation’s capital Friday and bring traffic to a standstill on the inner loop of the Capital Beltway zinged across the Web and were picked up by outlets ranging from Fox News to the Huffington Post.

Beltway shutdown was a stunt, trucker says. Lori Aratani Earl Conlon says a threat by thousands of truckers to tie up traffic on the Beltway was part of a stunt to draw attention to Washington's dysfunctional politicians.

But it is a hoax.“The comments to U.S. News were designed to do one thing and one thing only: stir the feather of the mainstream media,” said Conlon, a father of three. “Nothing gets the attention of the mainstream media like some sort of disastrous threat. I knew it was going to ruffle some feathers.” So while thousands of truckers may indeed come to Washington on Friday and many of them may travel along the inner loop of the Beltway, honking their horns, they won’t intentionally shut down traffic, he said.“First of all, we know it would not be right to go to D.C. to lock down the city by the Belt loop,” said Conlon, 50, a veteran truck driver who has suffered through more than his share of traffic jams. “That wouldn’t be fair to the people there.”And Conlon is not sure that he will even make it to town Friday. Still, he thinks that he has already scored a small victory: attention for his cause — mainly what he sees as the overreach of government and the inability for politicians to follow the rules as outlined in the Constitution. Take the government shutdown.
“We would not be having this conversation if government was balancing this budget,” he said. His solution: Take lawmakers’ perks away, and pay them minimum wage until the budget gets balanced.
“Then, I think you’d see some action,’’ he said. Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report.

Three top-ranking volunteer officers in Coles fire department resign
By Jeremy Borden, E-mail the writer
The three top-ranking volunteer officers at a Prince William County fire station resigned suddenly Tuesday night, notifying top officials but saying little about their reasons.
Fire Chief Adam Eldert and assistant chiefs Jimmy Pearce and Jeff Osborn volunteered for the Coles District Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department on Dumfries Road. Eldert sent an e-mail Tuesday night to fire personnel and county officials, saying that the three were resigning, effective that night. More news about Virginia

He said Deputy Chief David Wood would take over his duties.Pearce, who was in his 14th year as a volunteer and fourth year in Prince William, said in an interview that when the three took their leadership positions in January, they looked to tackle issues within the Coles department. He would not specify what issues led to his and the other chiefs’ resignations, but said that they had consistently butted heads with other factions over decisions big and small.“There were strategic decisions, long term plans, that was part of it” that lead to dissension, he said. “It was a constant barrage of random things. At the end of the day, it boiled down to not being able to see eye to eye.”Eldert, who did not return phone calls requesting comment, said in a statement e-mailed to county spokesman Jason Grant that he enjoyed his 11 years with the fire station. “Recently, disagreements and irreconcilable differences within the CDVFD on how best to advance the organization made me realize that it was time for me to step down and take the opportunity to spend more quality time with my family,” he said in the statement.Osborn could not be reached immediately on Wednesday. County Fire chief Kevin McGee said he was surprised by the resignations and unaware of issues within the fire company, as well as what might have led to the resignations. “They have a good long history in the fire and rescue system and I have a great deal of respect for each one of them and a great deal of confidence,” McGee said of the three former volunteer officers. “I’m disappointed they’re leaving the system. They contributed a lot and I enjoyed working with them.”McGee said he has appointed a fact-finding commission, led by volunteer Fire Chief Kevin Wilson of the Stonewall Jackson Volunteer Fire Department, to explore issues within the department and make recommendations on how to improve and maintain good service. The committee will report to the county’s Fire and Rescue Association, an umbrella group made up of both career and volunteer fire chiefs.The Coles station is staffed by both career and volunteer firefighters, with volunteers working primarily at nights and on weekends. With the loss of the three commanders, the number of volunteers at the station drops from 21 to 18, McGee said. That’s two fewer than the threshold of 20 to officially incorporate a volunteer fire company.But McGee said that, nonetheless, volunteers will continue to staff the station and resources can be shifted from neighboring units to take up the slack. McGee said that residents can be assured that the station will be staffed 24/7, although perhaps not at full capacity. McGee said he doesn’t think that service will be affected. “But it’s certainly prudent on our part to evaluate that as part of our fact finding,” he said. Other officials said they do not expect a drop off in fire or rescue service for the area.The Coles station covers a large swath of rural Prince William and often responds to larger emergencies countywide.
