Nouri al-Maliki: The U.S. has a foreign-policy partner in Iraq
By Nouri al-Maliki, Nouri al-Maliki is the prime minister of Iraq.
Today, on the 10th anniversary of the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the debate about whether it was worth it to topple the regime and the direction of the U.S.-Iraqi relationship is influenced by a pessimistic view that the United States has lost Iraq. Not true. Despite all the problems of the past decade, the overwhelming majority of Iraqis agree that we’re better off today than under Hussein’s brutal dictatorship.
Iraqis will remain grateful for the U.S. role and for the losses sustained by military and civilian personnel that contributed in ending Hussein’s rule. These losses pale by comparison, of course, to those sustained by the Iraqi people. Our government emerges from this experience determined to ensure that these sacrifices contribute to a future of freedom and prosperity for our country.

Echoes of war in contemporary Iraq: In the months after the last U.S. troops left their country, Iraqis are surprisingly optimistic about the future given the horrors of war they have endured for nearly a decade. Housing developments, shopping centers and hospitals are rising from the rubble, stores that had been closed for years are reopening, and familiar sights are returning. But every step forward is weighed down by continued bloodshed, brutality and corruption. Our relationship with the United States did not end when U.S. troops departed. In December 2011, I stood with President Obama while he spoke of “a normal relationship” between the United States and “a sovereign, self-reliant and democratic Iraq.”Iraq is building an inclusive political system, with free multiparty elections, a multiethnic government and an independent judiciary. Our gross domestic product is expected to grow by an average of at least 9.4 percent annually through 2016. Last year, we surpassed Iran to become OPEC’s second largest producer of crude oil.Iraq is not a protectorate of the United States; it is a sovereign partner. Partners do not always agree, but they consider and respect each other’s views. In that spirit, we ask the United States to consider Iraq’s views on challenging issues, especially those of regional importance. Iraq is developing an independent foreign policy. With no intention of repeating Hussein’s wars, we are committed to good relations with all our neighbors. We offer the hand of friendship to Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Sharing a 376-mile border with Syria and a 906-mile border with Iran, we have a vital interest in stable, non-hostile relations with these countries, too.In Syria, we can conceive of no scenario in which a military “victory” by either the government or the opposition can bring peace and stability. Only a negotiated solution can lead to such an outcome. Accordingly, we oppose all transfers of weapons, to both the government and the opposition, and we are working to ensure that our airspace and territory are not used for such transfers. Further militarization of the conflict will only increase the suffering of civilians and strengthen radical groups, including our common enemy, al-Qaeda. We have been mystified by what appears to be the widespread belief in the United States that any outcome in Syria that removes President Bashar al-Assad from power will be better than the status quo. A Syria controlled in whole or part by al-Qaeda and its affiliates — an outcome that grows more likely by the day — would be more dangerous to both our countries than anything we’ve seen up to now. Americans should remember that an unintended consequence of arming insurgents in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets was turning the country over to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.Iraq’s longest border is with Iran, and we don’t want a reprise of the war which left hundreds of thousands dead on both sides in the 1980s. We would like to see a Middle East without weapons of mass destruction, where governments are committed to development and cooperation rather than conflict and competition to obtain nuclear weapons. But as with Syria, we seek a peaceful resolution of this issue.The peoples of Iraq and Iran share historic, cultural and religious ties. While we want our relationship with Iran to be stable, it will never be subservient. Iraq follows an independent foreign policy based on its distinct interests. This has been proved by our decision to sign the strategic framework agreement with the United States and our commitment to maintain a strong partnership with the United States on political, security and economic levels. Our cooperation with the United States continues to bear fruit, and we hope to accelerate and energize it even more. While our journey from despotism to democracy has not been easy, the Arab Spring has shown that all countries going through such transitions face turmoil. The protests in several cities in Iraq reflect the fact that, while some sectarian elements call for violence, the majority of Iraqis want to express their demands through democratic means. With provincial elections this month and general elections next year, Iraqis can resolve their disagreements with ballots, not bullets.With the world’s fifth-largest proven crude oil reserves and the region’s fastest-growing economy, Iraq is an important energy supplier and trading partner for the United States. With our needs for infrastructure to restore our electrical power and water supply, Iraq offers investment opportunities for U.S. companies.The United States has not “lost” Iraq. Instead, in Iraq, the United States has found a partner for our shared strategic concerns and our common efforts on energy, economics and the promotion of peace and democracy.

Paul Harris leads Douglass football back to the Maryland 2A state semifinals
Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post - The 6-foot-4, 200-pound Paul Harris, left, is a key reason why Douglass returns to a Maryland 2A semifinal.

In July, Douglass senior Paul Harris orally committed to play football at the University of Tennessee, surprising even his mother by picking the Volunteers out of a group of more than two dozen offers, including one from his dream school, the University of Southern California.
Since then, the steady stream of letters and messages from top-tier programs around the country has only continued, increasing further with news last week of Tennessee Coach Derek Dooley’s firing. Harris, who took classes this summer so he could enroll in college early, said Tuesday he still plans to begin classes at the Southeastern Conference school in January.
Harris, 18, has learned to take the attention in stride. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound wide receiver had played few varsity reps before coming to Douglass from DeMatha last fall, and he only morphed into a top prospect thanks to his work at the Upper Marlboro public school. Now he’s led the Eagles back to the state playoffs for the second straight season, beginning with Friday’s Maryland 2A semifinal against Edmondson-Westside in Baltimore.“It’s just crazy — I’m like ‘Don’t these guys know I’m going to college in a month?’ ” said Harris, rated a four-star recruit by Rivals.com. “But it just goes to show that a lot of people really respect what I do, and they think they can help mold [my game]. That’s a blessing now — a sign from God that everybody knows my talent.”With Harris, the challenge was unlocking the potential that had long intrigued area coaches. After helping the Marlboro Mustangs to an undefeated season in his eighth grade year, the local private schools recruited him heavily. Harris and his mother, Tiasha Carter, made at least 10 different visits before settling on DeMatha. With the Stags, the wide receiver said he struggled to grasp the playbook early on and ultimately had his sophomore season derailed by a shoulder injury.When Coach Bill McGregor resigned in March 2011 leaving the program briefly in flux, Harris was ready for a change, too. Though he had grown up mostly attending private Catholic schools, he enrolled at Douglass, where his mother has worked as a special education teacher for eight years.“You watch Paul for five minutes, and you know he’s going to be outstanding,” McGregor said. “He has all the intangibles you look for that you can’t teach. . . . He just had to wait his turn a little bit.”Carter, who gave birth to Harris during her junior year at Woodbridge High School, knew her son would fit in easily at Douglass because of his familiarity with the school, but she met with each of his teachers early on to make sure he didn’t get a free pass in the classroom because she was in the building.On the football field, Harris joined the Eagles with little national recruiting buzz and his own doubts about how he would fit into Coach J.C. Pinkney’s run-first, triple-option offense. Adjusting to his first extensive game action took time, but Harris surged late in the season with 24 catches for 492 yards and six touchdowns combined in the team’s last five games. Douglass finished its season with its first state title game appearance since 1975, falling to Middletown, 43-6.“I’d been trying to get him to have that killer-type instinct,” Pinkney said. “Man, use that size, use all that ability to your advantage. All the sudden, he wasn’t saving anything. He was going all out.”With game tape to back up his physical attributes, Harris began accumulating scholarship offers last winter, landing his coveted offer from USC in late February. He had become enamored with the Pacific-12 school watching Reggie Bush play for the Trojans, and Carter believed it was such a sure thing she began making plans to move to the West Coast to be closer to her oldest son.But Harris took his time through the process and made his plan to graduate early before picking a school. During the summer he kept a strict schedule with a government class at Friendly in the morning and training sessions at Douglass in the afternoon before going to Suitland for an English course at night. Because he doesn’t have a driver’s license, Carter acted as her son’s chauffeur every step of the way.“I missed grinding with my team — that was the biggest thing,” said Harris, who has 29 catches for 603 yards with eight total touchdowns this season. “I couldn’t be with them hardly at all, but I wanted them to know that I was working hard, too.”Ultimately, Harris committed to Tennessee based on his close relationship with Darin Hinshaw, the team’s wide receivers coach. Despite the continued interest from other programs, including a new offer from Miami last month, Harris said he won’t alter his plans as long as Hinshaw is retained on the incoming staff. Barring a change, he plans to fly to Tennessee on Jan. 2 and start classes the next week, beginning work toward a degree in sport management with a minor in religious history.Then in late May, Harris will come back and walk in a high school graduation ceremony in front of the people that helped turn his dream of a scholarship into a reality. “It was just a matter of [him] buying into our program and our colors and everything else,” Pinkney said. “He was from another school. Now he’s a Douglass kid.”
