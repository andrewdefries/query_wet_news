Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Gay Catholics assess societal change and the impact of Pope Francis
Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post - Dozens of gay catholics hold an evening Mass at the St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Washington on Oct. 27.

By Michelle Boorstein, E-mail the writer
Allen Rose was a high school seminarian in the 1970s when his confession to a priest of sex with a classmate led to the other boy’s expulsion. Rose felt crushed by feelings of guilt and abandonment, and within a few years he began to drift away from Catholicism.
It took two decades to find a path back.

Pope Francis: Acts of humility: The new prelate is rewriting the rules in his first year at the Vatican. Here are a few of Francis’s symbolic moves and statements. Related
Conservative Catholics question Pope Francis’s approach
Michelle Boorstein and Elizabeth Tenety Some traditionalists concerned that his all-embracing style runs counter to clear, defined teachings He was working as a paralegal in Washington in the 1990s when he saw an ad for a gay Catholic community that met at St. Margaret’s Episcopal Church in Dupont Circle. By then he’d concluded that being gay disqualified him from being Catholic, but he still felt Catholic, and yearned for Mass and the prayers, sounds and rituals that remained his shared language with God.Every Sunday night at the gathering known as Dignity/Washington, Rose found a sanctuary full of hundreds of people struggling with negative comments about gay relationships they’d heard in church. Joining Rose were closeted Catholic schoolteachers, men dying of AIDS, former seminarians like himself. Under the vaulted dark wood ceilings, they would pray, take Communion from a once-ordained priest, and be both openly gay and Catholic. That church officials didn’t recognize the service was beside the point.“It took a while for me to realize being gay didn’t prevent me from participating in my Catholicism,” Rose said.And now, 41 years after the founding of Dignity/Washington, another turning point may be before gay Catholics: the Pope Francis era.Francis has launched a global debate with his more welcoming language, including a response of “Who am I to judge?” to a reporter who’d asked about homosexuality. The Washington branch of Dignity, the country’s largest spiritual community of gay Catholics, may be in as good a position as any to gauge Francis’s impact, having watched the experience of being gay and being Catholic change dramatically over the years.The tiny handful of Catholics who met in 1972 in the cafeteria of the Basilica of the National Shrine were afraid to share their real names. And Catholicism, like all of institutional religion, has seen its stature in society tumble.A few weeks ago, members of Dignity/Washington had their first meeting in more than five years with local church officials. And members are considering continually how gay or Catholic to be: Should they add a rainbow flag to the altar, behind the cross? (Yes.) Should they focus on gay issues in sermons? (Split.) Should they shift from focusing within, on healing, or aim outward and take stands — such as allowing females to preside at Mass? (Very split.)When the national Dignity organization was founded in 1969, the Catholic Church was far more open to gays and lesbians than was general society, with Catholic institutions among the first to ban employment discrimination. In the beginning, Dignity branches were allowed to meet in church buildings. The paradigm has since flipped, experts and Dignity members say. Americans have quickly opened to gay equality while the most recent church teachings call gay people “disordered.” And while harsh anti-gay rhetoric from clergy and teachers is rare, U.S. bishops are among the most active opponents of same-sex marriage. Some members still recall the 1987 march from Georgetown University to St. Margaret’s after U.S. bishops started banning gay-friendly services at Catholic institutions.At 3,000 members, Dignity nationally is half the size it was in the 1980s, when AIDS and the post-Stonewall era gave rise to the gay pride movement. Dignity/Washington split into two services to accommodate its more than 400 members. One-third of the congregation died of AIDS. These days the branch has about 200 members. Nationally, Dignity is two-thirds male, and in Washington the proportion is even higher.Members are divided on how Francis will affect their organization.Mark Clark, a retired father of two and a member of the Washington branch, said the pope’s impact is “huge” not because of any imminent doctrine changes but because of his way of thinking.“He has a sense he’s in charge of this foundational spiritual organization, and he can’t be making some sudden changes. It’s more like an aircraft carrier, turning slowly.”Marianne Duddy-Burke, Dignity’s national executive director, said the group is “paying a lot of attention” to what the pope says and “how that impacts the actions of bishops and other Catholics.”University of New Hampshire sociologist Michele Dillon, who has written about Catholics who disagree with church teachings on key issues but remain Catholic, called the Francis era “a very interesting time for gay Catholics.” How will Francis’s words be taken?“Will it mean some local parishes will start new ministries to gays? Or will it mean Dignity loses relevance? That’s an open question,” she said.Washington is considered among the country’s most conservative branches, with a large number of former seminarians, priests and theology students in the pews.Its members want weekly worship that is as close as possible to a traditional Mass, and are quick to tell a newcomer that presiders were all once ordained priests — even if they later left the church or retired and let their credentials lapse. Its offices are purposely not registered as a “church” because members want to show church hierarchy that the group doesn’t see itself as a breakaway group but part of Catholicism “in exile.”As the decades have passed, Dignity/Washington has continued to meet every Sunday evening, to watch the cross and liturgical books held aloft and carried to the altar, to hear scriptural readings and a sermon, to clasp hands and say the Lord’s Prayer and to receive Communion.Jason Entsminger, 26, was active in his Reno, Nev., church and wanted to be a priest until he realized in his teens that he was gay. He recalls the sting of hearing a classmate use a gay slur during confirmation class and then listening to the teacher elaborate on why same-sex relationships were immoral. The University of Maryland agriculture department adviser never went back, instead exploring different churches through his early 20s.When he learned about Dignity in May and then saw the rainbow flag displayed next to the crucifix on the altar, “it was awe-inspiring, something I can’t even describe. To be in a place where I didn’t have the fear of being told from the pulpit that what I knew was true and I have accepted is my truth from God was wrong.”Entsminger went with a Dignity group recently to a Mass celebrated by Washington Archbishop Donald Wuerl for young adults. They introduced themselves as being from Dignity, Entsminger said, and to other young people.“In the gay community, a lot of people say: ‘You go to church? Why would you do that?’ I say, ‘I go to gay Catholic church.’ [They say,] ‘What’s gay Catholic church?’ ”Indeed, some traditional Catholics wouldn’t consider Dignity’s members Catholic, not so much because they’re gay but because they are purporting to hold Catholic services with unofficial clergy.Archdiocese spokesman Chieko Noguchi said she had little to say about Dignity because “it’s not recognized by the Catholic Church.”As more observant Christians, Dignity members have had to reconcile their view of themselves as fully Catholic with the hierarchy’s perspective that the group is not. Members do this by focusing on Catholic teachings that emphasize freedom of conscience.After his first Dignity meeting, Clark, who was raised as an observant Catholic, said: “I was completely sold on this notion of a Catholic service for LGBT people. The church is not the hierarchy — not the bishops, not the pope — it’s the people, as well.”Dignity/Washington members aren’t making much of their recent meeting with a member of the archdiocese. “There’s no fruit on that tree,” one group leader said. Right now they’re focused on figuring out their role in a rapidly shifting society. They’re also trying to accommodate both the confident young members and the older ones, two of whom recently committed suicide in situations Dignity leaders say were related to their sexuality.“I’d love to see us go out of existence,” said Rose, 56. “But I’d hate it if we couldn’t figure out how to reach people who need us still. The biggest challenge we face is giving people a chance to heal and community in a changing environment.”

Hospital fountain linked to Legionnaires’ outbreak
By Lena H. Sun, E-mail the writer
An outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in Wisconsin has been linked to a decorative water wall in a hospital lobby, according to a study published Tuesday that suggested the popular architectural feature can pose dangers in a health-care setting, especially for people with weakened immune systems.
In 2010, eight people contracted the severe and potentially life-threatening form of pneumonia caused by the bacteria. None had been admitted to the Milwaukee-area hospital at the time of exposure. But they all had walked by the water wall in the main hospital lobby, researchers said.

The disease is spread through inhalation contact with contaminated water sources.One person who got sick was a delivery man. Three others were picking up medication at the hospital pharmacy. Three were outpatients. And one man was waiting to pick up his wife. “He really enjoyed sitting next to the water wall,” said Thomas Haupt, a Wisconsin health division epidemiologist and lead author of the study. “These water walls are indeed very beautiful, but they’re very risky.”All eight either had underlying medical conditions or other factors that increased their risks of getting Legionnaires’ disease. Three were hospitalized in intensive care and were on mechanical ventilators; all eight survived. The study, published online in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, is the second documented outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in a health-care setting associated with a wall-type water fountain, a design that is increasingly popular in hospitals, hotels, spas and other public settings, the study said. In 2007, two cancer patients at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda were diagnosed with the disease after being exposed to a contaminated wall-type water fountain.Decorative water fountains and water walls can be soothing and calming, so many hospitals and clinics included those amenities as a way to be more patient-friendly, said Jan Patterson, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.But the problem is, even with regular cleaning and testing, “it’s possible for legionella to accumulate,” said Patterson, who is also president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. “I guess the takeaway here is that if you have any underlying conditions, you should avoid walking by them or stay as far away as possible.”As for hospitals and other health-care facilities, “they should avoid having these in their facilities altogether,” she said.When the fountain was first suspected as the source of the Wisconsin outbreak, the hospital shut down the water wall and turned it into a planter. No known additional cases of Legionnaires’ disease occurred after that. Many other health-care facilities in Wisconsin shut down or removed their decorative fountains, the study said.Every year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receive reports of about 3,000 people diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease. But experts say that many more cases go unrecognized and between 8,000 to 18,000 wind up in the hospital, according to Lauri Hicks, a CDC medical epidemiologist and specialist on Legionnaires’. More than 10 percent of cases are fatal.Some of the most common symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough and severe fatigue, are also associated with pneumonia, she said. The Wisconsin study, she said, is a “good reminder that in settings where you have people with increased risk of getting Legionnaires’ disease, you should be considering carefully the management of any of your water systems that these persons could be exposed to.”CDC experts have been working with a professional organization, the American Society for Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, to come up with a standard practice for building managers and owners to prevent the disease, she said.Inpatient facilities with fountains, or any center that takes care of people with weakened immune systems, such as nursing homes, should be conducting regular assessment for Legionnaires’ disease, she said.The water in fountains or water walls is often an ideal breeding ground for bacteria because it is warm or at room temperature and because the recirculating water can stagnate. In addition, fountains develop scum, “and the bacteria like to live in that slime layer that forms on fountains, in whirlpools, even in your shower,” Hicks said.Fountains can also create bacteria-bearing aerosols as water sprays or cascades down walls or rocks.The fountain at the Aurora St. Luke’s South Shore hospital was installed in 2008. All visitors using the hospital main entrance passed by it on their way to the information desk. Water flowed down a tile wall about 8 feet wide by 5 feet high, and through a bed of decorative rocks that rested on a spongelike foam material.The water collected in a trough at the bottom of the fountain, beneath the rocks and foam, and an electric pump recirculated it to the top of the water wall.Health officials found that the water was kept warm by two heat sources: an electric fireplace on the opposite side of the same wall that housed the fountain and low-voltage flood lights in the ceiling and in the water trough. Although hospital staff performed weekly and monthly maintenance, “it’s very difficult to clean those things out,” Haupt said. A sampling of a 3-inch by 4-inch piece of the foam material found it had more than 1 million bacteria, he said.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
New Egyptian constitution may clamp down on parties
Amr Nabil/AP - A poster showing Egypt’s ousted President Mohammed Morsi with Arabic slogan reading, "no revenge without trials," hangs in a popular coffee shop in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt on Aug. 27, 2013.
By Howard Schneider, E-mail the writers
CAIRO —
Egypt is considering a new constitution that will ban ­religion-based political parties, reverting to the type of restrictions imposed under Hosni Mubarak
and now viewed by authorities as critical for stability after the military’s removal of an Islamist government sparked weeks of violence.
The constitution is taking shape at a rapid clip, as the country’s military-backed interim leaders try to satisfy Western demands and their own promises of a prompt return to civilian rule. But the effort also threatens to leave the country’s basic division unresolved, with supporters of Mohamed Morsi, the ousted president backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, still squared off against Egyptians who felt deeply disappointed by his rule.

Libya: Niger extradites Gadhafi’s son al-Saadi
Associated Press Niger on Thursday extradited to Libya one of Moammar Gadhafi’s sons, al-Saadi, who fled as his father’s regime crumbled in 2011.
Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. A presidentially appointed 10-member panel has completed work on a draft constitution, and state-affiliated media have reported on its key elements in recent days. Along with clamping down on religious political parties, the proposed charter repeals a move by Morsi to strengthen the role of Islamic law in Egypt.The draft is expected to be sent this week to another presidential panel, consisting of 50 people drawn from a cross-section of society, including the large trade unions, major religious groups, political parties, the security establishment and other constituencies. They are to make final recommendations in 60 days.A constitutional referendum would follow in the fall — the second such vote in as many years — and set the stage for national elections to choose a new president.Egypt’s second-largest Islamist organization, the Salafist Nour party, has agreed to join the panel, but the Muslim Brotherhood has not been included. Much of the Brotherhood’s leadership has been imprisoned and is facing criminal charges, including inciting violence — accusations that the group describes as politically motivated. Consensus unlikely
Egypt has struggled for decades to find a formula that balances the role of Islam with the rights of the country’s Christian minority and a strong secular current. As details of the draft constitution emerge, it is far from certain that this round of the process will be any more successful than the others.Even supporters of the process acknowledge that it is unlikely to produce a national consensus, given the summer’s tumult. But it may, they say, win enough backing for the country to move forward.“We are in a very sensitive and critical state right now,” said Ahmed Saeed, head of the Free Egyptians Party, one of the groups invited to nominate members to the constitutional advisory panel. “If we really work on women’s rights and children’s rights and press rights, our sector of society — civil Egypt — will be happy. To reach consensus is another matter. . . . I don’t think [the Muslim Brotherhood] will accept it.”Egypt has about 53 million voting-­age citizens. About 26 million participated in last year’s presidential election, which Morsi won. Over the objections of many moderates, he pushed through a new constitution that garnered about 11 million votes in a referendum late last year. In a stark exchange Tuesday, fugitive Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Beltagy, in hiding for weeks, claimed in a statement aired by Al Jazeera television that the group was acting “for God first,” and he accused the interim leaders of resurrecting Mubarak’s regime. Interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said the Brotherhood needed to understand Egypt’s “new reality.”“Ordinary citizens are afraid of reconciliation with people who were violent and who they think lack good intentions,” he said.
Points of contention
Some points of agreement have emerged, such as elimination of the Shura Council, the upper house of parliament, which added to Mubarak’s and Morsi’s power because the president appointed one-third of its members.But the flash points have quickly become apparent.Under Mubarak, political parties of all sorts were tightly controlled by a strict licensing procedure that chafed both religious and secular groups. The procedure was eased substantially after his departure.But under the draft constitution, Egypt would return to a Mubarak-era provision banning political parties organized “within any religious frame of reference or on any religious basis or on the basis of gender or origin.”After portions of the draft were published by the state-affiliated al-Ahram news organization, a Brotherhood-affiliated newspaper wrote that the new constitution will “insult Islam and spread immorality.”The fate of Article 219 also is being closely watched. That provision, enacted with the Muslim Brotherhood’s backing, specified that Egyptian law would be based on Sunni Muslim “jurisprudence” and practice. The Egyptian constitution has long nodded to Islam in a generic way, but the Morsi-backed provision pointed to a more intense application of Islamic law, known as sharia. The more general language, a compromise that dates to the era of Anwar Sadat, will be retained, while Morsi’s expansion will be repealed, according to the draft. Although the Nour party has agreed to participate in the constitutional panel, a spokesman for the group last week called aspects of the draft law “a move against the Islamic identity of Egypt.” The party said in a statement that it would participate in the upcoming deliberations to try to defend that identity.Some secular groups, meanwhile, worry that elements of the proposed constitution could restrict their rights, foiling the demands for reform that forced Mubarak to resign during mass protests in 2011. They argue, for example, that a return to single-member balloting for parliamentary elections favors candidates who can bankroll their campaigns and once helped Mubarak’s cronies dominate elections.Ahmed Maher, head of one of the groups that galvanized the 2011 revolution, told wire services here last week that the effort to reform the country was “back at square one,” caught in the same standoff between Islamists and the security establishment that for decades was used to justify strict state control of political life.
