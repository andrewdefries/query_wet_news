Are 21st century 5-year-olds cognitively ready to read?
By Valerie Strauss
This was written by Elfrieda (Freddy) H. Hiebert , president/CEO of TextProject, a not-for-profit aimed at increasing student-reading levels through appropriate texts. She is also a research associate at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Here, Hiebert analyzes the explicit and implicit assumptions within the Common Core State Standards regarding formal reading instruction in kindergarten: the dumbing down of kindergarten texts and the pushing down of reading instruction to kindergarten.
By Elfrieda H. Hiebert
“K–12 reading texts have actually trended downward in difficulty in the last half century”
(Common Core State Standards, Appendix, A, page 2).
In the case of kindergarten texts, this statement is blatantly false. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Kindergarten texts were added to core reading programs as a result of Reading First mandates in the first decade of the 21st century. How the writers of the Common Core State Standards came to the conclusion that kindergarten texts — which had been nonexistent until a decade ago — had decreased in difficulty over a 50-year period is perplexing. The explicit assumption that kindergarten texts have been dumbed down over the past 50 years and that their difficulty levels need to be accelerated has consequences for how young children begin their formal reading experiences, especially the children who depend on schools to become literate.
The inclusion of kindergarten in this blanket statement about text difficulty represents an implicit assumption about beginning reading that also requires consideration — that earlier is better. Does beginning reading in kindergarten truly ensure that high school graduates are better at reading the complex texts of careers and college? In this essay, I review research on both the explicit and implicit assumptions within the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) regarding formal reading instruction in kindergarten: the dumbing down of kindergarten texts and the pushing down of reading instruction to kindergarten.
The dumbing-down of kindergarten texts
The Common Core State Standards writers cite two sources for the dumbing down conclusion: Chall (1967/1983, 1977) and Hayes, Wolfe, and Wolfer (1996).
Chall analyzed first-grade texts from core reading programs of 1956 and 1962. Hayes et al. found that the first-grade texts from the 25-year period represented in Chall’s analysis were significantly easier than either the texts of the previous or subsequent 25-year periods.
Further, massive changes occurred in first-grade texts in the decade after the Hayes et al.’s analysis (Foorman, Francis, Davidson, Harm, & Griffin, 2004). When California in 1988 and Texas in 1990 dropped controlled vocabulary in first-grade texts, the number of unique words and rare words increased substantially. These two features of texts challenge, and, all to often, overwhlem, beginning readers. Even with the move to decodable texts in 2000, the number of unique and rare words has stayed high.
Further, neither Chall’s nor Hayes et al.’s analyses included kindergarten texts. In Chall’s era and also in her stages of reading (Chall, 1985), formal beginning reading instruction began in first grade. Kindergarten was not even provided in some school districts and, where it was provided even in the late 1980s, kindergarten teachers believed that their students should not be involved in formal reading instruction (Durkin, 1989).
In 1990, two independent analyses verified the absence of kindergarten textbooks in core reading programs (Hiebert & Papierz, 1990; Morrow & Parse, 1990). Kindergartners worked in reading readiness workbooks. These workbooks included a handful of pages that could be folded into booklets. The booklets were composed of a small group of highly frequent words (e.g., the, a, and) and labels for pictures (e.g., a with a picture of a cat).
Shortly after these reviews, publishers added “big books” to kindergarten components of core reading programs. These were intended for read-along and read-aloud sessions but it was not until the early 2000 programs that texts for kindergarteners were embedded within the core reading programs to comply with Reading First mandates. An analysis of the exit-level kindergarten texts in a 2007 core reading program showed them to be comparable in difficulty to the texts of the 1962 and 1983 copyrights of the same program (Hiebert, 2008). Not only have kindergarten texts not been dumbed down over the past 50 years, the literacy demands for kindergartners have increased immensely, particularly over the last decade.
The pushing down of formal reading instruction
There are two fundamental assumptions related to the pushing down of formal reading instruction to kindergarten: (a) that 21st century American children are cognitively prepared to read at age five and (b) that pushing down the task of reading to kindergarten will aid in high school graduates’ ability to read the complex texts of career and college.
Are 21st century American five-year-olds cognitively prepared to read? At least for children who live in homes above the poverty line, many literacy opportunities exist for young children — educational television, colorful and inventive books, and preschool. Even with all of the literacy stimulation that middle-class children experience, however, few read as kindergartners. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Denton & West, 2002) shows that most children can recognize letters by the end of kindergarten and many can make the connection to the primary sound associated with a letter but few children are reading before first-grade.
These data are not evidence that 5-year-olds do not have the cognitive capacity or processes to read. Some five-year olds (and even younger children) learn to read when parents, teachers or a combination of the two groups plan to teach children to read (Durkin, 1966). Even in these contexts, however, many five-year-olds do not learn to read (Denton & West, 2002).
And for those children who do learn to read — two critical questions are: Is the instruction worth it? And what has been eliminated or diminished in children’s experiences to make time for formal reading instruction? I attend to the first question but not the second question in this essay. In the long run, the answer to the second question may be the most critical one in developing engaged, interested, and proficient readers. That topic merits its own essay.
Does pushing down result in higher reading performances? Substantial investments in literacy-related instruction of four-year-olds were made in Early Reading First and even greater investments were made in primary-level instruction that included kindergarten. Despite these investments, gains have not been evident in higher grades (Gamse, Jacob, Horst, Boulay, & Unlu, 2008; Jackson et al., 2007).
Evidence on the effects of early reading instruction on later reading achievement also comes from analyses of international data. Suggate (2009) examined reading achievement as a function of school entry age of 15-year-old students across 55 countries, controlling for social and economic differences. Results showed no significant association between reading achievement and school entry age but, in countries with earlier starting ages, the achievement gap was larger for 15-year-olds. A few benefit from the early introduction. The students who depend on schools to become literate struggle even earlier—and longer.
Potential for decreasing access for children of poverty
Chall (1977) was the one who proposed that dumbing down of texts might be an explanation for lower performances of American high schoolers on college-board exams. In one of her last projects, Chall (1999) identified a staircase of text difficulty to support reading of complex texts at and after high school graduation. The CCSS also identified a staircase of steps with increasingly more complex text. The size of the steps in the two applications of the staircase model, however, differs substantially. At grade five, difficulty levels of the CCSS and Chall model were comparable. Prior to that, however, they were not. Chall advocated a more “gentle” perspective on when students should start on the stairway (grade one) and identified more moderate, although challenging, levels of text difficulty for grades one through five than those of the CCSS.
From Chall’s (1985) perspective, preschool and kindergarten were times when young children needed to be involved in listening to and retelling stories and writing with crayons, paints, and magnetic letters.
The foundation that ensures capacity — and interest — in reading complex text is grounded in appropriate early childhood experiences. When the steps are too big and when the capabilities of students do not match the size of the steps, the progression up the stairway of text complexity will likely be fraught with missteps and injuries.
The current policy initiative could well have the effect of making high levels of literacy even more inaccessible for the very students who depend on America’s public schools for academic learning—the children of poverty.

John Marszalek: By attempting to resupply Ft. Sumter, did President Lincoln purposely provoke the war?
By John Marszalek
Giles Distinguished Professor Emeritus of history at Mississippi State University
When Abraham Lincoln took his oath of office, the last thing on his mind was starting a civil war that would consume his entire presidency. He did, however, believe that he had a constitutional duty to prevent the break-up of the Union, which he and so many Americans viewed in mystic terms.
Preserving the Union meant doing what it took to prevent its dismemberment. Fort Sumter became the symbol of the ability or inability of the national government to maintain control over its territory, and the ability or inability of the Confederates to eject Federals from what they considered to be their land. Lincoln knew he had to hold on to that fort or admit the success of Confederate secession and the dissolution of the Union. Jefferson Davis and the Confederates believed just the opposite.
Ironically, both Lincoln and Jefferson Davis hoped that the other side would go on the attack first and thus lose the moral high ground. Lincoln held fast, but the Confederacy blinked and Southern cannon opened fire on Fort Sumter.
Did Lincoln’s actions to preserve the Union maneuver the Confederates into going on the attack first? Historian Charles Ramsdell certainly thought so in his famous Journal of Southern History essay in 1937. This was hardly the case, however. Southerners were only too happy to attack the fort on their own. Had Lincoln tried to resupply Sumter or not, it seems probable that the South would have attacked anyway. The Confederacy had gone too far already in its determination to be a separate nation to do anything less.

Privacy advocates oppose Facebook changes
By Hayley Tsukayama
Facebook’s future plans and tweaks have left some users confused and privacy advocates on edge.
(Thierry Roge - Reuters)
Users and privacy advocates have reservations about Facebook’s planned redesign, the way the change will affect third-party apps and the network’s general approach to privacy.
Third-party apps will be fully integrated into a user’s profile page, with updates about activity on each app. That means that users won’t actively click to share updates from apps — the apps will add that information to a user’s page automatically.
With this change, users will have to think more carefully about what apps they use, since their private media consumption, exercise routines and other habits could be automatically published on their profiles.
On Sunday, self-proclaimed hacker Nik Cubrilovic accused Facebook of using cookies to track users while they are logged off, something Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik denied in a comment on Cubrilovic’s post. Stefancik confirmed that Facebook alters rather than deletes cookies when users log out as a safety measure, but said the company does not use those cookies to track users or sell personal information to third parties. He also said that the company does not use cookies to suggest friends to other users.
Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that the organization is opposed to changes made to the Timeline, Facebook’s newly designed profile page. Acting as a sort of digital scrapbook, the Timeline now shows all the information a user has put on Facebook in chronological order. The new format changes rules about how information is accessed, Rotenberg said, adding that the problem is that this has happened after the company has already acquired user data. EPIC is preparing a letter to the Federal Trade Commission about the changes, he said. The organization has led the charge calling for the agency to look into Facebook’s privacy policies.
The change in format is also confusing to many users. Pam Dixon, executive director at the World Privacy Forum, said the nonprofit has heard from several consumers who don’t understand how their privacy settings will work. In an attempt to make privacy controls more granular, Facebook has made it an option for users to set privacy limitations on every post, which also apply to its associated likes and comments.
Users can set up the baseline sharing settings for their account in their personal privacy settings, but many users don’t understand how and why sharing settings are being set by default, Dixon said. Facebook users who’ve contacted her group also have said that they are concerned about how privacy settings are set up for opt-in third-party apps and whether or not they’ll be able to delete their data from an app if they decide they no longer want to use it.
Understanding privacy settings on Facebook accounts is particularly important, Dixon noted, since the Federal Trade Commission has made it clear that it’s fine for employers to look at social media profiles as part of background checks for potential employees.
Jeffrey Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy said one of the main problems users and regulators have with Facebook is that the company makes frequent changes to its network. “Facebook is such a moving target that hardly anyone can keep up,” he said. By	Hayley Tsukayama

(Linda Davidson/ THE WASHINGTON POST ) - Actress Kathleen Turner stars in a play about fiery newspaper columnist Molly Ivins.
CAPTION
By Peter Marks, E-mail the writer
The eve of a national political convention is as opportune a moment as any to summon the rabble-rousing ghost of Molly Ivins, the unreconstructed Texas liberal who loved nothing more than to place a few rhetorical matches between the toes of her conservative targets and giddily set the ensuing discourse ablaze.
The carousing journalist and sometime television personality is satisfyingly called forth in Arena Stage’s Cradle in the commanding personage of Kathleen Turner. For the 75 minutes of “Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins,” Turner prowls the confines of her compact domain and, with the aid of a gravelly twang and a pair of red cowboy boots, proceeds to reanimate the humor, by turns impish and withering, of a columnist beloved in progressive circles for conferring on George W. Bush the belittling nickname “Shrub.”
Video
Kathleen Turner channels the late Texas journalist Molly Ivins as she compares the social differences at her first few newspaper jobs. Then, Molly pokes fun at the unusual tendencies of Americans in a salute to our nation’s independence. Turner stars in “Red Hot Patriot” at Arena Stage. The show runs through October 28. GoingOut

Free admission Get ideas Opening the show while Republicans are out of town is not a bad move, because, as you might imagine, the thoughts ascribed to the late Ivins by sister journalist-playwrights Margaret and Allison Engel do not immediately provoke the thought that Karl Rove should host the cast party. (Margaret Engel, by the way, was once on the staff of The Washington Post.) When the audience leaps to its feet for the curtain call, one feels as if the muscular applause is both for the actress’s vigorous turn and the spectators’ own in-sync political views.Preaching to the choir is no crime, but “Red Hot Patriot,” efficiently guided by director David Esbjornson, will have limited appeal for those unmoved by Ivins’s worldview, or uninterested in the (mostly) bygone thrills of hard-drinking newspaper people, or immune to the war stories of trailblazing women. On John Arnone’s spare set, Turner, in a denim work shirt and Ivins’s curly ’do, pecks away at a manual typewriter, of the variety seen these days only behind a glass enclosure at the Newseum. And on a screen behind her materialize vintage black-and-white photos of all-male Texas newsrooms that the determined Ivins managed to infiltrate.Still, in the guise of Turner, Ivins emerges here as just the sort of person of outsize passion and vivacious excess you would like to believe can be nourished by a profession steeped in the notion of free expression. In that regard, “Red Hot Patriot” stands as a mini-monument to the whimsically unpredictable glories of the First Amendment.The show is held together by Turner’s magnetism and Ivins’s lashing quips, which, until her death from breast cancer in 2007 at 62, bubbled forth from such publications as the Texas Observer, the Dallas Times-Herald and, for an unhappy spell, the New York Times. (She also did a stint as a commentator on “60 Minutes.”) The playwrights capably curate many of Ivins’s best lines, which tend to be folksy grenades tossed directly at the colorful gang of Texas pols with whom she carried on a torrid professional love-hate relationship. Of one she saw as especially intellectually challenged, she said: “If his IQ gets any lower, we’ll have to water him twice a day.”As this one-person bio-drama makes plain — her only stage companion is a silent copy boy played by Nicholas Yenson, who rips the wires of Ivins’s past stories off an ancient teletype machine — Ivins was a classic outsider, from classically bourgeois roots. (She adored her deeply conservative parents, especially her father, known as “the General”; they seemed to have battled to a mutually respectful draw.) The Engels posit her as a champion of all those she saw as, like herself, barred from the inner sanctum of white male power. It was her facility for turning the language of Bubba hilariously against him that made her so effective.The concision of the piece and the vast archive of well-turned phrases that Ivins left behind explain why “Red Hot Patriot” is a more successful evening than “Ann,” the one-woman show about her close friend, the late former Texas governor Ann Richards, that actress Holland Taylor brought to the Kennedy Center in December. You wonder if a show in which these two entertaining figures actually spoke to each other, revealing each other’s vulnerabilities and weaknesses, might provide more enlightening portraits than do either of the solo pieces.In any event, “Red Hot Patriot” will be a diverting slice of American political life for those who want some charismatic flesh wrapped around the voice of a singular commentator on the left. In a manner most news editors would find commendable, it addresses the quintessential five Ws that all good reporters take into account. In Turner’s watchable rendition, it’s the “Who” that resonates most emphatically.

Set, John Arnone; costumes, Elizabeth Hope Clancy; lighting, Daniel Ionazzi; original music and sound, Rob Milburn and Michael Bodeen; projections, Maya Ciarrocchi; wig, Paul Huntley.

Libya’s all-important post-election steps
By Editorial Board, IT’S BEEN less than nine months since the final downfall of Moammar Gaddafi, the dictator who ruled Libya for 42 years and who left it with no recognizable political institutions, no rule of law and no established political parties. Given that history, and the predictions that NATO’s support for last year’s rebellion against the Gaddafi regime would produce Somalia-like chaos in the oil-producing state, Saturday’s general election was a remarkable achievement.
Election authorities said 1.8 million voters — a turnout of 65 percent — cast ballots for an interim National Assembly in which 3,700 candidates competed for 200 seats. There were, of course, some irregularities and scattered episodes of violence, but more than 90 percent of election stations opened, and the chief of a European Union assessment team said that “nearly all Libyans cast their ballot free from fear and intimidation.”

Apply the brakes
Editorial Board The Secret Service needs to avoid so many main road closures.
The initial results, drawn from exit polls and unofficial counts, were also encouraging. A centrist alliance led by former interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril appeared to have won a plurality, besting Libya’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and other explicitly Islamist factions. Mr. Jibril, who earned a doctorate in political science from the University of Pittsburgh, is regarded as a pro-Western moderate. Though he rejects the labels “liberal” and “secular,” he appears committed to democratic principles. On Sunday. he offered to form a coalition with the country’s other political forces, a proposal that at least some of his opponents appeared to welcome.The new assembly, which is to form an interim government expected to serve 18 months, will face profound challenges. Parts of Libya are still controlled by armed militias that answer to no central authority; clashes between Arab and non-Arab peoples have afflicted the sparsely populated south; and regional rivalries threaten to derail the constitution-writing process. Originally empowered to write the new charter, the assembly was stripped of that authority days before the election in response to protests from the eastern region centered on Benghazi.In that context, Mr. Jibril’s initiative to form a broad coalition seems prudent. Libya’s principal political forces may not have major ideological disagreements: There seems to be a consensus, for example, that Islamic sharia law should be one source of the constitution but not the only one. The biggest political challenges may be determining the degree of federalism in the new state and fairly distributing the country’s bounteous oil revenue among a population of 6 million.That will be easier to do if the new government can succeed in imposing its authority across the country, including disarming militias or integrating them with official security forces, and freeing prisoners from irregular detention. The United States and its NATO allies could help with this: Libyan officials have repeatedly requested assistance with reorganizing and training the army and police forces. NATO’s intervention in Libya last year paved the way for Saturday’s landmark election. Now the Obama administration and its allies should help the new authorities attain their goal of a democratic Libya.
