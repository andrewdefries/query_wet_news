Loop Missile Contest Winners!
By Al Kamen
Washington Post social media guru Natalie Jennings in an In the Loop T-shirt. (Marlon Correa)
And now. . . the winners in the Loop Contest to help the Pentagon figure out where to put the House-passed East Coast missile defense system — should the Senate also approve it.
There have been many excellent entries from around the country on where to put the interceptors to protect us from hypothetical missiles from Iran and North Korea — although the generals say they don’t really need the system.
Without further ado, the winners:
* “Locate one near Fenway Park to protect it from Iran, North Korea and the Yankees.” — John Modler, a retired federal employee and prior contest winner from Catonsville, Md. (After last weekend, Nationals Park also could use some protection from the Yankees.)
* “Accident, Md. and Pork Barrel Pond, Mass.” — Zachary M. Hosford, a think tank research associate at the Center for a New American Security.
* “How about building a base to protect the Smithfield, Va.,” the Ham Capital of the world. “Call it ‘pork’ for pork’s sake.” — Harry Meem, a retired copy editor for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
* “The Jersey Shore to protect Snookie, the Hamptons to protect the banksters.” — Leslie Beil, a writer and hot-glass artist in Alexandria.
* FedEx Field in Landover and another battery near Redskins Park to protect the “strategic brain trust of the organization and the talented players.” — Wesley Davis, a retired fire captain from Prince Georges County now living in Conway, S.C. * “How about Syria, Va.? That way, if the Iranians launch a missile at us, we can say we had the good people of Syria shoot it down for us.” — Doug Williamson, an international wildlife trade consultant and prior contest winner from, naturally, Syria, Va.
* “Capitol Hill — or at least around the House side,” so when the “non-existent” missiles are fired, “the interceptors that don’t work can protect” them. — Barry Blechman, who works at the Stimson Center, a foreign policy think tank.
The West Coast already has a system and is thus invulnerable to attack, so we asked for East Coast sites, but we’ll include this one.
* Cable TV viewers “know there is one place that is attacked over and over again by Iranians, Soviets, North Koreans and assorted aliens from outer space — Hollywood.” — James F. Schumaker, a retired foreign service officer and prior winner who, wouldn’t you know, lives about 30 miles away in San Clemente, Calif.
Congratulations to the winners, T-shirts headed your way, and thanks to all for entering.

More Obama picked up GOP senators’ dinner tab	By Rachel Weiner	March 6, 2013 at 9:31 pm More Comments
President Obama personally paid for a dinner out in Washington for a dozen Republican senators, the White House has confirmed.

The dinner, which took place at the Jefferson Hotel, is part of an ongoing charm offensive as Obama looks to cut a budget deal with rank-and-file Republicans rather than GOP leadership. The meal lasted over two hours.
Asked how the conversation went, Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Tom Coburn (Okla.) both flashed reporters a thumbs-up sign.
Along with McCain and Coburn, the attendees were Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.), Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Dan Coats (Ind.), Richard Burr (N.C.), Mike Johanns (Neb.), Pat Toomey (Pa.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), John Hoeven (N.D.) and Saxby Chambliss (Ga.).
“The President greatly enjoyed the dinner and had a good exchange of ideas with the Senators,” a senior administration official said.
The dinner took place as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and several senators -- including one Democrat -- maintain a talking filibuster against John Brennan, Obama's nominee to lead the CIA.

More Juergen Klinsmann discusses U.S. national team	By Steven Goff	November 1, 2012 at 5:41 pm More Comments
Before we get to excerpts from U.S. national team coach Juergen Klinsmann‘s media teleconference Thursday, a note about the World Cup qualifying hexagonal next year:
The FIFA draw to determine the dates and matchups in the final round will take place Nov. 7. At that point, the USSF will begin exploring venue options for the five home matches. The opener is Feb. 6, with the draw determining whether it is home or away.
While Klinsmann was answering questions on the call, Jozy Altidore scored twice for AZ Alkmaar in a 4-1 Dutch Cup victory at third-tier SWZ, increasing his total in all competitions to 11 in 10 matches. The coach was asked whether he has had any communication with the striker since dropping him from the roster ahead of the final two semifinal-round qualifiers in October.
“We have had no further contact since then and I haven’t made up my mind yet if I call him up for Russia” for the Nov. 14 friendly in Krasnodar (10 a.m. ET, ESPN2, ESPN3.com).
Klinsmann plans to lean heavily on European-based players — the match comes during a single FIFA fixture date in the heart of league campaigns — but he will also consider MLS players whose teams have been eliminated from the playoffs. The roster probably won’t go public until three days before the match.
Where does all-time scoring leader Landon Donovan stand after missing several qualifiers with injuries and indicating he is unsure about his future heading toward the next World Cup?
“I find it really courageous of him to talk openly about what is going through his mind. I can understand all of those thoughts and try to understand his personal situation, which I do with every player. … It’s really down to him, what he wants to further achieve in his future, what he wants to do. Whatever he decides to do will be very respected by us.”
Is Donovan in the hexagonal plans?
“We all hope so. Things can change overnight in our environment.”
Asked further about Donovan, Klinsmann said: “After the playoffs, we are going to sit down and talk. He is always in our plans, absolutely.”
Concerning Nurnberg right back Timothy Chandler, who is weighing his options about between the U.S. and German programs, Klinsmann said: “I have been talking to him. It’s similar to Landon; they have to make their own decisions. It’s totally up to him how fast the decision on his end will be made.”
Klinsmann said he is content with backline development, citing Geoff Cameron‘s emergence at Stoke and on the international level; Oguchi Onyewu‘s re-emergence at Malaga; Carlos Bocanegra‘s experience; Clarence Goodson in Denmark; and Maurice Edu‘s versatility. He also mentioned Omar Gonzalez, Matt Besler and Tim Ream.
On the left, Fabian Johnson “gives us a completely new element going forward.”
Bundesliga veteran Steve Cherundolo and Danish-based Michael Parkhurst, as well as the Mexican league’s Edgar Castillo and Michael Orozco Fiscal, are also in the mix. One lingering question is whether Aston Villa’s Eric Lichaj will receive a call soon.
Discussing the scrutiny he receives after each roster selection and whether that indicates a growing intensity and passion about the national team, Klinsmann said: “All of us enjoy that because it shows that soccer is growing in the U.S. in a very fast pace. Interest overall is getting bigger and bigger. … There is so much interest in the game, it’s just awesome. If people discuss every roster and every individual player, it’s just great. The more people that discuss it, the more opinions are out there — I love that. It’s good for the game here in the U.S.”
A few notes:
At 9-2-2 in 2012, the USA is enjoying its best winning percentage in the modern era.
Forty-five players have earned at least one cap this year.
Twenty-six players appeared in the six World Cup semifinal-round qualifiers. Of those, 11 made their qualifying debuts.
Ten players have scored this year, led by Clint Dempsey‘s six goals and three apiece by Donovan and Herculez Gomez.

More White House rep responds to liberal backlash against free trade deals	By Howard Schneider	February 18 at 12:47 pm More Comments
In his State of the Union address last month, President Obama avoided any deep discussion of global trade and the proposed agreements his administration is trying to complete -- leaving some to wonder if the president was still committed to what had been a core piece of his economic agenda. In the days since, the difficult politics of the issue got even worse. Labor, environmental and some other core
Michael Froman
Democratic groups are already mobilizing against the president's trade push, and the two top Congressional Democrats -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) -- came out against legislation likely needed for any future trade treaties to move forward.
In what is becoming an uphill battle, U.S. Trade Representative Mike Froman on Tuesday continued the long climb in a speech billed as a major effort to reconcile the free trade agreements that the administration is negotiating with Asia and Europe with a progressive labor, environmental and jobs-oriented agenda.
The remarks coincided with President Obama's trip this week to Mexico for meetings with President Enrique Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who with Obama run the three countries that opened their borders to each other 20 years ago under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As trade agreements go NAFTA is a bit of a touchstone -- a reference point that both sides use to score points, either noting how auto and other plants in the U.S. moved a few miles south to take advantage of cheap labor, or arguing that the integration of three very different economies models how an efficient world system could be organized.
At the Center for American Progress, Froman argued that critics of the administration's current trade push are replaying the debates of the early 90s -- rather than acknowledging that trade policy needs to catchup with the advance of the internet, other technolgy, the rise of China, and a general reshaping of global commerce over the past quarter century. There is, he insisted, a way to build trade agreements that can advance labor and environmental standards, build middle class incomes in the U.S., and be profitable for American companies -- not, as critics argue, simply streamline their ability to offshore.
"We face a choice," he said. "Work to raise the standards or stay on the sidelines as other countries write the rules."
The remarks included a dose of realpolitic -- specifically an effort to respond to longstanding criticism that the administration has been negotiating the new agreements without adequate input from Congress or advocacy groups. Froman said USTR is expanding a system of outside committees it uses to get advice on trade policy so that it includes "a new forum for experts on issues like public health, development and consumer safety" -- areas where advocacy groups have been most critical of the administration.
He also promised more detailed public updates on the status of the 12-nation TransPacific Partnership and a separate agreement being discussed with the European Union.
But the address was largely an effort to reframe an issue where the administration, at least publicly, has been suffering the death of a thousand cuts -- with lawmakers on both sides setting difficult demands, advocacy groups generating public petitions in opposition, and trade skeptics focusing on the disruptive aspects of globlization rather than its benefits.
His pitch was based both on the importance of U.S. leadership and on the economic realities of today's world. There was the usual statistical aside -- how exports lead to jobs and boost incomes, an argument opponents of the trade agreements counter with their own statistical arguments about the impact of trade deficits and job losses.
But Froman's key argument was a broader one: that globalization is here, likely to deepen, and that while it has been disruptive to individual workers it has also "proven to be the most powerful force for alleviating poverty and raising living standards around the world" -- a point often missing from domestic trade discussions. U.S. imports may, for example, displace some U.S. workers if factories migrate abroad, but they also provide jobs in poorer developing countries, have arguably furthered political liberalization in some places, moderated inflation in the United States and provided key new supply sources for goods used by American manufacturers.
The choice, Froman said, is to ignore that reality or navigate it -- presumably through agreements that would build stronger labor, environmental, intellectual property rules and other regulations into the global trading system, and let more U.S. goods be sold overseas. To the degree that U.S. energy supplies are making the country more attractive as a place to manufacture, he argued, that advantage will best be exploited if the country has open access to more of the world.
"The pace of...globalization and technological change is not slowing down," says a working draft of the speech. " The question is not whether we can roll back the tide of globalization. The question is whether we are going to shape it or be shaped by it."

Wizards hold players-only meeting
Nick Wass/AP - Nick Young, John Wall and the rest of the Wizards are looking for answers. The team held a players-only meeting on Thursday to address its 0-6 start.
By Gene Wang, E-mail the writer
Mired in the worst start in franchise history, the Washington Wizards held a players-only meeting on Thursday afternoon in which they addressed myriad issues that have left them the only team in the NBA without a victory.
Veteran guard-forward Maurice Evans organized the meeting that took place between a film session and practice at Verizon Center one day after the Wizards lost to Orlando, 103-85, to drop to 0-6. The meeting lasted 15 to 20 minutes, according to forward Andray Blatche, who invited criticism following a season-opening 90-84 loss to New Jersey in which he called for the ball in the post after the team blew a 21-point lead at home.

Wizards Insider: Latest updates
“The sense of entitlement that’s here sometimes, I’ve never seen before,” said Evans, who came to Washington last year in a trade with Atlanta. “We have to start earning things. Earn your way into the rotation. Earn your way onto the floor, and then you earn your minutes by being productive, and when you’re not in the rotation, you be supportive and make guys better in practice.”Evans has yet to play this season because of discomfort in his right knee. Still, he remains among the most respected players in the locker room as a veteran who has been on playoff teams and as a vice president of the players’ union.Blatche pointed to Evans, Roger Mason Jr. and Rashard Lewis as teammates whose messages resonated the most. Like Evans, Mason and Lewis have played with contenders for parts of their careers, and their leadership has become that much more necessary as Washington tries to extricate itself from a culture of losing that has continued despite preseason optimism.At the top of the discussion list during the meeting, players said, was delineating roles on a team on which no player, including 2010 No. 1 pick John Wall, has distinguished himself. Wall is averaging 13.8 points per game, second on the Wizards, but is shooting 33 percent — second lowest on the team. He’s also averaging 3.7 turnovers per game.Among the starters, only center JaVale McGee is shooting above 38 percent. McGee is averaging 12.5 points per game and is the third-leading scorer. Blatche, meanwhile, is averaging 12 points per game and went 2 for 13 in a 101-83 loss to Atlanta one game after he told reporters he should be more involved in the offense in the low post.“We’re just trying to hold ourselves accountable,” Blatche said. “A lot of guys say, ‘This is the reason, that’s the reason’ [for the losing streak]. Mo brought us together and said, ‘The reason is us.’ We’ve got nobody to blame but ourselves. At the end of the day, we’re the players out there. There’s nobody else playing but us, so we all had a good talk. We all said our piece, and hopefully all the guys took it in and didn’t take it” personally.Blatche was referring especially to the rookies and his younger teammates. The Wizards have seven players 23 years or younger, including rookies Jan Vesely, the No. 6 overall pick in this year’s draft, Chris Singleton and Shelvin Mack. Jordan Crawford, 23, was among the most despondent players in the locker room following Wednesday’s loss to the Magic, which put on an exhibition of team basketball the Wizards would be delighted to match.Crawford said the atmosphere was “dead” and he felt as if the Wizards had been playing for months rather than two weeks. Lewis, who played for Orlando for more than three seasons before being traded to Washington for Gilbert Arenas, said the team took “five steps back.”Coach Flip Saunders echoed that evaluation in the postgame news conference, and on Thursday he mentioned that he has coached winning teams that have conducted players-only meetings.“As you become a playoff team and a good team, players also have to hold themselves accountable on the floor because we only have so many timeouts that we can call,” said Saunders, who coached regular playoff participants in Minnesota and Detroit. “So a lot of times things happen out there, and the players have to communicate to themselves. “What accountability does is it increases the trust level that players have with each other, and usually when you’re struggling, it’s because it’s a lack of trust at times, and so you worry more about what you have to do than about what the team has to do. I think more than anything else, [the meeting] was just an emphasis that we’re going to hold each other accountable, that we’re a team, we’re family.”

Iraq's Law And Disorder
By Abdul Muhsin al-Athari
Sunday, October 17, 2004; Page B04 You might think of me as an ideal candidate to help reestablish a just legal system in my homeland. I'm an Iraqi American who has practiced law for the past 40 years, both in my native and in my adopted lands. I participated in the Iraqi political process for more than 20 years, first as a law student attending the University of Baghdad School of Law and later as an attorney defending political dissidents. After Saddam Hussein came to power and I left for the United States, I took the bar exam and opened my own law firm here, specializing in immigration law and personal injury cases.
In short, I understand the Iraqi civil law system and how much it owes to the French and Islamic legal traditions; I have built my career within America's common law system and know how deeply it respects the rule of law. I am aware of the strengths and flaws of both approaches, how they reflect the cultures of each country -- and that you cannot simply adapt one system and impose it on the other country. And what is true for the legal system is also true for other civic institutions.
The Post's opinion and commentary section runs every Sunday. � Outlook Section Free E-mail Newsletters Today's Headlines & Columnists See a Sample | Sign Up Now Breaking News Alerts See a Sample | Sign Up Now So you can understand why, after 23 years of living outside Iraq, I yearned to assist with the rebuilding of Iraqi society after Saddam Hussein's fall. My children -- a dentist, a doctor of neuropsychology, a lawyer and a retail manager -- have successful careers in the United States. "I have fulfilled my duty to you," I told them 16 months ago, when I made the decision to return. "Now, I must fulfill my duty to Iraq." I believed I could put a lifetime of experience to good use in my native country.
The challenge I set myself has been harder than I ever imagined. The four months that I spent in Iraq during 2003 crushed my optimism. Exactly one year after my return, I sit in my home in Virginia, worrying about my relatives, fearful for the country where I was born and increasingly disillusioned by the mismanaged American occupation. I have always pinned my hopes on the complete transfer of authority to Iraqis. For true stability, Iraq needs to be governed by men and women who have been democratically elected. That is what I hope for from the January election. I was always aware there would be challenges for Iraq after Saddam. Before I left for Iraq in June a year ago I got together with other Iraqi expatriates, and we met with members of Congress and legal experts on Capitol Hill. Iraq is not Afghanistan, we told them. It is not a decentralized tribal system, on which new democratic institutions can be imposed; it has a sophisticated history of centralized government, and Iraqis need help rebuilding security, the economy and a viable governing administration themselves. Of course, our legal system was subverted by Saddam, who added amendments to the established laws and made judges instruments of his tyranny. But Iraq is a country with a valid system and with a population of experienced and highly trained legal scholars who were either thrown out of the judiciary or forced to leave the country. Once I got to Iraq, I advanced my candidacy to be president of the National Bar Association -- an organization I had originally been invited to join some 35 years before, when the then-president asked me to form a disciplinary committee. Unlike in the United States, where the bar association is a purely professional group, the presidency in Iraq is a political post -- one that I hoped might allow me a platform to promote my views about the transition from American occupation to Iraqi rule. What I got instead was insight into how quickly good aims can turn bad when a foreign power doesn't pay enough respect to local people and institutions.
On my second day in Iraq, for example, I went to the bar association building to meet some old friends. I found the place surrounded by U.S. soldiers. The lawyers were resentful of the military presence but too fearful to complain. That same day, the soldiers arrested one of the lawyers, forcing him to the ground and handcuffing him. I ran over, identified myself as an Iraqi American and tried to explain that this man should not be treated like a common thug. I don't know why they had arrested him, but I was shocked by the rough treatment and lack of due process. Later, when I went to the courthouse in Kut, I found it barricaded with U.S. Army tanks. I persuaded the soldiers to let me in and discovered that a lawyer had been accused of threatening another and had been arrested. When I complained that the arrest was made without a warrant and tried to involve a judge, the soldiers simply dismissed him as corrupt. The country's future stability depended on engaging men like these, not in turning them against America.
Time and again as I traveled around the country from Mosul to Basra, building support for my candidacy, I saw American soldiers, highly trained in the skills of combat, failing in the art of managing the peace. Stories of such failures have become all-too familiar in the pages of American newspapers. But there is still reason for hope, and the legal system provides a metaphor for broader reforms. A former teacher of mine became president of the bar association and moved on to become minister of justice; a friend now heads the legal system. Both are good, knowledgeable men. If they are permitted to work independently, without the influence of the occupation, the whole system will become more attractive to the Iraqi people.
For them to do so, further changes and clarifications are needed from the Americans. First, the $18.4 billion package that Congress has approved for rebuilding Iraq needs to benefit the Iraqi people, not U.S. corporations. Iraqis who have learned about American companies profiting or even engaging in fraud have become convinced that the United States invaded Iraq for oil and financial gain. That belief has been compounded by the awareness that Iraqi oil revenue is being spent by the Americans.
Second, most Iraqis believe that the United States intends to stay indefinitely and that cooperating with the Americans will only prolong their presence. Therefore, there must be a firm timetable for withdrawing the U.S. military.
Third, it is essential that the Iraqi army and police force be reconstituted under the supervision of independent, well-qualified Iraqis. As we are seeing, military might can secure individual victories, but it will not bring lasting stability. The only way to do so is by handing security to Iraqis who are familiar with the culture.
When I left Iraq a year ago to rejoin my family in the States, I thought I would soon go back. But the deteriorating security situation has kept me here, watching from afar. I telephone every day and hear stories of bombings, deaths and near escapes from my relatives in Baghdad and Najaf. I hear about civil society dissolving into chaos. My cousin Qais told me about the day his car was struck from behind by a moped driver when he was stopped at a red light. The moped driver, who was an Iraqi, threatened Qais, saying that if he did not pay him $200, he would come to Qais's home and kill everyone. Qais knew the accident was no fault of his own, but with no viable authority to turn to, he paid the money. It is a less dramatic story than many I could tell, but it reveals the kind of everyday injustices that disrupt the lives of honest people. They will continue until Iraqis are given control over their own futures.

The great Smokey Robinson performed across the street from Ford Field on Friday night, so chances are he was available. And if Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder can do pregame and the national anthem, then why not reward them with the honor of doing the big show? Seeing Aretha perform in Detroit is, for some of us, the equivalent of seeing Frank Sinatra perform in New York or Michael Jordan perform in Chicago.
It makes me wonder if some artists, particularly in the R&B tradition, are being forced to pay for Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction from a couple of years ago.
Yes, this is what the Super Bowl has become, especially when the game is pretty much a snoozer. This is how big it is. Who's in the pregame? Who's singing the anthem? Who's at halftime? Who has commercial time? How did the Steelers fans get all those tickets?
At times, it didn't look or sound like there was a single Seahawks fan in the building. To say the crowd was 90 percent in support of the Steelers is an understatement. No one should ever call Super Bowl XL a neutral-site game. Not that anybody was at fault, but no Super Bowl in history has ever provided such a home-field advantage.
The Seahawks had a chance to keep the place quiet but made one bonehead play after another, from holding calls to dropping passes that would have extended drives and perhaps led to scores. Jerramy Stevens (three dropped passes) was even softer than Joey Porter suggested. And I've seen better clock management from high school teams than the Seahawks exhibited.
And when Seattle wasn't bungling, the referees were.
Seattle should have been ahead by a couple of touchdowns, yet found themselves down 7-3 at halftime because the referees blew a call. Roethlisberger's third-down dive into the end zone simply was not a touchdown, though it was called that on the field. Because less than two minutes remained, the call was reviewed in the booth. It was clearly and conclusively not a touchdown. Big Ben didn't get the ball across the goal line. Yet, the call stood.
Another penalty assessed on the Seahawks early in the fourth quarter, which negated a gain that took the Seahawks to the 1, also never happened. A penalty against Hasselbeck for blocking below the waist when, in fact, he was trying to tackle the interceptor, was erroneous. It would be irresponsible to say the officials were intentionally cheating Seattle. But the bad calls hurt Seattle's chances, no doubt.
Still, one gets the feeling the Steelers would have won a seven-game series, oh, 4-3. Ken Whisenhunt, the Steelers' offensive coordinator, is wonderfully creative, particularly with Roethlisberger, Randle El and Ward. And the defense is too hard-hitting. Hasselbeck played his rear end off, but his receivers are unreliable (isn't that a familiar theme?) and Shaun Alexander didn't have the kind of MVP performance his team needed to win the game. And in the end, the team that should have won did win. The Steelers beat the teams with the first, second and third seedings in the AFC and the top seed in the NFC. There's absolutely nothing more a team could do than that in the postseason -- nothing.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Sept. 1 -- Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto said Saturday that negotiations on a power-sharing agreement with Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, were at a standstill but that she would return from exile regardless of whether the two strike a deal.
Bhutto, who just three days ago had indicated that the agreement was nearly complete, sounded pessimistic about the future of the talks as she spoke to reporters in London. While refraining from much direct criticism of Musharraf, she spoke out harshly against the president's political backers, blaming them for allowing extremism to fester in Pakistan and saying they have deliberately scuttled the deal in order to keep moderates like herself out of power.
The talks "failed because some elements within the ruling party, who have presided over the expansion of extremism and militancy, did not want the path of moderation to take Pakistan to a democratic future," she said.
Bhutto's own Pakistan People's Party, however, had also been resistant to the deal. Many of her strongest supporters have expressed grave reservations about the idea of negotiating with a military man. They have urged her to abandon the talks and return to Pakistan to oppose Musharraf's reelection.
The apparent collapse of the negotiations added even more uncertainty to what is expected to be an incredibly volatile period for Pakistan in the coming months. Musharraf, who must stand for reelection between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15, was once considered a lock for another five-year term. But his fortunes have soured since March, following a botched attempt to fire the chief justice. With his popularity sinking, Musharraf had turned to Bhutto for a possible power-sharing deal that would have allowed her the chance to win back her old job in exchange for her help in giving him a smooth ride to another term.
But Musharraf's supporters said the government had decided that Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party did not offer enough to justify the price.
"Just the PPP on its own will not be able to deliver much, despite what she has been saying," said State Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan.
Still, without Bhutto's backing, Musharraf could face a difficult reelection. Even before the parliament and provincial assemblies vote, the Supreme Court could rule that Musharraf's candidacy is unconstitutional because of his dual role as army chief and president.
Another possible complication is that opposition parties have vowed to protest Musharraf's reelection in the streets, and now Bhutto's loyalists could join them.
Bhutto said her party will announce on Sept. 14 when she will be coming back to Pakistan. That is four days after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has said he will return from exile.
Sharif has already been given permission by the Supreme Court to come back. But Attorney General Malik Mohammed Qayyum told a Pakistani television station Saturday that Sharif would be arrested as soon as he arrived. Sharif was sentenced to life in prison in 2000 on a variety of charges, including corruption, but cut a deal to live in exile instead. Qayyum said the life sentence goes back into effect as soon as Sharif lands in Pakistan.
Without an agreement with the government, Bhutto could also be in legal jeopardy once she arrives because of several outstanding corruption cases against her. That may be one reason that Saturday she did not rule out the possibility that the talks with the government could be revived.

Wicker's Earmark Elicits Criticism

Watchdogs Decry $6 Million for Contractor
By Matthew Mosk
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, January 16, 2008
Sen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican congressman appointed to replace Trent Lott in December, last year obtained a $6 million earmark for a defense contractor whose executives were among his top campaign contributors and were represented in the matter by Wicker's former congressional chief of staff, according to federal records.
Wicker's earmark for Manassas-based Aurora Flight Science fits a pattern that recently attracted bipartisan criticism and gave rise to the most far-reaching ethics overhaul legislation in a generation: The firm retained the services of the congressman's top aide after he passed through the revolving door to become a lobbyist, and its employees helped underwrite Wicker's reelection.
Over the past three years, as Aurora sought defense contracts, the Republican member of the Appropriations defense subcommittee received escalating contributions from the company's executives. Aurora was Wicker's top source of campaign funds in 2006, campaign finance records show. In 2005, the company flew the congressman on a private jet to the ribbon cutting of a manufacturing facility it opened in Wicker's Mississippi district.
And just days after Wicker's chief of staff, John Keast, left his employ in 2006, Aurora began listing the former staffer on public forms as one of its lobbyists in Washington. Wicker placed the earmark in a defense appropriations bill that became law in November 2007.
None of those contacts with the congressman violated any laws. But they drew criticism from the Project on Government Oversight and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), nonprofit groups that have tried to change how Congress handles earmarking.
"It's so commonplace that people have become desensitized to the outrage, but the fact is earmarks for the well-connected leave that much less money available for the real needs of the American public," said Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director. "Congressional leaders promised they were ushering in an era of cleaner government. I guess not."
Wicker did not dispute his role in the earmark or the company's contacts with him, but said in an interview that he sees no problem with directing money to Aurora. He said contributions from its employees played no role in his decision to request the earmark in March 2007. The money was meant to speed development of a new, unmanned aircraft that would be able to fly for days at high altitudes -- a valuable military tool, Wicker said. And the company is developing the aircraft while creating jobs in his home state.
"The long and short of it is, Aurora is putting out a good product in return for these federal expenditures," Wicker said yesterday. "It clearly passes any cost-benefit test." Patti Woodside, a spokeswoman for Aurora, said the earmark was going to develop "a vehicle with tons of potential. I don't think anyone would dispute that this is a worthwhile endeavor." The aircraft is in the research and development phase, Woodside said. The company is developing the aircraft for the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command.
She said Aurora located its facility in Mississippi because the company's chief executive had a close friend at the Mississippi State University, not because of Wicker's representation of the 1st Congressional District from 1994 until his appointment to the Senate. She also said that while the company's lobbying firm, Cornerstone Government Affairs, hired Keast after he left Wicker's employ, another lobbyist at the firm, Dan Fleming, took the lead in helping them obtain federal funding.
Messages left Monday and Tuesday for Keast and Fleming were not returned. A lobbying disclosure statement filed for the period from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2007, lists both as lobbyists for Aurora before the House on budget issues. Wicker served on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee before his appointment to the Senate. That appointment came shortly after Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.)described earmarking as the key factor in scandals that helped drive Republicans from power in 2006.
John Pruett, a fellow at the Project on Government Oversight, said: "There are a thousand companies out there that make unmanned vehicles. Why did he choose Aurora? It points out that [it should not be] . . . left to the inclinations of a representative. There should be some standard."
John Cummings, a spokesman for the Army command, said he did not know why Wicker submitted the earmark request. "It's a congressional add," he said. "It was not requested. It wasn't in the president's budget. Anything that comes in above that means it has not been requested by us."
Records show that Aurora chief executive John S. Langford made his first contribution to Wicker in March 2005. In April, Aurora flew Wicker, Keast and another staffer on a private jet to Starkville, Miss., to attend the opening of the company's new facility there. Under old congressional ethics rules, the private flight was valued at the cost of a commercial flight, or $3,083.
Wicker said the facility is in an area referred to as "the golden triangle," on the border between two congressional districts, where several military contractors have factories. The Aurora plant has created 45 jobs and promises to yield as many as 200, Wicker said.
"It was not a requested earmark from DOD," said Kyle Steward, Wicker's spokesman. "But I will say we had discussions with DOD. They told us no one else is as close to developing this technology as Aurora, and DOD folks are very interested in it, and they see this technology as a need in the future."
On Feb. 5, 2006, after working jointly for Wicker and the Appropriations Committee, Keast left to join Cornerstone. He registered to represent Aurora on Feb. 14, 2006. Cornerstone reported earning $40,000 in lobbying fees from Aurora that year. The same year, Aurora employees donated more than $13,000 to Wicker -- his top campaign contributor that year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Wicker submitted his earmark request on March 22, 2007, less than two months after the one-year cooling off period in which Keast was barred from lobbying Wicker on Aurora's behalf. The company paid Keast's lobbying firm $60,000 in the first half of 2007.
Wicker said yesterday he had been "working with Aurora" long before Keast left his staff, and that he was certain that Keast "complied with all the waiting periods." Wicker said the company is one of several that have donated money to him and benefited from defense appropriations when he was on the subcommittee.
None of that should trouble people, he said. "Basically, I was just trying to create jobs for Mississippians and provide a strong national defense at the same time," Wicker said. "I'm a good vote for a strong national defense. When we can combine that with creating good jobs in Mississippi, in my mind, it's a two-fer."
Research director Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.
