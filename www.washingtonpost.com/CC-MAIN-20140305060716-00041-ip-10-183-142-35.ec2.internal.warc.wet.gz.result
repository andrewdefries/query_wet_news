The Answer Sheet: merit pay study
Posted at 06:00 AM ET, 09/29/2010
Ravitch: The long, failed history of merit pay and how the Ed Department ignores it
By Valerie Strauss
Education historian Diane Ravitch writes: "Few people realize that merit pay schemes have been tried again and again since the 1920s. Belief in them waxes and wanes, but the results have never been robust." And a day after a big study was released showing that performance pay made no difference, the Education Department handed out millions of dollars for the development of merit pay programs.

Arlene C. Ackerman, former D.C. schools chief, dies at 66

By Matt Schudel, E-mail the writer
Arlene C. Ackerman, who had a stormy tenure as superintendent of the embattled D.C. public schools from 1998 to 2000 and who later led the school systems in San Francisco and Philadelphia, died Feb. 2 in Albuquerque, where she had lived for the past year. She was 66.
She had pancreatic cancer, her son Anthony Antognoli told the Associated Press.
(Juana Arias/The Washington Post) - Former D.C. Schools Superintendent Arlene Ackerman at her office in D.C. School headquarters in this Aug. 1, 1998 file photo. Gallery
Notable deaths of 2013: A look at those who have died this year. Dr. Ackerman came to Washington in 1997 as an assistant to schools chief executive Julius W. Becton Jr., at a time when much of the District’s government and finances were overseen by the federally mandated D.C. Financial Control Board. She became the superintendent in April 1998 and began cleaning house at once.Dr. Ackerman inherited a school system with a $62 million deficit and a record of chronic underachievement and mismanagement. In her first three months on the job, she dismissed almost 30 principals, several department heads and 600 administrative staff members, including most of the personnel office.She realized how dysfunctional the school system was when she filed a change of address only to learn that her own personnel file was missing.“We have a school system where you have all of these systems that are broken, and you have had no accountability,” she told The Washington Post in 1998. “Now we are insisting on it, and now everybody realizes that.”During her two years leading the D.C. schools, Dr. Ackerman was credited with increasing student test scores and reducing administrative costs from 15 percent of the budget to 6 percent. She also instituted a new set of standards for teachers and administrators.She was praised for working closely with parents and for efforts to improve schools in poorer neighborhoods, but she often clashed with members of the D.C. Council, with the teachers union and with people who favored the establishment of more charter schools.She was criticized for a secretive leadership style, for micromanaging and for a confrontational manner of dealing with the city council, which ultimately controlled her budget. In 1999, Dr. Ackerman refused to draft a budget calling for a reduction in funding for the public schools. “In this city, if you could walk on water, you wouldn’t get credit for it,” she said in 1998. “They would say, ‘Arlene Ackerman can’t swim.’ ”Dr. Ackerman resigned in 2000 to take over the top schools job in San Francisco.“She has laid a great foundation for the future,” Michael Casserly, executive director of the nonprofit Council of the Great City Schools, said at the time. “She has laid out very detailed standards, moved more responsibility to the individual school level [and] allocated the resources more fairly.”Arlene Randle was born Jan. 10, 1947, in St. Louis. She was part of the first integrated class at a St. Louis high school and, in a 1998 interview with The Post, recalled that a white girl falsely accused her of carrying a knife to school.She said she had to enter a school banquet for honor students unaccompanied when a white male student refused to walk beside her.She graduated from Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis and received a master’s degree in educational administration from Washington University in St. Louis. She also had master’s and doctoral degrees in education from Harvard University.Dr. Ackerman was a fifth-grade teacher early in her career before becoming a principal outside St. Louis. She was an assistant superintendent in Seattle before coming to Washington.Her two marriages ended in divorce. Survivors include two sons and several grandchildren, but a complete list could not be confirmed.During her six years in San Francisco, Dr. Ackerman was credited with making the school system one of the best in a large American city. After teaching at Columbia, she became the superintendent in Philadelphia in 2008.Her tenure in Philadelphia was marked by repeated clashes with the mayor’s office and state political officials. Dr. Ackerman was criticized when she appeared to be deaf to complaints from Asian parents that their children were targeted for abuse and violence by other students. She was also accused of favoritism in dispensing contracts. A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist dubbed her “Queen Arlene” for her “controlling, aloof [and] imperious” manner. By 2011, the schools in Philadelphia had a deficit of more than $625 million, and Dr. Ackerman was forced from office.After she received a buyout of $905,000, plus $83,000 in unused vacation time, she further inflamed Philadelphia residents when she applied for unemployment.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional

Obama taps two for Federal Election Commission
By Matea Gold, E-mail the writer
President Obama on Friday chose his first nominees in four years to the politically gridlocked Federal Election Commission, planning to tap the head of the California Fair Political Practices Commission and a veteran Washington election law attorney to fill longtime openings on the six-person panel.
The White House said the president intends to nominate Democratic elections watchdog Ann Ravel to fill the spot vacated by Cynthia L. Bauerly, who stepped down in February, and Republican lawyer Lee E. Goodman of the firm LeClairRyan to replace Commissioner Donald F. McGahn, whose term expired in April 2009.

Both nominations require Senate confirmation.All current commissioners are serving expired terms, a situation that has galled advocates of tougher campaign finance rules, who have repeatedly called on the president to nominate new members.Obama’s only previous FEC nominee, labor attorney John Sullivan, withdrew his name in August 2010 after his confirmation stalled in the Senate for more than a year.Ravel has used her perch on California’s elections panel to spearhead an investigation into the donors behind a nonprofit group that funneled $11 million into state initiative campaigns. Her selection buoyed campaign finance reform advocates, who have long pushed the FEC to be more aggressive in that area.This year, Ravel led an effort by state regulators to collaborate on ways to force politically active nonprofit organizations and trade groups to reveal their funders, saying the federal government has failed to act.“Ann Ravel is an outstanding choice and has been a real leader in the area of campaign finance enforcement,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the pro-reform group Democracy 21. He added: “We hope this may be the beginning of the country having a federal campaign enforcement agency again, but it will take some time to find that out.”Conservatives reacted with caution to her planned nomination.“I hope she will exercise her power with restraint and understand that the role of an FEC commissioner is not to be a roving police of political speech,” said Bradley A. Smith, a former FEC commissioner who chairs the Center for Competitive Politics.Goodman brings a different background, having represented corporations, trade groups and political campaigns for the past two decades.“He has a great knowledge of the law and the impact of the rules on real-world political activity,” said Republican election law attorney Michael E. Toner, a former FEC commissioner, who worked at the same firm as Goodman in the 1990s.

Obama’s rough 2013 prompts a new blueprint
View Photo Gallery — 2013: Obama’s lost year: A look back at a year in which the president was besieged by a shutdown, mistakes and tragedies. By Scott Wilson, E-mail the writer
An internal White House assessment concludes that President Obama must distance himself from a recalcitrant Congress after being badly damaged last year by legislative failures, a government shutdown and his own missteps.
Obama has said that his fraught relationship with Congress, especially after Republicans won the House in 2010, complicated his ability to promote his agenda. But for the first time, following what many allies view as a lost year, the White House is reorganizing itself to support a more executive-focused presidency and inviting the rest of the government to help.

The new approach comes after weeks of internal White House debate over a single question: What went wrong in 2013? The answers will help determine the outline of the State of the Union address Obama will deliver Tuesday evening, as well as how he pursues a meaningful legacy in the remainder of his term.Last year began with the fresh-start ambitions of his second inauguration but ended in a long trail of mistakes, international embarrassments and missed legislative opportunities that sapped Obama’s credibility with the public. Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer outlined the lessons learned in a three-page memo that Obama discussed with his Cabinet in recent weeks, according to several administration officials who have read the document. Among its conclusions is that Obama, a former state legislator and U.S. senator, too often governed more like a prime minister than a president. In a parliamentary system, a prime minister is elected by lawmakers and thus beholden to them in ways a president is not.As a result, Washington veterans have been brought into the West Wing to emphasize an executive style of governing that aims to sidestep Congress more often. A central ambition of Obama’s presidency — to change the way Washington works — has effectively been discarded as a distraction in a time of hardening partisanship.The White House postmortem also concluded that the administration suffered from a lack of focus in a year without an election. The 2012 campaign imposed discipline on the White House, providing a political filter to assess every new initiative. Obama wanted to know how his decisions would be explained to voters, a demand that vanished once the election was won.As a result, senior advisers now say, the White House’s focus did not match its ambitions as 2013 began.A bid for new restrictions on gun sales died in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Immigration reform, thought to be a priority for Republicans after their poor showing with Latinos in the last election, languished. A late-arriving budget proposal that included cuts to entitlement programs surprised and angered Obama’s base.Even some of Obama’s closest advisers acknowledged that he sometimes appeared distant in meetings before the disastrous health-care rollout in the fall. The biggest national security leak in U.S. history, the first successful terrorist bombing in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, and a worsening war in Syria piled more time-consuming issues onto a cluttered agenda.By the end of the year, a majority of Americans questioned his administration’s basic competence. Now without an election ahead, Obama has fewer opportunities to recover — making this State of the Union address as politically consequential as any speech in his tenure.“A State of the Union creates a contract with the public about what you say and what you will do,” said John D. Podesta, a senior adviser to Obama brought in this month to help design an effective governing strategy around the president’s goals. “In that sense it is like a campaign, and it disciplines the priorities of the White House by creating an operation manual for the year ahead,” he said. “It is certainly in that spirit we are approaching this year’s State of the Union.”
Prime Minister Obama?
Before Obama answered questions in December from the White House press corps during the traditional year-end news conference, he personally wrote portions of his opening remarks, hoping to put a positive cast on the past year and the one ahead.“I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America,” he said. “We all know there’s a lot more that we’re going to have to do to restore opportunity and broad-based growth for every American. And that’s going to require some action.”Afterward, Obama departed to Hawaii for nearly three weeks of golf, family time and thinking about how to correct the course of his presidency. Others on his senior staff did the same.Pfeiffer, who has served in the administration from the start, returned to the West Wing a week before Obama. He had read a few presidential histories over the holiday and had taken heart in some of the lessons — and perspectives — offered by the travails of recent presidents.Unsolicited, Pfeiffer wrote his three-page memo to Denis McDonough, another veteran Obama adviser named chief of staff at the start of the second term. Facing a divided Congress, the memo said, Obama’s legislative record should not be used as the primary measure of his success.The assessment concluded that Obama and his communications team allowed his fifth year to be judged too much by his dealings with Congress, which were poor.A conservative Republican faction killed his gun-control proposals — joined by some Democratic senators — and eventually shut down the government for 16 days. “We still didn’t know enough about the Republicans,” said one senior administration official, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessments.A second senior administration official said, “The problem for us is that the test of our success became what we passed in Congress, and even in the best case — if the fever had broken and the clouds had parted — we still would have only gotten maybe 40 percent of what we wanted.” “The political discussion, the press, the politicians want to pull the president into the role of prime minister,” the second official added. “So you have to swerve really hard to the executive powers at a time like this.”That point was more a reminder than a novel assessment. After Obama’s second inaugural address last January, Podesta, then head of the Center for American Progress, the administration’s off-campus think tank, said Obama “no longer feels to me like a prime minister.”“He now understands the full range of the power of the presidency to get things done,” Podesta said at the time.Now in the West Wing for a year-long stint as senior adviser, Podesta acknowledged that he was brought in partly to make that early prediction a reality.He said that too often the story of Obama’s past year was dominated by his dealings with Capitol Hill, whether it was his early series of dinners courting lawmakers, the gun legislation defeat or a shutdown that the administration did not expect to actually happen.“Looking at the last year from outside, a lot of it was the president in battle with a dysfunctional Congress,” Podesta said. “Our task is to remember that [Sen.] Harry Reid is the majority leader, not the president,” and allow him to manage Democratic priorities in the Senate.This year, for once, began without a looming fiscal crisis. A budget agreement that replaces some of the money cut by the sequester has been passed, including White House priorities such as early-childhood education. Senior advisers say the deal may bode well for other modest legislative successes to come.Senior advisers also say Obama intends to work with Congress to secure an immigration bill, believing that the Republicans are willing to cooperate to improve relations with Latino voters. It could well be the last measure of legacy-building scale that Obama will be able to get.The rest of the administration’s legislative wish list consists mostly of bills that once would have passed with little debate or measures with growing bipartisan support. A farm bill, patent legislation, a federal minimum-wage hike and a transportation bill are areas where Obama’s advisers believe a partnership with Congress can produce modest results, even in a midterm election year.To better manage the relationship, Obama has brought back Phil Schiliro, his chief congressional liaison during the first two years of his presidency, and promoted Katie Beirne Fallon, who has extensive experience on Capitol Hill, to run the legislative affairs office. The White House political office has also been revived after three years of dormancy, with senior adviser David Simas promoted to run it.“The president is always reminding us that this isn’t the worst that partisanship has been, and you always have to be pushing because you never know when something will break,” said the first senior administration official. “Progress is three yards and a cloud of dust — that’s how it is for us in this environment.” The ‘outside game’
At the start of the second term, Obama and his advisers outlined a strategy for success that relied on smart management of Congress inside Washington and applying pressure to Congress from outside Washington through presidential speeches and travel.The president, his advisers said, would play the “inside game” and the “outside game.” The internal White House assessment of the past year, however, has concluded that Obama should now see the “outside game” as an end in itself.The buzzwords this year are “the pen and the phone” — the West Wing terms for executive action and presidential effort to promote ideas on the economy, education and social mobility at the state and local levels.“Engaging the public on how to improve our communities is a very important feature of the modern presidency,” said Podesta, a veteran of the Clinton administration.Since the start of the year, Podesta and Pfeiffer have held regular meetings in the West Wing to begin charting out how Obama should use his pen and phone in the coming year. Podesta said executive actions will include work to execute the Climate Action Plan, a government-wide blueprint announced last year for addressing global warming. Senior advisers say Obama will also travel outside Washington frequently. The effort will include urging businesses to hire the long-term unemployed, working with university presidents to promote skills training adapted to the demands of the changing economy, and identifying problems such as violence against women and girls, as he did this past week, as priorities for society to address.McDonough and others are also trying to knock down some of the walls within the administration that have often kept advisers and Cabinet secretaries limited to narrowly defined areas of expertise.Advisers and allies outside the government have long complained that the Obama White House makes policy in a political vacuum. The president prefers his advisers to “stay in their lanes” — that is, offer counsel only in their area of expertise — and prefers to put the pieces together himself. But the practice has led to confusion and, at times, poor execution.The deeply flawed health-care rollout, for example, was identified by Obama as a case in which he was not receiving candid reports about problems and made promises on the eve of the Web site’s unveiling that turned out to be embarrassingly untrue.Buying health insurance on the federal exchange never turned out to be as easy as “shopping for a plane ticket on Kayak,” as Obama promised.“I think he was asking the right questions, but he wasn’t getting the right answers,” Podesta said. “And we have to debug that process at the management level.”McDonough has begun meeting with small “clusters” of Cabinet secretaries, attempting to bring them into the policymaking and execution process much more directly.The idea, Podesta said, is to “get more throw weight” behind these ideas. The intent is to address criticism from allies and critics alike that the White House has failed to follow through on some of Obama’s biggest policy ideas, from the Muslim outreach initiative that began in 2009 with Obama’s speech in Cairo to the health-care implementation last year.The Cabinet clusters are chosen around issues. A job skills training group would include Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. Other clusters work on climate change and energy issues.As a third senior adviser said, “The idea is to bring all of the government alive in a way we have never been very good at.”
Running out of time
The clock has begun running in reverse on the Obama presidency, ticking back from Inauguration Day 2017. What is the legacy of a president whose victory made history? Obama will end the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of the year, concluding America’s longest war. Negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program are underway — precarious but continuing. Israelis and Palestinians are talking, though no final peace settlement is in sight.The economy also continues to improve. But Obama has not stopped warning that the gap between rich and poor in the United States is threatening the nation’s long-term economic prospects, a reminder he will deliver again Tuesday to a prime-time audience.Climate change, immigration reform, Wall Street financial regulations and implementation of his namesake health-care law remain unfinished. In his memo, according to people who have read it, Pfeiffer noted that because a modern presidency is often tugged by unexpected events, it is all the more important for the Obama administration to better manage events within its control.The health-care rollout stands as chief among the items the administration controlled but failed to successfully carry out. “The end of the year,” Podesta said, “focused everyone’s attention on execution.”After discussing it with senior staffers, Obama hit some of the highlights of Pfeiffer’s memo in a Jan. 14 meeting with the Cabinet, his first of the year.“One of the things that I’ll be emphasizing in this meeting is the fact that we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we’re providing Americans the kind of help that they need,” Obama told reporters before the session began. “I’ve got a pen, and I’ve got a phone.”Senior administration officials have been meeting with think-tank experts, administration alumni, Democratic strategists and others before the State of the Union — an outreach described by White House officials as more intensive than in the past. “After five years,” said one adviser, “it’s good to get some fresh eyes on the target.”With only two State of the Union addresses after this one, Obama’s target is increasingly history. This year will help decide how he is remembered — from new policies to ones in place that have yet to be fully executed.“We’ll be doing that as aggressively as possible,” said the first senior administration official, “and if we succeed, that is a big presidency.”

Da’Shawn Hand of Woodbridge: The recruit who cares as much about academics as the gridiron
View Photo Gallery — Da’Shawn Hand doesn’t let his bright future in football distract him from academics: Woodbridge’s Da’Shawn Hand, considered the top football recruit in his class, cares as much about schoolwork as the gridiron. By Preston Williams, E-mail the writer
Woodbridge All-Met defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand, considered the top football prospect in the country in the Class of 2014, is not swayed when college coaches promise playing time, national TV exposure, gleaming facilities or snazzy uniforms.
He will politely listen to a recruiting pitch and then launch into an inquisitive monologue of his own: What is your Academic Progress Rate? What internship opportunities do you offer in my field? What is the average income of a graduate with my degree from your school? Video
For Woodbridge’s Da’Shawn Hand, the nation’s top football recruit in the class of 2014, watching film is as much about becoming a better player as it is about family. He watches with his dad, cousin and teammate Marcus Boone, and his uncle, Damone Boone, the 1995 All-Met Player of the Year. Video
Preview: Hylton and Woodbridge face off in what should be a physical, low-scoring Cardinal district game. “They get thrown off, like ‘Whoa,’ ” said the 16-year-old junior, who with his black-rimmed glasses, handshake as tight as a blood pressure wrap and serene groundedness can at times pass for 30.“There are different things like that I want to know to set myself up after football,” Hand said. “NFL I was told stands for ‘Not For Long.’ And if I don’t make it to the pros, I want to make money like I did make it to the pros.”The 6-foot-4, 255-pound Hand has dozens of scholarship offers and two boxes of recruiting letters proudly stored in his grandmother’s bedroom, but by all accounts he handles himself like a second-stringer just happy to have a spot on the roster. That humility was ingrained early. His father, Sharif, used to instruct 5-year-old ‘Shawnie’ to wash the dishes — before putting them in the dishwasher — to give him a sense of responsibility and the value of work.So he was Dishpan Hand before he was Da’Shawn Hand, who first played football at age 12 in Elkton, Md. He was so good so soon that kids from other teams would knock on his door and ask him when his next game was.Now, in a sense, it’s adults doing the same thing. A man at one recent game overheard Hand’s mother, Nicole Graham, cheering for her boy. The man told her that the reason he came to games was to watch her son. Fans at a game in Franklin County, in southwest Virginia, told Sharif Hand they were there to watch Da’Shawn.These days, everybody is.“This is the number one player in the country,” said Rivals.com evaluator Mike Farrell, who has observed Hand on film and at combines and who plans to be on the sideline Friday night for Woodbridge’s game at No. 11 Hylton. “And I’ve seen enough number one players in the country and enough defensive ends and enough players in [the class of] 2014 to say this kid is head and shoulders above everybody else when it comes to talent level.”Managing that talent has not been an issue, because Hand tries to learn from others’ mistakes, whether within his own family or in the cautionary tales about athletes from newspapers, magazines and books that his mother saves or suggests for him.Sharif Hand was a junior in high school in Philadelphia when Da’Shawn was born. Sharif’s brother, 1995 All-Met Offensive Player of the Year Damone Boone, a former West Springfield running back, also became a father while in high school. Boone’s son, Marcus, plays for Woodbridge.“Basically, he watched me grow up,” Hand, 34, said of his son. “I don’t want him to get any kind of fake impression of how this real world is, so when I talk to him, I really talk to him like he’s an adult.”Hand’s mother, who lives in Delaware, does likewise: Take nothing for granted. Have a Plan B and a Plan C. School over football. Be a leader not a follower. Don’t let anyone sell you a dream. If you’re late, someone else won’t be and might get a promotion over you.“That’s what [my dad] wanted to instill in me. No secrets,” said Hand, who has approached his college recruitment with a sort of wary innocence. “He just wanted to prepare me for the real world. He didn’t want me to be shocked or taken advantage of. He just taught me how to be a man.”Boone played at Maryland, carrying only nine times in two seasons before dropping out. He delivered furniture and worked security at Rosecroft Raceway before enrolling at Carson-Newman in Tennessee. He knows the consequences of poor choices and inferior grades and how opportunities can dry up. In turn, so does Hand, who has heard the stories from his uncle. That’s why when the brothers and their boys meet each week to dissect game film, the adults all but ignore the standout plays and dwell on the mistakes.“You’re not impressing us,” said Damone Boone, one of about 20 extended family members who attend Woodbridge’s games and sit as a cluster. “Me and Sharif tell him, ‘Okay, Shawnie, you made the tackle here but what about the block right here you missed?’“He has more of a love of the game than I did,” Boone said. “He’s more of a student of the game than I was. He wants to learn and that’s what it’s going to take. You have to learn your craft. I was just playing. I wasn’t thinking about the future.”Hand always has. As an eighth-grader at Beville Middle School in Prince William County, Hand would bus to Hylton High for a geometry class. He would return to Beville in the middle of a period, so with that free time he would tutor students in math or help out in the school library. He endeared himself to the adults in the building.“Most kids at this age, their mind doesn’t match their body in middle school,” Beville Athletic Director Hess Moore said. “But his did. He always knew what he wanted to do and when it came down to leaving [middle school] and going to high school, football wasn’t what he looked at first. It was which school had an engineering program.”That was Woodbridge, not Hylton, the school in his zone. So Hand enrolled at Woodbridge to pursue an interest in engineering that he had developed from tagging along to job sites with his father, a construction worker.“He would treat me like I was a natural employee, like I was an adult,” Hand said.That’s how Hand, who has 553 Twitter followers but has issued only 24 tweets, handles his business. He once called a college-affiliated Web site to chastise a writer for mischaracterizing his interest in that particular school. Since then, he has stopped doing interviews with team sites, but the mail from the schools they report on continues to roll in at about 15 pieces per day, Woodbridge football coach Kevin Smith said. One school sent 54 letters in one day, an homage to Hand’s jersey number. College coaches fax Hand good-luck notes the days of Woodbridge games.Six colleges, including Virginia Tech and Virginia, offered Hand scholarships after his freshman year. Those pursuing him now include Alabama, Oklahoma and Ohio State.Hand has talked about majoring in engineering, a rarity for a big-time college football player. “If there’s anyone out there who can handle both, I think Da’Shawn’s it,” said Carlos Castro, who helps head the Career and Technical Education program at Woodbridge and who taught Hand his freshman and sophomore years. Hand likes to build things and tear them apart, to see how they work. But he also likes “crunching numbers and negotiation,” as he puts it, so he’s thinking about studying sports business, a major that would be easier to manage for a college football player with demands on his time.One peek in his grandmother’s boxes of letters would indicate that he will be given every opportunity to pursue either degree just about anywhere he likes.“Mom and my grandmas are like, ‘Oh, this is so amazing,’ ” Hand said in a jokey falsetto in imitation of the women in his life. “But my dad instills in me there’s always somebody out there working harder than you. You need to just bring it every time and don’t think about it.”
