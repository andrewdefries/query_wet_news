Jon Huntsman Sr., longtime Romney backer, calls on him to release tax returns
By Greg Sargent
The internet is alive with speculation that the secret source Harry Reid claims to have on Mitt Romney’s tax returns is Utah industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr. He is the founder of Hunstman Corporation and the father of the former GOP presidential candidate — and the speculation is based on the fact that his profile fits with much of what we publicly know about Reid’s presumed confidante.
But I just got off the phone with Huntsman, and he confirmed to me that he is not Reid’s source.
However, in a move that could be significant, Huntsman forcefully called on Romney to release his tax returns. This matters, because Huntsman is a longtime backer of Romney — he has long been close to Romney; he supported his early campaigns; he was the national finance chairman of Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign; and he has raised a lot of money for him over the years. (He backed his own son in the latest GOP primary.) “I feel very badly that Mitt won’t release his taxes and won’t be fair with the American people,” Huntsman told me. In a reference to Romney’s father, who pioneered the release of returns as a presidential candidate, Huntsman said: “I loved George. He always said, pay your taxes for at least 10 or 12 years.” (See update below.)
“Mr. Romney ought to square with the American people and release his taxes like any other candidate,” Huntsman said. “I’ve supported Mitt all along. I wish him well. But I do think he should release his income taxes.”
Reid has claimed that he has it from someone who knows that Romney paid no taxes for a long time. Some have speculated Huntsman is Reid’s source because Huntsman is partners with Robert Gay, a lontime managing director of Bain; they are both officers at Huntsman Gay Global Capital. Huntsman is also close to Reid. But Huntsman adamantly denied discussing Romney’s returns with Reid, and said he knew nothing about them.
“That’s absolutely false,” Huntsman said of the speculation. “I have absolutely no knowledge of Bain or Mitt Romney’s tax returns.” Asked directly if he had ever had a conversation of any kind with Reid about Romney’s returns, Huntsman reiterated he hadn’t. Huntsman said his main connection to Reid is through their shared interest in cancer research.
In any case, the more important thing here might be Huntsman’s call for Romney to release his returns. He may be the highest profile Republican — and he’s certainly the one closest to Romney — to do so thus far.
***************************************
UPDATE: Huntsman’s phrasing above — in which he quoted George Romney saying we should “pay” our taxes for 10 or 12 years — was inadvertently awkward phrasing on his part. Huntsman’s assistant confirms that he meant George said candidates should release their returns for 10 to 12 years. Obviously this doesn’t change the story at all.

They’re adapted from a new book by The Post’s Chris Cillizza, “The Gospel According to The Fix: An Insider’s Guide to a Less Than Holy World of Politics.” (Broadway Books)

By Andrea Sachs and Becky Krystal, Global tourism outlook, family-friendly hotels and more
Tourism boost, not bust Travel and tourism to the rescue! The World Travel & Tourism Council has some cheery economic projections in its latest report: Travel and tourism will grow by 2.8 percent this year, trumping the predicted global economic growth rate of 2.5 percent. The industry is expected to contribute $2 trillion to the global economy and support more than 100 million jobs. And when you take wider economic impacts into account, the number jumps to $6.5 trillion and 260 million jobs. On a micro-level, the report forecasts strides and stumbles in specific destinations. Among them:●South and northeast Asia will be the fastest-growing regions in 2012, expanding by 6.7 percent. ●After a tumultuous period, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and North Africa are showing signs of recovery. Morocco, which is perceived as more stable than Egypt and Tunisia, is at the head of the class.●Expect slow growth in the restless Middle East. Of the countries in the region, Qatar is expected to grow fastest. Interesting trivia: In 2010, Syria attracted almost 15 percent of all international arrivals in the Middle East, just behind Saudi Arabia. It’s not looking likely to repeat the feat in 2012, so far.●North America and Europe will continue to struggle. In fact, the European Union could experience a decline. Pack up the kids and go There’s enough to worry about on family vacations. Now you can at least take some of the guesswork out of deciding where to stay.
Parents Magazine evaluated 70 hotel chains for family-friendly aspects such as room layout, children’s programs, babysitting services and recreational facilities.In the budget category ($99 to $149 per night), the top chains were Embassy Suites, SpringHill Suites by Marriott, Hyatt House, Residence Inn by Marriott and Holiday Inn.One step up in the mid-priced group ($150 to $249 per night), the magazine liked Loews Hotels & Resorts, Kimpton Hotels, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Westin Hotels & Resorts.Check out the explanations behind the rankings at www.parents.com.
Where travel’s a bargain If you’re curious about what U.S. destinations will give you the most bang for your vacation buck, Hotwire.com says it can help.The Web site’s 2012 Travel Value Index
looked at prices and discounts on airfare, rental cars and hotels, as well as entertainment affordability.The top 10 destinations, beginning with the highest rating, were Orlando, Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix, Tampa, Denver, Charlotte, Albuquerque and Miami.

Letter to the Editor
C-SPAN’s Brian Lamb: a national treasure
The March 20 Style article on Brian Lamb, “For C-SPAN founder, a quiet exit,” was splendid. The Federal Communications Commission’s public-interest regulatory regime has been largely a failure regarding commercial broadcasting, and so has the policy on noncommercial broadcasting because of inadequate funding.
The one bright spot has been C-SPAN. In countless programs, Mr. Lamb has sought to foster an informed electorate, which is so vital to the proper functioning of our democracy.
Japan designates some of its distinguished citizens as national treasures. Brian Lamb is surely a national treasure of the United States.
Henry Geller, Washington
The writer was assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information from 1978 to 1979.
