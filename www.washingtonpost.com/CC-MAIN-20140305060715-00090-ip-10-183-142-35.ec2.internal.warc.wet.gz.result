Wealth management services on the rise
By Danielle Douglas, E-mail the writer
Wealth management services are exploding in the Washington area, where at least four financial firms have expanded their offerings in the past four months.
Last week, for instance, Bank of America said it hired 35 financial advisers in the greater Washington area in recent months to cater to customers with assets worth between $50,000 and $250,000. The hires are part of a nationwide effort that has doubled the number of advisers to more than 1,200 in the past year.
The bank, which has 8 million of these customers nationwide, also rolled out its Platinum Privileges rewards program in the area. The program provides “preferred” customers with higher interest rates on accounts, greater access to specialists, fee waivers and discounts on home loans, said Aron Levine, a managing director and preferred business executive at Bank of America.“This client base is the fastest-growing segment of the economy and has been fairly underserved by the industry,” he said. “Metro D.C. is an important market in catering to this group, which is why we will continue to expand in 2012.”Financial services firms have mined Washington for affluent customers for a long time, but the effort intensified as area wealth continued to grow, albeit marginally, despite the sluggish economy. Household incomes in Loudoun County, for instance, rose 2.8 percent to $119,540 in 2010, according to Census Bureau data. “D.C. has changed dramatically. It was always a high employment town because of the government and real estate, but it turned into a tech center, which created a lot of wealth,” said Steve Lockshin, founder and chief executive of Convergent Wealth Advisors. The Potomac-based firm in late October started a division, called Independence by Convergent, dedicated to clients with $500,000 to $5 million in assets. Convergent traditionally manages money for clients with at least $10 million in assets, but now is targeting a demographic that Lockshin said he believes has growth potential.“People are paying a lot more attention to their portfolios now because of the volatility in the markets. They are very conscious of the fact that they need to take risks to grow their assets but are afraid of suffering losses,” he said. “We wanted to democratize our core business because technology now allows us to deliver a similar offering to smaller clients.” Expansion for some wealth management firms has meant acquiring teams in the area or simply putting down roots to serve existing clients. HighTower, a Chicago-based financial services company serving high-net worth individuals, rolled up the Leventhal Group in Bethesda in September and District-based Pagnato-Karp Group in July. Meanwhile, Northern Trust, a Chicago-based bank targeting clients with at least $5 million in assets, opened a District office in early October to be closer to its local customers.“We have hundreds of clients here,” said Joanie Stringer, managing director of Northern Trust’s District office. Northern Trust is well known in the wealth management world, but it is hard to gauge what impact it, or any of its competitors, will have in an increasingly saturated market. “It is a tough market for financial services,” Stringer said. “But there is no better time to grow our business.”

What if we all let each other merge?
By John Kelly, E-mail the writers
As I was stuck in traffic the other day, I pondered the tao of merging.
Tao is a Chinese concept that means the “way” or the “route,” and so it seemed a perfect metaphor for that moment we experience frequently when driving a car: deciding whom to let in front of us. Archive
E-mail
Twitter
If you drive, merging will eventually become an issue. There are places where two lanes become one, places where parked vehicles suddenly eliminate the right lane, places where roadwork or fender benders steal a lane, places where highway offramps merge into surface roads (or vice versa), places where HOV lanes dump us into regular lanes, intersections where neighborhood streets T-end into commuter routes . . .
In each of these situations, we find ourselves either the merger or the mergee: either the driver who wants to be let in or the driver who does the letting in. Or, as often happens, doesn’t. If, as Clausewitz wrote, war is the continuation of politics by other means, then merging is the continuation of our personalities by other means. Some drivers think letting someone in is a sign of weakness akin to Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler.I wonder if some of the Washington area’s traffic aggravation wouldn’t be lessened if people just merged better. I’m not putting all of this on the mergees. Yes, there are spiteful drivers who speed up when they think someone is trying to get in front of them. But there are also mergers who fail to exercise the most basic form of driver etiquette: using their turn signal. Thus the first of my merging rules: If I’m in one of those situations where traffic is inching along because your lane is going away, I’m more likely to let you in if you have your turn signal on. If you don’t, there’s a good chance you’ll have to depend on another kind-hearted driver. If you’re driving the same model of car as I, I’m more likely to let you in. Really, shouldn’t we Kia Soul/AMC Gremlin/Bugatti Veyron owners stick together? If someone lets me in, I feel it’s my duty to let someone else in. Pay it forward, right?Not everyone feels this way. Every morning not far from my house, traffic creeps along Georgia Avenue. Two parallel neighborhood streets about 60 yards apart intersect it. Between them is a gas station. Everyone is trying to merge onto Georgia. I can’t tell you how often I see drivers who have been graciously allowed into the big flow of traffic suddenly stick to the bumper of the vehicle ahead of them, lest someone else try to slip in from the gas station or the next street. Have they become self-hating mergers? A few months ago I visited Southern California and was amazed at how merge-friendly it was. The freeways around L.A. were packed with traffic traveling at frighteningly high speeds, but every time someone wanted to join the flow or change lanes, other drivers made space. If I may mix metaphors, it was as if they recognized we were all in the same boat. And so we are. I wonder what would happen if everyone in Washington let everyone else in. Maybe we could do an experiment: What if on just one day — this Wednesday, say — every time you saw a driver who obviously wanted to join your lane, you let him or her in? It might not make our traffic woes disappear, but it could reduce the aggravation level. As Confucius said: “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”He also said: “Dude, please, use your turn signal.”
Send a Kid to Camp
It’s the time of year when children show an inordinate interest in the calendar. It’s not so much that they’re fascinated by the transition from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. It’s that they can’t wait to get out of school. Summer is almost here. For many kids, that will mean getting ready to go to summer camp. For others, though, it will mean trading the educational stimulation of the classroom for something closer to inertia. Thankfully, there is Camp Moss Hollow. Moss Hollow is a camp in Fauquier County that readers of The Washington Post have supported for more than 30 years, allowing underprivileged kids to spend a week or two in the woods. You can make a tax-deductible donation by going to washingtonpost.com/camp and clicking where it says “Give Now.” Or send a check, made payable to “Send a Kid to Camp,” to Send a Kid to Camp, Family Matters of Greater Washington, P.O. Box 200045, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15251-0045.
