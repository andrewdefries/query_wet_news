Hokies head into ACC tournament looking for ‘fresh, clean start’
By Mark Giannotto
Hokies point guard Erick Green said his teammates aren’t going into the ACC tournament thinking, “Let’s get the season over with.”
(Gerry Broome - AP)
The vibe around Virginia Tech as it prepares for the start of ACC tournament is much different than Hokies teams of the recent past. Gone is the ambiguity of the bubble and the speculation about what Virginia Tech must do to impress the NCAA selection committee. Instead, as No. 10 seed Virginia Tech set off for Atlanta on Tuesday, its only focus is on winning four games in four days. Because after finishing the regular season with an sub-.500 record for just the second time in nine seasons under Coach Seth Greenberg, taking home the ACC tournament title is likely the only way these Hokies can keep their season going.
“We’re in a one-bid league this weekend,” Greenberg said when he met with reporters in Blacksburg to discuss the Hokies’ first-round matchup against No. 7 seed Clemson on Thursday night.
With that has come a clean slate, especially after Virginia Tech ended the regular season with four straight losses, including a 70-58 defeat to North Carolina State on senior night Sunday that left Greenberg to wonder whether his team’s “emotional gas tank was on empty” following an unprecedented streak of six straight games decided in overtime or by two points or less.
Greenberg reflected this week that by playing 15 games decided by five points or less, “it’s almost staggering to think about what these guys have been through, especially with so many young players.” He also described himself as both “extremely disappointed” and “as frustrated as anybody” with how this regular season has gone. But he’s emphasizing to the team that in the postseason, “We’ve got the same record as everyone else.”
Point guard Erick Green said his teammates aren’t going into this tournament thinking, “Let’s get the season over with.” Focus this week has been on how nicely the bracket sets up for a Hokies team that, despite its 4-12 league record, lost only four conference games by double digits. “We just got to let everything go. There’s nothing you can do. It’s a new start and our one goal is to win the whole thing,” Green said. “I think [the gas tank is] going to be back on full just because we stepped aside from everything that happened this season and just go back to a fresh, clean start.”
If Virginia Tech can get past Clemson – a team the Hokies played twice this year, winning by two points in Blacksburg before losing by two in the rematch last week – it would face No. 2 seed Duke in the quarterfinals on Friday. Back on Feb. 25, the Hokies had a chance to defeat the Blue Devils on the final possession of regulation at Cameron Indoor Stadium, only to lose in overtime.
“I feel like going into this as a lower-seeded team, people are probably going to take us a little for granted, so I think the guys need to go out and play as hard as we can and try to win the game,” senior Dorenzo Hudson said. “Gotta win the whole thing, and that’s what our mind-set is right now. We can’t look over any team that we’re playing against.”
“It’s about getting hot at the right time,” he added. “If we go out there and get on a good run against Clemson and get some motivation, anything can happen. I’m not doubting me or my teammates. We can get hot at any time.”
Greenberg agrees that having a player catch fire is the key to a lower-seeded team making a run through a conference tournament. The coach also believes getting through the first game is perhaps more important than anything else, which is why he’s especially grateful the Hokies will play at 7 Thursday night instead of the noon game to kick off the tournament.
“I think our guys are excited about the ACC tournament,” Greenberg said. “If they didn’t grow up with it, their parents grew up with it or their grand-parents grew up with it. If you look at our roster, we surely fit the geographic footprint of our league and they’re excited about the opportunity to play themselves into some sort of a postseason.”
On a programming note, I will not be at this year's ACC tournament but The Post's Steve Yanda will be covering the Hokies this week. Check back here later today and tomorrow for updates from Atlanta, including forward Victor Davila’s status and a preview of the Clemson game. By	Mark Giannotto

The Occupy movement is going nowhere
By Jonathan Capehart
The massive protests over the weekend in Chicago during the NATO summit have folks wondering if that marked a resurgence of the Occupy Wall Street movement. But I have to tell you, if those demonstrations are any indicator, OWS is going nowhere fast.
Let me give OWS its props. When it burst onto the scene last year, it singlehandedly change the national debate from deficits to the 99 percent and their anger over the excesses of Wall Street. Just like the tea party, OWS is an organic movement that resists having recognized leaders. But unlike the tea party, OWS continues to resist having a clear goal that can be achieved through the political process. And it doesn’t help that it has an aversion to the political process.
Think about it. When the tea party got real angry, folks who adhered to its overarching concerns about federal spending and overreach made their voices heard in protests in Washington. But they weren’t content to simply protest. Whether out of conviction or co-opting by Dick Armey or the Koch brothers, those protesters became office seekers. They upended the Republican establishment by running primary challenges to the right of sitting members of Congress — and winning. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) is the most recent example. They provided the GOP the majority it needed to take back the House in 2010. And their resistance to raising the debt ceiling last summer put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk, called into question House Speaker John Boehner’s ability to control his caucus and forced President Obama to make a debt-ceiling deal that was less than ideal.
For all the power it exhibited last fall in changing the national conversation, I’m hard pressed to see what OWS has accomplished since then. Occupy Chicago had a list of grievances that included protesting Boeing for its role in war, climate change, income inequality, gay rights, women’s rights and foreclosures. All legitimate concerns. But if OWS is going to transition from protest to real political power that translates to the change it says it wants, the movement must field candidates who proudly carry the OWS banner. The Tea Party of the Left, if you will.
Yesterday, I said I didn’t know of any Occupy candidates anywhere in the United States. That’s when I heard from Dick Eiden, a San Diego independent running to oust Rep. Darrell Issa (R) and promising “to lobby for the 99%.” But even he acknowledges the hobbling antipathy OWS has toward the political process.
“As you know, Occupy is generally disdainful of electoral politics — which I have been all my life — and generally refuses to get involved,” Eiden wrote. Yet, because of California’s new open primary system, he’s hopeful that he can edge out the Democrat in the June 5 contest to face Issa in November. “If we beat the Democrat on June 5, I’ll be alone on the ballot with Darrell Issa, icon of the status quo, perfect target for Occupy politics,” he said. “This race could become national — even Occupy could get involved! (just kidding . . sort of).”
If Occupy doesn’t use this time to get actively involved in political process, it will never move from protest to power to achieve the goals it says it has. By	Jonathan Capehart

China’s economic slowdown emerges as risk to U.S. economy
By Jia Lynn Yang, E-mail the writer
HONG KONG — Concerns are growing about China’s economy as the country’s new leadership tries to get a handle on deep problems that experts say have been years in the making.
There was a record spike Thursday in rates banks charge when they lend to one another, evoking memories of the credit shortage that shook the U.S. economy during the financial crisis. A disappointing figure from the manufacturing sector provided another ominous sign this week, causing further alarm that China’s slowdown is well underway.

For years, China has been viewed as a place flush with money, erecting gleaming airports, highways and entire cities seemingly overnight. But experts say that much of that building — and impressive economic growth — was fueled by debt that local governments are now struggling to repay, especially as the economy slows down.“You’re dependent on creating new debt every day,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, a Beijing-based analysis firm.On top of that, the old method of taking on more debt to drive growth may be losing its potency.“It takes a lot more credit to produce the same unit of output than it did five years ago,” said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on China’s economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Analysts say China risks entering a vicious cycle. The slower the economy grows, the harder it becomes to pay back loans. The more defaults there are, the more banks pull back credit that could be supporting economic growth.The unfolding events in China, the world’s second-largest economy, are being closely watched by U.S. economists and investors because of the close ties between the countries. This week, the rate spike and manufacturing slowdown contributed to volatility in U.S. stock markets. Rates in China eased off their record Friday.China’s leaders have acknowledged problems with its financial system, and President Xi Jinping has vowed to reform the country’s economy in sweeping ways that rebalance China’s sources of growth, from an economy dependent on speculative investment and real estate to one that relies more heavily on consumption.“We believe the new leaders are fully aware of the financial risks in the economy,” wrote Zhiwei Zhang and Wendy Chen, economists at Nomura, the investment bank. “As their tenure will last for 10 years, they are willing to tolerate some short-term pain in order to achieve long-term policy objectives — preventing financial crisis and delivering sustainable growth.”But there’s some disagreement on how much China’s leaders are actually in control of the situation, and how well they can manage the political perils if people are out of work or see their wealth stop growing.Stevenson-Yang said that soon, even China’s famously large U.S. dollar reserves will start dwindling when the government has to step in and shore up its financial system.“It’s like going down a tunnel where the walls get closer and closer,” she said. “This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a debt crisis, which is way more systemic and difficult.”Part of the issue is that China’s financial system is still relatively immature, at least compared with developed economies. The banking sector is awash with so-called wealth management products that form the backbone of a largely unregulated shadow banking industry. These short-term products offer high returns, but they are often invested in risky assets such as real estate.The growth in shadow banking has been astronomical as banks have pulled back on traditional lending. In 2008, there was an estimated 1 trillion renminbi (or about $163 billion) worth of outstanding bank-issued wealth-management products, according to Nicholas Borst in a recent paper with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. By the end of last year, that amount had grown to more than 7.1 trillion renminbi, or about $1.16 trillion.Interest rates with traditional savings deposits are so low that many ordinary Chinese have begun purchasing these often riskier products in the hopes of getting higher returns on their money. The products are so ubiquitous that they’re regularly advertised on people’s mobile phones.The situation is potentially so dire that Xiao Gang, the chairman of the board of Bank of China, wrote an op-ed earlier this year saying the products amounted to essentially “a Ponzi scheme.”Still, some have faith that the Chinese government will step in before things go haywire.“Unlike the banking system in other countries, most of the Chinese banks are state-owned. . . . The resources which the central government can offer are abundant,” said Chen Gong, founder and chief researcher at Beijing-based Anbound Consulting. The banks “might be on the edge of collapse, but they will never collapse.”
Liu Liu contributed to this report from Beijing.

Enrollment up, HealthCare.gov back on track, Sebelius testifies
Lynne Sladky/AP - Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.
By Sandhya Somashekhar, E-mail the writer
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Wednesday that the ailing health insurance Web site was improving thanks to “relentless” efforts to work out the bugs, and cited an uptick in enrollment as evidence that the program is back on track after a false start.
But she told a congressional panel that the problems that initially plagued HealthCare.gov were “unacceptable,” and that as a result she was creating a new position in the department to head off similar failures and had directed the HHS inspector general to investigate what went wrong.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a House committee on Wednesday that the signup trend for the new health insurance markets is turning positive. How’s that new Obamacare plan working out?
Sandhya Somashekhar and Sarah Kliff Six million Americans got new health insurance on Jan. 1 because of the Affordable Care Act, and we want to know how it’s going for you. All your Affordable Care Act questions answered
We’ve compiled questions and answers around the topics discussed most, so you can browse what others have asked and get answers of your own. Obamacare #realtalk
TUMBLR| Answers to the Internet’s questions about the Affordable Care Act. Implementing Obamacare
LATEST UPDATES | What you need to know about the new health-care law as it begins to take effect.
“The initial launch of Healthcare.gov was flawed, frustrating and unacceptable,” Sebelius told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Now that the Web site is working more smoothly, I’ve determined it’s the right time to begin a process of better understanding the structural and managerial policies that led to the flawed launch so we can take action to avoid these problems in the future.”About 365,000 Americans chose health plans during the first two months of the federal and state insurance marketplaces, administration officials announced Wednesday, bringing the total to more than triple the meager enrollment from October. A report accompanying the announcement showed that the number of people who collectively signed up for coverage in the 14 states running their own insurance exchanges continued to outpace the total enrollment from the three dozen states relying on the federal marketplace.During the hearing, Sebelius disclosed that through the end of October, the administration had spent $319 million on information technology related to HealthCare.gov — up from the $174 million figure she cited during her last appearance before the committee Oct. 30.Asked by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the committee, if she would have delayed the Oct. 1 launch date for HealthCare.gov, Sebelius responded, “On balance, I am not sure what the right answer is.”“I would have done a slower launch, maybe with fewer people and perhaps more beta testing,” she said a little bit later.Republicans also hammered on a theme that they have centered on in recent weeks as the administration has labored to repair the Web site — that the problems with the health-care law extend far beyond the technological issues. They cited the millions of Americans whose health plans are being cancelled despite assurances from President Obama that people who liked their insurance could keep it under his law.“Millions of Americans are being harmed by this law,” Health subcommittee Chairman Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) said. “My constituents do not trust the administration when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, and it is they who are suffering because of these broken promises.But the uptick in enrollment provided fodder for Democratic lawmakers, who have struggled to defend the law’s poor rollout this fall but contended on Wednesday that the health law’s benefits were finally coming into focus now that the Web site is functioning better.“We’re beginning to hear the stories of people finally getting the security and peace of mind that comes with quality health insurance,” Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said. “And some of these stories are very powerful.”In a blog post published Wednesday morning before the hearing, Sebelius said she has asked HHS Inspector General Dan Levinson, to review the development of the Web site with a particular focus on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency known as CMS that oversaw the creation of the Web site, and the private firms that were contracted to work on the project.She also announced the creation of a “chief risk officer” within CMS, who will report to the agency’s administrator, Marilyn Tavenner. The officer’s first task will be to review acquisition and contracting related to information technology.The review is the latest sign that the Obama administration has moved into a new phase in its effort to manage fallout from the broken Web site, which stumbled out of the gate Oct. 1, suffering frequent crashes and other technical bugs. After meeting its self-imposed deadline to fix the site for most users by Dec. 1, the administration is now embarking on an effort to repair trust in the program.Sebelius’s announcement follows news last week that the White House was bringing back a former aide, Phil Schiliro, to help oversee its health policy efforts.The measures announced by Sebelius on Wednesday constitute “initial steps” of a broader accountability effort and will center largely on contracting and the Medicare agency. Administration officials have repeatedly blamed the main contractor on the project, CGI Federal, for many of the lapses. The firm has said it did the job it was hired to do and faulted the Medicare agency, which had ultimate responsibility for managing and testing the overall project.In the wake of the problems, the administration hired a different firm, Quality Software Services Inc., to serve as general contractor in charge of the project and brought in Jeffrey Zients, a former acting head of the Office of Budget and Management, to oversee the fixes.HHS is the third-largest federal contracting agency, Sebelius said in her blog post, with CMS spending $5.3 billion on contracting in 2013 alone. “We must take steps to ensure that our contractors are well managed, and that they fulfill their commitments and provide good services and products for our tax dollars,” she said.

Power vs. punks? Putin could learn from D.C.
By Mark Andersen, The sentencing this month of three members of the Russian feminist punk collective Pussy Riot
to two years in prison for “hooliganism” showed once again how authoritarian leaders fear the power of art and thus unwittingly undermine their own power. After all, who had heard of this confrontationally named group until Russian President Vladimir Putin’s apparatchiks decided to make an example of them, to help quell a growing chorus of dissent? I had not, even though I am a punk activist and historian who was an early supporter of D.C.’s Riot Grrrl movement, a key inspiration for Pussy Riot.
(John Falls) - A multiple-exposure image of protesters putting up posters around Washington in May 1988. Without overreaction by the Russian authorities, the band’s theatrical anti-Putin “punk prayer” at a Russian Orthodox cathedral would have touched almost no one beyond the handful present for the action. Now the three young women — Nadezh­da Tolokonnikova, Maria Alekhina and Ekaterina Samutsevich — are internationally known and have been deemed “prisoners of conscience” by Amnesty International, and their band’s racy name has become something akin to a household word. Conversely, Putin appears not only oppressive but scared, weakened by a show trial that was intended to solidify his rule.I know this dynamic from the inside, having been one of the ringleaders of a similar punk escapade in 1987-88. At the time, Ronald Reagan was president and his attorney general, Edwin Meese III, was mired in scandal, with three special prosecutors on his trail.Annoyed by Meese’s actions and eager to embarrass the Reagan administration, Dischord Records co-founder Jeff Nelson came up with a creative and rude action: silk-screening 3-by-4-foot red, white, black and blue posters that simply stated “Meese is a pig.” At my suggestion, three paragraphs making our case against Meese were glued to the bottom of each poster, lest the poster be dismissed as a mindless prank.We had a sense of humor about our endeavor and few illusions about its likely efficacy. However, the effort was no joke. With help from Positive Force DC — an activist collective I co-founded in 1985 — and assorted other local punks, we proceeded to paste a couple hundred of the posters across the D.C. metropolitan area under cover of night in December 1987, including outside the Justice Department. Amazingly, we pulled off our guerrilla poster campaign without being arrested or even unmasked by the authorities.We took pride in our work and enjoyed the minor local buzz around the mysterious posters that ensued, including in The Post. Nonetheless, the ripples we generated quickly dissipated. As the scandals around Meese deepened, and pressure grew for his resignation, Nelson determined to do a second, larger round of posters, with a snarky — but stylishly rendered — “Experts agree!:” appended to the “Meese is a pig” line. This time we aimed to clandestinely post more than 500 of the eye-catching posters and dispatched our punk army to carry out the task late one evening in May 1988.Our greater ambition, however, was not matched by sufficiently greater skill. This time, three of our teams had run-ins with the police, resulting in several tickets being written. However, these minor penalties soon escalated, and I found myself under investigation by the FBI (an agent told my lawyer he was acting at the behest of the Justice Department), while other organizers also faced charges disproportionate to the crime. This effort at raw intimidation blew up in the face of the administration once our case found its way to the front page of The Post and — via the Associated Press — into newspapers around the country. While the charges were quickly dropped and the FBI investigation halted, the story was given renewed life when a bicycle courier making a delivery was denied entrance to the Justice Department because he was wearing a “Meese is a pig” T-shirt. This time, the story rocketed around the globe. One friend read about it in a Russian newspaper; another heard a story about it on Indonesian radio. A crude prank that might have mattered only to a couple hundred denizens of our nation’s capital was given wings, spreading our message to corners undreamed of in our wildest imagination. Our tale had a happy ending when Meese resigned shortly thereafter, repudiated by his own Republican allies who feared that he might be a drag on George H.W. Bush as he sought to extend the Reagan era for four more years.Thus did ragged punk vandals become celebrated voices of dissent. While the irony was delicious, at the time I often thought of the famous rejoinder of the august Times of London, drawing from poet Alexander Pope, to the arrest of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1967 on politically motivated drug charges: Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel? Scared, self-destructive authoritarians do, as Vladimir Putin has shown. Tolokonnikova, Alekhina and Samutsevich face incarceration — and, for two of them, separation from their young children — but they can take heart that their message has been heard around the world, given extraordinary power and resonance by the Putin regime’s foolhardy actions.
