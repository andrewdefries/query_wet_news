Growing roots for more STEM
View Photo Gallery — : By Marjorie Censer, E-mail the writer
Local technology companies, concerned by a growing pool of jobs and an inadequate number of qualified employees, have increasingly focused on initiatives to improve what they call STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The focus is partly out of necessity. Many companies, such as defense contractors who need employees with security clearances, simply can’t find enough people to fill their jobs.
Many are beginning to broaden their approach from a focus on university programs and newly minted graduates.“Companies have been diversifying their investments,” from looking beyond college students to kids in middle and high schools, said James Brown, executive director of the STEM Education Coalition, whose membership includes associations and businesses. “To the extent that you’re really trying to look at the big picture ... [companies are betting] that if we make the pipeline stronger there, it will have ripple effects upwards.”There are multiple ways to address STEM education; here is a look at how local businesses are spending their time and dollars:
Making it fun for kids
Many companies see middle school as a turning point, the last chance to interest students in math, science and technology before they opt to focus on other subjects.“For girls and for students of color, by middle school if they are not excited about math and science, they tend to start dropping out” of those classes, said Sandra J. Evers-Manly, Northrop Grumman’s vice president of corporate responsibility and president of the Northrop Grumman Foundation.Northrop has targeted its giving at several programs for the age group, such as backing the Sally Ride Science Festivals for girls in 5th through 8th grade.Getting students excited often means looking outside the classroom. Northrop also sponsors FIRST robotics competitions, designed to feel more like sporting events than academic events. Team members often dress in costumes and build robots to play games against each other, said Lynn Gilmore, director of corporate citizenship for Northrop’s information systems business.Northrop funds individual teams as well as regional tournaments, and company employees act as mentors to teams and staff the tournaments.Northrop’s target is to donate about 50 percent of its charitable giving to STEM. In 2011, its total giving — which includes all charitable giving by the company and its foundation — totaled about $28.2 million, and a spokeswoman said more than half went to STEM initiatives.Northrop is hardly alone. This summer, BAE Systems plans to host a month-long program in Reston meant to introduce at-risk high-schoolers to the kind of geospatial technology BAE has created to help the military and intelligence agencies see information on maps.The idea, said Josh K. Weerasinghe, vice president for global market development in BAE’s intelligence and security unit, is to move students “over this hurdle from an interest to something that’s very real, that makes them look at college as really a positive alternative.“If we can get them through that [high school to college] bottleneck ... we hope that we can then be more successful in getting them out of the college pipeline into industry,” he said.
Kids in the classroom
Sterling-based Neustar, which manages the phone number and Internet address databases that help route telecommunications traffic worldwide, devotes all of its giving to STEM programs. Instead of spreading money “all over the landscape in amounts that really would not be a big impact, we decided to focus all of our charitable giving only on STEM and to really, really push it hard,” said president and chief executive Lisa A. Hook, who declined to disclose the amount.Neustar is focusing some of its efforts on what’s happening in the classroom, establishing a digital literacy program that is now in public and private schools in Virginia and Kentucky.Neustar pays for the program while District-basec education technology company EverFi trains teachers on how to teach it and tracks how many students complete the work.The curriculum covers a range of topics for teens interested in the Internet, from how to create a blog to how to evaluate online research sources, as well as privacy and security issues.Northrop Grumman, too, has tried to improve in-school curriculums, including starting Eco Classroom, a program that sends teachers to Costa Rica for two weeks in the field collecting biodiversity and climate data.The program, which was announced in January and last week named its inaugural class of 16 teachers, including four from Anne Arundel County, is meant to inspire teachers and provide an experience they can use to excite their own students in the classroom.
Paying for school
Not all STEM initiatives begin and end at the K-12 level. When McLean-based Iridium — along with other company partners — launched its first satellite network in the late 1990s, Matthew J. Desch, now chief executive, recalls that the sophistication of the technology was a motivator within the industry.“This was transformative in their careers, it was an inspiration to them,” he said of the program’s employees. As Iridium prepares to launch its next network of satellites, the company is hoping to recapture that excitement, establishing — along with partners such as SpaceX, Orbital Sciences and Lockheed Martin — a $250,000 endowment meant to support young aerospace engineers and distribute awards to undergraduates beginning in the 2012-2013 academic year.While there’s always the possibility some recipients might become Iridium employees, Desch said the program is targeted at broadly improving the industry’s pool. Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin has given more than $1.1 million in grants to organizations that provide STEM-related scholarships over the past two years, said Emily Simone, director of the company’s global community outreach. Lockheed annually gives about $13 million to STEM initiatives, she said.Some of the grants go to elementary, middle and high schools that need funding for curriculum or robotics programs, while some of it goes to colleges to provide scholarships for their students, said Simone.“We want to make sure that if a youth is interested in STEM that a lack of resources doesn’t get in the way,” she added.
Trying to hire
For companies with bottom lines and shareholders to worry about, long-term STEM initiatives can prove daunting. Even programs that successfully drive more students into math and science won’t necessarily provide direct return on investment to any given company.Some firms are mixing long-term approaches with nearer-term ones. Neustar, for instance, has a program meant to get low-income young adults into technology education, through which it last year hired two of five interns, according to Hook.“Frankly, it’s very selfish,” Hook said of the company’s investment in STEM. “We’re a company that is constantly searching for qualified candidates, and we know ... the [U.S.] education system as it is now is not going to graduate enough people to fill the kind of jobs that we have,” she said.Companies have to take the long view, she added.McLean-based Science Applications International Corp. has an internship program that attracts roughly 300 college students each summer. More than one-third become permanent employees. “When we hire interns, we’re not looking for summer hires, we’re not looking for temporary bodies to fill jobs,” said Amy E. Alving, SAIC’s chief technology officer.The company set up its internship program four to five years ago, said Alving, several years before it set up STEM initiatives geared at students in elementary, middle and high schools.The older students provide “the nearer-term business impact,” she said. But “both for good citizenship reasons and for self-interest, it’s important that there be a pool of students behind those college students.”
Measuring results
According to Brown, corporate-level interest in STEM remains a relatively new — less than a decade old — trend, meaning that it’s too soon to judge how successful the efforts have been.“The jury is still out on what works,” Brown said. “You have data on cohorts of 20 or 100 students, but it’s really sparse when you start talking about larger-scale innovations.”Still, at Chantilly High School, engineering teacher Marty Rothwell, who sponsors the school’s robotics club, said he sees club members’ experiences influence their college and career choices. One female student called her father from a robotics tournament to tell him she had found what she wanted to do, Rothwell recalled. He said she later went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“You come into the club, and you find your niche,” Rothwell said. “You might find that you like programming, or you might find that you like mechanical or you might find that you like electrical” engineering.Brown acknowledged companies accustomed to demanding return on investment can be frustrated by the difficulty in tracking STEM success. But as spending continues to increase and time goes by, he said he expects more data to be available and more companies to look to proven programs.“The pressure is now on showing results,” Brown said. “The philanthropy’s going to follow the results.”

Earthquake-damaged Washington Monument may be closed into 2014
View Photo Gallery — Washington Monument closed: A look at the damage to the landmark. By Michael E. Ruane, E-mail the writer
Repairs that could keep the earthquake-damaged Washington Monument closed into 2014 will require the exterior and part of the interior of the 555-foot structure to be shrouded in scaffolding, the National Park Service has announced.
The estimated $15 million project will necessitate the temporary removal of part of the granite plaza surrounding the monument, and the bracing of huge stone slabs that now rest on cracked supports near the structure’s top.

In this footage from the National Park Service, tourists run down the steps of the Washington Monument as debris falls from the ceiling the moment the earthquake hits. (No audio) Graphic
Monumental damage Robert A. Vogel, superintendent of the Park Service’s National Mall and Memorial Parks, said the project also may require the temporary removal of some of the plaza’s flagpoles and benches.The marble and granite monument was extensively damaged by the 5.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the area last Aug. 23.The structure, especially near the top, sustained cracks and loosened pieces of stone and mortar during the earthquake.The monument, which is entered by about 600,000 visitors a year, has been closed since the quake struck. Officials had said it might be closed until next year, but they now say the complex work could stretch into 2014, “which is frustrating,” Vogel said.He added that he was hoping there might be a construction cam so people could at least see what was going on during the work. Repairs should be underway by fall.“It’s a pretty big project,” he said. “Just putting up the scaffolding is a huge undertaking and challenge for us.”Tourism officials said Monday that visitors have been disappointed that the monument is closed, but that does not seem to have affected visits to the city.A spokeswoman for Destination DC, the city’s official tourism corporation, said it was hard to measure such impact.“D.C. is rich in stirring experiences and national monuments,” she said. “And we’re grateful that people are able to go up to the top of the old Post Office Building” for good views of the city.“Nothing beats the view of the Washington Monument,” she said.The monument repair project manager, Michael Morelli, said the Park Service issued a request for bids late last month and hopes to get proposals by July 31. Contracts should be awarded by next month.Vogel said the exterior scaffolding is required because of the difficulty of working in the confined interior of the monument. But Morelli noted that some inside scaffolding will be needed for interior work near the top.Large chunks of stone were shaken loose by the earthquake, and other unstable pieces were removed by inspectors in the weeks after to prevent debris from falling.The removed pieces were saved, Morelli said, and engineers hope to fasten them back into place with stainless steel dowels.Where stone is missing, a patch called a “dutchman” can be cut from extra monument stone the Park Service has in storage or from a quarry that has previously provided stone, Morelli said.He said no stones need to be replaced, but about 50 patches will be required.He said eight to 10 feet of the granite plaza pavers around the monument probably would have to be removed to pour the foundation for the scaffolding. The pavers would be saved and reset after the repairs are finished.The scaffolding will be much like that used when the monument’s exterior was refurbished 12 years ago, Morelli said.He added that the Park Service would like to have the same kind of decorative fabric that was designed by an architect for the scaffolding 12 years ago, if the agency can afford it.He said the repairs also will include the installation of 31 metal brackets to better fasten some of the exterior slabs on the monument’s pyramidal top. Some of the stone lips, or “rib tips,” on which the slabs rest were cracked by the quake, and the slabs need to be more securely attached.“Even though that panel’s on an angle, if you got another shake or something, you wouldn’t want that falling out and then falling down 500 feet to the ground,” Morelli said.“Those stone panels weigh about 2,000 pounds,” he said. “You’d hate to see even a part of one fall out and start heading to the ground.” He said the Park Service has a highly detailed assessment of the repairs that are needed: “Where every crack was found, what the damage was, what kind of crack it is.”“It’s pretty intricate,” he said. “That’s what took us so long.”The project will create a large construction site, with a crane probably required to install the scaffolding and an access road built to the monument from a staging area next to the Sylvan Theater, off Independence Avenue SW.The project is being funded by the government and by a $7.5 million donation from local businessman and philanthropist David M. Rubenstein.“It’s certainly a unique structure,” Morelli said. “It’s like the Statue of Liberty, a one of a kind thing. You’ve got to go see these at least once in your life.”

Indiana man accused of teaching people to beat lie detector tests faces prison time
By Matt Zapotosky, E-mail the writer
In the eyes of federal prosecutors in Virginia, Chad Dixon is a brazen criminal whose misdeeds threatened border security, state secrets and young children across America. They say he taught convicted sex offenders and aspiring federal law enforcement officers how to cheat their court- or job-imposed lie detector tests — even when he knew that they planned to use his advice for nefarious purposes.
In the eyes of his supporters, though, Dixon is no more than an electrical worker who did some Internet research on polygraph testing. And for offering instructions sometimes as simple as “relax and breathe normally,” he probably will end up in federal prison. More crime and safety newsPolice: 3 Alexandria slayings appear to be connected
Matt Zapotosky and Justin Jouvenal Bullets used to kill Ruthanne Lodato are similar to those used in slayings of two other residents, police said.

Dixon, 34, of Indiana, pleaded guilty in December to wire fraud and obstruction of an agency proceeding and is scheduled to be sentenced Friday in federal district court in Alexandria. He is accused of teaching what prosecutors term “polygraph countermeasures” to as many as 100 people across the country — among them convicted sex offenders in the Washington area and undercover agents who told Dixon that they would use his techniques to cheat their tests for Customs and Border Protection jobs. The case has reenergized a national debate on the accuracy of polygraph testing and led to some speculation that federal authorities intend to prosecute those spreading information on how to trick lie detectors. The McClatchy news organization reported last month that Dixon’s case was part of a broader federal effort to discourage possible criminals and spies from getting government jobs using polygraph countermeasures. Although Dixon appears to be the first charged publicly, others offering similar instruction say they fear they might be next. “I’ve been worried about that, and the more this comes about, the more worried I am,” said Doug Williams, a former police polygraphist in Oklahoma who claims to be able to teach people to beat what he now considers a “scam” test.In court filings, prosecutors said Dixon developed his polygraph countermeasures largely based on materials he took from Williams’s Web site. Williams — who declined to comment on Dixon’s case specifically — has written books and appeared on national television programs criticizing lie detectors and telling people how to beat them. Teaching about the flaws of polygraph testing is not inherently illegal. The test monitors a variety of physical responses — such as breathing and heart rate — and Williams and others preach that you can manipulate it by artificially provoking a physical reaction when you’re supposed to and keeping your reactions in check when you’re not. Whether the measures are effective is a matter of debate. Barry Cushman, president of the American Polygraph Association, said hands-on training, with feedback, on countermeasures has been shown to work sometimes in laboratory settings. But mere instruction, video or written, is unlikely to succeed, he said. Dixon was charged after he helped undercover agents learn to cheat the test after they told him specifically that they intended to lie as they applied for federal jobs. Nina J. Ginsberg, Dixon’s attorney, wrote in court filings that much of what Dixon did was legal and that prosecutors were using “hyperbole” in describing his crimes.“While understandably unpopular with law enforcement and other government agencies, polygraph countermeasures training is widely available and unless the person providing the training knows that the countermeasures training will be used to commit a criminal offense . . . it is protected First Amendment speech,” Ginsberg wrote. “Like it or not, providing polygraph countermeasures training, even to the most despicable among us, is not a crime.”Dixon declined to comment for this article. According to prosecutors, Dixon charged his customers $1,000 a day or more for hands-on training, advertising on his “Polygraph Consultants of America” Web site that he could help people appear to be truthful on a test, then traveling across the country to meet those interested in his services. Among his 69 to 100 clients from late 2010 to April 2012, prosecutors said, were unqualified applicants for federal law enforcement jobs and convicted sex offenders — including a former English teacher at a middle school in Rockville who was convicted of sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy and had to take polygraph tests as a condition of his parole. Perhaps the most outlandish examples of Dixon’s training, though, came when undercover federal agents approached him for his services in late 2011 and early 2012. When one agent posing as a Customs and Border Protection applicant told Dixon his brother was a member of the Zetas drug cartel involved in “drugs, extortion, murder [and] kidnappings” — and that he routinely let his brother use his identification — Dixon told him to reference the man only as a “distant relative” and say, “Look, I don’t really know what he’s into,” prosecutors wrote. Ginsberg wrote in court filings that Dixon trained only between 50 and 70 people and that most of them were preparing for marital fidelity polygraphs. She estimated that there are at least 30 others offering services similar to Dixon’s and that none of them have been charged. “Mr. Dixon has done nothing that warrants the government’s attempts to make him the poster child for its newly undertaken campaign to wipe out polygraph countermeasures training,” she wrote. George Maschke, whose Web site AntiPolygraph.org offers similar information on the flaws of polygraph testing but does not offer hands-on training, said he was troubled by Dixon’s case. “It seems to me that they’re going after critics of the polygraph and then fabricating a crime to prosecute where there had been no crime to prosecute before,” Maschke said. “Free speech is important, and I don't think explaining to people how the polygraph works, including its vulnerability to countermeasures, should be criminalized.”Dixon, a father of four, wrote in a letter to the judge that he was “disgusted” with himself and that he did not realize initially that what he was doing was criminal. He wrote that some of his “countermeasures” were as simple as “to relax and breathe normally on relevant questions.”“I was so dead set in my mind that this machine was bogus and I think this mind set made me feel that what I was doing wasn’t illegal and wasn’t that bad,” he wrote. Prosecutors have asked that Dixon serve between 21 and 27 months in prison, though preferably at the “low end” of the range. His sentencing is scheduled for 9 a.m. Friday.

In Senate race, Northern Virginia seniors look beyond Medicare, Social Security
(Tracy A. Woodward/ The Washington Post ) - Carl Hemmer, center, asks George Allen a question regarding health care, abortion and contraception on Tuesday, October 9th, 2012.
CAPTION
By Ben Pershing, E-mail the writer
For most campaigns, the equation is simple: Seniors care about Medicare and Social Security — and often vote — so candidates vow loudly and frequently to protect the programs.
But for U.S. Senate contenders Timothy M. Kaine (D) and George Allen (R), this year’s election is a bit more complicated, as they learned while courting older Virginia voters last week.

The former governors say they will safeguard Medicare and Social Security but have starkly different plans for doing so. And while seniors are concerned about entitlements, many appeared to care as much or more about other issues.Just talk to the residents of Ashby Ponds, a retirement community in Ashburn. That’s what Allen did last week.Republicans in the audience asked about President Obama’s executive orders, Iran’s nuclear weapons program and the possibility that the Senate might grant taxing power to the United Nations. Democrats pointedly asked Allen about the consequences of repealing health-care reform and his support for “personhood” legislation, which would define life as beginning at conception.Although Allen discussed Medicare and Social Security in his opening remarks, no one in the crowd asked him for his views on the programs, and retired teacher Faye Barondes had a good idea why.“This is a very successful community,” said Barondes, 91, referring to Ashby Ponds. “People are not in the sort of worrying mode about how they’re going to cover their expenses as they would be in some other senior facilities.”Emmett Dunsmore, 80, a retired pharmaceutical company employee, agreed that fellow residents were not particularly anxious about the entitlement programs.“I think that’s because probably those top issues in the country kind of overwhelm Medicare and Social Security,” he said.That dynamic changes in other Northern Virginia communities, as Kaine found out when he addressed a gathering at a Fairfax County community center convened by Social Security Works, a coalition of unions and liberal groups that advocate for the program.There, nearly every question was about the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. Some were quite detailed, including one query about a proposal to close Social Security offices early on Wednesdays.Kaine said that focus, and such talk throughout this campaign season, was a “virtue.”“I bet we will talk more about Medicare in 2012 than in any year since [President Lyndon B. Johnson] signed Medicare into law,” Kaine said.In a Washington Post poll in Virginia last month, only 1 percent of voters — and just 1 percent of those 65 and older — named Medicare as the most important issue in the Senate race. Less than 1 percent picked Social Security. (Kaine and Allen were essentially tied among senior voters in the poll.)But campaign operatives believe entitlement issues are more potent than polls suggest. Kaine released an ad last month critical of Allen for his Medicare and Social Security positions, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ran a similar spot. Allen’s camp called the committee's ad “tired and failed scare tactics” from the “Washington playbook.”Kaine has attacked Allen on multiple fronts, including his vote as a U.S. senator in 2006 for a plan that would have partially privatized Social Security and for broadly praising the House budget blueprints of Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), the Republican vice-presidential nominee, which included plans to convert all or part of Medicare into a voucher program.Allen has refused to take a specific position on Ryan’s Medicare plan, although he supports converting Medicaid, which many lower-income seniors rely on, to a block grant program that would be administered by states and could lead to a reduction of benefits.In turn, Allen has repeatedly assailed Kaine for supporting Obama’s health-care law, which Republicans frequently charge would take more than $700 billion from Medicare. Democrats and some fact-checkers call the allegation misleading, saying the law would reduce future spending on Medicare to offset costs while extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.At their debate in Richmond last week, sponsored by AARP and the League of Women Voters, Allen said he would consider gradually raising the Social Security retirement age and possibly means-testing the program. “For those who are millionaires, they don’t need to have all the same benefits as those of lower income,” Allen said.Kaine said at the debate that he would protect Social Security “to my last breath,” although at the Fairfax event he said there should be “appropriate adjustments over time” to ensure the program is financially stable.Bob Young, 77, a Democrat and Kaine supporter, said he thought many of his fellow Fairfax seniors, like those in Ashburn, were “pretty well-off” and not solely focused on entitlements.“I think they’re also worried about a whole range of issues — from foreign policy to tax policy,” Young said. “They’re not just concerned about Social Security and Medicare.”
