Obama’s dubious claim of leadership in Libya
By Jackson Diehl
Barack Obama has been frequently accused in recent of weeks of backing away from the traditional U.S. role of leadership in the Libyan crisis. So it was striking that in his first speech to explain the military intervention--nine days after it began--the president went out of his way to describe himself as fronting the charge against Moammar Gaddafi.
Obama began his address by saying he meant “to update the American people on the international effort that we have led in Libya” — a phrase that may have caused a few people in Paris to spit out their chablis. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, after all, has been widely portrayed as the prime author of the Libyan intervention--and may be banking his reelection campaign on it.
Obama then offered a chronology that went like this: “Gaddafi began attacking his people....so we evacuated our embassy and all Americans who sought our assistance. We then took a series of swift steps in a matter of days to answer Gaddafi’s aggression.” Assets were frozen, a first UN resolution was passed, and “I made it clear that Gaddafi...needed to step down from power.”
Next, according to Obama, “at my direction, America led an effort with our allies at the United Nations Security Council to pass an historic resolution” to impose a no-fly zone and authorize attacks on Gaddafi’s ground forces. When the regime’s forces then threatened to overrun Benghazi, Obama said, “I refused to let that happen...We struck the regime forces approaching Benghazi to save that city and the people within it.”
Judging from all the “Is” in that account, Obama played the part that the world usually expects from the U.S. president: a “leader of the free world” who “makes clear” that there is a threat; “refuses” to accept inaction; and rallies a coalition to respond. Only that, by all accounts, is not what has happened on Libya. It was not Obama who first condemned Gaddafi’s attacks on his people, and said he must go. That was Sarkozy. Obama was one of the last to speak up---after Britian’s David Cameron, after Germany’s Angela Merkel, after even Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. The president’s aides explained his silence by saying he was concerned about evacuating US citizens from Libya--but that did not deter the European leaders, some of whom had even more nationals in the country.
Obama also did not initiate the “historic” Security Council resolution he took credit for. That again was Sarkozy, accompanied by Cameron. France and Britain began circulating the no-fly resolution more than a week before Obama came around to supporting it. The administration was publicly skeptical about an intervention; just three days before the resolution passed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with a Libyan opposition leader in Paris but declined to promise any U.S. support.
In fact the administration was torn by internal debates over whether to stop Gaddafi’s offensive. When Obama finally decided in favor of intervention, the dictator’s tanks were on the edge of Benghazi--and it was French warplanes who carried out the first strikes against them.
U.S. forces subsequently have played a decisive role in driving back Gaddafi’s tanks and artillery and destroying his air defenses--and Obama deserves credit for committing them to the fight. But the record of the last few weeks seems pretty clear: Obama did not lead the way into Libya. He was dragged into it through a combination of pressure from allies--beginning with France--and concern about a looming massacre in Benghazi for which the United States would be blamed. As he said in his speech, “the United States has not acted alone.” But it also has not led.

D.C. insurance regulators take over Chartered Health Plan
By Mike DeBonis, E-mail the writer
District insurance regulators have taken control of Chartered Health Plan, the city’s largest manager of health care for low-income residents, amid questions about “irregularities” in its finances.
The takeover is the latest setback for its owner, embattled businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson, who has been implicated in funding a $650,000 “shadow campaign” to elect Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D).

The Debate Watcher
DISTRICT OF DEBONIS | An ongoing feature reviewing D.C. mayoral candidate forums ahead of the election. Read more
Chartered’s board of directors voted Tuesday to support the deal under pressure from city officials, and a D.C. Superior Court judge signed off Friday. District insurance commissioner William P. White is now in charge of Chartered and will seek a buyer for the company, which serves about 110,000 Medicaid-eligible city residents.“This is something that was necessary to do,” White said.Chartered attorney A. Scott Bolden said the decision to enter receivership is “in the best interests of the company” and represents a “rebuilding chapter” for the plan. “Operations will continue,” he said.Thompson has been sole owner of Chartered since 2000 and will remain so while the company is under receivership. Under his control, the firm became the dominant insurer of city residents enrolled in government-subsidized health programs. In 2011 alone the company did $355 million in business with the city.But the company, wholly reliant on city contracts for its business, has found itself under increasing scrutiny in recent years, starting with a 2008 audit that resulted in a $12 million settlement with the District’s attorney general. More recently, the firm has been under a microscope since Thompson was targeted in March raids by federal agents investigating campaign finance violations. He stepped down from the board of directors in April.White said the department had been watching Chartered for the past six months, after its financial positions had “fallen below certain regulatory standards.” More recently, company representatives alerted the District’s Department of Health Care Finance to “irregularities” identified in the company’s books by its independent auditor.Wayne Turnage, the city’s health care finance director, said he was told earlier this month about “unsourced receivables and a transfer of cash out of the company,” prompting him not to extend Chartered’s contract through April, when it is set to expire.Turnage and White declined to discuss the scale of the financial irregularities, citing the ongoing audit. In a statement, the insurance department said it anticipates “certain negative adjustments to capital and surplus” once the audit is complete; White would not say when that might be. Neither official said they had dealt personally with Thompson on the takeover or knew of his whereabouts.Two other D.C. officials with knowledge of the matter said the amount in question stretches into the “low seven figures.”Had the city not moved to take over the company, Chartered’s beneficiaries would have been moved on to other managed-care plans within 30 days, Turnage said. Putting the company into receivership will allow the city to continue paying Chartered until May. By that time, the city expects to have completed a solicitation for new five-year contracts.Currently, the city offers Medicaid-eligible residents two additional managed-care plans, subsidiaries of the UnitedHealthcare and MedStar companies. Both plans’ enrollments are significantly smaller than Chartered’s.City officials sought to assure Chartered’s members that their insurance would continue uninterrupted in the coming months.“Chartered has contracts with all of its providers,” Turnage said. “Those contracts will stand. The process for submitting, processing and paying claims have not changed. We have informed providers there is no reason they should not be paid.”White said he would name insurance attorney Daniel L. Watkins of Lawrence, Kan., to serve as receiver for the city. Watkins will be paid out of Chartered’s accounts, he said, and taxpayers bear no risk in the takeover.Both White and Bolden said they were optimistic a buyer might still be found for Chartered, which has been exploring a sale since at least April.“By taking the company into receivership . . . it’s a little bit easier to clarify their overall financial situation,” White said. “It gives them sort of a fresh start in terms of what they look like to a potential buyer.”It is clear that Thompson’s role in the company is essentially over. That could ease a sale, said Sharon Baskerville, head of the D.C. Primary Care Association and a close monitor of city health-care matters. “The issue isn’t not having a buyer,” she said, “it’s not having a buyer willing to pay what he wants.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
U.S. official says CIA has authenticated at least 13 videos showing victims of Syrian gas attack
Video: In his weekly radio and Internet address, President Barack Obama says the United States "cannot turn a blind eye" to the grim images out of Syria of children allegedly killed in a chemical weapons attack by the Assad government.
By David Nakamura, E-mail the writer
U.S. intelligence officials have authenticated at least 13 videos of the aftermath of an alleged Syrian gas attack showing men and children convulsing and struggling to breathe, a government official said Saturday.
The graphic videos, obtained by The Washington Post, have been made public previously on YouTube and other Internet sites. They are among as many as 100 public videos that purport to document victims of the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus.
EDITOR's NOTE: CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT. This video was shown to Members of Congress in a classified briefing along with other footage on a DVD obtained by the Washington Post. (Youtube/SHAMSNN)
Graphic
Lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria. The Central Intelligence Agency has confirmed these 13 videos as authentic, said the government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the materials. At the request of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the images were shown to senators on Thursday during a classified briefing that was part of congressional deliberations over whether to authorize President Obama to pursue limited military strikes against Syrian government targets. A growing number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are objecting to such strikes, but administration officials and their congressional allies believe that the horrific scenes depicted in the videos could help sway public opinion. The administration has said at least 1,429 people, including 426 children, were killed in the alleged chemical attack. The videos, shot in several different locations, show shirtless men squirming and convulsing on the floor, as well as young boys and girls having difficulty breathing. In some cases, medics have placed oxygen masks over their mouths. Some show doctors looking into the glazed eyes of the victims, and in at least one case a man appears to be foaming at the mouth. The CIA’s authentication of the 13 videos was first reported by CNN.After the private Senate meeting Thursday, Feinstein told reporters: “I have asked the CIA to prepare a DVD which would have specific instances of evidence. . . . I saw it this morning and it was hideous.”Later Saturday, Feinstein posted the videos to her Web site, with a disclaimer warning viewer discretion.The videos were filmed by Syrians who support the rebel forces that have waged an extended campaign against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s authoritarian regime. The videos do not make clear who used the chemical weapons. The Obama administration has said it has confirmed, through additional intelligence, including intercepted communications, witness accounts, photographs, news reports and other evidence, that the Assad regime is responsible. A U.N. inspection team, which was in Syria on the day of the attack to investigate another reported incident, has gathered evidence on the Aug. 21 incident and is expected to present a report on its findings later this month. But that report will only make a determination of whether chemical agents were used — not of who is responsible.In making the case for limited U.S. military strikes — which likely would involve cruise missile attacks on Syrian government targets, but no U.S. troops on the ground inside the country — Obama has repeatedly cited the deaths of the children to make an emotional appeal. “I want people to understand that gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children, is not something we do,” Obama said during a news conference Friday in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he was attending an economic summit. “It’s prohibited in active wars between countries. We certainly don’t do it against kids. And we’ve got to stand up for that principle.”Obama will deliver a nationally televised address Tuesday at the White House, and he will discuss the situation in interviews with six television networks on Monday.

U.N.: Syria’s humanitarian crisis is ‘dramatic beyond description’
View Photo Gallery — Syria uprising nears 2-year anniversary: An estimated 70,000 lives have been lost in uprising that started with protests in March 2011. By Karen DeYoung, E-mail the writer
The United Nations official responsible for aiding Syrian refugees painted his bleakest picture to date Tuesday, describing a humanitarian crisis that is “dramatic beyond description” and a country and people so destroyed that they could take years to recover under the best of circumstances.
In addition to 3.6 million people internally displaced by Syria’s civil war, registered refugees in the four neighboring countries now total 1.1 million, compared with just 33,000 last April, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in congressional testimony. At least half a million more who have fled Syria are unregistered, he said.

By the end of this year, Guterres said, his organization expects 1 million refugees each in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, a situation that will have “an unimaginable impact on the economy, the society and the security of these countries.”Guterres’s remarks came on a day when signs of restlessness surfaced in Washington over the two-year-old stalemate in Syria’s civil war, which has killed more than 70,000 people. Influential senators suggested a possible no-fly zone in northern Syria and proposed stepped-up U.S. training for rebel forces.Guterres said that, despite significant international aid both promised and delivered, the money is far short of what’s needed. “UNHCR and its partners have received less than 30 percent of the funding we need to assist the current number of refugees, let alone those who are yet to come,” he said. “There is no way a gap of this magnitude can be filled with existing humanitarian budgets.”State Department officials presented a similar portrait at the hearing, held by a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The United States has contributed $385 million in humanitarian aid to Syria and about $110 million in nonlethal support to opposition groups.The witnesses deflected questions calling for assessments of the opposition and opinions on whether the Obama administration should intervene with arms shipments to the rebels or with air power.In remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said President Obama’s goal of organizing a political alternative to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is the right objective. But he suggested the need for possible additional action.“I would go somewhat further than the president,” Levin said. “I would, for instance, help Turkey, if they’re willing — and I think they are — to establish a protected zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. . . . [I] would go after some Syrian air defenses and after some of the Syrian air power.”At a separate hearing held by Levin’s committee Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) asked NATO’s military chief, Adm. James G. Stavridis, whether it is time for the United States to “help the Syrian opposition in ways that would break what is a prolonged civil war.”“My personal opinion,” Stavridis said, “is that would be helpful in breaking the deadlock and bringing down the Assad regime.”But there is no consensus. On Monday, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed the role of military action during a talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I don’t see a military option that would create an understandable outcome, and until I do, my advice would be to proceed cautiously,” he said.The Obama administration has said it fears that sophisticated weapons sent to the rebels might fall into the hands of Islamic extremists fighting on their side. While some senior officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have noted major improvements in opposition organization, Dempsey said he does not see it.“About six months ago, we had a very opaque understanding of the opposition, and now I would say it’s even more opaque,” he said.At a news conference Tuesday, Sens. Robert P. Casey (D-Pa.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced legislation authorizing the president to provide special-operations training to vetted members of the opposition Free Syrian Army. The bill also would authorize Obama to provide nonlethal equipment and training to deal with chemical weapons and “to improve [rebels’] ability to conduct operations and provide security for convoys of humanitarian assistance inside Syria.”Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation in the House on Monday that would authorize Obama to provide the rebels with “lethal equipment.”

Is our system broken?
Has our 234-year experiment with democracy failed in a fit of partisanship? William Eggers and John O'Leary revisit major U.S. government initiatives since World War II to assess what it takes to get things done.
