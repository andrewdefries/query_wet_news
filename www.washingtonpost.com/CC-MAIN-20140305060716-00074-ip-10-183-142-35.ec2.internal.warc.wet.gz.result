Nicklas Backstrom cleared for full participation in practice
By Katie Carrera
Updated 12:11 p.m.: After missing 37 games and nearly three months with a concussion, Nicklas Backstrom took a big step forward in his recovery on Saturday morning. The Capitals’ star center has been cleared for full participation in practice with no restrictions and Backstrom was on the ice with a dozen teammates for an optional practice at KCI this morning. This session marks the first time he has taken full part in an on-ice workout with his teammates since Jan. 6 in San Jose. “I’ve been looking forward to this for 2 and 1/2 months,” said a grinning Backstrom after the workout. “I’m kind of happy right now. It’s good to practice with the guys; feels pretty good out there. I haven’t been skating long but it feels alright right now.”
Backstrom has been symptom free since he began skating on March 13 and the center has been on the ice for 10 of the past 11 days. Now that he has been cleared for practice, the 24-year-old Swede must work his way back into game shape without suffering any setbacks and then undergo neuropsychological testing according to the Capitals’ head athletic trainer Greg Smith.
Once Backstrom passes that test, the results of which will be compared to his baseline level that was established during training camp, he will need to be cleared by team physicians before getting back into a game.
It’s tough to gauge exactly how much time Backstrom might need regain his playing shape, so there remains no timetable for when he could return to the lineup.
“It’s kind of like it feels like youre back in training camp. It takes a little time, it feels good,” Backstrom said. “Give me a couple more practices – I don’t know how long -- we’ll see but I can tell it feels good and see what happens.” Backstrom reiterated that he must continue to be cautious with his recovery.
“I want to be back as soon as possible but you’ve gotta be careful and make sure you’re 100 percent before you go back,” Backstrom said. “You don’t want to get any setbacks and that’s what we’re looking forward to. I’m hoping I can be back as soon as possible, that’s my goal.” Backstrom suffered the concussion on Jan. 3 when he was elbowed in the head by then-Calgary forward Rene Bourque. Despite his lengthy absence, though, Backstrom remains fourth on the team in points with 42 (13 goals, 29 assists).

Jayson Werth on Washington as a sports town
By Dan Steinberg
(AP Photo.)
John Feinstein had Jayson Werth on his SiriusXM Mad Dog Radio show Friday afternoon, and Feinstein brought his D.C.-ness to bear on the interview. He told Werth that he was at Nats Park last season for games when Werth would have two hits and a nice defensive play, and yet would still get booed for striking out in his third at-bat.
And this made Werth reflect on the nature of Washington as a sports town.
“You know, I got booed in Philly too when I was playing good; it’s just part of the game,” Werth said. “And actually, Washington’s a pretty interesting place. Because I think you’ve got a really good sports town: They love the Redskins. The hockey team’s playing great and they’ve got a good following. And I think if we get going and start winning games, we’ll have a good following as well.
(Toni L. Sandys - THE WASHINGTON POST)
“But you’ve got a lot of people from all over the country, all over the world that live here, and so they have their own teams. And so every night they show up to support their teams, whether it’s us or where they’re from. So you get a lot of fans for other teams. So I think [that] didn’t bother them at all, booing me as well. It’s just how it is.”
Then Feinstein asked Werth if he was disappointed by the early-season attendance numbers, considering his team’s outlandishly excellent record.
“These things take time,” Werth said. “I think the attendance will come as the season goes on and the city starts to appreciate the team and the guys. I think we’re going in the right direction. I think that’ll all happen in due time.”
Feinstein also asked Werth if he can tell yet how good this Nats team actually is.
“It’s probably too early to tell, but I can tell you that the direction of the club and the organization has done a total 180,” he said. “And I can foresee a winning ballclub here in Washington for a long time. . . . I think we’re a good club, and we’re capable of playing like this for extended periods of time. And I think you’ll see it more and more as the season goes on.”
And in one final interesting quote, Feinstein’s partner Bruce Murray asked Werth if this was what he imagined when he decided to sign in D.C.
“You know, it goes back further than that probably,” Werth said. “When I started the whole process of free agency, I hired Scott [Boras], and you start taking a look at the landscape of free agency. And all along, Scott was saying that Washington is set up the right way. He would go into telling me how good the minor league system is, and in fact told me it’s the best minor league system. “And I went back and checked, and I said, ‘Well you know, Scott, Baseball America has Washington ranked like 18 or something like that.’ And he said I promise you, they’re the number one, and I think the next year they turned out to be the best-ranked minor league system in baseball, so he was right all along. And that was definitely part of the decision. And the future of this organization — with what Mr. Ted Lerner and Mark Lerner and Mike Rizzo laid out before me — this is the direction of the organization.” By	Dan Steinberg

White House threatens to veto defense bill over detainee rules
By Peter Finn, E-mail the writer
The White House on Thursday threatened to veto the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act because a series of the bill’s provisions would mandate military custody for some terrorism suspects and prevent the administration from transferring detainees out of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
“Any bill that challenges or constrains the President’s critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the Nation would prompt the President’s senior advisers to recommend a veto,” the White House said in a statement. The language on detention, which has divided Democrats on Capitol Hill, sets up a clash between Congress and the White House over a measure that would authorize $526 billion for the Defense Department budget.The human rights community welcomed the veto threat. “The bill tosses out the most effective tool for countering terrorism — civilian law enforcement — and makes the U.S. military the world’s jailor,” said Andrea Prasow, senior counterterrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch. The administration argued that some of the measures Congress proposed could upend the law that has emerged over the past decade regarding whom the government can detain. “The Administration strongly objects to the military custody provision,” the White House said, noting that it could apply to people in the United States. That “would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets.” The latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act left the Senate Armed Services Committee this week with amended detention provisions after the White House objected to the original version. But the measure continued to draw criticism from the White House and leading Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif), the chairman of the intelligence committee, and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the panel’s ranking Republican, said the measure would preserve the administration’s ability to make different detention choices. And they urged the White House to back their efforts. Reprints
