Five Hokies accept invitations to NFL Scouting Combine
By Mark Giannotto
Virginia Tech’s worst season in 20 years doesn’t appear to have had an effect on the NFL prospects for some of its top seniors. Five draft-eligible Hokies indicated on Twitter this week that they have been invited to participate in the NFL scouting combine next month. Linebacker Bruce Taylor, wide receivers Marcus Davis and Corey Fuller, and tackles Vinston Painter and Nick Becton have all accepted early invitations to be a part of the NFL’s annual week-long showcase for potential draft picks in Indianapolis.
The NFL only invites players who have a chance to be drafted, which is a good sign for these five Hokies.
Despite earning some negative attention because of his blocking, Davis was just nine yards shy of breaking Virginia Tech’s school record for single-season receiving yards this season, ending the year with 51 catches for 953 yards. Fuller, meanwhile, emerged from his brothers’ shadows this season and his speed has increasingly intrigued NFL scouts. He had 43 catches for 815 yards. According to CBSports.com, Davis and Fuller are the No. 25 and No. 28 wide receiver prospects in this year’s field and could be sixth- or seventh-round selections.
Taylor, an inside linebacker, finished with 76 tackles and a team-high 5.5 sacks after returning from a Lisfranc injury to his foot that limited him to eight games as a junior. He is projected as a late-round draft pick.
Becton and Painter were the only two offensive linemen to start every game for Virginia Tech this season. Both have the physical attributes that should entice NFL front office personnel – Becton, a left tackle, is listed at 6 feet 6 and 317 pounds; Painter, a right tackle, is 6-6 and 309 pounds. Becton is the more highly rated of two, projected as a sixth-round draft choice by CBSports.com after grading out at better than 80 percent in every game this season.
Quarterback Logan Thomas, cornerback Antone Exum and defensive end James Gayle could also receive invitations to the combine should they decide to forgo their senior seasons and declare for the draft before Jan. 15. All three sat down with Coach Frank Beamer on Wednesday after receiving paperwork from the NFL draft advisory board, but none have made final decisions regarding their future.

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate One man, two performances: Mills is a tour-de-force Jekyll and Hyde
Johnny Shryock/JOHNNY SHRYOCK - Alex Mills, above with Brittany O’Grady, plays boths the male leads in Synetic Theater's “Jekyll and Hyde.”
By Peter Marks, E-mail the writer
The hardest working man in Washington doesn’t sit at a government desk on Capitol Hill or field grounders on the waterfront or whip up elegant embassy dinners on Massachusetts Avenue. No, he clocks in nightly at a theater in a forest of office buildings and pours himself, liquidly and athletically, into a role that is, in every sense of the word, a killer.
The man is Alex Mills, and if you want to be picky about it, he’s pounding his theatrical beat across the river in Crystal City, where he assays the part of a perpetual motion machine in Synetic Theater’s chillingly seductive “Jekyll and Hyde.” Another entry in the company’s popular series of movement-shows without dialogue, this “Jekyll and Hyde” brings almost as much ingenuity in design and stagecraft to the horror genre as Synetic’s water-borne “King Arthur
” did to heroic fables.

Free admission Get ideas The production’s premium level of satisfaction is traceable in major measure to its 23-year-old star, whom director Paata Tsikurishvili has given perhaps the most dominant role in any piece in Synetic’s 11-year history. Mills is onstage virtually nonstop for all 90 diabolically intense minutes of “Jekyll and Hyde.” And sometimes, through digital sleight-of-hand, he is onstage twice at the same time.When one plays a man divided against himself, just such a technological magic act seems almost de rigueur. Loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson’s 19th-century novella “Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” this adaptation by Tsikurishvili and Nathan Weinberger places in a murkily modern context the tale of the scientist named Jekyll who turns himself into a monster called Hyde. As conjured by crafty set designer Daniel Pinha, Jekyll’s lab is equipped with both plasma screens and manual typewriters, a suggestion of how ahead of his time his experiments are. And by making the source of his victims a strip club, the adapters add to the story a psychosexual whiff of Jack the Ripper.The gyrations and muscularity of Irina Tsikurishvili’s choreography heighten, as always, the tension and watchability, and help to make “Jekyll and Hyde” an infinitely more satisfying excursion into chiller theater than the company’s 2006 version of “Frankenstein,” which used dialogue and wrestled rather laboriously with the original novel’s moral questions. The Tsikurishvilis here concentrate more expressively on how to translate into physical terms the visceral elements of horror.As has become customary, too, in almost all of their spoken and wordless pieces, they use the music of their fellow Georgian and house composer, Konstantine Lortkipanidze, whose fusion style has frequently seemed a fine match for the starkness or ebullience of the Tsikurishvilis’ adaptations. On this occasion, the composer, with additional music by Gia Kancheli, reinforces the sense of a splintered identity with musical fragments and abrupt shifts in tone and rhythm.But it’s the angelic-looking Mills, whose elasticity and acrobatic talent established him at a tender age as an avatar for Synetic’s gymnastic theatricality, who holds this project together. In Chelsey Shuller’s heavy costume, designed in a mode that might be described as Victorian-hip, Mills’s Jekyll is a science nerd in a lab where the tubes and screens bubble and throb: You can tell he is splashing around dangerously in the deep end of the gene pool.Although Jekyll has a fiancee (the graceful Brittany O’Grady), his transformation into the sexually aggressive Hyde is triggered by a celebratory visit with his cigar-smoking pal Lanyon (the solid Peter Pereyra) to the strip club — for what may be the company’s first-ever number for pole dancers. There, a ponytailed stripper played with an aptly adventurous swagger by Rebecca Hausman catches the eye of gentle Jekyll and, after Jekyll injects himself with the secret formula, the sadistic Hyde.The Tsikurishvilis pull patented tricks out of their bags for the hyper-violent fight scenes. But they come up with a terrific way to dramatize the duality of Jekyll’s nature: The big TV screen in his lab is, it seems, permeable, and both of Jekyll’s selves can pass in and out of it. And, at a climactic moment, both find themselves trapped inside the screen, two consciousnesses fighting for control of one body.Mills’s romantic bearing casts Jekyll in a more sympathetic light than might be possible with a less engaging actor; his extraordinary exertions are little short of heroic. The energy he expends makes you wonder if, in fact, Synetic really is employing a pair of Alex Millses. Jekyll and Hyde

Rory McIlroy rules the U.S. Open, or at least the first 75 percent
View Photo Gallery — Third round: Rory McIlroy reamins in the lead going into Sunday’s final round By Thomas Boswell, E-mail the writer
The whole golf world has gotten ahead of itself by 24 hours. The sight is beyond scary. After his 68 on Saturday to reach 14 under par and take an eight-shot lead in the U.S. Open, Rory McIlroy was anointed. As what? Don’t know. But apparently only the 22-year-old himself has salvaged an iota of sanity in the whole crazy mob at “Lets Go Ro-ry” Congressional Country Club. He owns the place. The Open crown? Not yet.
“Until you do these things, they don’t mean anything,” McIlroy said.

2011 U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club
Others, however, are delighted to lose their minds. After all, it’s not themselves they put at risk. It’s just the gifted kid they claim to adore.“Rory has the potential to be the next Tiger Woods,” said reigning U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell, his countryman from Northern Ireland.Padraig Harrington, a multiple major championship winner, said that McIlroy could break Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championships.“Oh, Paddy, Paddy, Paddy,” said McIlroy, dismayed, putting his hands over his head and forcing his hat down over his brow when he heard those tempt-fate words.Perhaps Mr. Harrington can claim he was overserved.At his post-round news conference, McIlroy obligingly answered the question that is always ducked on Saturday night by veterans, covered with their psychic scars: What would it mean to you to win the U.S. Open? McIlroy talked about his parents’ sacrifices. I wanted to tackle him and stomp the microphone.“The standing ovations were incredible, fantastic,” McIlroy said. “I just hope I can give them something to cheer about tomorrow.” The hell with ‘em. Win it for yourself.The kid is almost certainly going to make it. He’s not the nutty one. But it may not be as easy as all the bandwagon jumpers think. Perhaps they’re so giddy because they didn’t actually follow McIlroy and see how he actually shot his 68; they just saw a score.They didn’t see his five drives into the rough or the half-dozen 12-to-15-foot birdie putts he missed, making him progressively more annoyed. He could be a dozen shots ahead by now, and he knows it. They didn’t see the three traps that caught him or the up-and-down from 90 yards he made to make to stabilize his round at the third hole.“The [par] saves at three and four were huge. They changed things immensely,” McIlroy said. “After that, I found my rhythm and played some really good golf.”Those two pars helped. But the real stabilizing shots came later. At No. 9, a 584-yard par five fronted by a vast gulch, few try to reach the green in two shots. McIlroy hit what observers at the hole called the longest drive of the day at that hole, leaving him a mere 224-yard 4-iron to the green to set up a two-putt birdie. So, 360-yard drive?Even champions need a break at the right time. McIlroy lit up when he arrived in the deep rough left of the 11th fairway. He’d just bogeyed the 10th hole — his first bogey of the Open. There before him was a miraculously lucky lie in the hay. McIlroy grabbed the chance and scalded a 188-yard 7-iron shot that blanked the flag for a 15-foot birdie.After that, he rolled to the house hitting one quality shot after another.So, here’s what we’ve got: Maybe Saturday was McIlroy’s “bad round” at this Open, the one that all champions say they have to survive on one of the four days. Congressional played so easy, with the most rounds under par (26) in any Open third round in history, that 68 actually could be the bad round for a player of McIlroy’s gifts.If McIlroy’s lead is now so big, and his confidence so bolstered by all the grit he showed Saturday, then Sunday could be one of those glorious sit-back-and-marvel days such as Woods’s win by 15 shots at Pebble Beach in 2000 or . . . or . . . Secretariat at the Belmont?On the other hand — don’t you hate that “other hand,” the one that the Black Spot always seems to be in — McIlroy’s game and nerves are showing some cracks, such as those early drives in the rough at Nos. 1, 3, 6, 8 and 11. If that’s the case, then McIlroy is going to have to recapitulate his gumption of Saturday all over again Sunday. He probably can because he sure looked classy doing it in round three. But you might want to watch.Can he lose? No one has ever squandered more than a six-shot last-round lead in a major. And they’ve been doing this stuff a long time. So, we’re talking maybe 100-to-1 against it. But it’s not off the board. The blow to golf would be significant. The strike at McIlroy’s core isn’t something gentle folk even want to consider.Many of us remember Greg Norman going from six up to five down to Nick Faldo on Sunday at the Masters. That’s an 11-shot swing in fortunes, not just eight shots. Once a full-blown crash begins, the number of strokes needed to complete the catastrophe is irrelevant. Whatever disaster is required is the one that will arrive. The world felt so awful for Norman that the president of the United States reached out to console him.The loneliness and cruelty of golf when a player has a big lead and his game and nerves suddenly desert him is the cruelest sort of solitary confinement in sports. You are trapped in the frame of a billion electronic screens around the world, and you’re not allowed to leave the stage or seek a substitute. After McIlroy’s fourth-round 80 two months ago, losing a four-shot third-round lead, you can’t deny the possibility. But that experience actually seems to have allowed McIlroy to look at such miserable experiences with a steady eye. Sometimes, “been there, done that” means never, never, ever wanting to be there again. Saturday was tough for McIlroy. And Sunday, especially the front nine, when a golf black swan might still be sighted at Congressional, may be rigorous, too. Historic rounds of golf are not born whole, nor are they some kind of inevitability, flowing from the character or talent of the athlete.Instead, they are created gradually, perilously and often agonizingly over several hours. They come into being before our eyes with key moments of crisis that become pivot points to success or disintegration.On Saturday, the prize pupil passed one test after another. But one more exam awaits him with even higher stakes. Don’t get so nervous. You only have to watch.

Lake Braddock reflects on stellar season after stunning loss to Westfield
John McDonnell/The Washington Post - Dejoun Lee, right, A.J. Alexander (24) and Lake Braddock came up just short in Saturday’s Virginia 6A North region semifinal against Westfield.

By Brandon Parker, E-mail the writer
After Jim Poythress settled into his house Saturday evening, still stung by Lake Braddock’s stunning, 19-16 loss to Westfield just hours earlier in the Virginia 6A North region semifinals, the Bruins coach turned on the television to watch the final minutes of the Iron Bowl between Alabama and Auburn.
As Auburn rallied for a fantastic finish, when Chris Davis returned a missed field goal 100 yards for the game-winning touchdown, Poythress couldn’t help but think of the missed field goal attempt in the Bruins’ loss that was returned for a score and kick-started Westfield’s comeback.

No. 7 Westfield takes down No. 3 Lake Braddock, 19-16: Westfield scores 19 unanswered points to secure comeback win in Virginia 6A North region semifinal. “I guess we weren’t the only ones who had some tough breaks on Saturday,” Poythress quipped in a Sunday phone interview.Most signs pointed to the 2013 campaign being a special one for Lake Braddock and the season featured plenty of highlights. After finding his bearings as a junior following a transfer from West Potomac, quarterback and North Carolina recruit Caleb Henderson put together an impressive senior season in tandem with junior wide receiver A.J. Alexander and tight end Ryan Antonellis. The Bruins also possessed an imposing defense that strung together five consecutive shutouts during the team’s 12-0 start.After reaching the state title game in 2009, the Bruins had fallen to either the state finalist or Northern Region champion in each of the last three years, demonstrating just how close Lake Braddock was to a breakthrough. The first 42 minutes of Saturday’s game brought more reason for optimism, with Lake Braddock up 16-0 and Westfield playing without star running back Tyler Thrasher-Walker (left knee injury).But a blocked field goal and 89-yard touchdown return by James Gibson followed by a 78-yard Westfield scoring drive in the final minute reversed the game’s course, leaving Lake Braddock just short of its championship aspirations.“We had an 8-2 team make it to the state championship and now here we are, 12-0, and we thought we had the game won,” Poythress said. “Who’s going to predict that they would block a field goal and run it back for a touchdown? They hadn’t scored on offense until the last minute and their best player is injured on the sideline, so who’s going to think they would drive 78 yards and score? All these uncharacteristic things happened. But you can’t make excuses.”With Henderson, Antonellis and 30 other seniors graduating, the Bruins will enter next season with a slew of new starters. But between the valuable experience drawn from this year’s success and the potential for others to step in just as seniors Trevor O’Brien, Vincent Sica, Lance Hammond and others elevated their play in 2013, the Bruins are confident they can draw wisdom and character lessons even in the wake of Saturday’s loss.“We had a great season; there’s no doubt about that,” Alexander said. “Of course it didn’t end the way we wanted, and there’s no true satisfaction unless you win it all. It’s a mix of emotions, where you’re sad that you won’t play with these guys anymore, but as a junior, I realize there’s another year of football left, so I’ve got to keep my head up and start focusing on what’s ahead.” Reprints
