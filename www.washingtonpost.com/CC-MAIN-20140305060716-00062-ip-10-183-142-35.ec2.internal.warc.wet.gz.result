Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Jeffrey Thompson reimbursed employees for campaign donations, his former firm says
By Mike DeBonis, E-mail the writer
A prominent District-based accounting firm said its former majority owner, Jeffrey E. Thompson, had reimbursed company employees and others for their political donations, in apparent violation of campaign finance laws.
Bazilio Cobb Associates disclosed the findings of an internal review in an unsigned statement e-mailed to news outlets Friday night. The firm did not respond to a message.

A look at the Democratic candidates’ views on some of the most pressing issues facing Washington.
The face of new voters in D.C.
Since Vincent Gray won the 2010 Democratic primary by 13,124 votes, more than 80,000 new Democrats have registered in the District. The candidates

The Debate Watcher
DISTRICT OF DEBONIS | An ongoing feature reviewing D.C. mayoral candidate forums ahead of the election. Read more
The donations spanned a decade, the statement said, and were made in the names of firm employees as well as their family members and friends, who were then reimbursed at Thompson’s direction.The statement said the firm has cooperated with federal investigators over the past 15 months and has “instituted very strict policies and controls.” The firm was known as Thompson, Cobb, Bazilio and Associates (TCBA) until July, when Thompson sold his 79 percent stake to partner Ralph B. Bazilio.“The Firm is relieved that the cloud it has been under for the past 15 months will lift soon,” the statement said.Once hailed as one of the nation’s largest minority-owned accounting and consulting firms, the company came under deep scrutiny after federal agents searched its offices in March 2012. The raid revealed authorities’ focus on Thompson, who has been a prodigious donor to local and federal candidates.In July, public relations consultant Jeanne Clarke Harris, who was not an employee of the firm but was a close associate of Thompson’s, admitted in federal court to engaging in a host of campaign finance violations with an unnamed co-conspirator — including the financing of a $653,000 unreported “shadow campaign” to benefit Democrat Vincent C. Gray’s 2010 mayoral run. Numerous people familiar with the investigation have said that unnamed person was Thompson.Thompson has not been charged, and his attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., has a policy of not commenting on pending matters.This past week, former D.C. Council member Michael A. Brown also admitted in federal court to secretly taking funds from Thompson and Harris to bankroll a failed 2007 council run.The firm’s disclosure comes two days after prosecutors charged an employee, Lee A. Calhoun of Silver Spring, with giving campaign donations in his own name when they were in fact funded by “Executive A,” whose description in court documents matches Thompson. Calhoun’s attorney, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., said Calhoun intends to plead guilty.Since 2001, Calhoun has donated nearly $100,000 in his name to dozens of campaigns and political committees, according to District, Maryland and federal campaign finance records. His wife donated tens of thousands of dollars more.Under District, Maryland and federal law, contributions made directly to candidates are limited. In the District, for instance, a mayoral candidate may take no more than $2,000 from any one individual or company.One recent campaign that has come under federal scrutiny, Vincent B. Orange’s 2011 campaign to fill a vacated at-large D.C. Council seat, received 12 donations, totaling $10,500, from TCBA employees, including several listed on the Bazilio Cobb Web site.Six additional maximum donations came from Thompson’s other major business concern, D.C. Healthcare Systems, and employees of its subsidiary D.C. Chartered Health Plan.The statement Friday night said the firm “regrets that its employees and their family members and friends were ensnared by the aggressive solicitation of campaign contributions” and said current firm leadership has taken and “will take responsibility for any actions or inactions that wittingly or unwittingly facilitated this conduct.”The firm said investigators have not alleged any link between the campaign contributions and the millions of dollars in government contracts the firm has won over the past decade, saying it secured the deals “solely upon its established reputation for doing excellent work and the quality of its bid.”William Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in the District, declined to comment.

Va. families of autistic children still waiting for coverage
View Photo Gallery — Many families in Virginia who expected insurance coverage have continued to pay out of pocket — if they can afford it — or forgo treatments they say could help their children. The General Assembly is taking another look at bills that could offer relief. By Anita Kumar, E-mail the writer
Richmond — Jennifer Tidd was more than a little relieved when she learned that Virginia planned to require insurance companies to pick up the cost of thousands of dollars in treatment for autistic children, including her then-4-year-old son, Quentin.
That was a year ago — and the money never materialized.
Virginia General Assembly: 2012 Guide
Explore the session
Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) signed a bill into law last spring mandating coverage, but Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) determined that the legislation contained imprecise language that legislators needed to correct.Since then, families who expected insurance coverage have continued to pay out of pocket — if they can afford it — or forgo treatments they say could help their children learn basic skills such as talking or walking.“I just say: ‘Why? Why would you do this to families?’ ’’ said Tidd, 46, of Reston. “Every step of this process, every single thing that has occurred, has been designed to not pay.”Despite a snag at the start of this year’s legislative session, a pair of bills are moving through the Republican-controlled General Assembly. But even if they pass, coverage is not likely until the end of the year. Dozens of parents and treatment providers, clad in red, roamed Capitol Square last week, testifying in front of committees and lobbying lawmakers.The activists blame Cuccinelli and McDonnell, who recommended the language, for the problems with the original bill; they say the officials were late to disclose a glitch over state licensing.“They are not going to get access to this benefit because of this delay — all because of the interpretation of a sentence,’’ said Judith Ursitti, director of state government affairs of Autism Speaks, a national group that has spent four years lobbying in Virginia.The legislation became part of the nation’s debate over whether to require autism coverage last year and had significant resonance in Northern Virginia, which has one of the highest autism rates in the country.Last year’s bill required health insurers to pay for specialized treatment — called applied behavioral analysis — as well as occupational, speech and other therapies for children ages 2 to 6. The maximum benefit was capped at $35,000 each year.The initiative failed for 11 straight years
until House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) backed it — even though conservatives considered the measure an unacceptable mandate that would drive up insurance costs. Vania O’Keefe said analysis costs $2,000 a month for her 6-year-old son, Sean. His weekly hour of speech, physical and occupational therapies costs $125. Not to mention doctor’s visits and lab tests. Until recently, when the O’Keefes got off a waiting list for a Medicaid waiver, they mostly paid out of pocket.“There’s a lot of talk these days about handouts,’’ said O’Keefe, 35, of Chesapeake. “That’s not what this is. We pay insurance every month. We shouldn’t have to choose between treatment and the mortgage.’’
Autism is a neurological disorder that affects one in 110 children and one in 70 boys, according to national statistics. Virginia does not keep statistics on autism, but the state Department of Education estimates that 11,700 autistic children attend school (many others are too young or not able to attend).Thirty-four states and the District have laws related to autism and insurance, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. At least 29 states require insurance coverage for autism treatment. Others require at least limited coverage.There’s no estimate on the number of Virginia families who would benefit from the law, but it affects businesses that employ more than 50 workers and are not self-insured. Virginia set aside $1 million to cover state employees.Teresa Champion, president of the Virginia Autism Project and the mother of an autistic child, said Cuccinelli and McDonnell worked quickly last year to implement far-reaching regulations for abortion clinics and could have done the same for the autism bill. “It’s horrible to stand up and see the devastation on the faces of the families,” said Champion, who lives in Springfield. State licensing Those who teach applied behavior analysis, which involves intense one-on-one training, are certified through a nationally recognized group, the Behavior Analyst Certification Board. McDonnell amended last year’s bill to require the state to license the analysts. But Cuccinelli spokeswoman Caroline Gibson said McDonnell’s amendment
, which was not reviewed until after the legislation was approved, failed to give the Board of Medicine express authority to license them. McDonnell spokesman Jeff Caldwell said the governor and the board worked to settle the issue with Cuccinelli’s office, but they decided that only a new bill would do.Kerry Dillman, a board-certified behavior analyst from Woodbridge who works with seven autistic children, said a state license is an unnecessary step. She has written and called lawmakers to get this year’s legislation passed.
‘This is not the perfect scenario’
The House last week approved a measure, sponsored by Del. Thomas A. “Tag” Greason (R-Loudoun), that directs the board to write regulations within 280 days and create a work group of industry experts. It must be voted on by the Senate, which will consider a similar measure sponsored by Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax). Greason, who also sponsored the bill last year, has been teaching parents and analysts how to become citizen lobbyists. As he addressed a few dozen of them last week, he choked up when he urged them to fight a little longer.“This is not the perfect scenario — perfect would have been we were doing this last year and you guys already had coverage,’’ he said. Last year, a coalition of conservative groups, including the Virginia Federation of Tea Party Patriots and Americans for Prosperity, lobbied against the bill and targeted Howell via recorded phone calls statewide.The Independent Insurance Agents of Virginia, Virginia Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of Independent Business and Virginia Association of Health Plans also were opposed, citing the expense of another mandate.None of the groups are fighting the legislation this year.Tidd, who has three other children, including an adult son with Asperger syndrome, said she heard about the law’s problems in November. Quentin, now 5, will soon be too old to qualify for the coverage.Quentin, who is unable to speak and gets frustrated easily, goes to school with other autistic children and visits an analyst for two hours every other week. “We passed the law,’’ Tidd said. “They had to know.’’

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Journalists threatened and harmed in Egypt's unrest
By Paul Farhi, Journalists covering the chaos in Egypt have become part of the story as dozens of reporters have been harassed, threatened, physically assaulted and arrested since Wednesday in what at least one U.S. official suggested was a broad government effort to suppress coverage of the spreading violence.
ABC News correspondent Brian Hartman reported Thursday that his car was stopped by a group of men at a checkpoint on his way from Cairo's airport to downtown. The car was driven to a compound, where the men threatened to behead him and three ABC colleagues, he reported via Twitter. The group escaped only after ABC cameraman Akram Abi-hanna, who is Lebanese, "appealed to the generous spirit of the Egyptian people, hugging and kissing an elder," Hartman wrote.
On Wednesday, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was punched about 10 times, apparently by government supporters, as he walked with his cameraman and producer into a clash between factions near Cairo's Tahrir Square."We realized there were people in the crowd who were determined to cause trouble. They decided to focus on us as a target of opportunity," Cooper said from Cairo in a phone interview, noting that he took "a couple of pretty good pops in the face."Added Cooper: "I think anyone with a camera is a target in that square."On Thursday, Cooper encountered trouble again, as a mob set upon his car and smashed a window. Neither he nor his fellow passengers were injured.The assaults come amid 11 days of protests throughout Egypt aimed at toppling the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak. The protests have become bloody in recent days as Mubarak's supporters have confronted those seeking his ouster.There have been no reports of journalists being killed in Egypt's current unrest, but several have reportedly been injured. According to an accounting compiled by ABC News, journalists working for Fox News, CNN, ABC World News and CBS News, among others, have reported facing physical threats and violence.Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the attacks on journalists and human rights workers, calling them "unacceptable under any circumstances."Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, said Thursday that some of their employees had been detained.Post photographer Linda Davidson was hit by a flying rock while covering a demonstration Wednesday in Cairo, sustaining minor injuries to her scalp. Then on Thursday she was among four Post employees arrested by military police.Davidson and Post Cairo bureau chief Leila Fadel were held for several hours before being released; they were among a group of about two dozen journalists who were arrested.Two other Post employees were held longer before being released. One is Sufian Taha, a reporting assistant who is a U.S. passport holder. The other is Mansour el-Sayed Mohammed, an Egyptian passport holder who was hired in Cairo as a driver; he has worked for foreign news organizations in Egypt for three decades.In some cases, arrest might have been a blessing. While detained, Fadel spoke with other journalists who said their arrests had saved them from pro-Mubarak mobs. Most of the reporters were arrested in downtown Cairo while trying to report about the violence, Fadel said."It appears that journalists are being targeted by the Egyptian authorities in a deliberate campaign of intimidation aimed at quashing honest, independent reporting of a transformational event," said Douglas Jehl, The Post's foreign editor. "We are relieved that Leila and Linda have been released . . . and we are alarmed at the continuing threat to the safety of our correspondents and other journalists in Cairo."Two reporters from the New York Times were held overnight and released unhurt Thursday morning, said Times Editor Bill Keller."We also had three other reporters in a car, surrounded by thugs waving knives," Keller said. "Brief but menacing, until military police directed them to safety."State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said there are "strong indications" that the attacks on foreign-aid workers and journalists have been coordinated and planned. "These do not seem to be random events," said Crowley, according to Reuters. There appears "to be an effort to disrupt the ability of journalists" to cover events.The sheer number of arrests and physical altercations involving reporters strongly suggested an organized campaign to prevent the international media from providing an accurate portrayal of the tumultuous events. TV crews said that in some cases their equipment was seized or damaged.Several reporters said they saw "spotters" scanning Cairo's high-rise buildings to identify TV crews covering the street demonstrations from the relative safety of apartment and office balconies. Crews were then questioned or arrested.Journalists working in Egypt have long faced intense scrutiny from security forces on the streets, said Lawrence Pintak, a former Middle East correspondent for CBS News and the author of the newly published book "The New Arab Journalist: Mission and Identity in a Time of Turmoil." But the spread of satellite TV among the Egyptian masses has made the Mubarak government even more hostile toward the foreign and domestic press, he said. "The regime is angry at international journalists and TV in particular," Pintak said, adding that a crackdown is "the natural outgrowth.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
With next step, Giffords has long fight ahead
By David Brown, With the expected transfer Friday of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) from a hospital in Tucson to a rehabilitation center in Houston, her treatment transitions from a heroic, high-tech fight to save her life to a long and arduous slog to help her brain rebuild itself.
The success of this second effort will depend on the extent of her brain damage (which is not yet fully determined), the skill of her therapists, personal effort and the unpredictable capacity of her brain to change.
Despite the use of terms like "miraculous" to describe Giffords's progress, numerous experts describe her survival and apparently good condition as an increasingly common outcome in brain-injured patients, thanks to aggressive surgery and meticulous care afterward.The ability of the brain to compensate for damage by at least partly rewiring itself and assigning new tasks to undamaged regions is known as "neuroplasticity." It's one of the hottest topics in biology and an important one in medicine.Because of insights from functional magnetic resonance imaging and other technologies, scientists now realize that brain reorganization after injury is far more common and extensive than previously thought. They also know that neuroplasticity depends to a great degree on experience - which is to say, what the brain is forced to do in the critical weeks and months after it is injured."There is a relationship between the amount of therapy you receive and the degree of recovery," said Maurizio Corbetta, a neurologist who runs a brain injury unit at the Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis at Washington University. "This is particularly true in the first three to six months when the brain is reorganizing."The most common cause of brain damage is not trauma but stroke (also the fourth-leading cause of death). Of the 3 million stroke survivors alive, 40 percent have persistent weakness and disability. Brains damaged by trauma rather than stroke seem to have more capacity to recover."One of the things about traumatic brain injury is that recovery can go on for an extended period of time," said Michael R. Yochelson, a neurologist at National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington. "We leave the book open."In Giffords's favor is the report that half of her brain - the right hemisphere - was spared major damage by the bullet that passed through her head, front to back, in the Jan. 8 shooting in Tucson. That surgeons quickly removed a piece of skull to relieve swelling and pressure almost certainly spared her further damage. Her intelligence and relative youth will help, too.Use of muscles, especially those in the limbs, will be hardest to get back if the bullet destroyed the brain cells that control them or the bundles of nerve fibers that come out of them. The recovery of language is highly variable and can occur over years. Also amenable to rehabilitation are abstract thought, memory and emotion.
Location matters
Two facts about brain anatomy help explain what may go on in Giffords's brain during the months of rehabilitation.The first is that location matters in the brain, which is like a continent of regions, states, cities and neighborhoods. Hearing, smell and memory formation all have their own locations, different from where sexual arousal, hand movement and sight reside.Even different aspects of a single sense are widely separated.Consider a view of the brain with the forehead being the Pacific coast and the back of the head being the Atlantic coast. The region that controls the eyes tracking a bird in flight is as far from the region that actually sees the bird as Minnesota is from New Jersey. Furthermore, in the "New Jersey" region, at the back of the head, there's an area that receives information only about things appearing in the right-hand field of vision. Within it is a neighborhood that gets information only about things that move. In that neighborhood are avenues of cells firing only when the thing moves left to right on a downward diagonal path.The second brain fact relevant to rehabilitation is the organ's "laterality."The left hemisphere of the brain has capacities the right lacks. In more than 95 percent of people, that includes the ability to understand and produce language. (The right hemisphere, on the other hand, is much better at imagining three-dimensional information.) In addition to that right-left specialization, there's a general tendency for one side of the brain to sense or control things on the opposite side of the body: When something touches our right hand, the left side of the brain feels the sensation. When we move our left foot, the order comes from the right side of the brain.Those two neuroanatomical facts govern rehabilitation in this way:When an area with a specific function is destroyed, the brain first attempts to recruit nearby cells, which are often doing similar tasks, to change and perform the function of the destroyed cells.If that's not possible, because the destroyed area is so large and the nearest surviving cells are, in fact, doing something completely unrelated, the analogous area on the other side of the brain - the opposite hemisphere - takes on some of the tasks, with varying success.These two strategies - recruiting nearby tissue and recruiting the mirror-image area in the other hemisphere - have different success rates depending on what functions have been damaged by stroke or, in Giffords's case, by a projectile.The control of muscles occurs in a region called the "motor cortex," which sits like a tiara across the middle of the brain. It is laid out as a distorted "map" of the human body, with many more nerve cells dedicated to working the hand, face and tongue muscles than the shoulder, leg or foot muscles.When some of those cells are destroyed, ones that are nearby can take over some of the functions. If that's not possible, the brain turns to a strip of tissue just in front of the motor cortex. Normally that area is devoted to the more complex and abstract job of preparing for an intentional movement, rather than driving the muscles. But it can turn over some of its cells to do the latter if called on.When all else fails, the brain can use the part of the motor cortex in the other hemisphere to drive the muscles that would normally be controlled by the damaged area. In Giffords's case, the undamaged right side of her brain would be asked to control the limbs on the right side of her body.The problem with that solution is that very few of the nerve fibers from the right side of the motor cortex actually go to the limbs on the right. About 99 percent cross over and control the limbs on the left side of the body. So there's a limit to how much can be gained.Curiously, both sides of the body are "represented" in the motor cortex of each hemisphere, but the cells are wired up to to control only the muscles on the opposite side of the body. Neuroscientists hope to one day have a "brain-machine interface" that can capture this trapped knowledge in the good hemisphere and direct it to the muscles controlled by the damaged one.
Language use
Reassignment and rewiring under certain circumstances may be more successful in rehabilitating language use.Normally, the language centers in the left hemisphere suppress the activity of the areas in the right hemisphere corresponding to them. When the left hemisphere is damaged, the suppression is lifted and the corresponding areas on the right become more active. Whether that is always helpful for recovery, however, is uncertain.Only in small children or the very rare adult can the right hemisphere fully take over language. For a good recovery, some of the language function on the left must survive.Calling on the undamaged side of the brain appears to work even better for complicated activities such as watching and remembering a changing group of objects.Recent research by Bradley Voytek and Robert T. Knight at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California at Berkeley has shown that a damaged left frontal lobe can handle this kind of task as long as it's simple. But the harder the task gets, the more the brain turns to the right frontal lobe for help."What these studies show you is that the brain is moving things around," Knight said. "It is taking a piece of information and getting it to the part of the brain that can solve the problem."Targeted rehab and hard effort are essential to maximizing all of this. That's what's behind "constraint-induced therapy" in which the patient's good limb is restrained, forcing use of the weak one - and driving neuroplasticity. It's also the basis for aggressive speech therapy, and the need for more of it."Patients need eight or nine hours of speech therapy a week, and typically they don't get that as outpatients," said Washington University's Corbetta. "That's why it's very important to supplement what you get in a clinic with home exercises and computer exercises."Therapy is just beginning for even subtler functions that are less hard-wired than vision and movement and may be even more recoverable."The rehab world focuses on motor activity, but that's the hardest thing to fix," Knight said. "We are now seeing increasing interest in rehabilitation of more abstract things, such as how good a patient is in focusing attention, in problem solving, in 'executive control.' "

House hunters find it’s a jungle
View Photo Gallery — Navigating the market: a seller’s dream: Homebuyers in the D.C. area searching for affordable housing are running into an all-too-common problem: There are too few homes available for less than $400,000, as low mortgage rates and high rents have pushed demand to an all-time high. By Olga Khazan, E-mail the writer
On a recent rainy Sunday, David Albersheim and Andrea Cohen were yet again hunting for their first home. Their preferences: a house near a Metro station for less than $400,000.
So at $450,000, the rowhouse they looked at cost more than they ideally wanted to pay. The old house in Northwest Washington was in the process of being renovated and had a few glaring flaws, such as a backyard that was a mess of cracked concrete. As the couple looked, they tallied the thousands they would have to spend to fix it up.
The pair already had looked at dozens of properties, and in the process they uncovered an all-too-common problem for homebuyers in the District and inner suburbs: There are too few houses available in the less-than-$400,000 price range, as low mortgage rates and high rents have pushed demand to an all-time high. “It’s very difficult to get a house in a desirable neighborhood for less than $400,000,” said Andrew Riguzzi, a managing partner at D.C. Real Estate. “If they’re out there, they probably haven’t been cared for and need several thousand to bring them up to conditions.”So Albersheim and Cohen had adjusted their price range up slightly and their aesthetic expectations down. They house hunted almost every weekend, but they had thus far only bid on one: A $350,000 Petworth fixer-upper, located a block from Section 8 housing. That house sold the same day they placed their offer; it had been on the market for 48 hours.From the rowhouse in Northwest, the couple headed to a nearby $500,000 open house, where a handful of other house hunters were peeking in closets and inspecting the (aged) countertops. Downstairs, rainwater leaked into the basement.“Most of these houses need too much work put into them,” Albersheim said. “And yet they think they can charge whatever they want because the D.C. market is, you know, hot, hot, hot.”By Monday, there were already offers on both homes, but Albersheim and Cohen bid on the rowhouse anyway.
Unnatural shocks
Even though there’s a glut of homes throughout parts of the country, the Washington region seems to have the opposite problem, especially in the lower price ranges.Of the 30,000 active listings on the market in late April, only about 20,000 were priced below $400,000 — a 30 percent drop from this time last year, according to regional sales data analyzed by the real estate company Redfin. Many of the outer suburbs still have plenty of houses in the lower price ranges. But less-expensive homes are very hard to find closer to central D.C.: 68 percent of homes offered for less than $350,000 are located in the outer suburbs beyond Montgomery County, Arlington and Alexandria. In the District, Redfin counts only 862 listings for less than $350,000.So how did it get this way? As John Heithaus, chief marketing officer at MRIS, describes it, a “perfect storm” of economic issues and policy decisions have created the gap between the supply of affordable homes and demand for them.Development slowed during the recession, and in the District, housing starts have been at historic lows for years. Meanwhile, in 2011, D.C. enacted legislation requiring mediation for all foreclosures — a process that stalls the foreclosure process and, according to some experts, keeps the number of available foreclosed houses at artificially low levels.“Foreclosures are a stock of less expensive housing, but the lack of foreclosed homes is also not putting any downward price pressure on non-foreclosures,” said Lisa Sturtevant, an assistant research professor at George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis.Hung over from the housing crisis, some homeowners remain reluctant to list their homes, said Trish Szego, president of the Virginia Association of Realtors, particularly if they bought recently or owe more than the home is worth.On the demand side, the District’s population grew by more than 5 percent during the past decade, and the new wave of residents were largely upper and middle class: a key homebuying demographic. And while rents continue to rise, mortgage rates remain incredibly low, hovering near 4 percent for a 30-year. On top of that, the D.C. first-time homebuyer tax credit gave a boost toward homeownership for those on the fence.“We’ve had a number of unnatural shocks to the system that altered the demand and supply equation,” Heithaus said. “A flood of buyers came out of the woodwork and pulled all the normal supply out of the system.”As a result, homes are getting more expensive, and it’s harder to find them. Home prices have increased year-over-year in Arlington, Falls Church, the District, Fairfax, Bethesda and Alexandria.Cheaper homes sell faster, too: Homes in the $300,000 to $400,000 price range were on the market for a median of 35 days in March, as compared with 41 for all listings, according to data from Real Estate Business Intelligence. Redfin found that more than 25 percent of listings that hit the market last quarter were under contract within three days. The supply is further depleted because, within the District, developers often snap up older, less expensive homes to either “flip” them later for a higher price or to rent them.“Washington is a crazy place,” Riguzzi said. He estimates that 15 percent of his deals each year are in cash, which generally means a developer is buying the property. For his realty agent friends in other markets, he said it’s closer to 2 percent. Riguzzi said houses below $400,000 in good neighborhoods are gone in a matter of days. A recent open house for a $399,000 one-bedroom condo in Dupont Circle drew 65 groups of people, he said.“The day we go out looking at properties, you have to be prepared to put down an offer that day,” he said. “If you’re not, there’s no sense in looking.”
Great lengths
As a consequence of the low inventory, many buyers are going out of their way to accommodate sellers, and sellers can command terms that would seem unthinkable in more balanced markets.Christopher Klenner, a financial adviser, began looking for a single-family home in the $300,000 range in Northern Virginia in January and describes what he saw as unappealing — foreclosures in disrepair or, closer to the city, overpriced townhomes. He said he was shocked by how tough his search was.“I had figured that all you do is go out and look for a house and buy it,” he said. “But trying to find something that was reasonably priced was really tough.”Eventually, he and his girlfriend settled on a short sale, but it was a months-long process marked by constant uncertainty. Klenner called it “the most stressful experience I’ve ever dealt with.” When the former owner’s new living arrangement fell through at the last minute, Klenner had to agree to rent to her for a month while she found a new place to live.“I really had no choice but to do that, otherwise she could just say, ‘We’re not going to sell it to you,’ ” he said. For in-demand properties, bidding wars are common. For Redfin’s listings, 53 percent of homes for sale had multiple offers in D.C. last quarter, while in an area such as Atlanta, that only happened 31 percent of the time.Eva Su, a Government Accountability Office employee, and her husband Clarke, a professor, had an ample down payment and an 800 credit score. Still, they made eight offers on $300,000 to $400,000 condos in downtown D.C. before finally closing on one in March. To stay on top of it all, they made an Excel spreadsheet with their top 20 choices. They got nothing in their top five.“There were multiple issues — sometimes there was a bid competition and our offer was not accepted,” she said. “Sometimes a cash offer from a developer was accepted prior to a resident offer.” Some buyers have begun including escalation clauses — provisions that increase the bid price in the presence of competing offers — in their contracts, Sturtevant said, and some are even forgoing home inspections. When there are multiple offers, Szego said some real estate agents are asking buyers to write letters to the homeowners describing how much they love the property, in hopes of swaying them.Sturtevant said she thinks the inventory problem could have deleterious economic effects on the region if white-collar workers — and their prospective employers — are spooked away by the lack of affordable homes.“There is a point where people may say, ‘I love my job, but Austin is looking pretty good,’ ” she said. “At a certain point, we may start to worry that people won’t come here, and we need them to do so in order for the private sector to want to be here.”Heithaus said he thinks the market will eventually right itself as builders light up again. In the meantime, he said it’s inadvisable for anyone to “get emotional” when bidding on a dream house.“If the real estate agent calls and says, ‘You’re gonna lose it,’ don’t let that enter into the decision-making process,” he said. “Sunlight comes right at your darkest hour.”Albersheim and Cohen didn’t get the rowhouse. A competing bidder offered to close within 10 days, an extremely fast turnaround that the couple didn’t think was possible. They said they plan to keep looking, and they now think they’ll make clear that their closing date is negotiable in future offers.“It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m wasting time looking for houses every Sunday,” Cohen said. “I do have faith that we’ll eventually find the right one, though. I’m trying to stay optimistic.” Next week: Strategies for buyers

Africa's moment
The World Cup in South Africa brought hope, joy, tears and anticipation for the entire continent.
South Africa became the first African nation to host the FIFA World Cup. A worker runs with the South African flag inside the Soccer City stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg.
