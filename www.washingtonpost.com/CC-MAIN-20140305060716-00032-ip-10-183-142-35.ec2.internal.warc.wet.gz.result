The limits of surveillance
By David Ignatius, America’s top intelligence official said Thursday that there is no evidence so far that the Boston Marathon bombers had help from foreign terrorist networks.
“At this point, I haven’t seen anything that raises a concern there was a bigger plot, but we’re still investigating,” James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in an interview. He was responding to a query about a recent newspaper story citing two Russian militants as possible accomplices.

Clapper’s comments are another sign that the bombings, allegedly by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, were probably a homegrown operation, perhaps closer to the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., than to an al-Qaeda plot.“They may have acted alone, but we need to wait until the investigation . . . [is] completed before we draw that conclusion,” Clapper said. “It gets into how people radicalize. . . . It has to do with personal grievances, and how much they are fed by jihadist Web pages.”With such domestic plots, Clapper said, there are sharp limits on what the 17 intelligence agencies that report to him can do to collect information. The younger brother, Dzhokhar, was a U.S. citizen, and Tamerlan’s residential status made him what’s known as a “U.S. person,” giving both of them protection from surveillance by the FBI and other intelligence agencies. “There are restrictions on how intrusive we can be in monitoring U.S. citizens,” Clapper said. He cautioned that more aggressive efforts to connect the dots could create serious civil liberties issues, and he asked pointedly: “Does the public want us to be more intrusive in monitoring their Internet activity, listening in to their cellphone calls, monitoring their travel overseas? Do you want us to do this to you?”Critics have argued that the FBI and other agencies botched the investigation of the Tsarnaevs. They note that the CIA was alerted by Russian intelligence in 2011to concerns about Tamerlan, prompting an FBI interview of him that year. He was still able to travel to Russia in January 2012 and back to the United States that July without further queries.But Clapper said the intelligence community was properly following rules for entering and using names on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) database that’s maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). He said that the FBI interview of Tamerlan didn’t produce enough corroborating evidence of terrorist links to prompt his inclusion on a no-fly or special screening list and that, under TIDE’s rules, the name was dropped from the roster.“We had nothing on him. All we had was a Russian query. We asked three times for clarification. The FBI did a very thorough check, asked back for clarification, but never got any,” Clapper said. Through the interview, Clapper raised his voice several times to say that his job is not to oversee perfect surveillance but rather to manage intelligence under privacy rules that properly limit the government’s ability to collect or keep information. Not long before the Tsarnaev case broke, he noted, his office’s inspector general had conducted an investigation of the NCTC compliance with the rules for maintaining the TIDE database. “They got a very good report card on that,” Clapper said.Given the limits on government surveillance of homegrown extremists, what’s the strategy for preventing domestic terrorism? Basically, it focuses on outreach to Muslims and other communities to get their help in monitoring and disrupting mobilization for terrorist activities.Mere radicalization ­— visiting jihadist Web sites or talking about extremist groups — “is 100 percent legal,” one analyst said. The crossover comes when a person is mobilized for action, but such conversion is hard to detect because it usually takes place within the “personal zone,” as was apparently the case with the Tsarnaevs. Even when they visited jihadist Web sites or posted inflammatory messages, the Tsarnaevs’ activities couldn’t be monitored legally.Analysts say talking to Muslim communities — through community awareness briefings at mosques, community centers and other meeting places — is the most effective tool for preventing homegrown Islamist extremism. If Muslim families feel part of a larger American community, they have a greater stake in monitoring and preventing violence. That’s not Dr. Phil talking, but some of the nation’s hard-nosed counterterrorism specialists.Clapper and his analysts have concluded that the right answer to homegrown plots isn’t police-state surveillance but good community policing. It won’t stop the occasional plot by people who get radicalized, like the Tsarnaevs, but as one analyst noted, “it’s not likely to spike into a mass phenomenon.”

The return of Marco Rubio
Thus, the story of Seamus, the Romneys’ dog who famously rode atop the family car in a crate en route to vacation (to Ontario, Canada, 12 hours away) — and suffered acute gastrointestinal inconvenience, requiring a mid-trip hose-down — has caused me considerable distress. I know Mitt and Ann Romney to be lovely people who undoubtedly adored their dog, but how does one make this event seem less awful?By way of furthering my own credentials, Ollie is a five-pound, 10-year-old blind poodle I adopted from a shelter 21
/
2 years ago after a dinner party where I was, as we Southerners like to put it, “overserved.” For elaboration, you’ll have to wait for the book, but suffice to say, Ollie was born blind and his original humans, who bought him at a pet store, dropped him off at the shelter, reportedly, because they were tired of him.I am his seeing-eye human — and where I go, Ollie goes. Not all is snails and puppy-dog tails, I confess. He can sometimes be obstreperous when he is “lost in space.” That is, disoriented and unable to find me the instant his poodle brain registers that he is not, in fact, nestled in the crook of my elbow, a preferred spot that has resulted in a rather dogged case of “Poodle Elbow.” Yet under no circumstances imaginable would my pooch be relegated to the top of a car, no matter how fancy the crate. Car too small? Get a bigger one — or a smaller dog. Not enough room for five boys and an Irish setter? Leave one of the kids at home. Kidding, kidding.I’ve held my tongue all these months for several reasons, not least because Gail Collins of the New York Times had a Doberman’s grip on the subject and wouldn’t let go. Once a columnist takes ownership of a subject, as Collins did by mentioning Seamus more than 30 times at last count, other wags surrender the territory. Consider it an unwritten law of the sandlot.But now President Obama has crossed into dog territory. Ever since the Obama campaign implicitly put Seamus into play, Romney’s family vacation has become a dogfight of a different order. And really, why wouldn’t dogs become a metaphor for this political race? Has there ever been so much circling the hydrant? Obama, as the entire world knows, has a dog named Bo, whose addition to the first family was a promise kept to his daughters upon winning the presidency. Needless to say, Bo has never been crated on the roof of a car. When he travels, he doesn’t even have to make sure his seat back and tray table are in the upright position. Presumably, Seamus, whose infamous vacation took place in 1983, would have enjoyed better travel accommodations as first dog.As timing would have it, Seamus is now a metaphor for the characteristics that Romney critics find unappealing — out of touch, lacking in compassion, pragmatic to a fault. Who puts his dog on top of a car speeding down the highway? Will HUD be next?By contrast, in a photo now in circulation, Obama is shown extending an outstretched hand to an eager Bo. The president is crouched down at dog level, balancing on his toes with his jacket slung over a shoulder, and smiling. Unlike Romney, by implication, Obama is friendly, approachable and at one in bow-wowness.Pet owners have noticed. A Facebook page created by the president’s campaign, “Pet Lovers for Obama,” gives animal lovers a place to show their pets’ support for the Obama-Biden ticket. Members of the group “Dogs Against Romney” have staged protests. Stand by for more canine chicanery. When national issues are so complex, such distilled calculations may provide political relief, but is this really the way to pick a president? In defense of their dog policy, Ann Romney recently told ABC’s Diane Sawyer that Seamus liked riding in the crate because he understood that it meant he was going on vacation. Mitt Romney, who told Sawyer that attacks about Seamus have been the most “wounding” of the campaign, also said he wouldn’t put Seamus in a crate again.Which leaves voters with two choices: Forgive Romney, as surely Seamus did. Or, condemn a man with a knack for economic recovery for his flip-flopping just this one last doggone time.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Mia Love of Utah hopes to become the first black Republican woman in Congress
(Francisco Kjolseth/ The Salt Lake Tribune ) - Mia Love, running for Utah's 4th Congressional District, at the Utah State Capitol on March 6.
CAPTION
By Krissah Thompson, E-mail the writer
SALT LAKE CITY — Other than her conservatism, there is little about Mia Love that doesn’t stand out in Utah. She is a black Republican, a 36-year-old mother of three, a fitness instructor and mayor of a growing town.
Now, her congressional race against a popular incumbent whom Republicans have struggled to defeat has made Love a minor celebrity among GOP stalwarts.

She recently introduced herself to a group of teachers, standing in the gilded state Capitol, which historically has been the domain of white men, by describing her Haitian American father.“He said: ‘Mia, your mother and I never took a handout. You will not be a burden to society,’ ” she said with a stern smile. “ ‘You will give back.’ ”Most of the teachers already knew of Love, whose race against six-term Rep. Jim Matheson (D) has become one of the country’s most closely watched congressional contests.If she wins, not only would she help Republicans keep control of the House, but she would become the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. Love, who is Mormon, also could go a long way toward helping presidential candidate Mitt Romney, putting a fresh face on his church and his party as both try to appeal to an increasingly diverse nation.As a result, independent groups and both political parties are expected to pour millions of dollars into the contest. The race, in a district where Republicans have dominated, is rated a toss-up by the Cook Political Report.Republicans are effusive about their candidate.“Mia has a great opportunity to extend the message of liberty and economic freedom in ways that a lot of us can’t, and we’re excited about that,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.) after hosting a fundraiser for her in Park City on Friday night.It was only two months ago that Love caught statewide attention at Utah’s Republican convention, where she blew her opponents out of the race by winning support from 70 percent of the delegates. Under the state’s primary rules, candidates with at least 60 percent go into the primary election unopposed.Without an opponent in the primary Tuesday, Love has been able to spend her time raising money, preparing for the match-up against Matheson and raising her profile. She has not shied away from the provocative, saying that “government is not your salvation” and pledging to join the Congressional Black Caucus to take it apart “from the inside out.”“Mia Love is the type of candidate that Republicans have been trying to recruit,” said Jessica Taylor, a senior analyst at the Rothenberg Political Report. “On paper, this is a district that they should have won awhile ago.”Love is running in a congressional district created in 2010 amid negotiations to give Washington, D.C., a vote in the House. Utah’s new congressional map carved up Matheson’s old district, tossing in even more Republicans. So he hopped to the newly drawn 4th district, which contains about a third of his old territory. ‘It is unprecedented’
The primary victory for Love, a relative newcomer, stunned Utah. She is a tall black woman with braided hair in a state that has elected only three women to Congress and has an African American population of less than 1 percent, according to the most recent census.“It is unprecedented. It is astonishing,” said Tim Chambless, an associate professor of political science at University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics.Love has placed no special significance on the history she could make in Congress, but she knows the stakes are high. Matheson, who also had an uncontested primary, has outpaced her in fundraising by nearly 10 to 1. And she recognizes that some might question her ties to her adopted state: How does a woman born in Brooklyn and reared in Connecticut end up in Utah?While in college she met her future husband, Jason Love, who was in Connecticut on a Mormon mission. Fourteen years ago, she moved to Utah; left the Catholic Church, in which she was raised; and joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Love, whose husband is white, said she has felt nothing but acceptance in Utah.She has said that when she heard talk about taking the words “under God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance, she decided to run for city council in Saratoga Springs, a town of about 18,000, and was elected mayor in 2009.Love has vowed to take the balanced-budget approach she has used in Saratoga Springs and apply it Washington. To cut federal costs, she has advocated eliminating agencies that she considers bloated or ineffective, including the Departments of Energy and Education.Matheson calls her views “extremist.”“She wants to get rid of Medicare,” he said. “She wants to get rid of student loans. I think these are positions that are pretty far out there.”Love counters that Matheson “is out of touch with the people of Utah. I’m going to do everything I can to get decision-making back to the people.”She favors giving states control of Medicare through block grants, privatizing more of the student loan market, and revamping Social Security to increase the retirement age and reindex the program for younger Americans, said spokesman Brian Somers.LaVarr Webb, a Republican lobbyist and communications consultant in Utah, said that as Love lays out her ideas, she will need to “portray herself as mainstream Republican rather than arch-conservative, far-right Republican.”In a slick Web video, her campaign is playing up that she is a working mother, a move that could blunt talk that she is too far to the right and that could appeal to independents and women, who have supported Matheson.After meeting with Love, Elaine Grant, a high school teacher who lives in West Jordan, said she was refreshed by the candidate’s talk of “dismantling entitlements.” Grant is a Republican who has voted for Matheson in the past, but this year she has decided to abandon him for Love.“There’s this perception that there aren’t any African Americans in Utah and a misperception that there are no African American Mormons,” Grant said. “She dispels some of that. That’s a good thing.”
‘I’ve been to this rodeo’
Matheson recognizes the challenge. A sixth-generation Utahn, he has built a reputation as a hard worker, willing to negotiate across the aisle and buck his party.“Every year I have a tough race. I’ve been to this rodeo before,” he said in a recent interview. While his district voted Republican in presidential contests, Matheson won 63 percent of the vote in 2008 and 55 percent in 2004. If Romney, whose son Josh has endorsed Love, brings out more Republican voters, that could work against Matheson. But Utah voters pride themselves on their independence, hearkening back to the state’s founding by hearty pioneers, and they have a history of voting across the ticket.“My message has always been that I put Utah first,” said Matheson, who often reminds voters that he opposed President Obama’s health-care plan and supported the Republican-backed balanced-budget amendment. “To the extent that people are frustrated with the politics of today, the polarization, the bickering, I am the antidote.”Love is betting that Utah voters are looking for a more partisan solution. She likes asking fellow Republicans this question about Matheson: “How is it that we’ve allowed him to represent us for so long?”
