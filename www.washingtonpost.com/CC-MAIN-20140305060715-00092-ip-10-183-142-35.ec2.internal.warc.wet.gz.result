Obama says U.S. Embassy in Libya will reopen
Video: President Barack Obama promised the Libyan people that the world will stand with them as they reshape their country following the fall of Moammar Gaddafi's regime. (Sept. 20)
By Scott Wilson, E-mail the writer
NEW YORK—President Obama announced Tuesday that he is reopening the U.S. Embassy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli and returning the ambassador, mixing a pledge to stand by Libya’s post-revolution government with warnings that “difficult days lie ahead” as the country attempts to build a new government and economy.
Beginning his official visit to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama addressed a high-level meeting on Libya, recently rid of long-time dictator Moammar Gaddafi after seven months of civil war.
Video
Moammar Gaddafi says his regime is still alive in Libya and is calling his opponents' takeover of all but a few pockets of the country a charade. (Sept. 20) More on this Story

His message was a defense of NATO’s decision to intervene on behalf of the rebels in order to prevent a threatened civilian massacre, as well as a promise that security and humanitarian assistance will continue until the oil-rich North African nation is stable. “This is how the international community should work in the 21st century — more nations bearing the responsibility and costs of meeting global challenges,” Obama said. But Obama also warned that “even as we speak, remnants of the old regime continue to fight.”
Gaddafi, who took power in a coup 42 years ago, remains at large, and pockets of loyalists continue to threaten the weak hold of the Transitional National Council, recognized by the United States as the legitimate government.White House officials have held up Libya as a model for a kind of American leadership that relies on partnership and persistence rather than unilateral action, and Gaddafi’s ouster provides a partial vindication of the president’s politically difficult decision to open a third military front in a Muslim country.He praised the Libyan people for seeing through the revolution, adding pointedly, “even after some in the world gave up hope.” Obama’s Republican critics have argued that more assertive U.S. leadership and more military force would have removed Gaddafi sooner, while others fear that the intervention sets a precedent that could draw the United States into future civil conflicts that threaten civilian life.“Difficult days are still ahead,”Obama said. “So long as the Libyan people are being threatened, the NATO-led mission to protect them will continue. And those still holding out must understand — the old regime is over, and it is time to lay down your arms and join the new Libya.”In the early days of Libya’s armed conflict, the U.S. Embassy was shuttered and diplomats evacuated by sea. Obama said that this week “the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked will be raised again, over a reopened American Embassy.”Obama also linked Libya’s post-revolution economy to the building of a democratic government. Many nations reliant on oil are plagued by official corruption, and Obama, in what is a theme of his visit here this week, urged Libya to build responsive institutions as oil revenues and other state assets become available again with the end of sanctions.“The Libyan people deserve a government that is transparent and accountable,” Obama said. “And bound by the Libyan students and entrepreneurs who have forged friendships in America, the United States will build new partnerships to help unleash Libya’s extraordinary potential.”Later Tuesday, Obama was scheduled to host a meeting on the Open Government Partnership, a multi-nation effort to promote transparency, press freedom and anti-corruption efforts by harnessing technological advances.He will also meets with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an influential player in many of the administration’s efforts in the Middle East. Once an ally of Israel, Erdogan has become a sharp critic of the Jewish state, a position that hardened last year after a deadly Israeli military raid on a Turkish aid ship bound for the Gaza Strip. Erdogan has been an outspoken advocate of the Palestinian push for statehood during this General Assembly, a position that puts him at odds with the Obama administration and with Israel.The leaders will discuss ways to bring Israel and the Palestinians back to direct negotiations, either to head off the statehood resolution or to follow it.

Randy Wittman, through season’s rough first half, convinced Wizards to ‘stay with it’
Rob Carr/Getty Images - Coach Randy Wittman implored Trevor Ariza and the Wizards’ supporting cast to keep working while the team was starting 4-28, saying a break through was coming. With Nene and John Wall back, it came, and the Wizards are 11-8 in their past 19.
By Michael Lee, E-mail the writer
Before Nene returned to good health and John Wall made his season debut, the Washington Wizards were a hopeless collection of mismatched parts that couldn’t win, no matter how hard they tried; and then they became a bad luck, injury-plagued team that couldn’t field much more than patchwork lineup.
Coach Randy Wittman handled the challenges with the appropriate humor, desperation and disappointment, as he offered up jokes about seeking help from the waiver wire, begged for an exorcist to cure the spell of injuries, and even apologized to fans and ownership after a humiliating loss in Detroit. Video
The Washington Post’s Mike Wise analyzes the Washington Wizards at the all-star break. Wizards Insider
Insight on the Wizards and all the latest news from Post reporter Michael Lee.
Members of Wittman’s coaching staff know that he would often sit in his office, struggling to find ways to keep players motivated through the hardships, but inevitably, the same words kept rolling from his mouth. “Just stay with it,” rookie Bradley Beal said, explaining Wittman’s message. “It’s annoying because he always says the same thing, ‘It’s close. It’s close.’ He always tells us, ‘Stay with it and it’s going to come’ . . . and it’s starting to come.”The actual starting point of the turnaround is debatable — the day Wall started practicing, the day the Wizards upset Oklahoma City, or when Wall finally suited up after a three-month absence.But over their past 19 games, the Wizards have won 11 and are now entering games expecting to win rather than wondering how they will lose. That mind-set is the result of more talent and healthy bodies on the floor, but also Wittman establishing the schemes and culture for it to all come together once his expected roster was finally in place.“Since day one, he’s done a great job as far as leadership,” A.J. Price said of Wittman. “Records don’t indicate everything. Our schemes, our game plan, has been there for us, since the first day of camp. We just were lacking players. Once he’s got everybody back, you’ve seen how we’ve bought into what we’re doing on the court.”The Wizards (15-36) will host the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday at Verizon Center for what they hope will be a more fulfilling 31-game finish than their miserable beginning. They have had low moments (a forgettable, franchise-record 0-12 start) and the occasional silver lining (upsets of Oklahoma City and Miami).Through it all, Wittman kept searching for a group that would not succumb to the circumstances and would stay committed to a program that was not yielding immediate results. Wittman used 13 lineups in the first 33 games, either because of injuries or inconsistent play, but center Emeka Okafor said Wittman maintained his cool despite the constant tinkering.“He hasn’t really ever got in panic mode. He just kept with the system. He kept doing what he did and as he got healthy, we got better. He did an excellent job of keeping spirits up and his confidence never waned. He’s a big reason why we’re here,” Okafor said. “A lot of that, too, is the type of guys that are here. Nene and I being vets and [Trevor Ariza], we’ve seen it all. We understand it’s never over. Even though it seems like, you’re out of it, in the NBA, just like you can be up 20 or down 20, it’s the same thing with records.”After losing 17 of their first 20 games decided by seven points or less, the Wizards are now 3-3 in that situation. The Wizards also encountered five overtime — and two double-overtime — defeats, including having one victory overturned by officials when a tip-in came milliseconds after time expired.“It was dark, but all I tried to get our guys to understand is through injuries, through guys being out, is to compete. Compete and learn,” Wittman said. “We lost a lot of close games and we competed. To their credit they continued to come every night, and I think there is some positive coming out of that right now.”During the early stumbles, Wittman had to endure speculation about his status and questions about the Wizards’ decision to retain a coach who has the lowest winning percentage (.327, 133-274) of anyone with at least 400 NBA games on the sideline. Some fans even called for his job at home games, though Wittman claims to have never heard the catcalls.“I always say, the coach’s system is great. He’s a great coach,” said Nene, who missed the first nine games with plantar fasciitis and has spent most of his time back on a minutes restriction. “I like him a lot and now, we start getting healthy and play more together and have more chemistry and the system is the same. I don’t listen when people say things about the coach because he didn’t deserve it then and he don’t deserve it now.”With the Wizards lacking many offensive options, Wittman focused on making them a staunch defensive team and they have responded by ranking in the top 10 in points allowed (seventh, 93.9) and defensive field goal percentage (fourth, 43.6). Wittman has also gotten his players to buy into an offense that isn’t geared around the ability of one or two players to put the ball in the basket. And opposing coaches have often stopped to laud him for not allowing his team to fold.“I think Randy has done a great job of staying the course. Players have done a good job of hanging in there. Think about the number of last-possession losses they had. They were right there,” Pistons Coach Lawrence Frank said. “When you’re right in the middle of it, sometimes it’s hard to see the big picture. It’s such a long season and Randy did a great job of not changing what he believes in, and it’s amazing how things go from bad to good.”Wittman’s facial expressions have taken on another life on Twitter, with the popular hashtag, #WittmanFace, devoted to saved screen shots of his exasperated and helpless looks after bad shots, unfavorable calls or painstaking defeats. He isn’t all smiles these days, with the Wizards in too large of a hole to make a push for the postseason, but he has found some purpose for that rough patch. “I think realistically, through the darkness, it’s helped us win some games,” he said.

Port Deal To Have Broader Review
NEWS | LOCAL | POLITICS | SPORTS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS | ARTS & LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDE | JOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE |SHOPPING Port Deal To Have Broader Review
Dubai Firm Sought U.S. Security Probe
By Jonathan Weisman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, February 27, 2006
The Bush administration said yesterday that it has accepted a proposal from a Dubai maritime company to conduct a 45-day review of the national security implications of the company's plans to take control of significant operations at six U.S. ports.
The announcement by Dubai Ports World, brokered by the White House and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), appears to satisfy the demands of many members of Congress, who had threatened to force a security review if the administration would not conduct one. The deal also offered pledges to reassure the United States that the ports deal would not pose any threats to American safety and security.
The administration had approved DP World's $6.85 billion purchase of London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. (P&O) earlier this month without conducting a security review, after a broad interagency panel that looked at the transaction concluded the takeover of port operations in the United States would not affect the nation's safety.
But last week, members of both political parties erupted in furor, questioning the administration's judgment and promising to delay the deal, if not scuttle it. After President Bush vowed to veto any legislation that would thwart the Dubai company's plans, the most public clash between the Republican Congress and the Bush White House seemed in the offing. But yesterday's announcement may have headed off any showdown.
"We recognize that there are concerns regarding DP World's acquisition of P&O's U.S. terminal operations. Despite having already obtained approval by the federal government, we continue to take voluntary steps to assure people that the security of the U.S. will not be harmed as a result of this acquisition," said Edward H. "Ted" Bilkey, DP World's chief operating officer.
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: "We are pleased that Dubai Ports reached a middle ground with Congress. The transaction was closely scrutinized by the appropriate national security and intelligence officials, and important safeguards are in place. We believe, however, the additional time and investigation at the request of the company will provide Congress with a better understanding of the facts, and that Congress will be comfortable with the transaction moving forward once it does."
Eric Ueland, Frist's chief of staff, said yesterday that the Senate majority leader would ask the relevant committees to continue oversight while the administration conducts its review, and he said the company will have to continue its efforts to reassure lawmakers.
But, he said, Frist and GOP leaders would not tamper with the secretive interagency administration panel, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), during the review. The committee said yesterday in a statement that it welcomes the announcement and that it will "promptly initiate the review process and fulfill Dubai's request for a full investigation."
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), who supports the deal, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the new agreement "spells out unequivocally the willingness of this company to give every means of support to help work this thing out."
Warner called the ports deal diplomatically and economically vital to the United States. "This is going to establish a precedent, and it's got to be done in a way not to choke off other opportunities," he said.
Lawmakers who had threatened to block or delay the deal welcomed a longer investigation. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said the new proposal probably would quell calls for emergency legislation in Congress this week. He said a deeper investigation is necessary of a United Arab Emirates-owned company operating U.S. ports.
"This was only 4 1/2 , five years ago that they were very close to bin Laden, they were supporting Taliban," King, who heads the House Homeland Security Committee, said on "Meet the Press." "And unless there's been a complete transformation, I have real concerns."
Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), another critic of the deal, agreed that the delay would forestall immediate action in Congress but emphasized that transparency is vital in the new investigation. "If, after the 45-day investigation, it's kept secret, it's given to the president, who after all has come out for this deal already, I don't think that's going to assure the American people," he said on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Under the terms of the deal announced by DP World, the company would proceed with its takeover of P&O. That deal is to be completed Thursday.
But DP World said it would "guarantee" the independence of operations at the ports of New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Miami and New Orleans by establishing North American operations as a "completely separate" business unit. Management of the North American operations would be left in the hands of P&O's chief executive in London, who is British. The chief security officer of the North American unit would still be a U.S. citizen, unless the Coast Guard approves a change.
The rest of the current management of P&O in the United States also would remain in place, and DP World pledged not to interfere with operations, policies, procedures or security that was in place when P&O ran the U.S. terminals.
The statement concluded that all these pledges would remain in place until May 1 or the completion of the CFIUS review.
"We are confident the further review by CFIUS will confirm that DP World's acquisition of P&O's U.S. operations does not pose any threat to Americans' safety and security. We hope that voluntarily agreeing to further scrutiny demonstrates our commitment to our long-standing relationship with the United States," Bilkey said.
The deal was worked out over a series of meetings Friday among Frist, Bilkey, DP World lawyers, Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Late Friday, Frist recommended to the government of the United Arab Emirates and to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) that DP World request a security review and more clearly spell out how it intended to separate its U.S. operations from port management around the world.
DP World executives and their lawyers worked through the agreement all day Saturday, while GOP leaders in Congress and White House officials focused on the next political steps. Ueland said Frist is pleased with yesterday's company statement, indicating it comported with his expectations.

Apple's Steve Jobs helped save a sinking music industry, with his iPod and iTunes digital music store. Struggling record labels swallowed hard and accepted his 99-cents-per-song pricing because they had little choice.
When it comes to video content, however -- hit television shows such as "Heroes" and "The Office," and movies -- Jobs's bargaining position isn't as strong. For the second time in a year, he is getting significant resistance from a content creator that would rather turn its back on the mighty iPod than capitulate to Jobs's pricing demands.
And now, some music companies are starting to reexamine their relationships with Apple.
The turbulence on the content side comes as Apple is enjoying smooth sailing on its hardware side. On Monday, the company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings, with computer sales up 34 percent and iPod sales up 17 percent over the comparable quarter last year.
But fans of such hit shows as "The Office" are angry because Apple, feuding with NBC Universal over pricing, pulled all current NBC shows from the popular iTunes music store.
And after Dec. 1, when Apple's contract with NBC expires, all shows that NBC Universal owns, past and present, will disappear from the site. That includes shows from Sci Fi, USA and Bravo cable channels.
NBC Universal confirmed that it sent a letter on Oct. 9 asserting that Apple is in breach of contract, though it is unlikely to pursue legal action. The two sides have stopped negotiating and there appears to be no resolution in sight.
On the iTunes comment board for "The Office," there is plenty of fan enmity to go around.
"Apple wake up and work it out with NBC," wrote one poster.
Another simply wrote: "I hate NBC."
NBC said that before the breakup, its shows accounted for 40 percent of all the television programs purchased on iTunes; Apple said the number was closer to 30 percent.
For Apple, the feud with NBC is the most recent ding in the company's sleek, it-just-works image. A year ago, Apple added feature-length movies to its iTunes online music store, most for $9.99 each. But the only major studio that let its movies be sold on iTunes was the Walt Disney Co. -- and Jobs sits on Disney's board. Since then, only two of the six other major studios -- Paramount and Sony -- have made some of their movies available for sale on iTunes. Movie studios fear damaging sales of their movies on DVD by undercutting their price on the online music store.
