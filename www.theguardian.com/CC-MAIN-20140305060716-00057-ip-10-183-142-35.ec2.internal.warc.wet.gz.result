Libya, Syria and Middle East unrest - Wednesday 15 June 2011 | World news | theguardian.com 8.57am: Welcome to Middle East Live. Here's a roundup by country of the latest developments and analysis.Libya• Britain and its Nato allies no longer believe bombing alone will end the conflict in Libya, well-placed government officials have told the Guardian. Instead, they are pinning their hopes on the defection of Muammar Gaddafi's closest aides, or the Libyan leader's agreement to flee the country. "No one is envisaging a military victory," said one senior official.• Xan Rice in Tripoli reports on the growing frustration in Libya at Gaddafi's intransigence. A businessman told him: "Ninety-five per cent of people want him to leave, not just because of politics, but because of our desire for a return to normal life."Xan writes: Even among some senior officials close to Gaddafi there is a sense of gloom, regret, and even inevitability.• Nato dropped leaflets threatening Apache air strikes against government forces near the western rebel stronghold of Misrata, but they landed on ground claimed by the rebels, writes Chris Stephen. Thousands of leaflets were sprinkled from a bomb that detonated above no man's land east of the city, raining down over rebel units who had moved their frontline five miles forward from the shattered village of Dafniya. The rebels had apparently neglected to tell Nato about the move.• Hundreds of tickets to the London 2012 Olympics have been allocated to Libya, the organisers of the Games have confirmed. Libya's Olympic authorities, which is headed by Muammar Gaddafi's eldest son, Muhammad were allocated "a few hundred" passes to the event.Syria• The onslaught of the Syrian army goes on in the face of mounting international condemnation including for the first time from the Arab League. Syria's feared 4th division, commanded by Maher al-Assad, brother of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, is reported to have moved to the eastern city of Deir Azzor. The same division has been in control of the town of Jisr al-Shughour since Friday, forcing most remaining people in the besieged enclave to flee to the nearby mountains bordering Turkey.• Protesters in Deir Azzor staged a night time demonstration in defiance of the regime, according to video footage sent by activists.
• The Syrian government has urged refugees from Jisr al-Shughour to return home from Turkey. The state news agency Sana said: "The cabinet called on the citizens of Jisr al-Shughour and the surrounding villages who were forced to leave their homes to come back after calm and security were restored in the area."• The prospects are bleak in Syria and the west has no credibility to do anything about it, argues Chris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding.The situation in Syria will only get worse in the coming weeks with further demonstrations and killings, increased economic hardship as vital tourism and foreign investment drops away, increasing the pressure on the international community to act. Chaos in Syria will be almost impossible to contain...The west only has itself to blame. It is the inconsistency of its policies and the failure to root its actions legally and ethically over decades – not least over Iraq, Palestine and cosying up to the most dictatorial of regimes – that has led to the lack of trust in its motives and the dilemmas it faces now.• The US has leverage in Syria it has simply chosen not to use it, argues Tony Badran from the neoconservative thinktank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Writing Foreign Policy magazine he says: It is essential for US to abandon its hands-off approach to Syria. Once Washington states unequivocally that it sees no role for Assad except for him to leave, everything else will follow. The position of the superpower, after all, matters. The Turks, for example, who are divided on how to proceed, will stop vacillating if [Barack] Obama makes it clear that he would like to see Assad depart in a manner that safeguards their interests.Once the administration makes that decision, its ability to muster leverage increases. Washington could then widen the coalition against Assad to include other key Arab states, including Saudi Arabia. Washington should make clear that it seeks Assad's ouster as part of a broader strategy of countering Iranian influence in the region -- something about which Riyadh remains deeply concerned. There are several signs that the Saudis will be receptive to this argument, not least of which is the relentlessly critical line Saudi-owned media have taken against Assad over the last three months.Bahrain• Bahrain is to sue the Independent newspaper, accusing it of "orchestrating a defamatory and premeditated media campaign" against the Gulf state and neighbouring Saudi Arabia. It singled out for criticism the newspaper's award-winning Middle East correspondent, Robert Fisk.A UK-based legal firm has been hired, according to a report by the state news agency in Bahrain, where the ruling regime has been suppressing popular uprisings for months. In his latest column Fisk wrote:Has the Khalifa family gone mad? Yesterday [Monday], the Bahraini royal family started an utterly fraudulent trial of 48 surgeons, doctors, paramedics and nurses, accusing them of trying to topple the tin-pot monarchy of this Sunni minority emirate.He claimed the Saudis were now running Bahrain:Bahrain is no longer the kingdom of the Khalifas. It has become a Saudi palatinate, a confederated province of Saudi Arabia, a pocket-size weasel state from which all journalists should in future use the dateline: Manama, Occupied Bahrain.Yemen•
