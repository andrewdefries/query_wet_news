THE TALK OF AUSTIN
THE TALK OF AUSTIN; TEXANS WORRY ABOUT LOSING NATURE'S TOUCH
By WAYNE KING, Special to the New York Times
Published: March 26, 1985
AUSTIN, Tex.— Bob Armstrong's ranch is only 35 miles out of Austin as the crow flies, a little over 50 if you have to walk. But it is the Texas Hill Country at its epitome: rolling hills, cactus, chaparral and cedar on the ridges and bluebonnets down below, and a stream that cuts through it all and makes a waterfall. There are deer and foxes, and armadillos, of course. For years Mr. Armstrong, the former land commissioner who ran for governor a few years ago, has held a camp-out for friends, a few political but mostly personal. They roast a steer, sit around campfires, drink whisky, tell lies and sing songs, with Mr. Armstrong usually contributing ''Rosalita's Good Eats Cafe,'' a portrait in song of a Texas roadhouse at 3 in the morning. Even the coyotes join in. Mr. Armstrong's spread is modest by Texas standards, a single section, 640 acres, and he fears it is in danger of falling under Austin's relentless urban sprawl. Over the trees, the entire sky is aglow with the city's lights. ''When we came out here in 1971, you could pick out six or seven points of light; now, you can almost see those lights marching up Highway 183 towards us,'' he said. Years ago, the wilderness crept up to Austin like a timid deer; now it retreats. Besides traffic snarls, water shortages and soaring costs, Austin's decadelong boom has increasingly meant a loss of the city's special touch with nature. ''There is something unique about a certain size,'' Stuart Henry, a lawyer who is active in the Sierra Club, said. ''You simply can't accommodate a Hamilton Pool, where you used to be able to go skinny dipping at night, or Barton Springs, natural cold springs where people still swim, an institution, but one that's not meant for an urban environment.'' ''Austin is not Houston,'' he continued. ''You don't have a hell of a lot to lose in Houston; here you do, unique topography, land on the river. Down on Barton Creek, a mile or two out of Austin, you can see eaglets, ferns you never saw before; Barton Creek is not gonna be able to accommodate this growth.'' ''There is real pressure on the urban animals,'' he observed. ''Deer come up to the urban environment, birds, hawks; some of the varmints are back in, the raccoons, but they are scavengers in the garbage cans. Armadillos are pretty much nonurban animals. They tear up lawns, so they get run off. Austin without armadillos? That would be like Austin without Willie Nelson.'' It seems an obvious thing to do, and you wonder why somebody didn't think of it before: Most people wash clothes at some time, and it's about as much fun as being caught in traffic. So why not give customers at coin laundries something to do besides watch their clothes go around in circles? Like eat, drink and be merry? So two Austin brothers opened a combination coin-operated laundry, restaurant and saloon in an Austin shopping center last October and called it Barwash. They're cleaning up. ''Business is great, real good,'' said 25-year-old David Walsh, a co-owner. ''During the day it's generally housewives; by nighttime it's a younger crowd. The place starts rockin' about 7, and is open till midnight.'' The bar and restaurant, glassed off from the laundry, serves wine and premium beer along with items like Croissant Cordon Bleu, p^ates and anchovy caper garlic bread. ''It's nicer than I expected,'' said Toni Hoffman, who was reading a copy of ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' and having an iced tea with lime while her laundry swirled. ''It shows imagination. You have to do laundry; this is a nice place to do it.'' David Walsh and his brother, Rob, plan another location in Austin. With oil prices declining, crops battered by drought, floods and freezing, and trade with Mexico shattered by the plummeting peso, the Texas economy has slowed considerably, and with it state revenues. The Legislature considered a parimutuel betting bill that would have allowed wagering on the ponies and generated new state income, but turned it down because the ministers of the state looked askance at it. A state income tax is considered just as sinful. College tuition and most licensing fees will be raised, but the state is running out of ways to raise new money. Thus keepers of the state coffers are looking for ways to get more revenue without riling any special-interest groups, and one way is to go after tax evaders. One group, perhaps as many as 9,000 across the state, is merchants who do not pay their sales taxes. The problem is they average about 12 years old. Last year, the Legislature repealed the sales tax exemption on newspapers as part of a tax increase to benefit schools and highways. As a result the boys or girls who deliver newspapers after classes every day are supposed to turn in their sales taxes. Only about 1,500 have applied for sales tax permits and about a third of the taxes collected. ''They're really little merchants,'' said Lydia Stravato, an assistant controller for the state in the collections division. ''I think the Legislature does realize we can't administer it, but they're out of money.'' ''You have to depend on the kids and they don't understand their responsibility,'' she said. ''Most of them have never heard of this.'' ''Should we go to the schools of Texas to find these kids to 'fess up about how many papers they sold?'' she asked the committee that is reviewing a bill to reinstate the exemption on newspaper sales. photo of Henry Alvarado and Chris Kropp Get 50% Off The New York Times & Free All Digital Access.
