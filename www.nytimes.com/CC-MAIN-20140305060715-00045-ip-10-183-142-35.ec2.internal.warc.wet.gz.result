In the Heart of the Sea
CHAPTER ONE
In the Heart of the Sea
The Tragedy of the
Whaleship Essex By NATHANIEL PHILBRICK
Viking
Read the Review
Nantucket
It was, he later remembered, "the most pleasing moment
of my life"the moment he stepped aboard the whaleship
Essex for the first time. He was fourteen years old, with a broad
nose and an open, eager face, and like every other Nantucket boy, he'd
been taught to "idolize the form of a ship." The Essex might not look
like much, stripped of her rigging and chained to the wharf, but for
Thomas Nickerson she was a vessel of opportunity. Finally, after what
had seemed an endless wait, Nickerson was going to sea.
The hot July sun beat down on her old, oil-soaked timbers until the
temperature below was infernal, but Nickerson explored every cranny,
from the brick altar of the tryworks being assembled on deck to the
lightless depths of the empty hold. In between was a creaking, compartmentalized
world, a living thing of oak and pine that reeked of oil,
blood, tobacco juice, food, salt, mildew, tar, and smoke. "[B]lack and
ugly as she was," Nickerson wrote, "I would not have exchanged her
for a palace."
In July of 1819 the Essex was one of a fleet of more than seventy
Nantucket whaleships in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. With whale-oil
prices steadily climbing and the rest of the world's economy sunk in
depression, the village of Nantucket was on its way to becoming one of
the richest towns in America.
The community of about seven thousand people lived on a gently
sloping hill crowded with houses and topped by windmills and church
towers. It resembled, some said, the elegant and established port of
Salema remarkable compliment for an island more than twenty
miles out into the Atlantic, below Cape Cod. But if the town, high on
its hill, radiated an almost ethereal quality of calm, the waterfront below
bustled with activity. Sprouting from among the long, low warehouses
and ropewalks, four solid-fill wharves reached out more than a
hundred yards into the harbor. Tethered to the wharves or anchored in
the harbor were, typically, fifteen to twenty whaleships, along with
dozens of smaller vessels, mainly sloops and schooners, that brought
trade goods to and from the island. Each wharf, a labyrinth of anchors,
try-pots, spars, and oil casks, was thronged with sailors, stevedores,
and artisans. Two-wheeled, horse-drawn carts known as calashes continually
came and went.
It was a scene already familiar to Thomas Nickerson. The children
of Nantucket had long used the waterfront as their playground. They
rowed decrepit whaleboats up and down the harbor and clambered up
into the rigging of the ships. To off-islanders it was clear that these
children were a "distinctive class of juveniles, accustomed to consider
themselves as predestined mariners.... They climbed ratlines like
monkeyslittle fellows of ten or twelve yearsand laid out on the
yardarms with the most perfect nonchalance." The Essex might be
Nickerson's first ship, but he had been preparing for the voyage almost
his entire life.
He wasn't going alone. His friends Barzillai Ray, Owen Coffin, and
Charles Ramsdell, all between the ages of fifteen and eighteen, were
also sailing on the Essex. Owen Coffin was the cousin of the Essex's
new captain and probably steered his three friends to his kinsman's
ship. Nickerson was the youngest of the group.
The Essex was old and, at 87 feet long and 238 tons displacement,
quite small, but she had a reputation on Nantucket as a lucky ship.
Over the last decade and a half, she had done well by her Quaker owners,
regularly returning at two-year intervals with enough oil to make
them wealthy men. Daniel Russell, her previous captain, had been successful
enough over the course of four voyages to be given command of
a new and larger ship, the Aurora. Russell's promotion allowed the former
first mate, George Pollard, Jr., to take over command of the Essex,
and one of the boatsteerers (or harpooners), Owen Chase, to move up
to first mate. Three other crew members were elevated to the rank of
boatsteerer. Not only a lucky but apparently a happy vessel, the Essex
was, according to Nickerson, "on the whole rather a desirable ship
than otherwise."
Since Nantucket was, like any seafaring town of the period, a community
obsessed with omens and signs, such a reputation counted for
much. Still, there was talk among the men on the wharves when earlier
that July, as the Essex was being repaired and outfitted, a comet appeared
in the night sky.
Nantucket was a town of roof dwellers. Nearly every house, its shingles
painted red or left to weather into gray, had a roof-mounted platform
known as a walk. While its intended use was to facilitate putting
out chimney fires with buckets of sand, the walk was also an excellent
place to look out to sea with a spyglass, to search for the sails of returning
ships. At night, the spyglasses of Nantucket were often directed
toward the heavens, and in July of 1819, islanders were looking toward
the northwest sky. The Quaker merchant Obed Macy, who kept meticulous
records of what he determined were the "most extraordinary
events" in the life of his island, watched the night sky from his house
on Pleasant Street. "The comet (which appears every clear night) is
thought to be very large from its uncommonly long tail," he wrote,
"which extends upward in opposition to the sun in an almost perpendicular
direction and heaves off to the eastward and nearly points for
the North Star."
From earliest times, the appearance of a comet was interpreted as
a sign that something unusual was about to happen. The New Bedford
Mercury, the newspaper Nantucketers read for lack of one of their
own, commented, "True it is, that the appearance of these eccentric
visitors have always preceded some remarkable event." But Macy resisted
such speculation: "[T]he philosophical reasoning we leave to
the scientific part of the community, still it is beyond a doubt that the
most learned is possessed of very little undoubted knowledge of the
subject of cometicks."
At the wharves and shipping offices there was much speculation,
and not just about the comet. All spring and summer there had been
sightings up and down the New England coast of what the Mercury
described as "an extraordinary sea animal"a serpent with black,
horselike eyes and a fifty-foot body resembling a string of barrels floating
on the water. Any sailor, especially if he was young and impressionable
like Thomas Nickerson, must have wondered, if only fleetingly, if
this was, in fact, the best time to be heading out on a voyage around
Cape Horn.
Nantucketers had good reason to be superstitious. Their lives
were governed by a force of terrifying unpredictabilitythe sea. Due
to a constantly shifting network of shoals, including the Nantucket Bar
just off the harbor mouth, the simple act of coming to and from the island
was an often harrowing and sometimes catastrophic lesson in seamanship.
Particularly in winter, when storms were the most violent,
wrecks occurred almost weekly. Buried throughout the island were the
corpses of anonymous seamen who had washed up on its wave-thrashed
shores. Nantucket, which means "faraway land" in the language
of the island's native inhabitants, the Wampanoag, was a mound
of sand eroding into an inexorable ocean, and all its residents, even if
they had never left the island, were all too aware of the inhumanity of
the sea.
Nantucket's English settlers, who began arriving in 1659, had
been mindful of the sea's dangers. They had hoped to support themselves
not as fishermen but as farmers and sheepherders on this grassy,
pond-speckled crescent without wolves. But as the increasing size of
the livestock herds, combined with the growing number of farms,
threatened to transform the island into a wind-blown wasteland, Nantucketers
inevitably looked seaward.
Every fall, hundreds of "right whales" appeared to the south of
the island and remained until the early spring. So named because they
were "the right whale to kill," right whales grazed the waters off Nantucket
much like seagoing cattle, straining the nutrient-rich surface of
the ocean through the bushy plates of baleen in their perpetually grinning
mouths. While English settlers at Cape Cod and eastern Long Island
had already been hunting right whales for decades, no one on
Nantucket had had the courage to pursue the whales in boats. Instead
they left the harvesting of whales that washed up onto the shore
(known as drift whales) to the Wampanoag.
Around 1690, a group of Nantucketers was standing on a hill overlooking
the ocean where some whales were spouting and playing with
one another. One of the onlookers nodded toward the whales and the
ocean beyond. "There," he asserted, "is a green pasture where our
children's grandchildren will go for bread." In fulfillment of his
prophecy, a Cape Codder by the name of Ichabod Paddock was soon
thereafter lured across Nantucket Sound to instruct the islanders in
the art of killing whales.
Their first boats were only twenty feet long, and they launched
them from the beaches along the island's south shore. Typically a
whaleboat's crew was comprised of five Wampanoag oarsmen, with a
single white Nantucketer at the steering oar. Once they'd killed the
whale, they towed it back to the beach, where they removed the blubber
and boiled it into oil. By the beginning of the eighteenth century,
English Nantucketers had instituted a system of debt servitude that
provided them with a steady supply of Wampanoag labor. Without the
island's native inhabitants, who outnumbered Nantucket's white population
well into the 1720s, the island would never have become a successful
whaling port.
In the year 1712, a Captain Hussey, cruising in his little boat for
right whales along Nantucket's south shore, was blown out to sea in a
fierce northerly gale. Many miles out, he glimpsed several whales of a
type he had never seen before. Unlike a right whale's vertical spout,
this whale's spout arched forward. In spite of the high winds and rough
seas, Hussey managed to harpoon and kill one of the whales, its blood
and oil stilling the waves in an almost biblical fashion. This creature,
Hussey quickly realized, was a sperm whale, one of which had washed
up on the island's southwest shore only a few years before. Not only
was the oil derived from the sperm whale's blubber far superior to that
of the right whale, providing a brighter and cleaner-burning light, but
its block-shaped head contained a vast reservoir of even better oil,
called spermaceti, that could be simply ladled into an awaiting cask. (It
was spermaceti's resemblance to seminal fluid that gave rise to the
sperm whale's name.) The sperm whale might be faster and more aggressive
than the right whale, but it was far more enriching. With
no other means of support, Nantucketers dedicated themselves to the
single-minded pursuit of the sperm whale, and they soon outstripped
their whaling rivals on the mainland and Long Island.
By 1760, the Nantucketers had practically wiped out the local
whale population. But no matterby that point they had enlarged
their whaling sloops and equipped them with brick tryworks capable
of processing the oil on the open ocean. Now, since it would not need
to return to port as often to deliver bulky blubber, their fleet had a far
greater range. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, Nantucketers
had made it to the verge of the Arctic Circle, to the west coast of
Africa, the east coast of South America, and as far south as the Falkland
Islands.
In a speech before Parliament in 1775, the British statesman Edmund
Burke looked to the island's inhabitants as the leaders of a new
American breeda "recent people" whose success in whaling had exceeded
the collective might of all of Europe. Living on an island that
was almost the same distance from the mainland as England was from
France, Nantucketers developed a British sense of themselves as a distinct
and superior people, privileged citizens of what Ralph Waldo
Emerson called the "Nation of Nantucket."
The Revolution and the War of 1812, when the British navy
marauded offshore shipping, proved disastrous to the whale fishery.
Fortunately, Nantucketers possessed enough capital and inherent
whaling expertise to survive these trials. By 1819, Nantucket was well
on its way to reclaiming and, as the whalers ventured into the Pacific,
even surpassing its former glory. But the rise of the Pacific sperm-whale
fishery had an unfortunate side effect. Instead of voyages that
had once averaged about nine months, two- and three-year voyages
had become the norm. Never before had the division between Nantucket's
whalemen and their people been so great. Long gone were the
days when Nantucketers could watch from shore as the men and boys
of the island pursued the whale. Nantucket was now the whaling capital
of the world, but there were more than a few islanders who had
never even seen a whale.
In the summer of 1819 people were still talking about the time
when, nine years earlier, a pod of right whales was spotted to the north
of the island. Whaleboats were quickly dispatched. A crowd gathered
on shore to watch in fascination as two whales were killed and towed
back into the harbor. For the people of Nantucket, it was an epiphany.
Here at last were two of the creatures they had heard so much about,
creatures upon which their livelihood depended. One of the whales
was pulled up onto th
