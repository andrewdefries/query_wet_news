A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTIGATION
A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INVESTIGATION; Agents Pursue German Leads On Terror Trail
By LOWELL BERGMAN and DON VAN NATTA Jr.
Published: September 25, 2001
WASHINGTON, Sept. 24— Two weeks after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon, investigators have not yet identified any knowing accomplices in the United States or uncovered a broad support network that assisted the 19 hijackers, a senior law enforcement official said today. The official, who is actively involved in the investigation, said that a key to unraveling the plot might lie in Germany, not the United States, and that a team of agents had been dispatched to pursue leads there. Based on investigators' portraits of the suspected hijackers and their movements before the Sept. 11 attacks, the official said, federal agents are investigating whether the plot had its origins in Germany and then branched out to hubs in Newark, Boston, Florida and Maryland. While some reports have suggested that there were other terrorist cells in the United States and even failed plots to hijack other airplanes on Sept. 11, the official said the arrests of hundreds of people and interviews with thousands of others had produced little hard evidence to support either suspicion. ''Thus far we cannot connect any of those people that we're looking at to any of those 19'' hijackers, the official said. Investigators have evidence that some people unwittingly assisted the hijackers but did not know about the overall plan. They are still pursuing leads in the United States that other people may be tied more closely to the hijackers and the plot. Attorney General John Ashcroft said today that 352 people had been arrested or detained and that an additional 392 people were being sought for questioning. If this new theory of the case proves true, it will have the effect of assuring the public that no conspirators remain hidden in the United States at a time when the White House is planning military reprisals. While not ruling out future discoveries, the authorities are saying that to date they have not found evidence of organized groups linked to Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, still operating in the United States, or any direct evidence that the 19 men identified as the hijackers who crashed airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were associated with other groups planning future attacks. Officials said that promising information had been developed in Germany, where the police seek two men who they believe may have been directly involved in the plot. One suspected hijacker, Mohamed Atta, believed to have played a central role in coordinating the plots, lived in Hamburg while studying engineering. He was killed aboard the American Airlines flight that struck the World Trade Center's North Tower. Some investigators still believe that the plot was so intricately timed that it almost certainly required help from accomplices on the ground who helped scout airlines, airports and flight training schools. But as days pass without evidence of their presence, other investigators suggest that the hijackers designed their plot to self-destruct, leaving behind no trace of other conspirators or much documentary evidence. Moreover, investigators have still not identified a chief architect of the plot who might have headed a decision-making structure and then fled. A senior law enforcement official said that 17 of the 19 hijackers were not known to intelligence or law enforcement officials before the Sept. 11 attacks. Two of the hijackers, Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf alhamzi, were placed on the government's official watch list for suspected terrorists before the attacks. Saying that thousands of people had been trained at Mr. bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan, this official acknowledged that Western intelligence could not track them all. ''It shouldn't surprise us that they have people that don't come up on anybody's radar screen, in our country or elsewhere, who can legitimately come here, travel on a legitimate visa, pay bills, stay out of trouble, take training and launch an attack like this,'' the official said. ''It's staggering in its complexity and the discipline is very impressive.'' The official said investigators had collected electronic intercepts connecting the attacks to Al Qaeda. But the official said that evidence would probably not be made public in the government's ''white paper'' that is to connect Mr. bin Laden to the attacks. The official said the authorities were still sifting through thousands of bank records to determine whether the hijackers received financial support from Al Qaeda. Investigators are pursuing other avenues in the United States. Today, one man was charged in Northern Virginia with helping three of the suspected hijackers fraudulently obtain Virginia driver's licenses last month; a second man who aided with the licenses is cooperating and was not charged, prosecutors said. But officials said they did not believe that either man had any knowledge of the hijacking plot. The F.B.I. searched an apartment in Paterson, N.J., last week and showed neighbors photos of two of the hijackers on the flight from Newark that crashed in Pennsylvania, residents said today. Jamie Diaz, who also lived in the building, at 486 Union Ave., said today that one man had lived there about six months, and that they both moved out about a week before the hijacking. Officials said that reports that other hijacking teams were prepared to commandeer other flights on Sept. 11 remained only a theory, even though searches of planes turned up boxcutters similar to those believed to have been used by the hijackers. Last week, Mr. Ashcroft said other planes might have been at risk on Sept. 11. But reports of other hijackers who may have boarded or tried to board other flights appear to lack credibility, the officials said. Law enforcement officials in recent days said the hijackers planned for the attacks by monitoring the airports, and even taking the cross-country flights, more than once. ''I'm starting to believe only two weeks into this that they did this with only a minimal amount of support in the U.S.,'' one official said. The investigation has also spawned a secondary intelligence inquiry of huge proportions intended to glean fresh threats in the United States and overseas. A senior law enforcement official said some investigators had theorized that the hijackers were able to keep the plan secret by letting only one member of each team know that the planes would be crashed into buildings. The others, the official said, might have believed that the jets would be landed at an airport where demands would be made. This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series ''Frontline,'' which will broadcast a documentary about the roots of terrorism and American efforts to combat it on Oct. 4. Photo (pg. B5) Chart: ''The Investigation So Far'' Federal officials said that despite the largest investigation in government history, they have failed to identify any accomplices or confirm initial suspicions that the 19 hijackers had a support network in this country. Following the Money Investigators have been trying to trace how the hijacking plot was paid for. The cost is estimated at about $200,000, or from 5 to 10 times the amount spent before the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. YESTERDAY -- President Bush ordered an immediate freeze on assets of suspected Islamic terrorist groups and individuals. The president also gave Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill the power to sanction banks that give terrorists access to the international financial system. The 27 individuals and organizations whose assets were frozen included Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants, as well as three charities that the government suspects channeled money to him and his Al Qaeda network. Arrests YESTERDAY -- Attorney General John Ashcroft said that 352 people have been detained or arrested and 392 others are wanted for questioning, mostly about immigration violations. It is not clear that any of those detained so far have provided direct information about the attacks. A man was charged with helping several hijackers fraudulently obtain Virginia driver's licenses last month. But the authorities do not believe that the man who was arrested knew of the hijacking plot. Florida court records showed that one suspected hijacker, Mohamed Atta, was wanted on an arrest warrant at the time of the attacks and that his Florida driver's license was revoked last month. New Threat From the Air? YESTERDAY -- The government grounded crop-dusting planes for a second day amid concerns about possible biological or chemical attacks. Investigators were told that at least one of the suspected hijackers had asked about agricultural planes at a small airport in Belle Glade, Fla. Leads Overseas Last week, investigators said at least three suspected hijackers belonged to a cell of Islamic fundamentalists while attending a small technical college in Germany. YESTERDAY -- The F.B.I. has dispatched a new team of agents to pursue leads there. The German authorities continue the hunt for two men who they believe may have been directly involved in the hijacking plot. (pg. B5) Map of Florida highlighting Belle Glade. (pg.

Hide details	Frequently Asked Questions
Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
Visitors get 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows, video and other multimedia features) each calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog fronts and classifieds. Subscribers enjoy unrestricted access to all of the content on NYTimes.com and 100 Archive articles every four weeks. Also note that NYTimes apps are free to download and install, and you can access up to three free articles a day, from any section. Subscribers get unlimited access to all sections within the app.
View our complete FAQ
Home Delivery Subscriptions
With home delivery of The New York Times newspaper, do I get free digital access?
Yes, only print subscribers get the added benefit of a free full digital access subscription which includes unlimited access to our New York Times website, NYTimes.com, and the NYTimes apps for smartphones (iPhone®, BlackBerry® 10, Windows® Phone and Android™-powered phones) and tablets like the iPad®.
Once I order home delivery, when can I start using my free digital benefits?
To start using your free digital benefits, you’ll need your New York Times home delivery account number. This will be sent to you in a confirmation email once your order is placed. If you do not receive the email you can call New York Times Customer Care at 1-800-NYTIMES (698-4637) and obtain the number.
What time will The New York Times be delivered to my home?
In most areas, The New York Times will be delivered by 6:30 a.m. on weekdays, and 8:30 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
Can I suspend home delivery while I am on vacation?
Yes, you can choose to receive credit for the period of your suspended delivery or donate your vacation credit to provide The New York Times newspaper to schools.
