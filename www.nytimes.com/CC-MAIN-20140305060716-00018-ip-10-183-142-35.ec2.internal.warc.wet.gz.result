About the Best Sellers
Rankings reflect sales for the week ending July 14, 2012.
An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable
from those of the book above it. A dagger (†) indicates that some retailers report
receiving bulk orders.
Read a full explanation of our methodology.
Rankings reflect sales reported by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles. The sales venues for print books include independent book retailers; national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university, gift and discount department stores; and newsstands. E-book rankings reflect sales from leading online vendors of e-books in a variety of popular e-reader formats.
E book sales are presently included for all adult categories (fiction, non-fiction and advice) except for graphic novels, and all children's categories with the exception of picture books. Titles are included regardless of whether they are published in both print and electronic formats or just one format. E-books available exclusively from a single vendor will be tracked at a future date.
The universe of print book dealers is well established, and sales of print titles are statistically weighted to represent all outlets nationwide. The universe of e-book publishers and vendors is rapidly emerging, and until the industry is settled sales of e-books will not be weighted.
Among the categories not actively tracked at this time are: perennial sellers, required classroom reading, textbooks, reference and test preparation guides, journals, workbooks, calorie counters, shopping guides, comics, crossword puzzles and self-published books.
The appearance of a ranked title reflects the fact that sales data from reporting vendors has been provided to The Times and has satisfied commonly accepted industry standards of universal identification (such as ISBN13 and EISBN13 codes). Publishers and vendors of all ranked titles conformed in timely fashion to The New York Times Best Seller Lists requirement to allow for independent corroboration of sales for that week.
Publisher credits for e-books are listed under the corporate publishing name instead of by publisher's division.
Sales of both print books and e-books are reported confidentially to The New York Times. The Best Seller Lists are prepared by the News Surveys and Election Analysis Department of The New York Times. Royalty Share, a firm that provides accounting services to publishers, is assisting The Times in its corroboration of e-book sales.
An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (†) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders.

NYT Lesson Plan: How Do You Measure (Up)? The New York Times Learning Network Lesson PlanDeveloped in Partnership with The Bank Street College of Education in New York Cityhttp://www.nytimes.com/learningTo print document select "Print" from the "File" menu on your browser.How Do You Measure (Up)? Assessing Lung Capacity and Heart Rate in Athletes and Ordinary PeopleRelated New York Times Article"Just a Bike Race, You Say? Think Again", By GINA KOLATA, July 24, 2007Author(s)Catherine Hutchings, The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York CityGrades: 6-8, 9-12Subjects: Current Events, Health, MathematicsOverview of Lesson Plan:In this lesson, students compare the physical stresses on elite cyclists, runners and ordinary people through discussion, investigation of lung capacity and measurement of heart rate. Then they reflect on the mental and physical demands on athletes in their favorite sports.Suggested Time Allowance:1 hourObjectives:Students will:
1. Reflect on a difficult physical challenge they have accomplished.
2. Learn about elite endurance athletes by reading and discussing the article "Just a Bike Race, You Say? Think Again."
3. Measure and calculate their lung capacity and heart rate and compare these figures to norms.
4. Research and reflect on the stresses and demands on athletes in other sports.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils
-classroom board
-student journals
-copies of the article "Just a Bike Race, You Say? Think Again," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070724tuesday.html (one per student)
-additional materials for laboratory activities (as described in the Activities section)
-projection equipment for viewing a video clip or still photographs of the Tour de France (see Warm-Up; optional)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: As students enter class, have them respond to the following prompt in their journals, written on the board before class: �What is the hardest physical achievement (such as a race, a walk for charity, a dance performance or a personal fitness goal) you have accomplished? How did you feel mentally and physically during this activity? How did you feel afterwards?� After five minutes, have them share their responses.
Then, if resources are available, show a video clip or photographs from the Tour de France, such as ones from the official Tour de France Web site (http://www.letour.fr/2007/TDF/LIVE/us/300/). Discuss the toll that the race must take on the bodies of the cyclists and how these athletes are able to mentally and physically accomplish such a long and difficult race. 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "Just a Bike Race, You Say? Think Again" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070724tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:
a. According to the article, how are �superathletes� different from ordinary people?
b. In what ways do running and cycling take a physical toll on the body? c. What is metabolic rate? d. How do elite-level cyclists and runners compare in terms of strength and cardiovascular fitness?
e. How are the physics of cycling and running different? f. In your opinion, which seems more difficult: cycling the Tour de France or running the New York City marathon? Why? g. Given that elite cyclists and runners both experience significant suffering, what might drive gifted athletes to compete at the top levels?
3. Divide the class into pairs or small groups. Explain to students that there are several physiological factors that set elite endurance athletes apart from ordinary human beings, including large lung capacity, high VO2 maximum (the volume of oxygen a person can consume during exercise), strong hearts and a large proportion of �slow-twitch� muscles (muscle fibers that contract slowly and do not easily tire). Though some of these factors require advanced laboratory settings to measure, lung capacity and heart rate can be easily measured in the classroom. Explain that students will be using these measurements to assess their own cardiovascular fitness.
PART I: LUNG CAPACITY Explain to students that they will measure their tidal volume and vital capacity experimentally and also use a formula to calculate their theoretical expected vital capacity. Provide each small group with the following materials: a large pan or tank of water, a plastic jug marked incrementally every 250 ml and filled with water (jugs may be calibrated by adding water 250 ml at a time and marking the side at the water level), a plastic tube and alcohol wipes to clean the tube. Next,
provide the following procedures and facts for determining lung capacity (copied into a handout):
Determining experimental tidal volume and vital lung capacity:
-First, invert the plastic jug into the tank of water so that no air enters the jug.
-Insert one end of the tube into the mouth of the bottle, leaving the other end out of the tank. -Holding your nose, exhale a normal breathe into the tube and measure the amount of water displaced. This is tidal volume. Refill the bottle with water and repeat. Find and record the average of your two results. -Refill the bottle with water. -Holding your nose, inhale deeply and exhale as much as you can through the tube. This is vital capacity. Again, refill the bottle and repeat to find an average vital capacity. -Clean the tube and repeat procedure with other group members.
Determining theoretical expected lung capacity: This can be calculated using weight and height by following the following formula: -Height in cm x weight in kg = _____
-Divide this number by 3600 cm kg/m4 = ______
-Find the square root of this number = ______. This is your body surface area (BSA).
-To find the vital capacity, males multiply the BSA by 2500 and females by 2000. -Theoretical vital capacity = ________.
Express each individual�s lung capacity as a ratio by dividing your experimental vital capacity by your theoretical vital capacity. This enables comparison between and among classmates� values, as it accounts for natural variation in the size and sex o

Digital Subscriptions
What is a digital subscription? What do I get when I subscribe?
A NYTimes digital subscription provides ongoing unlimited access to the NYTimes.com website from any computer or device, plus access to apps on portable devices. To get unlimited access to NYTimes.com and our NYTimes apps, you’ll need a subscription. When you subscribe, you’ll get unlimited access to articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features — on the website, on the mobile site, and on our smartphone and tablet apps. With your digital subscription, you’ll also get 100 Archive articles every four weeks. (NYTimes digital subscriptions do not include Premium Crosswords or The New York Times Crosswords apps.)
Can I get a digital subscription to NYTimes.com only?
No. The basic subscription package gives you unlimited access to NYTimes.com, plus the NYTimes apps for your smartphone. Do you offer discounted education rates?
Yes. College students, faculty and staff in the U.S., please visit our college rate page. K-12 educators in the U.S., please visit our teacher rate page. International educators and university students, please visit our international education page. For information on providing access for multiple users, and all education options, please visit our education rates page. Restrictions apply.
Do you have a group or corporate subscription program?
Yes. We offer group subscriptions, which allow companies and organizations to purchase digital access for a set number of authorized users, under one bill, and at a special discount. Group subscriptions are available for all three digital subscription packages. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com or call (800) 753-7795.
What is the cancellation and refund policy?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the remainder of the current four-week period. Afterward, you will still be able to view 10 articles a month on NYTimes.com and read Top News on our apps at no charge, just like any other visitor. What if I don’t want to subscribe — can I still read NYTimes.com for free?
