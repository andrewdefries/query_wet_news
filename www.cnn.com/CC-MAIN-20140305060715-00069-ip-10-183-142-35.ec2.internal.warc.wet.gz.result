Japanese fishermen brace for giant jellyfish Story Highlights Nomura's jellyfish seen in Sea of Japan for third year since 2005 Species can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter, 450 pounds (204 kilos) Tears in expensive nets can devastate communities Next Article in World » By Shelby Lin Erdman CNN Radio (CNN) -- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Sounds like a great sci-fi flick. But it's not. It's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen. The massive sea creatures, called Nomura's jellyfish, can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds (204 kilos). Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters. For the third year since 2005, ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward, they get caught in fishermen's nets. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. But Nomura's stands out because of its enormous size. "The sheer size of them, individually, makes them fairly spectacular," Graham said. Don't Miss Governments trying to reel in 'ocean sprawl'

Commentary: World's biggest fish are dying
Spectacular, perhaps, to scientists, but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past. They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007, and because they've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan, they're bracing for another, potentially harmful wave this summer. The jellyfish destroy fishermen's nets, getting trapped in them, tearing holes and ruining catches. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them, the result is devastating. "Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets," Graham said. "When these nets get wiped out, it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community." The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen. While they still risk losing a big catch, they can, at least, save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish. It's not clear why waves of Nomura's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years. Some have speculated that overfishing, pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura's jellyfish in the polyp stage. However, no one is certain, Graham said.

Official: Bomb found on King Day in Spokane had rat poison, pellets By the CNN Wire Staff The bomb found along a parade route on Martin Luther King Jr. day was set up to be detonated remotely. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe backpack bomb also contained metal pellets, the official saysThe FBI says it has no evidence linking regional neo-Nazi activity to the backpack bombThe bag was found along the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade (CNN) -- A backpack bomb discovered last week along a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade route in Spokane, Washington, contained a chemical found in rat poison and was packed with little metal pellets, apparently as shrapnel, a law enforcement official said Thursday. The device was set up to be detonated remotely, the official told CNN. The bomb is being examined in the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. Authorities don't have a suspect and don't know whether the bomb was linked to a white supremacist group, the official said. Before the King march kicked off last week, three parade workers found the gray backpack on a bench at the northeast corner of North Washington Street and West Main Avenue in downtown Spokane. No threat was made before the device was found, and no note was found with the backpack, authorities said. The FBI said last week it will consider regional neo-Nazi activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb. Two T-shirts were found in the Swiss Army-brand backpack, authorities said. One shirt says "Treasure Island 2009" and the other reads "Stevens County Relay For Life June 25th-26th 2010." Frank Harrill, special agent in charge of the FBI's Spokane field office, said last week that authorities know of no link to "any specific group or individuals" and called reports linking the bomb to recent neo-Nazi activity in a nearby Idaho town "premature." The bureau is looking into the incident as "an act of domestic terrorism," and investigators are analyzing "every square millimeter" of the backpack, Harrill said. Tony Stewart, one of the founders of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, told CNN last week that he found the timing of the planted bomb and two recent neo-Nazi activities in Coeur d'Alene "just too overwhelming" and suggested hatred was also behind the Spokane bomb. Coeur d'Alene is 35 miles east of Spokane. But Stewart had no evidence tying the Spokane bomb to the two activities in Coeur d' Alene. Earlier this month, a handful of neo-Nazis protested two Mexican restaurants with signs saying, "This is white land" and "We want you out of here," he said. Then, during the evening of the King holiday, about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene, Stewart said. About the Spokane bomb discovery, Stewart said: "It's clear that it was an attempt to end the march and attack human rights advocates. "All three events were going on when there was a reaction by the white supremacists or hate groups in some way," specifically at the two Coeur d'Alene events, Stewart said. "We don't know who did it, but there was certainly a reaction to human right events." The Coeur d'Alene area had been a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity through the Aryan Nations and Order II hate groups since at least the 1970s, though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000, Stewart said. Several bombings in Coeur d'Alene in the 1980s, including at the home of a Catholic pastor and priest who was also serving as president of the human relations task force, were blamed on the Order II, Stewart said. The priest wasn't injured in that bombing, he said. A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The FBI is asking the public for information on who might have been seen with the backpack from about 8 a.m. to 9:25 a.m. on the King holiday, January 17. It also is asking for photos or videos taken in the area.CNN's Carol Cratty and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

OMG, the text message turns 20. But has SMS peaked?
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 5:04 PM EST, Mon December 3, 2012 | Filed under: Mobile
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The first text message was sent on December 3, 1992, and read "Merry Christmas"
8.6 trillion text messages are sent each year around the world
SMS text messaging is on the decline as more people switch to third-party tools on smartphones
(CNN) -- It's been hailed for its succinctness and blamed for everything from sore thumbs to the decline of conversation. Love it or hate it, the text message is 20 years old.
The first-ever text message was sent December 3, 1992, by software engineer Neil Papworth, to Vodafone director Richard Jarvis, who received the message on his husky Orbitel 901 cell phone. It read simply, "Merry Christmas."
As of Monday, the text is no longer in its teens -- the age group it's probably most associated with. In fact, it's more of a senior citizen in technology years.
At just 190 bytes and 160 characters, the modest text message isn't the most glamorous or elaborate form of communication, and that's a major reason it's become so pervasive.
Texting is popular around the world, across age groups and cultures, because it is simple, concise, and compatible with every mobile device, whether it's a $500 smartphone or a disposable flip phone.
Mobile society leads to bad manners?
Church: Go forth and tweet
Teen is fastest texter in United States
Six billion SMS (short message service) messages are sent every day in the United States, according to Forrester Research, and over 2.2 trillion are sent a year. Globally, 8.6 trillion text messages are sent each year, according to Portio Research.
It seems tacky to bring this up on its birthday, but this may also be the year the text message peaks. After two decades of constant growth, text messaging is finally slowing down as people move to smartphones and use third-party messaging tools to circumvent wireless carriers' costly per-text charges.
SMS messaging is expected to be a $150 billion-a-year industry in 2013, with carriers charging set monthly fees for unlimited texting, or as much as 20 cents per text. The actual cost to carriers for sending a text message is about 0.03 cents.
By using popular apps and services, including Apple's iMessage, Facebook messages, GroupMe and WhatsApp, smartphone users can send all the texts they want over Wi-Fi or cellular networks without paying per message. But smartphones still only account for 50% of all cell phones, so text messaging is likely to be around for years to come.
Since a birthday is a day of celebration, LOLs and HBDs, let's take a look at some fascinating text messaging trivia.
• In the United States, 75% of teenagers text, sending an average of 60 texts a day. According to Pew Internet research, texting is teens' most common form of communication, beating out phone conversations, social networks and old-fashioned face-to-face conversations.
• Women are twice as likely to use emoticons in text messages, but men use a wider variety of emoticons, according to a recent study by Rice University. :-)
• The practice of exchanging sexual messages or photos (yes, "sexting") isn't just for single people and politicians. It's also popular among committed couples. According to a study by psychology professor Michelle Drouin, 80% of young adults in relationships sent or received naughty texts, and 60% upped the ante by exchanging photos or videos.
• Some emergency response call centers are beginning to accept text messages sent to 911. There are still lingering concerns about the practice, including lack of location information, confirmation that the message was received, and timeliness of messages. Verizon plans to launch limited SMS-to-911 services in early 2013.
• The world of competitive texting can be lucrative for the fastest thumbs. At this year's fifth annual National Texting Championship in New York City, 17-year-old Austin Wierschke was crowned the winner for the second year in a row, taking home $50,000 in prize money.
• According to Guinness World Records, Melissa Thompson set the record for fastest text. In 2010, she took 25.94 seconds to type and send, "The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human."
• Text messages have a dangerous side. Texting while driving is a risky activity, and sending or reading a single text can distract a driver for approximately 4.6 seconds, according to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. Thirty-nine states have banned text messaging while driving. Distracted texters have also been injured or killed while biking and walking.
• Text messaging technology has popped up in some fascinating places over the years, including cows' reproductive organs. Swiss dairy farmers have implanted sensors in cows to detect when the cows are in heat. A second sensor with a SIM card in the cow's neck sends a text message to the farmer, who can then inseminate the animal, according to The New York Times.
• Text messaging has been used in medical fields to improve treatment for malaria, depression, diabetes and addiction.

Syria: There's a chemical weapons agreement. Now what?
By Holly Yan, CNN
updated 9:31 AM EDT, Mon September 16, 2013
(CNN) -- Now comes the real test. Of Syria's sincerity. Of Russia's resolve. Of America's gamble.
Over the weekend, the U.S. and Russia hashed out a new plan to get Syria to give up control of its chemical weapons. Syria says it welcomes the plan.
But will the war-torn country actually hand over one of the world's biggest stockpiles of chemical weapons? Or is this just a delaying tactic to get the world off its back? And if President Bashar al-Assad doesn't comply, what next?
We'll find out in the coming days. Syria has until next week to provide a full list of all its chemical weapons and where it's storing them. Today, we hear from a U.N. report on whether poison gas was used in an attack on Damascus suburbs on August 21. But here's the hitch: The report won't say who used it -- the regime or the rebels.
Putin the diplomat
Syrian children suffering malnutrition
U.N. inspectors submit report on Syria
Concern over jihadists in Syria
As you begin your first day back at work after the weekend, here's a Q&A that'll bring you up to speed on what happens next.
Russia slams U.S. on Syria chemical weapons deal as U.N. report due
What does the deal say?
The four-page "Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons" basically says:
• Within one week, Syria must submit a full list of its chemical weapons stockpile.
• By November, international inspectors must be on the ground in the country.
• Before the end of November, the inspectors should complete their initial survey of the weapons sites.
• Also before the end of November, all production and mixing or filling equipment must be destroyed.
• By the middle of next year, all chemical weapons material must be destroyed.
That's quite ambitious. Will it have any teeth once the U.N. weighs in?
It's true that plans often get watered down at the United Nations. This one goes to Security Council members as early as today. There, members will craft a resolution that'll keep the process under review and allow the U.N. to consider the use of force if Syria fails to comply. "If the Assad regime believes that this is not enforceable, then they will play games," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday. French President Francois Hollande has said that the council might vote on it by the end of the week.
'Use of force'? Hasn't Russia consistently said that's a no-go?
Yes, and it's still standing firm on that. So what happens if Syria doesn't comply? More on that below.
Why Russia, Iran and China have Syria's back Isn't there big news coming today? A long-awaited report by U.N. weapons inspectors will be released today, but it'll probably only confirm what many already suspect -- that chemical weapons were used near Damascus on August 21. The United States says more than 1,400 people, including children, were gassed to death in that attack. And that incident set off the flurry of events that has brought us to this point today. But what the U.N. report won't say is this: Who was behind the attack -- the regime or the rebels?
So, when is the first real test of Syria's sincerity? Next week. The regime has until then to provide its full list: How big its stockpile is, what kinds of are weapons are in it, and where are they stored.
How big is the stash?
U.S. intelligence believes Syria has about 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, most of it sarin and VX stored as unmixed components, Kerry said last week. Sarin and VX are nerve gases that can cause convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure and death. And they may be stored in about 50 different sites, the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel says.
How many inspectors will it take to get rid of it all?
No one's really sure. The Russian-U.S. plan doesn't specify a number. It says the inspectors will come from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the U.N. may have a role. However, David Kay, a former U.N. and U.S. weapons inspector, thinks it'll take 500 to 1,000 people just to secure the sites.
What are the major challenges?
Where do we begin? First off, there's a civil war going on. No one's brought up if troops will be needed to protect the inspectors as they go about their work.
Then there's the matter of where the weapons will be taken, and how.
The Russian-U.S. plan mentioned the possibility of collecting and destroying them in the coastal area of Syria, which is under government control. But who would protect the convoys headed there? Will the regime fully cooperate? And will rebels agree to a cease-fire as the weapons are being moved?
The U.S. and Russia say they're working on the details. They say they'll submit something in the next few days.
Given these mammoth challenges, how feasible is it that all stockpiles can be destroyed by mid-2014?
That's a question worth asking. To put things in perspective, U.N. inspectors who were searching for Saddam Hussein's stocks of chemical weapons crisscrossed Iraq for seven years in the 1990s. They had unrestricted freedom of movement. And even though they were dealing with an obstructive regime, at least they were not trying to work during a war.
Framework for eliminating chemical weapons
How current is our intelligence about where these sites are? What if Syria's moved its stash?
In a way, Syria is on the honor system, especially since both U.S. officials and Syrian rebels suspect the regime has been moving around parts of its stockpile. "I think we may know where they were, and we may know where maybe a majority are now," Kay says. "But look, it's going to be up to the Syrians to disclose where they are and the amounts that they have."
Last week, Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, said he had information that the regime has started to move chemical weapons and materials into Lebanon and Iraq. Iraq denied the allegation, calling it "cheap propaganda."
So, the ball's in Syria's court -- so to speak. What if it doesn't comply?
Remember that resolution we talked about earlier that the Security Council is trying to draft? It allows for use of force to compel Syria to cooperate.
But Russia's against that, right?
Yes, Russia has veto power. And it's consistently said it won't stand for military strikes on its ally Syria.
In that case, what happens?
The U.S. might go it alone. That option's not off the table. "If diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act," President Barack Obama has said. Kerry reiterated the point Monday: "The military option is still on the table."
Finally, is the situation on the ground any better?
Unfortunately, no. The bloodshed hasn't stopped for a day. At least 91 people were killed across Syria on Sunday, including six children, the opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011.

Nigeria's Boko Haram targets Christian town and fishing village in latest attacks From Aminu Abubakar, for CNN updated 6:59 AM EST, Tue February 18, 2014
Police officers stand guard in front of the burnt-out remains of buildings in the village of Konduga, Nigeria, on February 12, 2014.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Boko Haram kills at least 106 people in an attack targeted at males, officials, residents say
In another village, some victims drown in Lake Chad as they flee Islamists' gunfire
Boko Haram's insurgency has left hundreds dead in northeastern Nigeria
Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Dozens of residents in northeastern Nigeria have been killed in two separate attacks launched by Boko Haram Islamists, according to officials and residents.
Scored of Islamist insurgents dressed in military uniforms stormed the Christian farming village of Izghe, in Borno state, late Saturday and opened sporadic fire on residents, killing at least 106 people in an attack specifically targeted at male residents.
The gunmen, who arrived in the village riding in trucks and on several motorcycles, opened fire and hacked male residents they had assembled in the village square. They moved door to door in search of male residents who were hiding.
The attack prompted an exodus of hundreds of panic-stricken residents of nearby villages to the neighboring Madagali district in Adamawa state.

U.S. designates Boko Haram as terrorists
"We suspect that the gunmen were members of Boko Haram. They have taken over the village," said Madagali local government chairman, Maina Ularamu..
The attackers looted businesses and food stores "and loaded all their spoils into vehicles owned by residents and fled into the bush," said Ularamu.
A survivor of the attack, farmer Barnabas Idi, said he scaled the fence of his house and crawled for about 40 minutes to safety. Idi said that security agents were not present during the attack.
In the second attack early Saturday, suspected Boko Haram gunmen opened fire on Doron Baga, a fishing village along Lake Chad.
"They opened fire from all directions, forcing residents to jump into the lake in a bid to escape, and many drowned while others were gunned down," said Babagana Gwoni, a survivor of the attack.
The gunmen looted fish and foodstuffs before setting houses on fire, Gwoni said.
Lt. Col. Mohammed Dole, a military spokesman, confirmed the Doron Baga attack but declined to give details.
"We received report of the attack on Doron Baga, but we don't have details because the area falls under the operational jurisdiction of the Multinational Joint Task Force," Dole said.
The Multinational Joint task Force comprises troops from Nigeria, Niger and Chad and was set up in 1998 primarily to fight light weapons proliferation. Its mandate has been expanded to include combating the Boko Haram insurgency.

Battered athletes may suffer the consequences
We see it on the field, in the rink and in the ring. Athletes in high-contact sports suffering concussions - a brain injury caused by a strong blow to the head that can cause dizziness, headache, memory loss, and even a loss of consciousness. Every year players in the National Football League suffer concussions and risk life-altering consequences, particularly those who experience multiple concussions.For decades athletes have called them "dings," and some shook them off, "playing through" the injuries that some doctors now link to depression, dementia and even suicide - once an athlete's playing days are over. In a study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina, the rate of depression for players who had five or more concussions was three times that of players with no history of concussion.And what about children who play sports? Studies spanning the last 20 years show that nearly 20 percent of high school players - nearly 250,000 kids - suffer concussions yearly, moving experts to call for better education among players, trainers, coaches and parents. If you've had one concussion your brain needs time to heal because head injuries can cause lasting problems. And we know that a player who has had a concussion has a greater risk of having another one. But if your brain hasn't healed from the first, your next concussion could be fatal. There's a lot that we don't know about concussion, but with all we do know, do players, coaches and parents need to start taking them more seriously. Has your child suffered a concussion playing high school sports? How long did you make him or her wait before resuming play?

A beautiful addition to the family
One week ago, my wife delivered our second child. Up to the point of the delivery, we had no idea whether the baby was a boy or a girl. She is definitely a girl. Very pretty, very mild mannered. Beautiful. We could not be happier. My wife and I are both pretty compulsive people. Yes, we had a birth plan and everything went pretty much as we anticipated. To prepare, I have been reading tons of books written by friends such as Dr. Laura Jana, who often calls to check in on us. Thanks, Laura. I also have read several books by Heidi Murkoff and Dr Ari Brown, who have both been guests on my show. My wife is partial to "The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy." Without a doubt, there are many great books out there and great resources. Still, I am not sure any amount of reading can truly prepare you for your second child. It is a very different experience from the first. Truth is, I could write a book about all that I have felt over the last week. My friend and colleague John Vause sent his greetings from China and very correctly stated that we "had gone from being a couple with a kid - to a real family." A real family. Interestingly, one of the most powerful emotions I felt had more to do with my 19-month-old daughter. I was so used to seeing her as a baby, and suddenly she seemed grown up, too grown up. When she offered to go get her new sister's diaper, I was both amused and sad. Wasn't she still our baby too? It is when your children grow up that you are truly forced to stare into the face of mortality. As I reflect now, I realize that I wasn't quite ready for that. I am sure that it will get better over the weeks and months, and then our new one will suddenly seem too grown up. In the mean time, I want to enjoy our moments.I typically don't solicit parenting advice, but I wanted to get a discussion going here about what experiences other parents have had, especially bringing their second child home, and wondering whether you raised your second child any differently from your first. And, what advice for me do you have on new-dad bonding?

Women's heart disease still poorly understood
As wives and girlfriends and sisters and friends worry that the men in their lives who smoke, eat big steaks and covet the couch will have a heart attack, I'm going to let you in on something the American Heart Association says fewer than one in five doctors know:Heart disease kills more women than men.The statistics are a study in superlatives.Women are six times as likely to die of heart disease than breast cancer.Heart disease kills more women older than 65 than all cancers combined.And that has Dr. Sharonne Hayes, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women Heart Clinic frustrated."We need to be able to tell women whether the diagnostic tests we order are accurate and how treatments will affect them, but today we don't have enough data specific to women," says Hayes. She's just published research showing sex differences continue to be poorly understood.She attributes it to the fact that far fewer women are included in clinical trials, and even when they are included, study results are not sex-specific. Other facts: -Men and women respond differently to certain heart medications. -Even aspirin affects men and women differently: In women, aspirin therapy seems to reduce the risk of stroke more than in men, while in men it reduces the risk of heart attack. -A woman may experience different heart attack symptoms. Men and women are both likely to feel chest pain, but women may also feel it in their neck, back or abdomen. -Depression affects women's hearts more than men's. -Smoking is much worse for women than men.Why?Doctors don't fully understand it yet but suggest hormones, particularly estrogen receptors in the heart, may play a role.For both sexes, heart disease is often avoidable. Don't smoke. Maintain your weight. Get regular blood pressure and cholesterol screenings.And knowledge helps.Everyone from the Dr. Hayes to the first lady of the United States to our own Paula Zahn will be wearing red this Friday ... it's the American Heart Association's "National Wear Red" day to raise awareness.So when you see people in red, remember: More women than men die of heart disease.Pass it on.Will you be wearing red to support heart disease awareness?

Doctor Salisu's Hospital
My interview with Dr. SalisuAs Americans, we can take for granted our access to safe health care. Even people without health insurance can still see a doctor when they are sick.In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, having a doctor or any kind of health care nearby is still very much a luxury. But that's changing in the northern part of the country.Recently, I visited a hospital in Katsina State near the border of the Niger Republic. I spoke with Dr. Salisu Barau Banye, who was born and raised in Katsina and has practiced medicine in the area for more than 25 years. When many of his generation were leaving Nigeria for opportunities abroad, Dr. Salisu chose to stay and serve his community.Dr. Salisu works at Katsina General Hospital, which is considered a shining star for health care in northern Nigeria. People travel there from neighboring Nigerian states and even the Niger Republic. The tiny hospital treats 1,500 people a day and is open nearly around the clock. Just eight years ago, the hospital did not have a clean water supply, consistent electric power or adequate staff. But the government of Katsina State has invested millions of dollars into health care, and Dr. Salisu's patients are beginning to thrive. Like many places in Africa, the plague of poverty is the doctor's biggest foe. Infections, malaria, food-borne illnesses and malnutrition are some of the major maladies in Katsina. Dr. Salisu and his colleagues say they are continuing to provide the three A's of health care: availability, accessibility and affordability. Thanks to funding from the Katsina State Government the hospital provides:Free prenatal care and deliveryFree kidney dialysisFree treatment of malariaFree emergency treatment of accident victimsDiscounted prescription medicinesNew equipment, facilities, ambulances, better-trained doctors, nurses and midwives, improved immunizations and even a state-of-the-art intensive care unit have created an oasis of high-quality health care in a very rural area. It's now Dr. Salisu's goal to bring more primary-care facilities to villages so people will not have to travel as far to be treated for more common illnesses. Easy access to health care is improving in this part of the world. Can you get medical care when you need it where you live?

Injecting your way to a younger face
Watching Dr. Lisa Airan, cosmetic dermatologist to New York's glamourotti transform a 40-something single mom into a 30ish-looking woman with a few pricks of a needle, I'm thinking, injectable facial fillers look as easy as hitting a "refresh button" on your face. For the uninitiated, facelifts lift, lasers sand, Botox relaxes, and injectible facial fillers plump up wrinkles and folds. Face work no longer requires extended periods behind dark glasses. Minimally invasive cosmetic procedures are skyrocketing: 8.4 million people in the United States had this type of work done in 2005. While Botox remains the most popular minimally invasive procedure, facial fillers are elbowing their way in: Restylane remains the dominant player, but enter a crop of recently FDA- approved fillers: among them, Juvederm, Radiesse, and Artefill. Users find the immediate gratification and few side effects (bruising and swelling) attractive. But fillers can be expensive: hundreds of dollars per syringe - several times a year. As Dr. Alan Matarasso, spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons points out, annually, a face-full of fillers may be comparable to facelift in terms of cost. Artefill is billed as the first permanent filler, and may alleviate wallet and needle fatigue. Experts warn, Artefill is not a great choice as a first-time filler, and it's not approved for lips. Also be careful about who's plumping your face. There's an aesthetic involved - and more isn't necessarily better. Fillers aren't insurance reimburseable, and even dentists are getting into the act. Dr. Matarasso says lips are the biggest offender in terms of looking "overdone."Are fillers really safe? It's "buyer beware" according to Dr. Matarasso, who notes that no long-term studies support safety claims. Finally, less into needles, more into natural? Key factors for face preservers: avoid weight fluctuations and the sun. Not as dramatic as hitting the "refresh button" - but it works for me.Do you have facial fillers, or are you considering them? Tell us your stories.

(MayoClinic.com) Penis-enlargement products and procedures aren't difficult to find. Men's magazines, radio shows and the Internet are full of ads for pumps, pills, weights, exercises and even surgeries that claim to increase the length and width of your penis. However, there's very little scientific support for any nonsurgical methods to enlarge the penis. And no reputable medical organization endorses penis surgery for purely cosmetic reasons. Most of the techniques you see advertised are ineffective, and some can damage your penis. So think twice before trying any of them. Don't Miss
Boomer's Health
Penis size: What's normal, what's not?
The fear that your penis looks too small or is too small to satisfy your partner during sex is a common fear. But a number of studies have shown that most men who think their penises are too small actually have normal-sized penises. Similarly, studies suggest than many men have an exaggerated idea of what constitutes "normal" penis size. Consider that:
The average penis measures somewhere between 3 and 5 inches (or about 8 to 13 centimeters) when not erect, and between 5 and 7 inches (13 to 18 centimeters) when erect.
A penis is considered abnormally small only if it measures less than 3 inches (or about 7 centimeters) when erect, a condition called micropenis.
How partners view penis size
The popular media and advertisers would have you believe that your partner cares deeply about penis size. The issue of attraction is complex, but numerous studies suggest that penis size is much lower on the list of priorities for women than such issues as a man's personality. Unfortunately, there's little research about gay men's perceptions about their partners' penis size. But keep in mind that understanding your partner's needs and desires is more likely to improve your sexual relationship than trying to change the size of your penis.
Don't believe the hype
Companies offer many different types of nonsurgical penis-enlargement treatments, and often promote them with serious-looking advertisements that include endorsements from "scientific" researchers. But if you look closely, you'll see that claims of safety and effectiveness haven't been proved So, marketers rely on testimonials, skewed data and questionable before-and-after photos.
On close inspection of so-called sexual enhancement supplements, you may notice a sentence such as, "These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)." Indeed, manufacturers don't have to provide evidence to the FDA of safety or effectiveness before putting dietary supplements on the market.
Penis-enlargement products
Most advertised penis-enlargement methods are ineffective, and some can cause permanent damage to your penis. Here are some of the most widely promoted products and techniques:
Pills and lotions. These usually contain vitamins, minerals, herbs or hormones that claim to enlarge the penis. None of these products has been proved to work, and some may be harmful.
Vacuum pumps. Because pumps draw blood into the penis and make it swell, they're sometimes used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Using a penis pump more often and for longer than typically used for erectile dysfunction can damage elastic tissue in the penis, leading to less-firm erections. Using a vacuum pump can create an illusion of a larger penis, but results are not permanent.
Exercises. Sometimes called jelqing, these exercises use a hand-over-hand motion to push blood from the base to the head of your penis. Although this technique appears safer than other methods, it can lead to scar formation, pain and disfigurement. There are no scientific studies that indicate this technique is effective at increasing penis size.
Stretching. Stretching consists of attaching a stretcher or extender device to the penis. These devices exert traction on the penis. A few small studies have reported increases of half an inch to almost an inch (about 1 to 2 cm) in length with these devices. However, the studies are not of high quality and more rigorous research is needed before this technique can be considered safe and effective.
Surgery is risky and may not work
Studies have shown that the majority of men who undergo penis-enlargement surgery aren't satisfied with the results. At best, surgery may add half an inch (1 cm) to the length of the flaccid penis. At worst, surgery can result in complications such as infection, scarring, and loss of sensation or function.
Surgical methods of penis enlargement — Not for cosmetic use
The need for penis-enlargement surgery is rare. Surgery is typically reserved for men whose penis doesn't function normally because of a birth defect or injury. Although cosmetic penis enlargement is offered by some surgeons, it's controversial and considered by many to be unnecessary and potentially harmful. A few different techniques are used to lengthen a penis. All of them should be considered experimental. There aren't enough studies of penis-enlargement surgery to give an accurate picture of risks and benefits. The most widely used surgical procedure to lengthen the penis involves severing the suspensory ligament that attaches the penis to the pubic bone and moving skin from the abdomen to the penile shaft. When this ligament is cut, the penis appears longer because more of it hangs down. But cutting the suspensory ligament can cause an erect penis to be unstable. Severing the suspensory ligament is sometimes combined with other procedures, such as removing excess fat over the pubic bone. A procedure to make the penis thicker involves taking fat from a fleshy part of the body and injecting it into the shaft of the penis. The results are often disappointing, however, because much of the injected fat is reabsorbed by the body. This can lead to curvature or asymmetry of the penis. Another technique for increasing width is grafting tissue onto the shaft of the penis.
None of these procedures has been proved to be safe or effective.
A few things that might actually help
Although there's no guaranteed safe and effective way to enlarge your penis, there are a few things you can do if you're concerned about your penis size.
Communicate with your partner. It may be hard to break old habits or to discuss sexual preferences with your partner. But you'll be glad you did — and you may be surprised at the spark it puts back in your sex life.
Get in shape and lose the belly fat. If you're overweight and have a "beer gut," you might look as if you have a shorter penis than you actually do. Regular exercise can make a big difference. Better physical conditioning may not only make you look better, but can also give you more strength and endurance during sex.
Trim your pubic hair. A lot of pubic hair around the base of your penis can make your penis look shorter. Trimming may make your penis look bigger. It may also increase sensitivity around the base of your penis.
Talk to your doctor or a counselor. Feeling unhappy about the size of your penis is a common problem. A certified counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist or your family doctor can help. Many men feel better with reassurance that they are "normal" or with advice about how to better satisfy their partner without resorting to cosmetic penis enlargement.
The bottom line
Many men think they have a small penis and that increasing the size of their penis will make them a better lover or make them more attractive. But chances are your penis is within the normal size range. Even if your penis is smaller than average, it may not matter as much as you thought. Before you resort to time-consuming, expensive or dangerous techniques that will be minimally effective at best, consider other options.
The most effective solution may be as easy as talking with your partner or getting in shape. If those steps don't help, try talking with a professional counselor about your concerns.
