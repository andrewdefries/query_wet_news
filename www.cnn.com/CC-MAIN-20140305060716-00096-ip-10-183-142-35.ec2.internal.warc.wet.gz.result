Woman charged in death of eviscerated pregnant teenStory Highlights Woman charged with homicide in death of teen whose uterus was cut open Suspect showed up at hospital with baby that's not hers, police say Placenta, teen's body found in suspect's apartment, authorities say Authorities don't know whether victim was baby's mother Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A Pennsylvania woman has been charged in the slaying of an 18-year-old woman who was found with her uterus cut open and her fetus removed, authorities said Sunday. Andrea Curry-Demus is charged with homicide in the death of a woman whose uterus was cut open. Andrea Curry-Demus, 38, of Wilkinsburg was charged Sunday with criminal homicide kidnapping and unlawful restraint in connection with last week's death of Kia Johnson, Allegheny County police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said. Police found Johnson's body in Curry-Demus' apartment Friday, two days after Curry-Demus arrived at a hospital with a newborn and falsely claimed that the baby was hers, authorities said. Police have not confirmed whether the infant belonged to Johnson, whose family reported her missing last week. Johnson's eviscerated body -- which police said they found after receiving calls about a foul odor coming from the apartment -- "was in a state of moderate decomposition," and she had been dead about two days, Medical Examiner Karl Williams said. The cause of death hasn't been determined, he said. The woman's hands and feet were bound by duct tape, police said. A placenta was found at the scene, Williams told reporters. Authorities said they used dental records to confirm Johnson's identity. Drugs were found at the apartment, and authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine whether she was sedated, Williams said. It's unclear whether Johnson was alive when her infant was taken, he added. Wilkinsburg Police Chief Ophelia Coleman said Johnson's body was not found earlier because Curry-Demus' sister led investigators to another apartment. The sister has not been charged, Coleman said. Police said Curry-Demus arrived by ambulance at a local hospital with a newborn boy Wednesday, claiming that she had just given birth. Hospital personnel determined that she hadn't given birth, so they contacted police, authorities said. According to a criminal complaint, Curry-Demus told Detective Rich Grande that she purchased the baby from a woman named Tina for $1,000. Curry-Demus told Grande she had suffered a miscarriage in June and "did not want her mother to get upset," according to the complaint. Don't Miss WTAE: Autopsy provides clues

According to the complaint, Curry-Demus said Tina showed up with her newborn wrapped in a towel and left. Curry-Demus said she called medics because the baby was still "dirty from birth," the complaint said. The baby is in good condition, a hospital spokeswoman said, and will be released to child welfare workers when he is ready. Criminal homicide is a broad charge that covers a variety of murder or manslaughter counts, said Mike Manko, a spokesman for the Allegheny County district attorney's office. More specific charges could be brought as the case moves through the courts, Manko said. "At some point after a case is held for court, then the general charge of criminal homicide will be made more specific," he said. Curry-Demus was charged Thursday with endangering the welfare of a child, a felony, and dealing in infant children, a misdemeanor, after she brought the newborn to the hospital, authorities said. Watch Andrea Curry-Demus being taken into custody » Moffatt said investigators don't know how long Curry-Demus and Johnson knew each other. Investigators have reason to believe that the two recently were visiting inmates at the Allegheny County Jail at the same time. "We don't know if they met there," Moffatt said. Friends and relatives said Curry-Demus had told them she was pregnant for months, even having a baby shower. "I went to the baby shower and her wedding," Ivee Blunt said. "I had no idea something like this could happen. I'm totally shocked. And she was so nice and kind. It's just unbelievable." But sister-in-law Stephanie Epps said Curry-Demus would never allow her to touch her stomach. "Pregnant women do things like that," Epps said. "They're happy because they're pregnant. But she would never do none of that." Being led out of the Wilkinsburg Police Department, Curry-Demus told reporters, "I didn't do nothing," according to WTAE. According to court records obtained by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Curry-Demus became pregnant at 12 and miscarried four months later. She had a second miscarriage in 1990, when she was 21, the paper said. Only a few months after the second miscarriage, Curry-Demus befriended a woman who had just given birth but later attacked her with a knife and tried to steal the baby, the paper said, citing the court records. The woman's husband intervened, the newspaper reported, and she fled. The next day, she went to a hospital and befriended a woman who had brought her 3-week-old daughter to the hospital to be treated for meningitis, the Tribune-Review said. When the woman went home for the night, Curry-Demus left the hospital with the baby. It was found at her home, unharmed, the following day. In 1991, according to the records, she pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from both incidents and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison, the newspaper reported. She was paroled in August 1998 and ordered to serve 10 years of probation, the paper said. The newspaper reported, citing court records, that Curry-Demus was examined by psychiatrists at the Allegheny County Jail before her sentencing and was diagnosed with severe depression, personality disorders and auditory hallucinations. She told doctors she spent a lot of time thinking about her miscarriages and "kept hearing babies cry," the Tribune-Review said. Wilkinsburg is just east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This year, a Kansas woman was sentenced to death in the 2004 killing of a Missouri woman whose baby was cut from her womb. Lisa Montgomery was convicted in October in the death of Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23, who was found strangled in her Skidmore, Missouri, home. Stinnett's womb was cut open, and her unborn child was missing. Montgomery was found days later at home in Kansas, where she was attempting to pass the baby off as her own.

Make sure your pet enjoys your vacation, tooStory Highlights Look for professional pet sitters that are bonded and insured Invite the sitter to your home for an interview before your trip Familiarize the sitter with your home and the special needs of your pet Next Article in Travel » By Marnie Hunter CNN (CNN) -- Worried about how Fido will fare while you're away? Do some research to minimize the stress of leaving your pet in someone else's care. Start well in advance of your trip to find quality care for your pet. Many travelers look to friends and neighbors for pet care, and although this arrangement may be working, experts caution against relying too heavily on them. Sometimes friends get wrapped up in other things and may not routinely visit your precious companion. "If they are just looking in on the pet on a fly-by-night basis, they may not necessarily remember all the time," said Kelly Connolly, an issues specialist at the Humane Society of the United States. "It just tends to work a little better if you can go into it and look at pet-sitting as more of a business contract than just a favor." Finding a sitter Ask friends, neighbors and veterinarians for recommendations on professional animal caregivers well in advance of your trip, Connolly recommends. If you can't find a pet sitter that way, you might check with your local humane society or a dog trainer. Connolly also suggests using online pet-sitter locator tools provided by Pet Sitters International or the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters. "Pet owners should look for pet sitters that can provide references and take the time to check those references and make sure that this is someone that they want to provide a key to their home for," said John Long, a spokesman for Pet Sitters International. Don't Miss In Depth: Travel Companion
Long also encourages owners to look for pet sitters that are bonded and insured. It's a good idea to ask about that in an initial phone interview. Also, make sure the sitter is comfortable with administering medication or tending to other special needs your animals might have, and tell the sitter about all the pets he or she would be expected to look after. "A lot of people will have other animals, and you need to know people's experience and comfort level with that, because not everyone will be comfortable feeding or harvesting slugs from the garden for the turtle," said Dr. Dianne Dunning, associate professor at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, whose family counts a frog, a turtle and a gecko among its menagerie. Home interview Once you've contacted a pet sitter who seems to match up with your pet's particular needs, invite that person to your home for an interview. This gives the potential sitter a chance to interact with your pet, and it gives you the opportunity to gauge how comfortable you and your animal feel with that person. The home visit also gives pet owners a chance to familiarize the sitter with the house, the location of supplies, and areas the pet frequents or is not allowed to roam. Find out how often the sitter would visit, whether he or she would stay in your home and what backup plans are in place in the event that the sitter is not able to care for your pet. Kennel stays Many pet owners prefer to leave their pets at home -- rather than taking them to boarding facilities -- to avoid travel trauma, the stress of a new environment and exposure to illnesses carried by other animals. "It can be more stressful than keeping your pet in your own house, mostly because the pet will be staying in an unfamiliar environment, and he will be proximal to other pets," Connolly said. But home care may not always be the best option. "If your pet has some sort of medical problem or if they're older or more frail, you may want to consider boarding them at a veterinarian's office or a kennel just because they're more likely to have 24-hour care and have medical care available to them," Connolly said. Some kennels now offer special exercise and weight-loss programs, and socialization can be stimulating for some animals, Dr. Dunning said. If you board your pet, check the kennel's insurance, licensing and bonding, Dunning suggests. Choosing a good kennel is very similar to choosing a good pet sitter: Get references, visit in person and make sure you're comfortable with the staff and the facility.

Romney defends record as Huckabee wins straw pollStory HighlightsNEW: Huckabee gets nearly 29 percent of vote; 4 others get about 12 percent eachRomney speech at Values Voter Summit focuses on economic, security policyHe criticizes Obama's financial record, stand on intelligence agentsHe defends record after criticism from rival Huckabee at 3-day conferenceNext Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Rebecca Sinderbrand CNN Political Producer	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A day after former Baptist minister and likely presidential rival Mike Huckabee offered a withering critique of Mitt Romney's record, the former Massachusetts governor made his pitch to the same group of religious conservatives. As Mitt Romney, left, defended his health care record Saturday, Mike Huckabee won a vote. Romney appealed to attendees at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Saturday, using a speech that drew heavily from his address to social conservatives at the same hotel earlier this year. "Putting such a spirit-crushing, back-breaking debt burden on our children is unworthy of our national character," he said. "That is why I believe that this spending and borrowing is not just economically irresponsible, it is morally wrong." The former Republican presidential candidate, widely considered a likely 2012 contender, was on the ballot for the gathering's 2012 presidential straw poll, along with Huckabee, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Indiana Rep. Mike Pence and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Huckabee won the straw poll Saturday, grabbing nearly 29 percent of the vote. Romney, Pawlenty, Palin and Pence each won roughly 12 percent of the 597 votes cast. Just four of the eight prospective GOP standard-bearers spoke at the three-day conference: Romney, Pence, Huckabee, and Pawlenty. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who will speak later Saturday, earlier asked that his name be removed from the straw poll ballot. Despite the makeup of the crowd, Romney's speech was relatively light on social issues, focusing instead on economic and security policy. Watch what Romney has to say at the summit » Don't Miss 'Romney care' touted as model for health care reform
He blasted the Obama administration's financial track record and its decision to consider prosecuting intelligence agents who violated government protocols on the interrogation of prisoners. "[President Obama] can spin a speech, but he can't spin his record," said Romney. "And I'll bet you never dreamed you'd look back at Jimmy Carter as the good old days." Romney has eked out several victories in similar recent measures of conservative presidential preference, including the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll earlier this year, and the last Values Voter Summit contest, held two years ago. He narrowly defeated Huckabee that year in voting that was allowed over the Web. This year's vote is limited to conference attendees. Watch the House GOP leader talk about health care and the summit » Romney, a Mormon who battled Huckabee for evangelical support during the 2008 Republican primary season, drew a polite, though not overwhelming, response from activists Saturday. He continued to make a bid for social conservative support, taking aim at Obama's address to the nation's schoolchildren earlier this month: He backed the president's decision to speak to students, but slammed him for failing to focus on the challenges of single parenthood and out-of-wedlock births. Romney's efforts to reform health care in Massachusetts have come under fire from Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor. "In fact, the only thing inexpensive about Massachusetts' health care bill is that there, you can get a $50 abortion," Huckabee said, drawing instant pushback from the Romney camp. On Saturday, the former Massachusetts governor continued the defense of the health care overhaul launched during his tenure and criticized Obama's health care plan. "This Republican worked to reform health care in my own state," he said. "Not every feature of our plan is perfect, but the lesson it teaches is this: You can get everyone insured, without breaking the bank and without a government option. There is no government option in my Massachusetts reform. The right answer for health care is not more government, it is less government." Romney's criticism of the president's health care plan drew a muffled shout of "He lied!" from a man in the audience, followed by a round of laughter and applause from the crowd. The Democratic National Committee, which blasted Pawlenty after his conference speech Friday, also slammed Romney's remarks Saturday. "If Mitt Romney thinks pandering to the far right is a winning strategy, that's his choice," Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan said. "Of course, it didn't work out so well for him last time. Maybe that's because, given how often he changes his position on issues, he has no credibility with the right. And given how often he's misrepresenting the truth, he doesn't have much credibility with anyone else, either." Conference breakout panels Saturday afternoon are scheduled to include Global Warming Hysteria: The New Face of the "Pro-Death Agenda"; Obamacare: Rationing Your Life Away; Activism and Conservatism: Fit to a (Tea) Party; and Thugocracy: Fighting the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy. The summit's straw poll results -- an early look at the state of the 2012 race -- are scheduled for release mid-afternoon.

Law firm backs out of defending federal Defense of Marriage Act By Bill Mears, CNN Lawyer Paul Clement resigned from King & Spalding after the law firm pulled out of the Defense of Marriage Act case. STORY HIGHLIGHTSA spokesman says Boehner is "disappointed"King & Spalding says the vetting for accepting representation was "inadequate"Attorney Paul Clement has resigned from the firm"Defending unpopular clients is what lawyers do," Clement wrote Washington (CNN) -- The private law firm hired by House Speaker John Boehner to represent the government in the federal Defense of Marriage Act has suddenly pulled out of the case. The chairman of King & Spalding said Monday the firm's internal vetting for accepting representation was "inadequate." As a result, the high-profile lawyer who was to lead the legal fight for House Republicans has resigned immediately from the firm. Paul Clement, who was a top partner at the firm, wrote in a letter, "I resign out of the firmly held belief that a representation should not be abandoned because the client's legal position is extremely unpopular in certain quarters. Defending unpopular clients is what lawyers do." He will now defend the statute for another law firm. The decision by the Atlanta-based law firm to withdraw is a victory for gay-rights supporters that have tried to have the Defense of Marriage Act repealed or tossed out on constitutional grounds in court. Those groups had urged King & Spalding in recent days to drop out of the case, and were preparing a national campaign to highlight the company's efforts. The Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states. The Obama administration, which normally would defend federal laws in judicial disputes, announced earlier this year it believed the Defense of Marriage Act, often referred to as DOMA, to be unconstitutional. The law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman. Boehner said that with the Justice Department not participating, he had "no choice" but to act unilaterally, and moved to lead the legal defense of the law. Robert Hays Jr., chairman of King & Spalding, said the firm had filed a motion Monday to withdraw its representation of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives, "on the constitutional issues" regarding the law. "In reviewing this assignment further, I determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate," Hays said in a statement. "Ultimately I am responsible for any mistakes that occurred and apologize for the challenges this may have created." Law firms typically undergo an internal review process headed by senior-level lawyers to determine which cases they will accept. Controversial issues like same-sex marriage are normally subject to intense scrutiny to balance the legal issues with financial, ethical, and other considerations. The Hays statement made no specific mention of the reasons behind the sudden change of heart. Clement said he is going to work for a Washington law firm, Bancroft PLLC. Legal sources say he will be taking a number a high-profile clients with him to his new job. Clement had filed a brief a week ago while at King & Spalding in a pending case from New York, where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died. He is a former solicitor general under President George W. Bush, serving from 2005 to 2008. It was his job to defend federal laws and executive actions in court, similar to what he will be doing now as a private lawyer on retainer. He was mentioned at one time as a possible Supreme Court nominee. Separately, he also is representing more than two dozen states in a lawsuit against the Obama administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by Congress last year. That case is pending in a federal appeals court in Atlanta. In his resignation letter, Clement made clear, "I take this step not because of strongly held views about this statute. My thoughts about the merits of DOMA are as irrelevant as my views about the dozens of federal statutes I defended as Solicitor General." "In this instance, my loyalty to the client and respect for the profession must come first," he wrote. "The Speaker is disappointed in the firm's decision and its careless disregard for its responsibilities to the House in this constitutional matter," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck told CNN. "At the same time, Mr. Clement has demonstrated legal integrity, and we are grateful for his decision to continue representing the House. This move will ensure the constitutionality of this law is appropriately determined by the courts, rather than by the president unilaterally." Papers have not yet been filed for Clement to continue representation of the House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had been vocal about her opposition to the decision to take on the case. "Leader Pelosi shares Mr. Hays' apparent concerns with the lack of transparency and accountability in the way this contract was signed," spokesman Drew Hammill told CNN. "She also vigorously opposes using half a million taxpayer dollars or any taxpayer resources to defend discrimination at a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting critical initiatives like education and infrastructure. It is now more critical than ever that Speaker Boehner fully account for his decision to sign this half million dollar contract to defend this indefensible statute." Boehner last week indicated he would make an effort to divert money from the Justice Department to fund its high-profile fight. "Obviously, DOJ's decision results in DOJ no longer needing the funds it would have otherwise expended defending the constitutionality of DOMA," he said April 18. "It is my intent that those funds be diverted to the House for reimbursement of any costs incurred by and associated with the House, and not DOJ, defending DOMA." Such a move would require Senate approval, an unlikely prospect since Democrats control that chamber. President Barack Obama on February 23 ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the law. "The president has concluded that given a number of factors, including a documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny," said Attorney General Eric Holder at the time. The key provision in the law "fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional," he said. Obama had previously expressed his personal opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality. Gay-rights supporters applauded the law firm's decision to withdraw. "King & Spalding has rightly chosen to put principle above politics in dropping its involvement in the defense of this discriminatory and patently unconstitutional law," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. "We are pleased to see the firm has decided to stand on the right side of history and remain true to its core values." Two pending lawsuits from New York and Connecticut challenge the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes both states, is the only federal circuit to have never decided the basic legal question of whether a law discriminates against gay men and lesbians. The New York legal fight was prompted by Edith "Edie" Windsor, who lived with her female partner, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades. They married out-of-state in 2007, but neither the federal government nor their home state of New York recognized the legal union. Spyer died and left her estate to Windsor, who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse. In July, a federal judge in Massachusetts, in a separate case, became the first to rule part of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. District Judge Joseph Tauro said that "irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest." The administration's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights. In December, Obama signed legislation that will repeal the controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces. Courts in California are considering a legal challenge to Proposition 8, an initiative narrowly approved by that state's voters in 2008. It defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Either one of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming months, perhaps in time to become a major issue during the 2012 election year. Same-sex marriage is legal in five states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont -- and in the District of Columbia. Civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in New Jersey, while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships. The New York case is Windsor v. U.S. (1:10-cv-08435).

Member of white supremacist group pleads guilty in Florida
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 5:29 PM EDT, Fri August 3, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Christopher Brooks pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm
He will serve three years in prison
Brooks was one of 14 people charged in the case of American Front
(CNN) -- A member of American Front, a white supremacist group, has pleaded guilty in Florida to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and will serve three years in prison, prosecutors said.
Christopher Brooks, 27, was one of 14 people charged this year in connection to an investigation into the group.
In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dropped two other felony counts -- participating in paramilitary training and conspiracy to shoot into an occupied dwelling -- according to Osceola County State Attorney's Office spokesman Bernie Presha.
Brooks, who pleaded guilty Wednesday, is the first of the 14 to resolve his case. The alleged ringleader of the group, Marcus Faella, is scheduled to go on trial this month.
According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups.
Faella, police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California.
The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL.
"Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race," investigators wrote in an affidavit, referring to the group by its initials. "Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."
According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a compound in Saint Cloud, Florida, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway.
The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote. The group was allegedly making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation.
The charges came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound after Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had made of training exercises, according to the arrest affidavit.
In Session's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report.

ISAF chief Gen. John Allen under investigation amid Petraeus probe
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 4:52 PM EST, Tue November 13, 2012
John Allen prepares to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 28, 2011, in Washington, DC.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Defense official: Allen has disputed that he did anything wrong
Official: There is a "distinct possibility" that this is connected to the Petraeus scandal
Investigators are looking into 20,000 to 30,000 pages of documents
(CNN) -- The spiraling scandal that took down David Petraeus has apparently ensnared another powerful general, as authorities announced that Gen. John Allen is under investigation for allegedly sending inappropriate messages to Jill Kelley, a woman who has been linked to the Petraeus scandal.
Allen, who is the commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, has denied any wrongdoing, a senior defense official said.
Details of the latest angle of the scandal that has shaken the highest level of the military were sketchy early Tuesday morning.
Timeline of the Petraeus affair
Some details about Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, came from a terse overnight statement by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.
Stone: Petraeus is a 'showman'
King: FBI should have informed Obama Ex-Petraeus spokesman: No Benghazi link
"On Sunday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred to the Department of Defense a matter involving General John Allen, Commander of the International Security Assistance Force (or ISAF) in Afghanistan," part of the statement said. "Today, the secretary directed that the matter be referred to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense for investigation."
A defense official told CNN there is a "distinct possibility" that the investigation into Allen is connected to the investigation that led to the resignation of Petraeus.
Allen will still retain his position as the commander of ISAF as the investigation continues, the Pentagon said.
But Panetta asked that Allen's nomination to become NATO's supreme allied commander be put on hold, the statement said.
The confirmation hearing to see if Allen would get that lofty military post was scheduled for Thursday.
Rep. King: Petraeus' resignation doesn't preclude testimony
The investigation was in its early stages but authorities were looking into some 20,000 to 30,000 pages of documents, the defense official said.
It was not immediately clear Tuesday exactly how Allen may be linked to the Petraeus investigation.
Petraeus, 60, resigned Friday after acknowledging he had an affair with a woman later identified as his biographer, Paula Broadwell, 40, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
The investigation into Petraeus came to light during an FBI investigation of "jealous" e-mails reportedly sent by Broadwell to a woman named Jill Kelley, a government source familiar with the investigation told CNN on Monday.
Now authorities say Allen was under investigation because of communications with Kelley.
Amid national talk about the Petraeus scandal, Kelley, 37, and her husband released a statement saying they have been friends with Petraeus and his family for more than five years and asked for privacy.

'Shredded bodies' in 'horrific' Benghazi blast
By Salma Abdelaziz and Jomana Karadsheh, CNN
updated 9:10 PM EDT, Mon May 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Apparent targeting of civilians shakes Libyans
NEW: State news quotes official as saying 13-year-old boy killed
The blast took place near a hospital in eastern Libya
Officials don't know who or what was targeted
(CNN) -- Children were among the victims Monday when a car bomb blew up near a hospital in the Libyan city of Benghazi, a security official told state TV.
"Children with shredded bodies and wounds to the head," Benghazi Security Directorate spokesman Tareq Khraz told state TV Libya Al Ahrar. "I cannot even describe the scene to you, but believe me, it was horrific."
The car bomb detonated near Al Jalaa hospital but not immediately in front of the building. Officials don't know at this point who or what was targeted.
Obama dismisses Benghazi criticism
Benghazi: Facts vs. politics
Discovering the truth about Benghazi The blast destroyed eight cars and caused damage to nearby buildings, Khraz said.
Khraz said that at least 13 people were killed and more than 40 wounded. The hospital director, speaking on Ahrar TV, had a lower toll: three dead and 15 wounded.
Later Monday, state news agency LANA quoted Abdullah al-Fitouri, a health ministry official in eastern Libya, as saying that four people were killed, but three have not been identified because of the "gruesomeness of the incident." The fourth body was identified, LANA reported, as a 13-year-old boy.
Libya's parliament condemned the bombings and suspended its Tuesday session to allow members to head to Benghazi to take part in the funerals.
Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, standing alongside General National Congress President Mohammed al-Magariaf and other members, said that Monday's explosion comes after a string of similar acts but that security forces have not been able to take strict measures against such attacks.
According to a CNN journalist there, the bombing seems to have shaken Libyans fiercely because of its civilian victims.
Over the past 18 months, Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya's revolution that toppled longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, has been the scene of attacks that mainly targeted security forces, Western diplomats and international organizations.
Gunmen attacked the U.S. diplomatic mission in the city on September 11, killing the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. The Obama administration's handling of that incident has come under much criticism and scrutiny.
Doomed Libya ambassador: 'We're under attack'
Most of the attacks in Benghazi have been blamed on extremist Islamist groups that have established a foothold in eastern Libya, according to Western intelligence officials who have spoken to CNN.
More than two years after the start of the revolution, the country is awash in weapons and hundreds of militias. Libyans frustrated with the security situation have called on the government to bolster security forces.
The government, in power since November, has been taking steps to curb militia groups and build a police and army force.
Libyan officials, particularly Zeidan, have said that securing and stabilizing the country remains a top challenge and a priority. But the process of doing that will take time and began only a few months ago, Zeidan said.
During the past two weeks, bombs have targeted a number of police stations in Benghazi. There were no casualties in these primarily overnight attacks.
Those attacks followed a few weeks of relative calm in a city that has been plagued by a fragile peace since the fall of Gadhafi, according to residents.
Benghazi residents said they felt that security had been improving before the most recent uptick in violence.
In light of the car bombing Monday, the Libyan military ordered army and pro-military militias to help Interior Ministry forces preserve security, the military command told state news.
And the U.N. Assistance Mission in Libya condemned the violence.
It issued this statement: "The Mission also underscores the need to support the legitimate authority of the State and enable it to shoulder its responsibilities in ensuring the safety and security of all citizens across Libya."

Why this verdict? Five things that led to Zimmerman's acquittal
By Chelsea J. Carter and Holly Yan, CNN
updated 10:08 AM EDT, Mon July 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Attorney: I think the prosecution overcharged the case in the very beginning
Prosecutor Angela Corey defends the decision to charge Zimmerman with murder A lack of witnesses who saw the entire incident made the case hard to prove Attorney: Trials are not always about the truth; "It's about what you can prove in court"
The George Zimmerman trial: What happened? What's next? Watch an "Anderson Cooper 360" special tonight at 8 ET on CNN.
(CNN) -- Five key issues factored into George Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday in last year's shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin:
1. The charges filed Did the prosecution make a mistake in filing a second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman?
"I think the problem was they overcharged it in the very beginning," said Holly Hughes, a criminal defense lawyer who was not on Zimmerman's legal team. Had prosecutors started with the manslaughter charge, the outcome might have been different, she told CNN.
But Florida State Attorney Angela Corey said the allegations "fit the bill" for the second-degree murder charge.

Zimmerman confers with his defense team on July 13, after working out the wording for a response to the jury, who had asked for clarification on the instructions regarding manslaughter. The response, crafted and agreed to by both the prosecution and defense, instructed the jury to ask their question more specifically, as the court could not engage in general discussion.

Prosecutor John Guy addresses the jury with his closing rebuttal during Zimmerman's murder trial on Friday, July 12. "He shot him because he wanted to," Guy told jurors, saying that Zimmerman didn't have to shoot 17-year-old Martin.
Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara holds up a chart during closing arguments for the defense on Friday, July 12. "How many 'what ifs' have you heard from the state in this case?" O'Mara asked the jury. "They don't get to ask you that."
Zimmerman, right, sits with another defense attorney, Don West, this week. West objected to a third-degree murder charge also sought by prosecutors on Thursday, July 11, the day closing arguments began. The judge ruled out that charge but said the jury could consider convicting the defendant of manslaughter.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement Crime Lab Analyst Anthony Gorgone testifies about DNA findings on Wednesday, July 3, in Sanford, Florida. Here, Gorgone points to a sweatshirt worn by Trayvon Martin on the night Martin was shot. Only one stain on Martin's hooded jacket yielded a partial DNA profile that matched Zimmerman's.
Gorgone points to a jacket worn by Zimmerman on the night of the shooting. Multiple stains on Zimmerman's jacket tested positive for Zimmerman's DNA. At least two stains from the jacket tested positive for a mixture of DNA that included Martin's DNA.
Firearms analyst Amy Siewert from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement answers questions from the prosecution while holding Zimmerman's gun on July 3. Siewert examined the gun and said Zimmerman had one bullet ready to fire in the chamber as well as a fully loaded magazine when the shooting occurred. Alexis Carter, a military prosecutor, testifies during the trial on July 3. Carter taught a criminal litigation class that Zimmerman completed, and testified that the class included extensive coverage of Florida's self-defense laws.
Mark Osterman, a U.S. Air Marshal and friend of Zimmerman's who wrote a book about the case, testifies on Tuesday, July 2. He recounted the story of the shooting that Zimmerman told him and testified that when he took Zimmerman home from the police station after the shooting, Zimmerman wasn't acting like himself. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, on July 2, demonstrates a possible scenario while questioning state witness Chris Serino, a Sanford police officer.
Hirotaka Nakasone, a voice recognition expert with the FBI, testifies in the Zimmerman trial on Monday, July 1.

Witness Jennifer Lauer points to where her former home was in the Retreat at Twin Lakes community during questioning by defense attorney Mark O'Mara on June 27. Lauer called 911 on the night of the shooting.
Rachel Jeantel, a friend of Martin's, is questioned by defense attorney Don West on June 27. She appeared to get frustrated several times during the cross-examination, including one time when West suggested they could break until the morning so she'd have more time to review the deposition transcript.
The evidence letter that Jeantel says she wrote with a friend for Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, is displayed during the trial on June 27. When the defense asked Jeantel to read the letter, she said she couldn't read cursive. She asked a friend to write the letter for her, she said.
Jeantel testifies on Wednesday, June 26. She was the last person to speak with Martin on the phone.

'F*****g punks, these a******s all get away,'" Guy quoted Zimmerman. "These were the words in this grown man's mouth as he followed this boy that he didn't know. Those were his words, not mine."

Photos: Reaction to Zimmerman verdict
Second-degree murder is defined as a killing carried out with hatred, ill will or spite, but is not premeditated. To convict Zimmerman of manslaughter, jurors would have had to believe he "intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of Trayvon Martin."
A verdict and more: Get caught up
Questions surfaced about whether the charge was appropriate because knowing a person's feeling during a killing is difficult to prove.
As a result, the prosecution had to rely on the evidence to tell the story of what happened and what led to the shooting, HLN's Ryan Smith said.
Without an abundance of evidence, proving the case was difficult for both sides.
Former Los Angeles County prosecutor Loni Coombs emphasized that jurors did not find Zimmerman innocent; rather, they found him not guilty. There's a difference, she told CNN's Don Lemon.
"They're not saying he's innocent, they're just saying they couldn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore the law gave them no choice but to write 'not guilty,'" Coombs said.
-- Trial days: 14
-- Exhibits: More than 200.
-- Total number of witnesses called to the stand: 56.
-- 911 calls played in the courtroom: Three (Zimmerman made a call to the non-emergency line).
-- Statements about the shooting made by Zimmerman: Seven.
-- Number of jurors who decided Zimmerman's fate: Six -- all women; five are white and one is black/Hispanic.
2. The evidence presented Zimmerman's account of what happened the night of the shooting was a central part of the trial. He was the only living person who witnessed the entire incident, and there wasn't much physical evidence for either team to fall back on.
Various adverse conditions played into the initial investigation that night: A dark, rainy scene isn't ideal for a homicide investigation, says HLN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks.
Much was made during the trial about why there was so little blood on Martin and Zimmerman, who said he fired in self defense because he was being beaten and feared for his life.
Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a former medical examiner in San Antonio and an expert on gunshot wounds, testified that the rain could have washed away and affected evidence collected from Martin's hands.
Attorney Faith Jenkins said it doesn't matter what a prosecutor believes if he or she doesn't have adequate evidence.
"Trials are not necessarily about the truth all the time," the former prosecutor told CNN. "It's about what you can prove in court."
There was so little evidence available that the defense put together an animated video to re-enact the events of that night based on witness statements, police reports and Zimmerman's account, they said.
The judge ruled against the use of the video.
Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death
3. The teen who spoke to Martin
She was on the phone with Martin moments before he was shot and was considered a key prosecution witness. But Rachel Jeantel initially resisted coming forward.
Father, son react to Zimmerman verdict "She did not want to get involved in this in no way possible," Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters Saturday.
Martin lawyer: 'We must all be peaceful'
During two days of testimony that was at times tense and combative, Jeantel described her conversation with Martin.
When defense attorney Don West challenged her story, suggesting Martin attacked Zimmerman, she responded: "That's retarded."
Jeantel testified that Martin told her he was being chased by a "creepy-a** cracker."
"This was a disaster," criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN's Anderson Cooper the day Jeantel testified. "This was the star witness, the star witness. The wheels came off and it was a train wreck. And there's no other -- there's no way to soft-pedal it."
Analysis: The race factor
4. The voice on the call
The mothers of Zimmerman and Martin each testified that screams for help heard on a 911 call the night of the shooting were those of her son.
Whose voice was heard on the call was considered key for both the prosecution and defense in proving who was responsible for the shooting. If the screams were Martin's, as the prosecution contended, Zimmerman was the aggressor. If the screams were Zimmerman's, as the defense said, Martin was the aggressor.
On July 5, in a packed courtroom, the prosecution played the recording for Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton.
When asked if she recognized the voice, Fulton said it belonged to "Trayvon Benjamin Martin."
Hours later, the defense called Gladys Zimmerman to the stand, where she testified the voice screaming for help belonged to her son.
"I know because he's my son," she said.
As a result, there was no definitive answer for jurors.
5. Testimony
The lead detective in the case, Chris Serino, was called to the stand by the prosecution.
Serino told the court that he believed Zimmerman exaggerated the number of times he was hit that night but didn't feel any "active deception."
"Either he was telling the truth or he was a complete pathological liar," he testified.

Missing Michigan doctor accused of stalking gospel artist Marvin Sapp
By Susanna Capelouto and Emma Lacey-Bordeaux, CNN updated 11:55 AM EST, Sun January 5, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Court records show Marvin Sapp filed a personal protection order against Teleka Patrick
Patrick was last seen a month ago on surveillance video; her car was found in a ditch
Patrick's family said she had a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida
(CNN) -- A 30-year-old Michigan doctor who has been missing for almost a month was accused in September of stalking gospel artist Marvin Sapp, court records show.
Teleka Patrick failed to show up for work in Kalamazoo on December 6. The night before, police 100 miles south in Indiana found her car abandoned in a ditch off busy Interstate 94.
Sapp, who has been nominated for eight Grammys, filed a personal protection order against her, in which he complains that Patrick "has claimed him as her husband, had moved from California to Michigan, joined his church, had contacted his children and had been to his home.
"I have at least 400 pages of correspondence from her which I have never responded," his complaint reads.
Videos show doctor who disappeared Patrick's family recognized that questions have arisen regarding the missing woman's mental health, but said the focus must remain on finding her.
"We are aware of media reports that are beginning to focus on Teleka's mental health, and while we encourage the pursuit of honest journalism and truth, we will not take part in sensationalizing Teleka's disappearance," the family said in a statement on Facebook.
"We believe that she has met with foul play and wholeheartedly believe that she is in danger," the statement said.
So far, investigators have little evidence in the missing person case.
Two home videos uploaded to YouTube feature Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown.
Patrick's mother told CNN she wasn't aware of any romantic relationship her daughter may have had. But the videos have an intimate feel to them.
"Hi, baby," Patrick says in one. "I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."
In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes.
"If you were here, this is what would be your plate," she coos.
The two videos were posted in early November.
A third video to surface came from a local hotel in Kalamazoo. That's where Patrick went the night of December 5, just hours before police found her car in the ditch in Indiana.
Videos raise more questions about missing doctor
At a little past 7:30 p.m., Patrick, dressed all in black, showed up at a Radisson hotel not far from the hospital where she worked.
She spent around 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left.
There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room.
But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus.
Those images provide the last known picture of Patrick.
Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida.
Her colleagues called her "part of our family of medical professionals."
Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary.
Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators the 30 or so feet out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the trace went cold.
