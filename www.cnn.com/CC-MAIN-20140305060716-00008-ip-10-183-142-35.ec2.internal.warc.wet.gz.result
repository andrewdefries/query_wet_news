Margaret Thatcher: 'The old girl is never going to come back'
Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- Five years after leaving the prime minister's office in Great Britain, Margaret Thatcher finished the second part of her memoir, "The Path to Power."As Larry King celebrates 50 years in broadcasting, take a look at some excerpts from her June 26, 1995, interview.KING: Lady Margaret Thatcher's new book, "The Path to Power," is already a major hit in Great Britain. ... These books were written in reverse, right? First "The Downing Street Years," then "The Path to Power."THATCHER: That's right. I thought it best to write "The Downing Street Years" while they were still fresh in my mind and I had access to all the documents. Then, people said, 'Well, how did you come to hold these views and so tenaciously?' So I wrote the story of that.KING: Which of the two books was harder to write?THATCHER: In a way, "The Path to Power," because there weren't so many documents, and I had to call heavily on local newspapers, local friends, and friends at all stages of my life. But the more you discovered, the more you remembered. And it was a most interesting journey. You don't often see your whole life laid before you, and you're really surprised, when you do, at the amount you've managed to do in your life.KING: Some people also find it tough to touch on painful areas. Was it for you?THATCHER: Yes, it was. But, then, quite a lot of my life has been, really, quite a battle.KING: How so?THATCHER: I've had to battle to get my views across. Well, a battle, certainly, in politics, because I had very strong views, stemming from quite fundamental principles, some of which I learned from my father. And, for quite a time, when we were both in our position and when I was in power, my views were in a minority in cabinet, or in shadow cabinet. And I nevertheless felt so strongly that I had to push them through. And then, there were some faint hearts in my party, and they didn't want us to be bold in our policies at all. And I said, 'But that's what I'm for. I'm here to say what I believe, and why, and to do it.'KING: Was yours a happy childhood, generally?THATCHER: Yeah, I think so.KING: Brothers and sisters?THATCHER: Yes, I had an elder sister. We were a very close-knit family. My father was a grocer, and my mother had been a dressmaker with her own business. He was also on our local council. He became mayor. He had had to leave school at the age of 13, because, in those days, you know, you couldn't go on easily without paying something for it. And so, he was the best self-educated man I ever met. He read and read and read and taught us to read.KING: When did you know you were different? I mean, most little girls don't grow up to be prime minister. We have yet to have a little girl grow up to be president. When did you know you were different?THATCHER: That's a strange question to ask. And for a moment, I have to think. I was very much aware from quite an early age, being the youngest in the family, I much preferred the company of my elders to the company of my contemporaries. I was much more interested in the things that they were talking about, because these were the '30s, and these were interesting times. They were times of great unemployment.KING: And you were a very young lady.THATCHER: Oh yes.KING: You must have felt different. 'Why aren't I hanging around with my 12-year-old friends?'THATCHER: I enjoyed the conversation and the company of older people very much. And I enjoyed the things they were talking about. And I listened, and then gradually came to join in. We were also quite a musical family, and we loved music, and we loved to sing songs around the piano sometimes.KING: How old were you when you said, 'I'm going to run for office?'THATCHER: Oh, I was, really, at university when I expressed the wish to become a member of parliament. And it wasn't I who really triggered that expression. We were just sitting around the kitchen table with a number of friends after a dance one evening. And we were talking about politics, of course. I was often talking about politics. And all of a sudden, one of my companions said, 'You want to be an M.P, don't you?' And it crystallized it for me, just like that. I said, 'Yes.' But I couldn't afford it. M.P.s [members of Parliament] weren't paid very much in those days.KING: So you ran when?THATCHER: When they were paid enough.KING: Britain has had a history of strong women. You had strong queens. Was it still unusual for women to be in parliament?THATCHER: It was still quite difficult for us to get into parliament, to get adopted. I remember I first put in for quite a tough, industrial seat, and the chairman said, 'We can't have a woman here. This is an industrial seat.' However, they adopted me, and it was the first seat I fought. It was a tough labor seat. But it really gave me a good deal of experience of fighting. And I had a very interesting labor member opposite me, who challenged me to a debate in the local school hall. And I think he thought he was going to make mincemeat of me. But I really had grown up to debate in my family, so we had a very equal debate. And he was very magnanimous, you know. It's very good when you have a good relationship with your political opponents. It makes much better politics, it really does.KING: When did Margaret Thatcher say, 'I want to be prime minister?'THATCHER: Oh, that, too, just happened to come about ...KING: You're sitting around talking one day and someone said ...THATCHER: Not quite. Not quite. After the government of '70 to '74, which we didn't handle very well, we went into our position, and one of my great political friends, Keith Joseph and I decided we had to go right back to the drawing board, right back to first political principles and philosophy, and work out the policy and the details from there. And we did it. And I had always thought that Keith Joseph would become the leader of our party and put that into operation when he became prime minister. And one day, he just made an unfortunate speech with some unfortunate phrases. You know, just a few phrases can shatter your whole life.KING: Yeah, it can.THATCHER: And it did. And all the press camped around his house for three or four days. And eventually, on the Tuesday evening- Monday or Tuesday evening, he rang my study in the houses of parliament and said, 'Can I come and have a word?' He came in, and he said, 'I have to tell you, I cannot stand to be leader of our party.' And I went to protest, he said, 'Don't. My family and I have talked it through. I really can't take this pressure. And I was just very off-put. And I heard myself say, 'Well, Keith, if you're not going to stand, I will, because someone who holds the views we've worked out has to put them forward.' Let me tell you completed, I went home and I said to Dennis, 'I'm going to stand to be leader of the party.' He said, 'Good God, you're mad. You haven't got a hope.' Well, I wasn't mad, but I agreed with him I hadn't got a hope. But then it came out the way it did, so another coincidence, you see.KING: Is Dennis a strong man?THATCHER: Oh, marvelous. He has to be, doesn't he?KING: That's what I was going to get to. Obviously.THATCHER: Yes. But he is. Obviously. He has his own industrial career. He's also a person in great demand. He's also very keen on sports. He's very keen on rugby football. He was a rugby football referee in his spare time, at one time. And, when we went into Downing Street, he made a rule, which he kept to. He was never going to have any interviews with the press, nor even television. And the people respected him for it. And he made speeches, after-dinner speeches, and he came out with all the phrases which it would have been difficult for me to come out with.KING: Would you like to be in that office again?THATCHER: No.KING: Not ever?THATCHER: No, I reckon I'm too old. I was in that office for 11-1/2 years. There would be plenty of people who were saying, 'Oh, it's time the old girl went.' And the old girl went. And the old girl is never going to come back.KING: ... we go to your phone calls. Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, hello.CALLER: Lady Thatcher, being a principal person in power, what was your most difficult decision to make?THATCHER: The most difficult decision might surprise you. It was not the Falkland Islands, which really made itself. We had to go. The most difficult decision was the day President Reagan rang me up and said, 'We have to do something about Libya. It is a terrorist state. We have all the evidence, as you know, things that it has supported. And I want to do a raid on Libya. And I want to do it from the bases in Britain.' And this came out of the blue. I knew the sort of trouble it would cause in parliament. And I said, 'Well, just give me a few hours to think it over.' Called in my foreign secretary and defense secretary and talked it through.And we decided that, unless someone tried to put a stop to terrorism and made it clear that people could not go on bombing airports and the thing on the Achille Lauro, the terrible thing, and continuing to do that, we really should be failing in our duty. And so, we decided that it was justifiable, provided the targets were military targets, strictly military targets.So I telephoned him back and said, yes, we would consent. It caused an uproar, as I thought it would. But many people realized later that it was the right thing to do. But strangely enough, it was the most difficult debate in parliament I ever had to take. And I had all of the law and the case and the intelligence worked out about why we had to do it.KING: Did you have any second thoughts?THATCHER: No, I didn't. It was the right decision. It was a decision of Ronald Reagan which took me by surprise. But he was not a man to be beaten by terrorism. He was not a man to fear the consequences of making that raid, because he thought it was right. And it stopped the terrorism from that country for a very long time.KING: What do you miss the most?THATCHER: I miss the sense of being at the center of things and the adrenaline that goes to the brain with it. I miss the cut and thrust of swift debate. I miss the regularity of the life, because life was extremely well ordered, in great variety. It was well ordered. Tuesday and Thursday were questions. The cabinet meeting was Thursday. One had certain conferences to attend, both international and at home. And that very ordered life suited me very well. It was packed full of activity. One had to work late into the night. But that suited me also.KING: What do your children do?THATCHER: My daughter is in the press. And she's very good at writing. Yes, she's very good at writing. And she's writing a book about my husband. And my son has had his own business for a time.KING: Our guest Lady Margaret Thatcher. Her children were twins, by the way. What was it like to raise twins?THATCHER: Very busy, but very, very worthwhile. I was actually delighted. I didn't know I was going to have twins until the day they were born. They were born prematurely. So it is very exciting. And a boy and a girl, all at the same time, was just done wonderfully, I thought.KING: One cries, the other sleeps. One sleeps, the other cries.THATCHER: That's right. That's right. You think the first two years will never end, and then all of a sudden they're over and gone and the children are growing up. They grow up so quickly.KING: Was it tough to balance motherhood and elective office?THATCHER: Well, you couldn't have done it until the children- I didn't do it until the children were in school. I came into parliament when they were 6. But I couldn't have done it unless our home had been in London. People often ask me, why aren't there more women members of parliament or members of Congress. And I say, if you have a young family, you couldn't come from miles and miles away, to Washington or to London, leaving them with a family. You would feel that they would miss you, and you would feel you weren't doing your duty by them.KING: One more call for Lady Thatcher. Evansville, Indiana. Hello.CALLER: I was wondering, Lady Thatcher, do you have a hobby?THATCHER: Do I have a hobby?KING: Other than politics?THATCHER: I like music. I love opera. I love theater. I don't have as much time to go as I would like to, but they are all a great joy in my life. And I love visiting galleries, art galleries, or museums. The cultural things really add a great richness to life.LARRY KING: I thank you so much.MARGARET THATCHER: Thank you. Bless you. ... I've enjoyed it. Thank you. Tools:	Save |

Military needs response plan to genocide By Chris Taylor and Anthony Zinni, Special to CNN Chris Taylor, left, and retired Gen. Anthony Zinni endorse the MARO Project protocols. STORY HIGHLIGHTSTaylor and Zinni: Possibility of genocide in Sudan if South, as expected, secedes from NorthYet despite that and previous genocides, they say, military has no response planMARO Project has developed a doctrine and plans for response to mass violenceAuthors urge commanders to adopt protocols, and nations and groups to follow suitEditor's note: Chris Taylor is the CEO of Mission Essential Personnel and provides pro bono training and exercise support to the MARO Project. Retired Gen. Anthony Zinni is the former commander of U.S. Central Command and the chairman of BAE Systems, Inc. (CNN) -- In the past 75 years, the world has been witness to genocide in Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur and the Holocaust. In a few weeks, the next mass atrocity could happen in East Africa. As retired Adm. Dennis Blair, former U.S. director of National Intelligence, testified in 2010: "A number of countries in Africa and Asia are at significant risk for a new outbreak of mass killing. Among these countries, a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in southern Sudan." In one week, the mostly Christian people of South Sudan will cast a historic vote to secede or not from the Muslim North. While the United States rightly pursues diplomatic solutions to what most believe will be a vote to secede, prudence demands military preparations for violence -- to include mass killings that could be carried out simultaneously by varied groups. Will Sudan break apart?

Should South Sudan vote to secede, North-on-South violence is probable. A secession vote could also create a scramble for power and retribution by marginalized tribes in the South, while posturing by outside provocateurs and regional states could also lead to unintended violence. Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army could exploit violence in Sudan to cover its own killing of civilians, as could al-Shabaab in Somalia. All could result in mass killings, and all could require military responses. But so could a withdrawal from Iraq, unrest in Central Asia, or cartel violence in Mexico -- and the United States is unprepared to respond to genocide or mass atrocities in any of these cases. Failing to respond to barbaric events of human slaughter is more than just a matter of political will or legal authority -- it is a result of the manifest lack of critical thinking about how military forces could respond when prevention fails. The Obama administration has said many of the right things. The 2010 National Security Strategy proclaims the United States will "in certain instances ... use military means to prevent and respond to genocide and mass atrocities." The Pentagon's 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review says the military will "prepare to defeat adversaries and succeed in a wide range of contingencies," to include "preventing human suffering due to mass atrocities." Even so, the United States has done little in the way of concrete planning should mass violence against civilians break out. A concept and doctrine for response is long overdue. Genocide and mass atrocities present military planners with a unique set of challenges that have not been adequately addressed. Should South Sudan vote to secede, North-on-South violence is probable.--Chris Taylor and Anthony Zinni

African Politics
This gap leaves a critical void of information for geographic combatant commanders if they must deliver credible military options to the secretary of defense and the president. Fortunately, the Mass Atrocity Response Operations Project addresses these challenges directly. Founded by Harvard professor Sarah Sewall, the MARO Project provides operational concepts and a planning framework for military response to mass violence against civilians. The MARO Project joined with the U.S. Army's Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute to develop the operational concepts and planning tools, detailed in the MARO Handbook, that are required to create a wider range of response options. President Dwight Eisenhower famously said: "The plan is useless; it's the planning that's important." The MARO planning framework forces planners, commanders and policymakers to consider the distinct operational and moral challenges they will encounter in the face of mass killing of civilians, and fleshes out the unique nuances specific to MARO. It's not "us against them." In MARO, victims, perpetrators, interveners, and others (bystanders, other agencies, political missions, and NGOs) are the key figures. Making MARO significantly more complex is that other actors can become victims, perpetrators, or interveners; and victims can become perpetrators, and interveners can become victims. It is essential to understand the critical impact these intertwining relationships can have on the scope and speed of violence or planning and carrying out an intervention. Genocide and mass atrocities can escalate quickly (Srebrenica) and in large numbers (Rwanda) or they can be slow and periodically flare (Darfur). In many cases, perpetrators have sped up their killing knowing they've been discovered and will be stopped. Designed to be an ecumenical platform for adoption and adaptation by other militaries and international organizations such as the United Nations, NATO, and the European and African Unions, the MARO planning framework offers greater cooperation and a common operational picture when planning and responding. Perhaps most important, by providing more clarity as to the complexity of responding militarily to mass killing of civilians, MARO may drive policymakers to pay more attention to the value of prevention efforts and provide them with the proper resources. The MARO Project isn't just academic. It provides practical tools that governments have been unable to generate, but that are necessary to plan for real-world challenges like Sudan, and it also offers a more permanent framework for future government planning to halt mass atrocities. Genocides don't follow bureaucratic policy timelines, they prey on them. The MARO framework provides clarity, increases the number of credible options, naturally attracts coalition partners, reduces decision times, and can deter perpetrators, ultimately saving lives. MARO must become enshrined in military doctrine to be successful. Until that time, geographic combatant commanders should adopt the MARO planning framework, and they can do so without policies or directives. By leading the adoption process, they make it easier and more acceptable for international organizations and militaries to follow their lead. We applaud the U.S. government for taking seriously the U.S. role in preventing and responding to genocide and mass atrocities. Prevention should always be the primary goal, but because it sometimes fails, we implore geographic combatant commanders to lead the way by adopting MARO now so that "never again" might become a reality. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the authors.

Muslim protests may force cancellation of Lady Gaga concert in Indonesia
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 10:35 AM EDT, Tue May 15, 2012
Indonesian police have recommended Lady Gaga not be issued a permit in the country, because of security concerns.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The performer's show is under fire from conservative Muslims; police deny her a permit
Some consider her shows to be forbidden under Islamic law
Newspaper says more than 25,000 concert tickets were sold 2 hours after they went on sale
A Christian group also opposed Gaga's show in South Korea
(CNN) -- Lady Gaga may have to disappoint a lot of her "little monsters" in Indonesia after Jakarta police recommended that her sold-out June 3 show not be issued a permit because of security concerns.
"Yes, it is for sure, the promoter will not get a permit to hold the concert," National Police spokesman Saud Usman Nasution said Tuesday.
The concert promoter, Big Daddy Entertainment, declined to comment on the development.
"Please wait for further official information from us," spokesman Alif Ramadoni said.

Tony Bennett's Gaga experience
Trump's role in launching Lady Gaga
There has been an outcry against Lady Gaga performing among Islamists and conservative Muslims, who say her revealing costumes and sensual dance moves are "haram," an Arabic term that means "forbidden by Islamic law."
The chairman of the Islamic Defenders Front, Habib Rizieq, said his group could not guarantee what might happen, as far as security goes, if the concert were held.
The pop star was given a thumbs-down in March by a "high-ranking member" of the country's highest Islamic authority, according to The Jakarta Globe.
The report said that Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the overtly sexy and controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta.
"[The concert is] intended to destroy the nation's morality," Ridwan told the Globe.
Ridwan is concerned that the singer's revealing outfits and sexy dance moves will set a bad example for Muslim youths.
Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March. Police said the promoter should not have started selling tickets before getting a permit.
This isn't the first bit of controversy during the singer's "Born This Way" tour. Gaga also ran afoul of Christian groups in South Korea, prompting the government to ban kids under the age of 18 from attending her show.
Ahead of the concert in late April, detractors called it "pornographic" and a promotion of homosexuality.
Yoon Jung-hoon, a reverend who helped organize the "Civilians Network against the Lady Gaga Concert" movement, told the Chicago Tribune that his group collected 5,000 supporters on Facebook. He also advocated a boycott of the show's sponsor, Hyundai Card, in addition to Hyundai Motor Co., Korea's largest automaker.
"Some people can accept this as another culture, but its impact is huge beyond art and debases religions," Yoon said. "Even adults can't see her performance, which is too homosexual and pornographic."
The show went on as scheduled.
CNN's Kathy Quiano and journalist Tasha Tampubolon contributed to this report.

Suicide attack on provincial governor's compound in Afghanistan kills 7
By Masoud Popalzai, CNN
updated 6:17 AM EDT, Thu May 17, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The attack takes place at the compound of the provincial governor of Farah
The governor and his deputy is unharmed, an official says
No group claimed responsibility immediately
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Suicide attackers with explosives stormed a governor's compound in southwestern Afghanistan on Thursday, killing themselves and seven people, officials said.
The attack took place at the compound of the provincial governor of Farah, said Abdul Rauf Ahmadi, a regional police spokesman.
The governor and the deputy governor were unharmed, he said.
When the attackers raided the compound, they met with resistance from police and were forced to detonate their explosives before they could reach the governor's office, Ahmadi said.
America rushing for Afghan exit?
Six police officers and a civilian died in the attack. Twelve others, including three policemen, were wounded, he said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. But the Taliban is active in Farah province, which borders Iran.
Last month, a Taliban attack in the province killed eight policemen.

Gen. John Allen: A Marine of distinction
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 9:25 AM EST, Wed November 14, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gen. Allen's stellar Marine career makes it hard for those who know him to write him off
Allen has a habit of replying to every e-mail he gets, an official close to him says
Allen did not have an affair with Jill Kelley, the official says
Allen is a married father of two daughters
(CNN) -- A story told about Marine Gen. John Allen while commanding troops in Iraq describes his ability to inspire the loyalty.
A mortar shell landed near a mess hall where Allen was eating, sending a young soldier under the table for cover. Allen, who remained upright during the attack, bent over and said to him, "Son, you're not going to win the war from down there."
Allen may be tempted to find cover under a mess hall table this week as he has been entangled in the sex scandal that ended the career of Gen. David Petraeus, who he followed as commander of international troops in Afghanistan.
Petraeus pillow talk: 'A spy agency's worst nightmare'
An investigation into "flirtatious" e-mail exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley, the woman whose complaint about anonymous, harassing e-mails uncovered Patraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell, has put Allen's promotion as NATO commander on hold.
The married father of two daughters did not have an affair with Kelley, who is also married, according to a senior official close to the general.
What we know so far
"Allen has never been alone with her," the official said. "He does everything with his wife."
Marks: 'Bizarre' communication for Allen
Obama 'surprised' by Petraeus scandal
Cummings: Scandal a 'critical moment'
Rep. Chaffetz: Petraeus should testify Allen, who has a habit of replying to every e-mail he gets, never wrote about sex although he may have said "thanks sweetheart," in casual e-mail conversation, the official said.
Allen's stellar career in the U.S. Marines has made it hard for those who know him to write him off because of the controversy.
Allen became the first U.S. Marine to command the International Security Assistance Force - Afghanistan and United States Forces when he took over from Patraeus in July 2011.
Photos: Who's who in the Petraeus scandal
President Obama will keep him in his Afghanistan post for now.
"He has faith in General Allen, believes he is doing and has done an excellent job at ISAF," White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.
"His leadership has been instrumental in achieving the significant progress that ISAF, working alongside our Afghan partners, has made in bringing greater security to the Afghan people in ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists," Defense Department spokesman George Little said.
Fran Townsend, who served as Homeland Security Adviser in the last Bush administration, called him "a competent, respected, admired leader of troops."
Allen's military career began when he graduated with honors from the Naval Academy in1976. He returned there in 1988 to teach in the political science department, earning the "military instructor of the year" award in 1990.
Timeline of the Petraeus affair
He became the first Marine to be appointed commandant of midshipmen, the second highest post at the Naval Academy, in 2002.
When Allen was promoted from colonel to brigadier general in 2003, he was made principal director of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He held the position for nearly three years.
He served in Iraq as commanding general of the 2d Marine Expeditionary Brigade from 2006 to 2008. He championed the "Sunni Awakening" strategy that organized and paid former insurgents or sympathizers who turned against al Qaeda.
Opinion: 5 things we've learned from Petraeus scandal
Allen was posted in Tampa, Florida, as deputy commander the U.S. Central Command from July 2008 until June 2011, when he took over the Afghanistan command.
It was in Tampa that Allen met Jill Kelley, who was already a friend of Patraeus.
Allen holds three master degrees -- from Georgetown University, the Defense Intelligence College and the National War College.
The left chest of his Marine dress uniform is covered with military decorations, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit with three Gold Stars in lieu of four awards.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Terror suspect "sitting at a cafe" couldn't be targeted, attorney general says
NEW: Attorney General Eric Holder expressed view in testimony to Senate committee
Issue of drone strike first raised in Senate consideration of John Brennan to lead CIA
Holder says such a strike is "entirely hypothetical"
Sen. Rand Paul discusses his problems with the Obama administration's drone policy on "Erin Burnett OutFront" at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.
Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder is not entirely ruling out a scenario under which a drone strike would be ordered against Americans on U.S. soil, but says it has never been done previously and he could only see it being considered in an extraordinary circumstance.
He began to winnow the list of those possible extraordinary circumstances Wednesday. In testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pressed Holder whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an American terror suspect "sitting at a cafe" if the suspect didn't pose an imminent threat.
"No," Holder replied.
Is it okay for U.S. to target citizens?
Domestic drones in U.S. skies
Buyers: Drones are here to stay
Al Qaeda's guide to avoiding drones
But he also said the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the United States. Echoing what he said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, he called the possibility of domestic drone strikes "entirely hypothetical."
That letter, released Tuesday, was prompted by questions raised over the nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Specifically, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee sought the Obama administration's legal rationale for its use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas.
But Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has said he would do what he could to hold up Brennan's nomination until he got a full answer to his query, wanted to know whether the administration considered that policy applicable domestically.
Holder: Drone strike against Americans in the U.S. possible
In a letter to Paul dated on Monday, Holder said it was possible, "I suppose," to imagine an "extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate" under U.S. law for the president to authorize the military to "use lethal force" within the United States.
However, Holder said the question was "entirely hypothetical" and "unlikely to occur."
The United States, he said, has not carried out such action domestically and had no plans to do so.
Holder said a potential scenario might involve a president ordering such action "to protect the homeland" in a case like the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington or the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941.
But he said the administration rejects the use of military force where law enforcement authorities provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat.
Paul, who released the letter from Holder along with his statement, was not satisfied with the response.
"The U.S. attorney general's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening. It is an affront to the constitutional due process rights of all Americans," Paul said.
Jeffrey Toobin, CNN senior legal analyst, said on CNN's "The Situation Room" that Holder made it clear in his letter that he would have to examine the facts of each situation separately and advise the president on his legal authority.
"Again, he made a point of saying Sen. Rand Paul's question is hypothetical at this time. But at some point down the road, this may not be hypothetical," Toobin said.
Brennan defended the use of drones overseas at his confirmation hearing weeks ago, but acknowledged there should be more public discussion.
Read letter from Brennan to Paul
In a written response to the intelligence panel, Brennan, too, said the administration has "no intention" of killing Americans with drones in the United States.
The issue of targeting American terror suspects with lethal force was brought into sharp focus in 2011 when New Mexico-born Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen.
Officials said he played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Brennan confirmed a connection at his hearing between al-Awlaki and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a Delta Air Lines jet enroute to Detroit in 2009 with a bomb in his underwear.
The Obama administration has said targeting Americans overseas with drones is only permitted when the U.S. government determines a suspect to be an imminent threat to the United States and when capture would not be feasible. Additionally, all applicable laws must apply.
The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel turned over new documents on its legal rationale to the Senate intelligence panel earlier in the day.
Some key members who had been pressing for the information said they were satisfied with the White House cooperation.
"We are pleased that we now have the access that we have long sought and need to conduct the vigilant oversight with which the committee has been charged. We believe that this sets an important precedent for applying our American system of checks and balances to the challenges of 21st century warfare. We look forward to reviewing and discussing these documents in the days ahead," Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said in a statement.
They credited Paul with raising the use of drones domestically as a question of "fundamental importance."
The Intelligence Committee approved Brennan's nomination later Tuesday and sent it to the full Senate for consideration.

U.N.: More than 1.5 million fled Syria, 4 million more displaced within nation
By Saad Abedine. Joe Sterling and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 8:20 PM EDT, Fri May 17, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Opposition group reports 113 dead, 39 of them in and around Damascus
Over 1.5 million are refugees, over 4 million are displaced internally, U.N. says Russia sending Syria missiles "will prolong the suffering," U.S. official says Rebel who apparently ate the heart of a government soldier appears in a new video
(CNN) -- The number of Syrian civilians who have fled their country to escape the civil war has passed 1.5 million, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
"The Syrian conflict continues to have a devastating impact on the lives of those who are forced to flee," said Dan McNorton, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, in Geneva, Switzerland.
"Refugees tell us the increased fighting and changing of control of towns and villages, in particular in conflict areas, results in more and more civilians deciding to leave. Over the past four months, we have seen a rapid deterioration when compared to the previous 20 months of this conflict," he said.
The real number of refugees is probably much higher, McNorton said, adding that "this is due to concerns that some Syrians have regarding registration."
Since the start of 2013 alone, UNHCR has registered close to 1 million refugees -- which amounts to about 250,000 people each month.
Along with the refugees, more than 4 million people have been internally displaced, according to U.N. General Assembly President Vuk Jeremic.
Syria has a population of just more than 22 million, according to the CIA World Factbook. That means nearly 30% of Syrian people have left their homes amid the violence.
The war has left at least 80,000 dead, Jeremic said, since the start of the hostilities in Syria more than two years ago.
That death toll continues to climb. On Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported 113 dead -- 39 of them in and around Damascus, 17 in Idlib province, 15 in Homs, 14 in Deir Ezzor and others elsewhere.
U.S. official: Russian missiles will 'prolong the suffering'
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow's position Friday that it will fulfill a deal to supply air defense missiles to the Syrian government.
At a news conference with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Russia's Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Lavrov said he did not understand the furor over the sale of the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
Delivery of the weapons will fulfill a signed agreement and will not give the Syrian government any advantage in its fight with the opposition, he said.
Moscow says international concerns voiced over the move by Russia, a longtime friend of Syria that has supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad during the conflict, are unfounded.
"All who are not planning aggressive acts on a sovereign country, should not be worried, because air defense missiles are exclusively for defense (hence their name) and they are needed to fight an air attack," Lavrov said last week, according to the Foreign Ministry website.
"We are not breaking any laws and don't want to jeopardize our reputation of a trusted supplier."
Among those expressing concern about the missiles Friday was U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who said the sale "does not help" the situation in Syria. "It makes it more dangerous," he said.
U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, elaborated further, calling Russia's move "at the very least a very unfortunate decision that will embolden the regime and prolong the suffering."
"What I really worry about is that Assad will decide that since he's got these systems, he's somehow safer or more prone to a miscalculation," Dempsey added.
Hagel noted U.S. efforts, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, to work with Russia to find common ground and help prevent the eruption of a regional war.
Lavrov and Ban said they were keen to see an international meeting held soon involving the Syrian government opposition.
The aim would be to implement last summer's Geneva communique brokered by Russia and the United States outlining how a transitional government could be formed.
Lavrov and Kerry said this month that they had agreed to try to organize a meeting "as soon as is practicable, possibly and hopefully, by the end of this month."
France: Iran shouldn't be part of Syria conference
Even though it's viewed as a civil war, the conflict in Syria has had a significant impact on its region.
Violence has spilled over into Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. And the conflict has become entangled in issues involving another hot-button nation in the Middle East: Iran.
On Friday, France's foreign ministry issued a statement opposing Iran's participation in an international peace conference on Syria.
Iran has been a strong ally of al-Assad and his government, as well as a focus of international condemnation over its nuclear program.
"The stability of the whole region is in question," the French ministry said. "We can't see a country, representing a threat to stability, taking part in this conference."
The French government said that Tehran should provide a "certain number of answers" and meet "international obligations" before it takes part in talks regarding Syria.
Gruesome footage shows man cutting out soldier's organs
Inside Syria itself, opposition groups responded Friday to widespread outrage this week over a horrific video showing a man said to be a Syrian rebel carving into the body of a government soldier, cutting out his heart and liver, and taking a bite of the heart.
Syrian rebel cuts out soldier's heart, eats it
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, questioned in a statement why the world had not paid the same attention to the many videos it has published showing atrocities allegedly carried out by forces loyal to al-Assad.
A new video purported to be of the Syrian rebel who carried out the atrocity, Khaled al-Hamad, known as Abu Sakkar, was also posted online Friday.
He is asked, "Abu Sakkar, do you regret what you have done? After the killing of the Assad militiaman and the mutilation of his body?"
He replies: "I am ready to face justice and be brought to trial for my actions on the condition that they need to bring Bashar and his thugs to stand trial as well, for the atrocities that they have committed against our women and children."
He warns that "if the bloodshed doesn't stop in Syria, all of the Syrian people will be Abu Sakkar. Everyone will be Abu Sakkar."
Although CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos, it interviewed a local rebel spokesman this week who confirmed the heart-eating incident and said he had spoken to the man involved.
Also Friday, Human Rights Watch urged the rebel groups now in control of Raqqa city, in northern Syria, to ensure that evidence of torture chambers in government security facilities seen by HRW researchers last month is preserved.
"The documents, prison cells, interrogation rooms, and torture devices we saw in the government's security facilities are consistent with the torture former detainees have described to us since the beginning of the uprising in Syria," said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
"Those in control of Raqqa need to safeguard the materials in these facilities so the truth can be told and those responsible held accountable."

Doh! 20 biggest travel mistakes
By Chuck Thompson, CNN
updated 8:16 PM EDT, Fri August 2, 2013
There's no faster way to become embittered with the locals than going toe-to-toe with hungry shopkeepers. Do you really need to whittle 50 cents off that embroidered handbag?
The Armenian peasant jacket or Metallica nesting dolls you didn't buy? Not having them will haunt the rest of your life. When you see something you like, just buy it.
"Near city center" is like a Bible verse -- open to vast interpretation. When the money you saved on your "near city center" hotel is wasted on 30-minute commutes and outrageous taxi fare, you've committed a cardinal travel sin.
Making a travel plan using only your guidebook is like making a plan to stand in line for a week. Pull no more than a suggestion or two a day from a guide that thousands are carrying. So where's that Kafka statue, again?
A survey says two-thirds of travelers return from trips with six unworn outfits. Figure on two wears for (almost) everything. Trial-size shampoo bottles are handy -- until they burst open in-flight, spreading glycerol soap snot all over your bag. Nobody back home wants to scroll through your 9,000 lame images.
Arriving less than two hours before any Heathrow flight is risky. Imagine walking across a football stadium and you get an idea of the Andean trek from the Heathrow Express station to the lifts that will transport you merely to the start of your Oz-like journey through Terminal 1.
You can hit a foreign city like a cashless bumpkin or, for a few extra bucks, arrive with some local coin. Convenience factor makes it worth accepting a slightly higher rate and changing a small amount of cash at the airport.
You think, "I'll wear 'em for a week, why buy the good ones?" The answer comes when you blow out a toe strap and shred your foot a mile into a hike across the local lava beds. A week of texts from St. Lucia shouldn't cost more than open-heart surgery. But it happens all the time to travelers who fail to check their phone plans before departure. CheapAir.com says the lowest fares are available 49 days before a flight. Kayak says it's 21 days before domestic flights and 34 days before international ones. Texas A&M researchers simply say Saturdays and Sundays are best. The golden rule to cheap fares? There's no golden rule. Wait on the curb for a ride in a van and risk being the last one dropped off on a nine-hotel run, all to save a few bucks? Your time is worth more than that.
No one wants to get sick on vacation, but why travel all the way to Thailand or Mexico and not eat the local grub? If locals are in line, consider the place vetted -- you're going to be fine.
If you end up needing the travel insurance you purchased, you're going to want the full coverage. Even if you do love your drum circle buds, there are some balls and chains you really don't want to lug around.
Carnival Rio! It's a nightmare come true when you get turned away at the ticket counter on departure day because you didn't realize Brazil requires you to secure a visa before travel.
This is the fastest way of paying through the nose for the privilege of paying through the nose.
At 344 square miles, Berlin is larger than New York City and, as the first-time visitor quickly learns, has just as many places to see, eat, drink, shop and get lost. They're already on your phone, why bother with hard copies of your hotel name and address? Because your phone and electronics might not work with the local network as soon as you land.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mistakes include not buying it when you see it -- you probably won't go back Over-reliance on guidebooks -- they should "guide," not define
Taking the "super shuttle" -- you'll save $20, but it takes three times as long
Editor's note: Tis the season for travel. In honor of all the holiday miles being put in this time of year, the CNN Travel team is revisiting our list of the biggest travel mistakes we've made. Got your own? Share 'em in the comments box below. (CNN) -- The CNN Travel staff has put in some hard miles.
Collectively, we've touched down on every continent on earth and we're closing in on every country.
But we're nowhere near perfect travelers.
Every one of the travel chokes on this list comes from painful personal experience -- often multiple times repeating the same mistakes. (We're nothing if not persistent.)
1. Overpacking At home, with your complete wardrobe available, there's no reason not to run through work, workout and working-the-clubs outfits in a single day.
But when your life is crammed into a couple bags, your fashion morality changes.
Those socks you wore on the plane should be good for another go.
The purple tee you slept in ought to be alright for a third wear.
Yesterday's undies? Well ...
According to a recent survey by Travelodge, two-thirds of travelers typically return from a trip with at least six unworn outfits.
The lesson: You don't need a new set of anything for each day of a trip. Figure on at least two wears for (almost) everything.
Share your best travel tips
2. Not buying something you like as soon as you see it
You think you're gonna circle back to that shop.
You think you'll see a cheaper, better version somewhere else.
You won't.
That evocative street painting or those Metallica nesting dolls you didn't buy? Now not having them will haunt you for the rest of your life.
When you see something you like, just buy it and live without regret.
3. Not checking your phone plan before traveling abroad
What you call "international roaming" your phone carrier calls "shareholder dividend!"
A week of texts from Singapore or St. Lucia shouldn't cost more and hurt worse than open heart surgery. But it happens all the time to travelers who fail to check their phone plans before departure.
Near? Far from it.
4. Trusting "near city center" descriptions
"Near city center" is like a Bible verse -- open to vast interpretation.
When you find the money you saved on your "near city center" hotel is being spent on 30-minute commutes and outrageous taxi fares, you know you've committed one of the cardinal sins of travel.
Related note: Except by purely technical definition, if you're staying near the convention center in Portland, Oregon, you're decidedly not staying "downtown" (as is popularly advertised) by any local sensibility.
5. Taking the "super" shuttle
Wait on the curb for a ride in a sweat-soaked van and risk being the last one dropped off on a nine-hotel run, all in the name of saving a few bucks?
Your time is worth more than that.
Adam Carolla brilliantly sums up this classic travel blunder in his book, "In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks."
"The shuttle is the worst $20 you'll ever save. It adds 90 minutes to whatever a Town Car or cab would have been. You have the unenviable choice between being dropped off last or being dropped off first and having a bunch of losers who can't afford cab fare and have no friends or loved ones with cars knowing exactly where you live."
Perfect way to ruin an arrival -- shampoo snot.
6. Not tightening shampoo caps ... all the way
Those cute, little trial-size shampoo and conditioner bottles are really handy -- until they magically burst open in-flight, spreading a layer of glycerol soap snot all over your bag.
7. Thinking you know the perfect time to book a ticket
There's an art to reading the tea leaves of the airlines' protean pricing schemes, but there's some muddled science to it, as well.
According to Travelers Today, research conducted by Kayak found the optimal timing for a cheap-ticket purchase is 21 and 34 days before domestic and international flights, respectively.
But 2012 analysis by CheapAir.com concluded that on average the cheapest fares are found 49 days before a flight.
Meanwhile, researchers at Texas A&M University simply found that Saturdays and Sundays are best for finding discount fares.
The golden rule?
There's no golden rule. Tickets are cheapest when they're cheapest.
Editor's note: The original version of this story reported that CheapAir.com claimed the optimal ticket-buying time is 79 or 81 days prior to a flight. The error has been corrected.
Congrats, you just saved 50 cents. Now go get your blood pressure checked.
8. Trying too hard to chisel out a bargain
There's no faster way to become embittered with the locals than going toe-to-toe with a market full of hungry sales people and shopkeepers.
Yes, we understand there's principle involved, but do you really need to whittle the equivalent of fifty cents off the price of an embroidered handbag that's going to sit in the back of a closet anyway?
Just buy the damn thing and spare your heart the cortisol burst for when it actually needs it.
9. Not changing money at the airport
When traveling internationally, the conventional wisdom is that only amateurs change money at the airport, because the exchange rate for foreign currency will be better in town.
It usually is, but often not by that much.
A recent check of the dollar-to-pound exchange rate in London Heathrow was $1.71 to £1 (with no commission for changes more than $300).
Near Oxford Circus the exchange rate was advertised at $1.62 to £1, also with no commission.
Using these rates, converting $300 at the airport would get you £175.43 as opposed to £185.18 on the street.
So, you can hit the city like a cashless bumpkin and spend an hour hunting up an acceptable place to change money or, for less than £10, arrive with some local coin in your pocket.
Convenience factor alone makes it worth changing at least a nominal amount of cash at the "ripoff" place at the airport.
On the plus side, you're also getting in your day at the gym.
10. Underestimating the hell that is Heathrow
Speaking of London, it's easy to underestimate the several hundred miles of concourse you'll likely be obliged to traverse and the time-consuming security searches that create jumbled queues and make travelers look more like internment camp refugees than cosmopolitan jet setters.
Arriving anything less than two hours before an international flight is risky, but even a longer cushion can get dicey.
Imagine walking across a football stadium and you start to get an idea of the Andean trek from the Heathrow Express station to the swarm of travelers clamoring to get on lifts that will take them merely to their start of the Oz-like journey through Terminal 1.
11. Buying cheap flip-flops
You think, "I'm only gonna wear 'em for a week, I might not even take 'em home, why buy the good ones?"
The answer comes when you blow out a toe strap and shred the bottom of your foot a mile into a hike across the local lava beds.
And now you have to go back.
12. Fearing street food
No one wants to get sick on vacation, but why travel all the way to Thailand or Mexico and not eat the local grub?
The locals don't like food poisoning any more than you do. If they're in line, consider the place vetted and assume you're going to be fine.
(Cue angry commenters with the "I almost died from a tainted falafel" and "the locals are immune to bacteria" histrionics below.)
Buy a drum on your trip? Sounds dumb.
13. Buying a drum on the first day of a three-month trek across Asia
We know, this is the antithesis of travel mistake number two, but there are some balls and chains you really don't want to lug around the subcontinent.
Not because you'll make instant enemies with everyone in your hostel when they spy you struggling top-heavily into the dorm, but because a) you'll never play the thing, and b) you'll get back home, walk into the new Authentic Beats music shop that replaced your favorite bookstore while you were away and find 10 superior examples of your exact instrument.
14. Over-reliance on guidebooks
Making a travel plan using only your guidebook is like making a plan to stand in line at the bank for a week.
Guidebooks are great -- we use them all the time -- but it's best to pull just one or two suggestions per day from a guide that thousands of like-minded travelers have read or downloaded.
15. Not buying the full insurance policy
We're not a bunch of free spenders -- except when the boss whips out the company credit card at the pub -- but a lot of the mistakes on this list come down to adding a significant amount of stress to your life in the name of saving a few bucks.
If you actually end up needing the travel insurance you purchased (a move a significant percentage of our staff thinks is silly in the first place), you're going to want the full coverage.
Just because you're in a country where the beer is cheap, it doesn't mean the healthcare is.
That bargain insurance policy might pay for your flight home when you crash your motor scooter on a winding road in some island paradise.
But it won't cover the $5,000 in stitches and sponge baths you racked up during your three-day international hospital stay.
Pity the friends back home who'll have to scroll through the lot of them. Assuming he has any.
16. Obsessive photography
The obsession/obligation to document every street scene, statue and starter course kills the spontaneity and visceral experience that should be the backbone of travel.
It's now so easy to take photos that one click leads to another.
Before you know it, you have 300 pictures on your phone comprising old buildings, blurry sunsets and plates of food.
Congratulations. Your trip is now defined by low-quality images on a handset that, trust us, nobody back home wants to spend 20 minutes scrolling through.
17. Not checking visa requirements before departure
Carnival Rio!
It's a nightmare come true when you get turned away at the ticket counter on departure day because you didn't realize Brazil requires citizens of your benighted country to secure a visa before travel.
18. Attempting Berlin in a weekend
At 344 square miles, Berlin is a metropolitan Goliath, larger than New York City (301 square miles), and, as the first-time visitor quickly learns, with just as many places to see, eat, drink, shop and get lost.
19. Using a credit card to get cash
This is the fastest way of paying through the nose for the privilege of paying through the nose.
Credit card companies charge a high transaction fee (up to 15%) for using a card to get cash.
These special transactions also attract a higher associated fees than other purchases: the ATM-owning bank will charge a fee; if you're withdrawing a foreign currency the exchange rate will be miserly; and if you're not paying off your balance each month, credit card companies in some countries will apply your partial payments to normal purchases (with a lower interest rate, say 9%) before applying them to those cash advances (which have a much higher interest rate), milking your desperation for every pitiless penny.
"As I recall from the website, we were staying somewhere around here."
20. Not printing out reservation details
They're already on your phone and computer, so why bother with hard copies of your hotel name and address?
Because your phone, computer, tablet and other electronics might not work with the local network as soon as you land, especially after crossing oceans.
Now where are you supposed to go?

K-pop group Girls' Generation beats Miley, Lady Gaga at first YouTube awards
By CNN Staff
updated 12:06 PM EST, Mon November 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
South Korea's Girls' Generation wins year's best video at YouTube awards
The K-pop group beat Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga
The group is massively popular in Asia
The inaugural YouTube awards were streamed online
(CNN) -- The South Korean girls group Girls' Generation beat the likes of Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and its compatriot Psy to win the top award for video of the year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards.
The K-pop group, which is one of Asia's biggest musical acts, won for the video "I Got a Boy."
While massively popular in Asia, the reaction to its win from the American audience was muted -- with scattered applause, but mostly a long, deafening silence.
Meet the 'YouTube famous'
While Girls' Generation may be unknown to an American audience, the pop group is a national phenomenon in Korea. The group's record releases are a national event with every news outlet running stories and inciting fans to near-hysteria.
'K-pop' goes global
The rise of 'K-Pop'
READ: How far would you travel to see Girls' Generation? The group might be likened to an Asian version of Spice Girls, with pop sounds, costumes and synchronized dancing. The members sing and also rap.
The YouTube Music Awards nominees were based on views, likes and comments and subscriptions over the last 12 months and fans voted for the winners.
The "I Got a Boy" video features the nine members in a pink house and then moves to the girls gyrating in front of random settings. They intermittently have random English lyrics, but mostly sing in Korean.
It's not the group's first foray into the United States, as the ladies appeared on the "Late Show with David Letterman" and also "Live! With Kelly" last year.

Artist of the Year went to rapper Eminem and the award ceremony, which was streamed live online, was hosted by actor Jason Schwartzman and musician Reggie Watts. The awards reflect the growing tendency for people to turn to the internet, rather than television or radio, for music and video.
However, according to Variety magazine, at most 220,000 people watched the event online, a fraction of the 10.1 million who tuned in for the MTV Video and Music Awards in August.
