How robot drones revolutionized the face of warfareStory Highlights Expert: Robots have biggest impact in 5,000 years on how man fights war UAVs credited with killing more than half al Qaeda's top 20 leaders U.S. military commanders are now trying to keep pace with battlefield demand U.S. government admits that civilians, as well as targets, are dying in some strikes Next Article in World » Read VIDEO From Nic Robertson CNN Senior International Correspondent (CNN) -- Barely an hour's drive from the casinos of Las Vegas, a group of unassuming buildings have become as important as the trenches were to WWI. The big difference? Today's warriors are fighting without getting in harm's way, using drones to attack targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Remote-controlled drones, such as the Predator, are proving increasingly popular with the U.S. military. U.S. Air Force fighter pilot Major Morgan Andrews is one such combatant. He kisses his wife goodbye, drives to Creech, a tiny desert air force base in Nevada, and within minutes could be killing insurgents on the other side of the world. Andrews fights not from the seat of the F16 he joined the air force to fly but from a darkened ground control station. He pilots a remote-controlled Predator, a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) which can spy on and attack positions and personnel without risk to its controller, shooting deadly Hellfire missiles at enemy fighters in support of fellow soldiers. "You're talking to them on the radios as if we were in a normal airplane flying overhead," says Andrews. "You see the imagery, you know what's going on, you see what you're looking at. It's very easy when something like that is happening to project yourself there and feel a part of the battle. Like I said, your heart starts racing a little bit." Is remote-controlled warfare a good or a bad idea? Tell us what you think. Meanwhile, intelligence analysts get to see images in real time and can identify personnel on the ground. There are now more than 7,000 UAVs ranging from the workhorse, the Predator, and its beefier, deadlier kin the Reaper, to army drones like the tiny hand-launched Raven and the larger Shadow. The drones are dramatically tilting the war in favor of the United States. Predators, for example, played a key role in killing al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006. UAVs are credited with killing more than half al Qaeda's top 20 leaders. Now U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wants more UAVs. Already he has said that the next generation of fighter planes -- the F-35 that took decades to develop at a cost of more than half-a-billion dollars each -- will be the last manned fighter aircraft. Lt. Gen. David Deptula, USAF, explains that the next phase will enable a single drone to provide as many as 60 simultaneous live video feeds directly to combat troops. Some new drones will be as small as flies, others walk -- all appear destined to work with decreasing human input. "The future of how you use these un-manned systems or remotely piloted systems is really unlimited," says Deptula, based at the Pentagon and racing to keep pace with battlefield needs as well as Gates's demands. "We need to open our minds and think more about capability and impact we are going to achieve as opposed to how we've done business in the past." Watch how UAVs are changing the face of warfare » At Creech, frontline requests surged when weapons were first put on the Predator. In Iraq and Afghanistan drones have become so indispensable that missions are cancelled if they are not available Don't Miss 'They circled above and watched U.S. soldiers die in front of them'

U.N. envoy calls for probe into U.S. drone attacks
Robotic warfare expert Peter Singer, who advised President Barack Obama's campaign team and has authored "Wired for War," says that remote warfare is changing mankind's monopoly on how conflict is fought for the first time in 5,000 years. All that limits its advance is its application, not the technology. "The barriers of war in our society are already lowering," he says. "This tech may allow them to lower to the ground. And we might already be seeing this in the strikes being carried out on Pakistan." He points out that raw numbers over the last year show the same number of strikes as the opening of the Kosovo war. "But we didn't debate about it in Congress, we don't talk about it daily in our media." Pakistani officials say drones are killing al Qaeda leaders who thought they were beyond U.S. reach. But even the U.S. government admits civilians are dying in those attacks too. Singer fears the use of drones is misunderstood as cowardice, undermining the effectiveness of attacks and ultimately losing the war UAVs are fighting. He explains that last year one of the most popular songs in the Pakistani charts talked about America fighting without honor, adding that the U.S. is "getting better and better at targeting leaders but perhaps creating a context that gets more recruits." The spokesman for Taliban leader Mullah Omar recently told me that it is not afraid of drones, that it doesn't fear death. Deptula disagrees and quotes recently declassified comments between two Taliban leaders: "Tanks and armor are not a big deal, the planes are the killers." He says that of more than 600 Hellfires fired by Predators, over 95 percent hit their targets. Those that failed did so generally through mechanical fault, loss of guidance or a target moving at the last instant, Deptula says. Singer cites other instances when a computer fault has turned robotic warfare into a mass casualty event. "Last year in South Africa an anti-aircraft had a 'software glitch' during a training exercise," he says. "It was supposed to fire upwards into the sky, instead it lowered and it fired in a circle and killed nine soldiers, all because of a software glitch." For the U.S. military the gains more obviously outweigh the glitches. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of service men and women have had limbs and lives saved by bomb-detecting bots. Conservative estimates say that fighting from home and putting robots in to war has saved hundreds of millions of dollars. At Creech the demand for Predator pilots is so intense that it is mobilizing Air National Guard and reservists. It has also introduced an experimental training program for air force cadets from the videogame generation. Colonel Chris Chambliss, based at Creech, explains: "If you look at younger people right now, they multitask much better than I do. They can do a lot of things with a lot of different information, gather all that in. That's certainly a skill set we need." Cadet Greg Groves, who is in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, has never flown a plane before -- but is well aware of his responsibilities. He says: "It's pretty clear that it's not a video game, and it is real life and that what I do directly affects someone else halfway around the world. So I don't think that's going to be a big problem for me." Groves' father and grandfather were both in the military: when he leaves for Creech he'll be the first in his family to go to war without fear of dying. Some commanders, such as Colonel Baxter Swift, based at USAF Balad in Iraq, says the future has only just begun. He says: "It's almost like what the hot air balloon was back in the Civil War for us. 'Hey, I can rise above and look around and see what the forces are doing on the battlefield.' So now we are just in the pioneering stage." Yet if U.S. forces can have UAVs, so can other nations. An estimated 40 or more countries also are developing drones, with an Iranian UAV already shot down over Iraq a few months ago. Even Hezbollah -- a political movement, not a state --- has used them against Israel. Watch how the demand for UAVs has increased » For his part, Singer draws another historical parallel, comparing the U.S. and the UAV to the British invention of the tank in the early 20th century. "There is no such thing as a permanent first maneuver advantage," Singer says. "The British came out of WWI with the most tanks, they invented the tank and yet they didn't figure out the best way to use it in the wars they would be fighting. It was the Germans that figured that out and it was the Germans that would be fighting and would win with the tank when WWII starts."

Tropical Storm Emily approaches the Dominican Republic, Haiti By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Nearly 12,000 U.N. troops and police are on standby in Haiti Emily is about 75 miles south of the Dominican RepublicThe storm is expected to approach Haiti Thursday Emily's winds are at 50 mph

Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Nearly 12,000 United Nations peacekeepers are on emergency standby in Haiti, as Tropical Storm Emily churns towards the Caribbean island, the United Nations said. Residents braced themselves for the storm that is expected to hit the island early Thursday. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians are still living in temporary quarters in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake. Members of the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti have already been deployed to areas at risk of flooding from the storm, the U.N. said. The government issued an alert advising residents that the storm's heavy rains could produce dangerous flooding and mudslides. Rains and flooding from hurricane Tomas in 2010 unleashed a cholera epidemic in Haiti that killed hundreds and infected nearly 2,000 people, the U.N. said. Tropical Storm Emily continued to gradually spin towards Haiti. The center of the storm was expected to pass over eastern parts of Cuba Thursday night. As of Wednesday evening, the disorganized storm was about 75 miles southeast of Isla Beata, Dominican Republic, and was expected to dump heavy rains over Haiti and parts of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. The government of the Dominican Republic discontinued the tropical storm watch from Cabo Francis Viejo to Cabo Engano. A warning for Puerto Rico was discontinued as Emily passed that island by. A storm warning means storm conditions are expected within the next 36 hours, a watch means storm conditions are possible, the center said. "Some weakening is possible as Emily interacts with the high terrain of Haiti and eastern Cuba," the Miami-based hurricane center said. "Some re-strengthening is possible when the cyclone moves over the Bahamas." Emily was continuing to move west at 14 mph, but the weather service said it expects the storm to turn to the northwest over the next couple of days. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Haiti; the southern coast of the Dominican Republic, the southeast and central Bahamas; and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, were expected in the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos on Thursday, and conditions were possible Thursday night across the central Bahamas. The forecast also suggested Emily could skirt the east coast of Florida by early Saturday, but no watches or warnings were posted for the U.S. mainland as of Wednesday.CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.

Santorum challenges policy on prenatal testing
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 6:59 AM EST, Mon February 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Obama's campaign calls Santorum's comments "misinformed and dangerous"
Former senator says prenatal testing such as amniocentesis increases abortions The government should not mandate health care coverage of such tests, Santorum says Republican's comments continue a series of harsh attacks on president
Washington (CNN) -- The government shouldn't make health care providers fully cover prenatal tests like amniocentesis, which can determine the possibility of Down syndrome or other fetal problems, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum said Sunday.
Santorum, an outspoken opponent of abortion rights, told the CBS News program "Face the Nation" on Sunday that amniocentesis "more often than not" results in abortion.
"People have the right to do it, but to have the government force people to provide it free, to me, is a bit loaded," he said.
The former Pennsylvania senator was arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care legislation passed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in 2010. He said Saturday at an appearance in Ohio that the law was intended to increase abortions and reduce overall health care costs.
How Santorum lead could change race
Sound of Sunday with Candy Crowley
Santorum's 'Gotcha' complaints
No support for Santorum in Senate?
"One of the mandates is they require free prenatal testing in every insurance policy in America," Santorum, a conservative Roman Catholic, told a Christian Alliance luncheon in Columbus. "Why? Because it saves money in health care. Why? Because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society."
He added that the requirement was "another hidden message as to what President Obama thinks of those who are less able."
The White House referred CNN to Obama's re-election campaign for comment, and campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith called Santorum's remarks "the latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the Republican presidential primary has become."
"Prenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries," Smith said. "These misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women cannot trust any of the Republican candidates for president."
On Sunday, Santorum mentioned his own experience with this 3-year-old daughter Isabella, who has Trisomy 18, a chromosome disorder that often results in stillbirths or early childhood death. He said prenatal testing showed the problem, and doctors recommend abortion in virtually all cases.
Such a recommendation is common when any problem is detected through amniocentesis, said Santorum, who added that in such cases "we know that 90% of Down syndrome children are aborted."
Some studies since the late 1990s do suggest a high percentage of women terminate their pregnancies after receiving a Down syndrome diagnosis, with one British study putting the figure as high as 92 percent. A 2005 study of nearly 1,100 pregnant women found 76% would consider an abortion if tests indicated their child would be born with Down syndrome.
Now considered the main conservative challenger to the more moderate Mitt Romney, Santorum has shed a more understated demeanor to challenge both Romney and Obama as the Republican campaign heads toward a series of key primaries in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6.
He continued throwing out the cultural red meat for primary voters Sunday night, telling a rally at a Georgia church that Obama was intent on starting a cultural war. As the audience roared with applause, he called on the country to build a foundation that will "defend the church, defend the family, defend the nonprofit community, defend them from a government that wants to weaken them."
His attack on insurance coverage for prenatal testing was the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made since surging to the top tier of polls in the Republican presidential race. He also found himself defending other Saturday comments regarding Obama's religion, appearing to question the president's adherence to Bible-based Christian theology.
Santorum said Saturday the president was not motivated by concerns for ordinary Americans but by "some phony ideal, some phony theology.
"Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology," he said.
Asked about those remarks on CBS, Santorum said he was referring to Obama's energy policies, which he said favored what he called radical environmentalism. Asked specifically if he was questioning Obama's Christian beliefs, Santorum said: "I wasn't suggesting the president is not a Christian. I accept the fact the president is a Christian."
Instead, he said he was taking on what he called "an attempt to centralize power in the government."
"I'm talking about the belief that man should be in charge of the Earth," Santorum said, and then in specific reference to Obama: "I am talking about his worldview and the way he approaches problems in this country."
But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Santorum's comments continued the kind of character attacks he said were typical of the GOP presidential race.
"I think that if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line," Gibbs told ABC's "This Week."
"I think this GOP primary, in many cases .... has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents' records, of the president's records," he said. The negative tone of the campaign was hurting the Republican candidates and causing low turnout numbers in some of the primaries so far, Gibbs added.
"It's just time to get rid of this mindset in our politics that, if we disagree, we have to question character and faith," Gibbs said. "Those days have long passed in our politics. Our problems and our challenges are far too great."
The issues raised by Santorum follow another religious-themed controversy over the Obama administration's decision to require church-affiliated hospitals and other institutions to provide employees with health care coverage for contraception.
Catholic bishops vehemently opposed the move, and the administration changed its rule to require health care insurers to provide free coverage for contraception rather than the churches or other religious-based institutions.
Santorum's comments may appeal to some Republican voters who have questioned Obama's faith before, or others who saw the administration's recent contraception mandate as an overreach. Last month, Santorum was criticized by some for not correcting a voter who called the president a Muslim when she stood up to ask a question at one of his campaign town halls.
On Sunday, Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, who flirted with a presidential bid last year, told the CNN program "State of the Union" that the contraception issue could benefit Republicans if properly approached.
"These are the questions that I think Republicans can unite on," Daniels said. "They do have to be framed, as they really are, as the defense of individual freedom against the right now limitless power of the state."
CNN's Chris Welch, Athena Jones, Ashley Killough and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.

Stories revive Hong Kong's 'forgotten souls'
By Elizabeth Yuan, CNN
updated 12:11 AM EST, Thu November 29, 2012
Patricia Lim shows pictures of Henrietta Shuck, the first U.S. female missionary to China, left, and her friend, Theodosia Dean, another missionary wife.
The two friends, Henrietta Shuck and Theodosia Dean, died within two years of each other and are separated by two graves.
Outside the Hong Kong Cemetery's gates: the Happy Valley Racecourse and the flyover leading to the Aberdeen Tunnel that links 64,000 drivers daily with the other side of Hong Kong island.
A tree appears to rock the grave of Efim Kasachkoff, who died in 1957, in Section 9.
The monument, erected in 1850, is dedicated to 20 men from Britain's HMS Columbine, which saw battle in Borneo and against Chinese pirate Chui Apou and his fleet. The cut-off pillar signifies dying in the prime of life.
The fountain is the oldest classical one in Hong Kong, according to Patricia Lim. Fellow author Ken Nicolson says he hopes the fountain will be restored to working order since water is an important Christian symbol.
The grave of Lieutenant Benjamin Fox of the HMS Nimrod is the cemetery's oldest. He died during Britain's attack on Canton during the First Opium War, which led to China's cession of Hong Kong to Britain.
Catchick Paul Chater was knighted in 1902 and was behind the development of both Kowloon and Hong Kong waterfronts. He has a road named after him.
Sir Robert Ho Tung, buried next to his wife, backed Sun Yat-sen's revolutions, built a commercial empire and founded the Chinese Club.
Apartment buildings in Happy Valley overlook the Hong Kong Cemetery.
Dmitry Belanovsky, who lives in Moscow, found the Hong Kong grave of his granduncle, Nicholas Belanovsky, and his wife, Tatiana, in 2004, after a decades-long seach.
All that was known for decades of Nicholas Belanovsky, pictured in 1915, was that he escaped for China after the Russian Revolution. He wound up in Hong Kong after helping build a Russian Orthodox Church in Shanghai.
Stella Loterijman of UK finally found info for her grandfather Charles William Reilly's first wife, Mary Constance. Here he is pictured in his army uniform.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Patricia Lim charts 8,500 graves, weaves stories in 624-page book
She pored through now-defunct newspapers, accounts, old records, histories
Out of it emerges a social history of Hong Kong and the cemetery
Doctors were prominent, fever was high; brothels, bars very popular
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid exotic trees in a garden setting rest Hong Kong's extraordinary and ordinary, those who died heroically in wars, ignominiously in drunken brawls, or suicide; victims of accidents, pestilence, and pirates; barkeepers, prostitutes, children, and luminaries whose names are today borne on street signs.
It's a far cry from the highway overpass outside the gates.
Charting the 8,500 or so names and weaving their stories together into a 624-page book, "Forgotten Souls: A Social History of the Hong Kong Cemetery," is Patricia Lim, who spent about a decade on the project.
The cemetery had only a record of graves -- which date from 1841 to 2007 -- identifying them by section but not with precise locations, while the earliest graves had no information, Lim said.
A "fanatical friend" from the UK spurred her on to the cemetery project after Lim had dedicated a chapter of her last book, "Discovering Hong Kong's Cultural Heritage: Hong Kong and Kowloon" to the Happy Valley cemeteries. The friend was none other than Susan Farrington who has recorded graves in the Himalayan foothills of Pakistan. She came to Hong Kong to help. When she left, Lim couldn't stop.
"Since I was in it, I might as well finish," she explained.
With inscriptions as a starting point, Lim and a host of volunteers recorded each grave into a database, assigning it a section, row and number. Then she pored through now-defunct newspapers -- like The China Mail, the Friend of China, the Daily Press -- personal and travel accounts, histories and every book on Hong Kong she could get her hands on.
It seemed such a waste of opportunity -- and stories -- not to link themPatricia Lim, author of "Forgotten Souls"
"It seemed such a waste of opportunity -- and stories -- not to link them," Lim said. "If you just go through the cemetery, plot-by-plot...no one would have taken any interest. It seemed imperative to link, if people were going to get to know them."
Out of it emerged a social history of, if not Hong Kong, then of the cemetery whose names have included the "Protestant Graveyard" and the "Colonial Cemetery." Adjacent to it are separate cemeteries for Catholics, Jews, Parsees, and Muslims, while Hindus were given land for their temple.
The Chinese, on the other hand, "were always at the bottom of the pile" despite being the majority, said Lim. "They weren't trusted, and they weren't accorded respect of other nationalities here." Although some 225 Chinese are buried in the Hong Kong Cemetery, Chinese didn't get their own permanent cemetery -- in Aberdeen, on the south of the island -- until 1915, decades after other groups got theirs.
Hong Kong was "a hard, unhealthy place to live," Lim said. "It was a gamble. You sacrificed health for wealth. But that was maybe why they were so wealth-conscious. It was very important. You knew you were sacrificing, that you'd probably die."
The cemetery opened at its current location in 1845 after its former spot -- just east of where the office tower Pacific Place 3 now stands -- overflowed beyond capacity. Hong Kong had become a British colony only three years earlier.

Particularly prominent at the time were doctors, two of whom -- Dr. William Aurelius Harland and Dr. William Morrison -- have the cemetery's biggest monuments and most appreciative epitaphs, according to Lim. They were among four colonial surgeons who died within a 12-year period of malarial fever in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong wasn't really "happy" or a place for European women, Lim said. With a high ratio of lonely bachelors in a transient population, brothels and bars were in high demand.
"There were German taverns, English taverns, American taverns," including Edward Thomas' Uncle Tom's Cabin, which opened in the 1850s after its namesake novel was published, said Lim. Thomas, a New Yorker buried in Section 9, died at age 29, leaving his widow to run the business.
Among the 465 graves that belong to Japanese are ship crewmen, shop owners, employees of trading firms as well as prostitutes, according to Lim. One monument to Kiya Karayuki bears the signatures of 58 girls, suggesting she was either a much-loved prostitute or a brothel keeper.
The database gives the basic details, but the book adds the stories that bring the people to lifeDavid Bellis, Gwulo
Also buried at the cemetery are the first to not only make their fortunes in Hong Kong but also give to it: financier and developer Sir Catchick Paul Chater, who transformed Hong Kong and Kowloon waterfronts; Sir Kai Ho Kai, founder of the medical school that would evolve into the University of Hong Kong; and Robert Ho Tung, who built a commercial empire.
Others meanwhile died without a trace except for the inscription on their tombstones, Lim said.
Old graves were difficult to read, requiring multiple trips under different light conditions. "Some I never managed to read." she said.
There were also family members who had the same names. And then there were Chinese who went by as many as three or four names during the course of a lifetime, whether it was during school, used for family purposes or attained upon wealth.
In the late 19th century, the Botanical Garden staff helped the cemetery evolve from a simple graveyard to a lush cemetery garden inspired by those in Europe, like Pere Lachaise in Paris and Glasgow's Necropolis, according to one landscape architect.
The experimentation with exotic plants helped enrich the cemetery's landscape, turning it into a habitat for dozens of butterfly and moth species, said Ken Nicolson, who wrote "The Happy Valley: a History and Tour of the Hong Kong Cemetery."
For Lim's husband, Po Chye, cemeteries are for ceremonies, not for idle strolls. "You don't go there for recreation."
Lim, who is "over 76," has had some close calls -- she once tripped, cutting her knee on a metal railing with jagged points; another time she got locked in the cemetery after hours and had to climb out through a government building. She also once borrowed somebody's grave to rest while suffering what a doctor later diagnosed as "broken heart syndrome," an incident similar to a minor heart attack.
It solved a mystery no one else seemed terribly concerned aboutCraig Bissell, descendant of Miller Robb Dickson
"Not everyone is willing to do all this hard work and then put it out in the open for everyone to benefit from," wrote David Bellis, who has listed the names, graves and inscriptions compiled by Lim on his website, Gwulo, which is dedicated to historic Hong Kong.
"The database gives the basic details, but the book adds the stories that bring the people to life," he said.
Stella Loterijman, who's based in the UK, had been trying to find her grandfather's first wife, Mary Constance Reilly, since 1979. All she knew was that Reilly was born in 1869, married Dr. Charles William Reilly and died at age 20 of dysentery, while he was on a tour of duty with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Hong Kong.
Then last month, Loterijman was resuming research into her family tree when she found Mary's information on Gwulo: "In loving memory of Mary Constance Reilly, wife of Captain Reilly" in section 18.
In an e-mail to CNN, Loterijman described being "thrilled and elated."
Craig Bissell also credits Lim and Gwulo for helping solve a years-long mystery over Miller Robb Dickson, the favorite brother of his Scottish grandmother, who has always said he went off to Canada to join the Hong Kong Police Force and died unexpectedly. Even so, Bissell, who lives in Toronto, Canada, could never find evidence of Dickson's ever being in Hong Kong until it suddenly appeared on Gwulo one day.
"It was a marvelous breakthrough," Bissell wrote, adding, "It solved a mystery no one else seemed terribly concerned about." Dickson's listing identifies him as a police sergeant for the Hong Kong Police Force from Dundee, Scotland, and who died in 1928 at the age of 30.
Nicholas Belanovsky and his wife, Tatiana, are among 108 Russians buried in the cemetery. All that was known of him for decades was that he had escaped for China after the Russian Revolution, said his grandnephew, Dmitry Belanovsky, in an e-mail from Moscow.
Then in 2004, Dmitry typed "Belanovsky" into a browser -- and to his "amazement" discovered that Nicholas' name appeared as an engineer for the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Surety of the Sinners in Shanghai during the 1930s. With the help of a Russian priest, he found the grave and subsequently learned that Nicholas' work with the British Cigarette Company had taken the couple to Hong Kong in 1948. He lived to the ripe old age of 88 on the second floor of a Kowloon apartment building, surviving Tatiana by nearly 30 years and leaving his entire estate to his longtime amah, or maid.
Having been regarded as "stateless" and the "people's enemy," Nicholas had never gotten in touch with his family in Russia apparently fearing harm would come to them, said Dmitry.
He has since posted the info on Gwulo in hopes of learning more about Nicholas Belanovsky's life.
"It's full of stories, this cemetery," said Lim, who now splits time between Hong Kong and England. "They are like old friends, yes."
For now, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department operates the cemetery, which has yet to attain heritage status.

Katt Williams: 'I'm kinda done' with stand-up comedy career
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 9:37 AM EST, Wed December 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Williams tells Seattle TV station KOMO he's retiring from stand-up comedy
Seattle police charge Williams with assault, harassment and obstruction Sunday
Williams first gained attention as a stand-up comic in 1999
(CNN) -- Katt Williams announced the end of his stand-up comedy career Monday, a day after a bizarre incident in Seattle that landed him in jail.
"I'm just going to go ahead and announce my retirement from stand-up," he told a photographer for Seattle TV station KOMO Monday night. "I'm kinda done."
Williams was in Seattle to perform over the weekend, but his allegedly aggressive behavior at a Seattle bar and an odd exchange with police ended with him in the King County, Washington, jail Sunday on charges of assault, harassment and obstruction. He was released on bond Monday morning, a jail official said.
He was also involved in incidents in Sacramento and Oakland during comedy tour stops in California in the past month.
KOMO aired an interview with Williams that is said was recorded on a street after he was ejected from a south Lake Union hotel Monday evening.

Williams: I'm not anti-Mexican
"I've already discussed it with my kids," Williams said. "I wasn't really going to do it on a Seattle street. I was going to Los Angeles and do it in the offices of ICM or LiveNation." ICM is a talent agency, and LiveNation is a concert promotion company.
Williams told the station he would remain in Seattle until a Thursday court date on the criminal charges and while he files a lawsuit against the city "for this $50 million that I want for crippling my reputation as a father and a black man and as a taxpaying citizen and as a person who is not a convicted felon."
Williams "exchanged words with patrons in the bar, brandished a pool cue at a bar manager and refused to leave the business," and later refused to show identification to a police officer who had been called to the scene, a Seattle police news release said.
Officer Michael Virgilio wrote in the arrest report that the World Sports Bar manager told him Williams had returned to the bar Sunday after being involved in a dispute with a customer the night before.
"I suppose you're going to ask me to take my hands out of my pockets, huh?" Williams said to Virgilio, according to the report.
Williams refused to give his name or show an ID, but "yelled out a (California) driver's license number," the officer wrote.
When Virgilio warned he would arrest him for obstruction unless he produced an ID, Williams said "no." The comedian then turned around and placed his hands behind his back "on his own accord," the arrest report said.
"Two of Williams' associates were standing nearby and were pleading for Williams to calm down," the officer wrote.
While being handcuffed and searched, Williams "made several comments about how he was going to sue the department," the report said.
"He stated he had been arrested over 30 times in the last few months and every time he was released prior to being booked into jail," Virgilio wrote. "He made comments regarding my employment with the city of Seattle and how it would end as a result of his arrest. Williams stated he had millions of dollars, and this arrest would not affect him."
After the search turned up Williams' passport in his pocket, the officer asked why he hadn't just handed it over.
"You asked for my driver's license," he quoted Williams saying. "I didn't have it!"
Then, it got worse, the arrest report said.
"Williams became aggressive and resistant and his actions forced me to take him to the ground for a short period of time. He was subsequently placed in the back of my patrol car."
Williams was playing pool in the bar when Sunday's trouble started, the report said. "An argument began and quickly escalated."
When the manager tried to separate Williams from the couple with whom he was arguing, Williams yelled at him for "protecting the customers from the famous guy," Virgilio wrote.
"Williams picked up a pool stick, raised it up and pointed it at (the manager's) face," the report said. "(The manager) continued to state if he hadn't stepped back the stick would have hit in the the face."
When the manager asked him to put the stick down, Williams said "What if I don't?" and jabbed the stick toward him again, the report said.
"At one point during the altercation, Williams followed a family outside of the bar where, as the family got into their car, Williams flicked a cigarette through a car window at a woman, striking her just below her eye," the police news release said. "Williams also threw a rock at the family's car."
Virgilio said he would request additional charges against Williams, including reckless endangerment, because the rock hit a window in the family's car, "directly next to an 8-year-old girl."
"Had the glass shattered or the rock had penetrated the window, it could have struck and harmed the 8-year-old victim," he said.
Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET network led to more success.
His 2006 HBO special "Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1" raised his profile even higher.
He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's "Norbit," and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including "The Boondocks."
His often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor.
CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.

More than a watch: Apple's entry into wearable tech
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 6:42 PM EST, Wed February 13, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
Samsung may be the latest company to leap into the emerging field of "smart," or Web-connected wristwatches. The company is planning to announce a new smartphone device that's worn on the wrist in September, according to a Bloomberg news report. No word on whether it might come in multiple colors, like the Samsung Galaxy Note phone.
Most current smartwatches rely on smartphone pairing over Bluetooth to get data and notifications. A long-rumored 'iWatch' from Apple could take the same approach as these rivals, or put more computing power directly into the device. Apple's sixth-generation iPod nano was a small, square touchscreen (it has since been replaced by the rectangular seventh-generation nano). Many fans immediately saw the potential to turn the iPod into a watch face, and companies such as Lunatik make kits that included mounts and slick straps.
The $150 Pebble waterproof watch has a black-and-white, e-paper screen, which can be customized with specially designed watch faces. It connects to iOS and Android smartphones over Bluetooth and vibrates to notify the wearer of incoming calls, e-mail, texts and other alerts. There are also downloadable music and sports apps.
The Italian-made aluminum I'm Watch is one of the pricier smartwatch options at $399. It comes in seven colors and runs the Droid 2 operating system. It connects to Android smartphones using Bluetooth to get texts and e-mails, check social networks, make calls and see calendar events. Another full color touchscreen device, the $130 Sony SmartWatch, also only syncs with Android devices. When paired with a phone over Bluetooth, it can receive notifications for e-mail, texts, social networks and calendars.
The MetaWatch has a retro-looking, black-and-white screen, but it can connect to the iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, in addition to Android devices. It's also a water-resistant sports watch that tracks pace and distance. The watch starts at $179 and is available with various colored bands or in black or white leather. The $269 Motoactv smart watch is marketed as a fitness tracker. It acts as a heart-rate monitor and pedometer, has GPS and an MP3 player. There are also a number of nonwrist mount options, including a handlebar strap, arm band and chest strap. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An Apple watch could pass existing smart watches with more computing, sensor power
Bloomberg reports that 100 employees are already working on developing the device
A watch could spawn an industry of compatible third-party wearable accessories
(CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to well-placed leaks that have been showing up in various publications.
The latest is a report from Bloomberg that says Apple already has a team of 100 employees working on a wearable device.
The clues, and resulting flurry of speculation, are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. Apple dream-product rumors have mostly focused on an elusive Apple TV over the past year.
But Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be way more than just a fancy timepiece.
It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. An Apple watch could work with an ecosystem of third-party wearable sensors and products that tie into one powerful, small hub.
If executed correctly, an Apple watch could spawn a lucrative industry of compatible products, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications.
"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can tap into," said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that alert the watch when you've eaten too much.
Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of slick smart watches available, but most act as accessories, connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth.
For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates.
Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely.
"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple's the real one, that can add some value to some of this wearable technology," said Munster.
Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will face off when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique take on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps.
Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones prominently display the time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem redundant to also strap a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it ceases to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer.
An Apple watch could leap frog the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls. Two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device, while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone doesn't become obsolete.

'I never forgot about you': Families reunite with women held captive for years
By Matt Smith. Greg Botelho and Martin Savidge, CNN
updated 11:01 PM EDT, Tue May 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Amanda Berry tells relatives she's fine, she has a young daughter NEW: Another victim, Gina DeJesus, is in "good spirits," her sister says Three suspects, all brothers, are arrested and awaiting charges, police say
Some neighbors say they were suspicious, but police only went to the home twice
For more on this story, check out coverage on CNN affiliates WJW, WEWS, WKYC and WOIO Cleveland (CNN) -- The first time most of America heard Amanda Berry's voice was on a frantic 911 call.
"I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years," the 27-year-old woman said on the call, which was made on Monday. "And I'm here. I'm free now."
A day later, Berry could be heard again. This time talking to relatives, she seemed positive, even upbeat -- telling her grandmother Fern Gentry that she's "fine" and that the 6-year-old girl also rescued Monday from a Cleveland home is indeed her own.
"I love you honey, thank God," her tearful grandmother said, in a call recorded by CNN affiliate WJHL. "... I've thought about you all this time. I never forgot about you."
Amanda Berry vanished a few blocks from her Cleveland home on April 21, 2003. She was 16. On Monday, May 6, she was found with two other missing women blocks from where she disappeared. Click through to see more miraculous stories of lost children who were found months or even years later.
Georgina "Gina" DeJesus was found on May 6 with Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight in Cleveland. DeJesus was last seen in the Ohio city on April 2, 2004, on her way home from school. She was 14 when she went missing.
Michelle Knight was the third of the three women who escaped from a captor's house in Cleveland on May 6. She was last seen on August 22, 2002, when she was 21.
On June 5, 2002, when Elizabeth Smart was 14, she was abducted from her bed, raped and held captive for nine months by Brian David Mitchell. On May 25, 2011, Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison.
Natascha Kampusch, an Austrian woman, was held prisoner in a basement for eight years from the time she was 10. Her abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil, beat her up to 200 times a week, manacled her to him as they slept and forced her to walk around half-naked as a domestic slave after kidnapping her in 1998. Kampusch escaped in August 2006. Priklopil committed suicide shortly thereafter.
Eleven-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard was abducted in 1991 from outside her home in South Lake Tahoe, California. She was held by Phillip and Nancy Garrido in a hidden compound of sheds along with the two daughters to whom she subsequently gave birth. Dugard and her daughters were found in 2009.
Shawn Damian Hornbeck spent more than four years with Michael Devlin, passing as his captor's son in the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood, Missouri. Shawn was 15 when he was found in 2007 and reunited with his family. Elisabeth Fritzl was imprisoned and raped by her father, Josef Fritzl, for 24 years. Fritzl lured his daughter into the basement in 1984 when she was 18 years old. She had seven of his children. She was released at age 42 after her ill 19-year-old daughter was taken to the hospital and police called the family in for abuse suspicions. In 2009 Josef Fritzl was sentenced to life in prison. Carlina White was abducted in 1987 from a Harlem hospital room. She learned her real identity 23 years later after finding her case online. She contacted the police after finding a baby picture that looked like her baby pictures on a missing children website. She was reconnected with her birth mother in 2011. White said she'd never felt like she belonged to the family who raised her.
Steve Carter also discovered he was a missing person after an online search. He had been adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in Honolulu. At 35 years old, he heard about White's case and clicked on Missingkids.com and found an age progression photo of himself as an infant. It came to light that biological father, Mark Barnes, reported him missing more than three decades ago after his mother, Charlotte Moriarty, took him for a walk and didn't return.

Amanda Berry's emotional call to 911
Bandmate: Castro seemed to live alone
Back in northern Ohio, balloons dotted the frontyard of the home of 23-year-old Georgina "Gina" DeJesus, who along with Berry and Michelle Knight were allegedly held captive for years in a Cleveland house. There was also a sign strung along a fence, the same one that had been there since Gina was first reported missing nine years ago.
Her 32-year-old sister, Mayra DeJesus, told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday that her sister -- for all the hell she's gone through -- is in "good spirits."
DeJesus spent the day with family, who didn't focus on what she'd gone through but more on lifting her up, her sister said.
Her brother, Ricardo, earlier described how the whole family was crying and shaking upon hearing Gina was safe and alive.
"I was just glad to be able to see her," he said. "It's been nine long years. I was just happy I was able to sit there and hug her and say, 'Yup, you're finally home.'"
Berry, DeJesus and the 32-year-old Knight each disappeared from the same Cleveland street -- Lorain Avenue -- three miles from the home in which they were found Monday evening. They escaped after Berry broke out the bottom of a screen door and called for help Monday evening, startling neighbor Charles Ramsey who came over and helped kick in the door.
Cleveland police and the FBI hailed Berry as a hero for her daring escape.
"We're following her lead," Cleveland's Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba said. "Without her, none of us would be here today."
Three men have been jailed in the women's disappearance -- 54-year-old Pedro Castro, 50-year-old Onil Castro and 52-year-old Ariel Castro, who neighbors said lived at the house. All three are expected to be charged in the coming days.
Some neighbors of Ariel Castro spent Tuesday second-guessing themselves, questioning why they hadn't noticed signs earlier and if they could have prevented the horrors.
"This is a heartbreaking moment for us, because I'm always out there (and) I've heard nothing," said Daniel Marti, who's known Ariel Castro since junior high school and lived near him for some 22 years.
"... To us, it was like nothing was happening. But yet it was happening, right in front of our face and we didn't even know."
The latest developments
'He didn't want nobody back there'
The predominantly Latino neighborhood, made up mostly of two-story frame homes, sits within sight of downtown. The gentrification that has spiffed up districts on either end hasn't extended to the blocks around Castro's home, where a number of houses are boarded up. But the churches in the neighborhood still ring the bells in their steeples, and the neighbors say they look out for one another.
Authorities and several neighbors say they had no prior indication anything suspicious was going on at the nondescript home on Seymour Avenue, where a Puerto Rican flag hung from the porch.
But after Monday's discovery, they reflected back and noticed things that, in retrospect, might have signaled something awry.
Marti, for one, asked himself why he didn't question why Castro -- who, he thought, lived alone -- would return each day with bags of McDonald's food, or who would watch the little girl he occasionally took outside. He also recalled how Castro seemed to steer him away from the house when they talked: "Now that I think of it, he didn't want nobody back there."
Another neighbor, Israel Lugo, said saw Castro at the park Sunday with a little girl and asked who she was: "He said it was his girlfriend's daughter."
Lugo said his sister got a bad vibe from the house and asked him not to let the children play unsupervised nearby. He said he heard yelling in the house in November 2011 and called police to investigate, but they left after no one answered the door.

Kidnapping suspect's son 'truly stunned'
And Nina Samoylicz, who lives nearby, said she called police about two years ago after spotting a naked woman in the backyard of Castro's house. Samoylicz said when she called out to the woman, a man told the woman to get in the house, then ran in himself.
Neighbor who helped Berry an instant Internet star "She was just walking around and naked," Samoylicz said. "We thought that was weird. We thought it was funny at first, and then we thought that was weird, so we called the cops. They thought we was playing, joking, they didn't believe us."
She said she had also seen tarps covering the backyard.
But Sgt. Sammy Morris, a Cleveland police spokesman, told CNN that the department had no record of a 911 call reporting a naked woman at Castro's address.
In fact, authorities never had any indications that the women were being held in the home or that anything suspicious was going on there, Cleveland Public Safety Director Martin Flask said. Neighbors had not provided any tips, he added.
Police had visited the home twice, authorities said Tuesday, once after Castro called about a fight in the street and another time to investigate Castro on an unrelated incident involving a child who had been left on a school bus.
The 2004 incident was the first of four exhibitions of "bad judgment" that led to Castro's November firing by Cleveland's school district, according to records released Tuesday night.
"He previously had been suspended for 60 days for leaving a child on a bus; 60 days for making an illegal U-turn in rush hour traffic with a bus load of students, and last school year for using the bus to do his grocery shopping," the letter recommending his dismissal states. His firing came after he had left his bus unattended outside a school after his preschool routes had been canceled, without notifying his dispatcher or depot.
Tito DeJesus, a bandmate of Castro's, said he had been inside the bass player's home once, about two years ago, to help deliver a washer and dryer he'd sold to the suspect and saw "a normal environment." DeJesus said he isn't related to the rescued Gina DeJesus but had known the family for years.
"It didn't seem to be a place where women were being held against their will," he said. "Of course, mind you, I didn't go throughout the entire house. I was just at the beginning of the house, in the living room, but it seemed normal."
Finally free
Berry was last seen after finishing her shift at a Burger King in Cleveland on April 21, 2003. It was the eve of her 17th birthday. DeJesus disappeared nearly a year later, on April 2, 2004. She was 14.
Michelle Knight vanished on August 22, 2002, and her family reported her missing the next day, Flask said. She was 21.
Little was known about Knight's case Tuesday. Her mother now lives in Naples, Florida, and was contacted by Cleveland police late Monday, a neighbor, Sheldon Gofberg, told CNN.
The three women and the child were released Tuesday from the hospital where they had been taken for evaluations, a spokeswoman said. Tomba said all four appeared to be in good condition, if in need of a good meal.
While amazing, such discoveries are more common now, said John D. Ryan, CEO of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
"To us at the National Center, this is not something that we find shocking any more," he said. "The fact is, we have seen more and more long-term missing cases end up in the victim being rescued many years after their original abduction."
The most widely reported such incident in recent years was that of Jaycee Dugard, who was freed in 2009 after 18 years of captivity behind the home of a California couple.
In another case, Ryan said last year a 43-year-old man was found and reunited with his mother after being abducted at the age of 2.
More than anything, the three victims need privacy and time with family members, said Elizabeth Smart, who was in the headlines in 2002 when she was kidnapped from her Utah home at age 14 and held captive for nine months.
"I want them to know that nothing that has happened to them will ever diminish their value and it should never hold them back from doing what they want to do," Smart told CNN's "The Situation Room."
The women should not feel pressure to speak publicly about their ordeal, Smart said, adding that time will help them heal. "It's just incredible they are walking away from this horrendous nightmare, alive and safe today," she said.
'We're hoping for a miracle'
Investigators had previously speculated that the disappearances of Berry, DeJesus and another girl, 14-year-old Ashley Summers, may have been connected. Summers' family last saw her in July 2007, when she was 14.
Read CNN story on three missing from 2009 "We did in fact believe there was an association between the Berry case and the DeJesus case as well as the Summers case," said former FBI agent Jennifer Eakin. Eakin is now a case manager at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which in 2008 held a comprehensive review of the cases with the FBI and Cleveland police.
Now the Summers family is hoping that the Cleveland investigation will yield information about Ashley, her aunt, Debra Summers, said.
"We're hoping for a miracle," she said.
Anderson, the spokeswoman for the Cleveland FBI office, said investigators will question the three women found Monday in the hope that they know something about Summers' disappearance.
Survival the key difference from 'House of Horrors' case
The suspects
Of the three brothers arrested, Ariel Castro was the only one to live at the home where the three women were apparently held, police said. The others lived elsewhere in the city.
Their uncle, Julio Castro, told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Monday that his family had grown up in the same west Cleveland neighborhood and knew the Georgina DeJesus family.
Julio Castro told CNN's Martin Savidge on Tuesday that family members were "surprised" over the developments.
"Shame on you," Julio Castro said, when asked what he would say to his nephews.
CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Cleveland and Matt Smith and Greg Botelho reported and wrote in Atlanta. Michael Pearson, Tory Dunnan, Jason Hanna, Josh Levs, Steve Almasy, Laura Ly and Rande Iaboni also contributed to this report.

Marry girls when they're '15 or 16,' said 'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson
By Amanda Sloane, HLNtv.com
updated 8:16 AM EST, Thu January 2, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16," Phil Robertson says in old video
The clip was originally posted in 2009, then posted again to YouTube on Monday
This month, Robertson drew ire with controversial comments about homosexuality, race
HLN has reached out to the "Duck Dynasty" family for comment but has not heard back
(HLNtv.com) -- "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson is ruffling feathers again, this time for comments he made years ago about how girls should marry when they're still teenagers.
"They got to where they're getting hard to find, mainly because these boys are waiting 'til they get to be about 20 years old before they marry 'em," Robertson says in a video clip that resurfaced Monday. "Look, you wait 'til they get to be 20 years old, the only picking that's going to take place is your pocket. You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16. They'll pick your ducks."
In the video, Robertson is recounting an anecdote at a speaking engagement. He describes the story as "river rat counseling" he was giving to a "boy" of unknown age and -- referring specifically to marrying teenage girls -- also advises the crowd to "check with Mom and Dad about that, of course." Robertson is four years older than his wife, Kay, whom he married when she was 16 years old, according to A&E's website.
Should Duck Dynasty Star Be Forgiven?
A&E lifts suspension on 'Duck Dynasty' star
The reality show patriarch was speaking at a Georgia Sportsmen Ministry event when he recounted this advice, according to the video's description. The clip was originally posted in 2009 by YouTube user wakemakerducks, which is also the name of Robertson's company. It was posted again to YouTube on Monday.
In the newly resurfaced footage, Robertson also lists other qualities he advised the boy to look for in a future wife.
"Make sure that she can cook a meal. You need to eat some meals that she cooks, check that out. Make sure she carries her Bible. That'll save you a lot of trouble down the road," he said.
The resurfaced footage comes on the heels of controversy caused by comments regarding homosexuality that Robertson, 67, made to GQ magazine this month.
"It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus," Robertson told GQ when opening up about topics he said he couldn't discuss on the show. "That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical."
Robertson went on to explain to the magazine how he thinks that the line between right and wrong has been blurred and that "sin becomes fine." He then expanded on what, in his opinion, is "sinful."
"Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there," he said. "Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."
A&E quickly suspended Robertson from filming future episodes of the hit show after he made those comments. Nine days later, the network reversed its decision.
HLN has reached out to the "Duck Dynasty" family for comment but has yet to hear back.

GOP's slick Black History ads fall short, miss the point
By Andra Gillespie
updated 2:18 PM EST, Wed February 5, 2014
The Republican National Committee is launching its first paid ad campaign in recognition of Black History Month.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Republican National Committee ad campaign celebrates Black History Month
Andra Gillespie says the effort should be encouraged but falls short
Gillespie: Ads fail to recognize the complexity of the communities
Editor's note: Andra Gillespie is associate professor of political science at Emory University. She is the author of "The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark and Post-Racial America." She is currently working on new projects about race and the Obama administration and blacks and their relationship with the Republican Party.
(CNN) -- It's February and Black History Month, and networks and major consumer brands are reprising their annual ad campaigns honoring the contributions of African-Americans to the arts, politics, technology and commerce.
This year, a new player is sponsoring Black History Month ads: the Republican National Committee.
In spots airing on black radio and television stations in select media markets, the RNC praises the contributions of black Republicans such as Louis Sullivan, a former secretary of health and human services under President George H.W. Bush.
Andra Gillespie
RNC makes first ad buy for Black History Month
This ad campaign is part of a larger Republican strategy to reach out to minority voters. After President Barack Obama won more than 70% of the vote among blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans (93% among blacks alone) in 2012, the Republican National Committee redoubled its efforts to court minority voters. This ad campaign is a part of that effort.
A well-produced, uplifting ad campaign will not be enough to convince black Democrats to switch their party identification, though.
For every ad praising Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican Party has had to put out fires created by state and local officials who make insensitive racial comments. For instance, in the past two weeks, the Iowa Republican Party had to fire the mastermind behind the "Is Someone a Racist?" flow chart on its Facebook page. The flow chart flippantly charged that racists are white people you don't like.
RNC highlights strategy for building 'new generation of black Republicans'
By this point, some Republicans are probably wondering why blacks don't seem to punish liberals and Democrats for their racial missteps. Democrat-friendly MSNBC has faced strong and valid criticism for its recent taunts of the Romney family's transracial adoption and its assumptions that conservative Republicans don't marry interracially. For his part, Fox host Bill O'Reilly raised eyebrows when he asked Obama why he had not done more to lower the out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks.
The answer is rooted in a long, complicated history of race and partisanship and in psychological frames that the GOP ignores at its peril.
RNC clarifies tweet that suggests racism is over
A Republican Civil War?
Obama speaks candidly on race and pot
Some Republicans rightfully point out that during the civil rights movement, Southern Democrats tried to block passage of the Civil and Voting Rights Acts. They forget, however, that in the past 50 years, white Southern Democrats (both racists and non-racists) have gradually shifted their party identification to the Republican Party. They don't account for the fact that GOP has admitted to (and apologized for) purposely using racially coded language to win over racially resentful whites in the wake of the civil rights movement.
And they ignore data that confirm that while black political views have moderated in the past generation, blacks still tend to prefer a stronger federal state and greater governmental intervention, in large part because they perceive the federal government to have done a better job than state and local officials at protecting civil rights.
The 'white' student who integrated Ole Miss
Perhaps the biggest impediment to the GOP's outreach efforts among blacks, though, is its misunderstanding of the importance of group dynamics to individual political decision-making.
Republicans value limited government and personal liberty, traits that celebrate rugged individualism and a view of politics that assumes that self-interest informs most policy preferences. Numerous studies have shown that many blacks and Latinos believe that what happens to other blacks and Latinos affects them. This belief that their fates are linked to the fates of their co-ethnics informs liberal policy and political preferences.
It means that an affluent black person might be willing to pay higher taxes if it helps maintain the food stamp program, which helps poor, disproportionately minority people. Or that a Latina born in the United States might wince when Republican congressional candidates voice their opposition to immigration reform because she perceives that tone of the opposition evinces a general antipathy toward Latinos regardless of their nativity.
Don't get me wrong, Republican outreach to blacks is a good thing, and I hope to see more of it.
Republican candidates who win office need to engage their black and minority constituents, and Democrats should not assume that blacks (or any other group) will always vote Democratic.
However, a polished ad campaign alone is not enough to win over black voters. If the GOP hopes to become significantly more competitive among blacks, it will have to acknowledge the importance of group identity to blacks and other minorities and learn how to frame their principles in terms of group interests.
