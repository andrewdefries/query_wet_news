Officials survey damage after strong quake jolts Mexico
By the CNN Wire Staff

STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Interior minister: 11 people are injured nationwide
At least 500 homes are damaged in Guerrero state, the governor says

Ometepec, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican officials were assessing damage Wednesday, a day after a strong earthquake left homes in ruins and rattled residents hundreds of miles away from the epicenter.
At least 11 people were injured and hundreds of houses were damaged in the 7.4-magnitude quake, which struck midday Tuesday in southern Mexico near Ometepec, Guerrero.
In some of the hardest-hit areas, residents surveyed rubble where adobe homes once stood. Nurses tended to patients in a parking lot beside a hospital damaged by the quake.
Paulino Sisto said he sprinted toward his home in Ometepec when the quake hit, fearing for his family inside.
"I couldn't even walk because the earth was shaking. It was moving back and forth like a hammock," he said.
From a distance, Sisto saw clouds of dust rising as houses collapsed in his neighborhood. His family survived, but their home didn't.
"No one has come to help us," he said Wednesday. "These areas are very abandoned. There is no highway. There is no way here. Cars can't get through because of the earthquake yesterday. Dirt is blocking the roads."
The massive quake sent broken tiles and pieces of buildings falling onto sidewalks as far away as Mexico City, about 200 miles (320 km) from the epicenter.
The city's mayor said the earthquake was the strongest to affect the capital since an 8.0 temblor that struck in 1985, killing about 10,000 people in the sprawling metropolis.
Officials said no deaths had been reported after Tuesday's quake, despite the widespread alarm it caused.
Although Tuesday's quake was strong, its magnitude was lower than the 1985 quake, which means significantly less energy was released, said John Bellini, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey.
Going up one full magnitude would mean 10 times the ground motion. Even with the sixth-tenths magnitude difference between Tuesday's 7.4 temblor and 1985's 8.0 quake, "you're talking about a big difference in the shaking and all the associated potential damage," he said.
The relatively low population near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake and improved building codes in the Mexico City area also may have been a factor, he said.
The quake's epicenter was about 15 miles (25 kilometers) east of Ometepec, a municipality of about 50,000 people, including enclaves of indigenous communities.
"You could see the fear on everyone's faces," said Olga Libia Ramos, the chief nurse in the city's general hospital.
Officials evacuated patients into the parking lot after the quake shattered windows in the hospital, she said.
At least 500 homes in the southern coastal state of Guerrero were damaged, Gov. Angel Aguirre said.
Nine of the 11 injuries occurred in Oaxaca state, which borders Guerrero and also suffered damage from the quake, said Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire.
Authorities said two people were injured in Mexico City, including the driver of a minibus that was crushed when a pedestrian bridge collapsed during the quake.
Many residents in Guerrero, fearing aftershocks, said they slept outdoors overnight.
Office workers rushed into the streets after feeling the temblor in Mexico City. Tourists and residents also felt the earthquake in the resort city of Acapulco, about 100 miles (200 km) from the quake's epicenter.
Authorities in Mexico City were surveying buildings, schools and hospitals to evaluate damage, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said.
The USGS describes Mexico as one of the most seismically active areas of the world.
The country sees an average of seven earthquakes daily with a magnitude greater than 3.0, according to Mexico's National Seismological Service.
CNN's Rey Rodriguez, Rene Hernandez, Jason Hanna and Catherine E. Shoichet and journalist Salomon Kaufman contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Beitar Jerusalem offices are set on fire days after it signed Muslim players Football club supporters are arrested for making racist remarks
Fans wave a banner at a match that says "Beitar -- pure forever"
No one was injured in the fire, police say
(CNN) -- Arsonists attacked the administrative offices of leading Israeli football club Beitar Jerusalem on Friday, police said. The attack occurred just days after the club signed two Muslim players.
No one was injured in the fire, which was discovered around 5 a.m., police said. But the blaze damaged the club's trophy room.
Last Thursday, four club supporters were arrested on charges of making racist chants, apparently directed at the Beitar's newest players, Zaur Sadaev and Dzhabrail Kadaev. They came from Russian League club Terek Grozny, based in Chechnya.
On the same day they were signed, January 26, fans at a Beitar match waved a banner reading "Beitar -- pure forever" and chanted anti-Arab slogans. Four were arrested.
The Israeli Football Association later fined Beitar $15,000 and ordered the club to close the area at the Teddy Kollek Stadium where the club's hardcore supporters usually gather.
Meanwhile, investigators continue to figure out who is behind the arson attack.
"A thorough investigation has been opened by a Special Investigations Unit searching for suspects that fled the scene," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the "shameful" arson attack in a statement issued Friday.
"We cannot accept such racist behavior," he said.
Beitar's general manager, Itzik Kornfein, issued a defiant message, saying the club would stand by its signing of Sadaev and Kadaev.
He said bringing them on was the "right decision," despite the subsequent controversy.
"We will keep strong," he told CNN.
"The club won't change it's mind because of these criminals," he said. "But I want to emphasize that a minority of people have been causing these actions. Beitar and most of its fans are not racist."
Rosenfeld said security will be stepped up ahead of Beitar's home match Sunday in the Israeli League against Bnei Sachnin, an Arab-Israeli team.
Beitar, owned by Russian-Israeli Arkady Gaydamak, was founded in 1948.
The club's crest features the menorah, which is also embedded in the emblem of the state of Israel.
Throughout the club's history many of their fans have remained implacably opposed to the signing of Arab or Muslim players.

At progressive gathering, hints of anxiety about Obama
By Peter Hamby, CNN Political Reporter
updated 12:20 PM EDT, Fri June 21, 2013
Protesters send a message to the president over the Keystone XL pipeline at a Santa Monica, California, fund-raiser this month.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Some progressives dismayed with compromises and slow pace of change in Obama years
Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about President Obama
"Sometimes the administration is standing in the way ... ," one Netroots participant says
San Jose, California (CNN) -- Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and Democratic firebrand, stood behind a podium at the San Jose Convention Center and neatly summed up the current zeitgeist of the left.
"Is the president perfect?" Dean asked a buzzing audience of left-leaning bloggers, political activists and organizers on Thursday evening. "No. But it sure is better than having Bain Capital, I mean Mitt Romney, in there."
Dean's growling joke crystallized the prevailing liberal sentiment about President Barack Obama as the curtain rose on Netroots Nation, the annual progressive conference started in 2006 by the creators of the Daily Kos, a popular left-leaning blog and founding member of an online grass-roots movement that eventually helped lift Obama into the White House.
From the left, Dean open to presidential run
Obama the senator made a pilgrimage to the 2007 conference, then called Yearly Kos, and charmed the assembled bloggers as he mounted what seemed an impossible primary campaign against Hillary Clinton.
Liberals turn on Obama
Columnist: Obama not leading on Syria
Liberals angry at Obama budget
In 2013, Obama the president sent a YouTube video. He wasn't exactly missed.
On a host of issues from National Security Agency surveillance to Wall Street reform to foreclosure assistance to the Keystone XL pipeline debate, the more than 2,000 activists in San Jose for the eighth Netroots Nation expressed dismay about the compromises and slow pace of progress that have so far marked Obama's tenure in the White House.
"If George Bush was in there, I'd more frustrated," said Tony Alexander, political director for a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. "But we have Barack Obama, so it's a little less frustrating."
But frustrating nonetheless.
To many here, the hard-won battles of the 2012 campaign have not yielded much at all.
"We are in the middle of foreclosure crisis, and we haven't seen any real action on principal reduction, and we haven't seen any of the banks get prosecuted for some of things that were supposedly under investigation," said Liz Butler, a fellow at the Movement Strategy Center, a social justice organization. "A lot of us have concerns within the progressive, social justice and environmental movement about the lack of action on a whole set of issues."
Scott Paul, a self-described "labor Democrat" and president of the nonpartisan Alliance for American Manufacturing, pointed to Obama's promise at the Democratic National Convention to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term.
'The American people want to believe in something'
"The first five months are in, and there is virtually no job creation, so they are already way behind on manufacturing," said Paul, who was enticing conference-goers to his display in the Netroots Nation exhibition hall with classic arcade games such as Galaga and Pac-Man. "How much of it was rhetorical? A lot of it was, clearly."
Across the hall from Paul's display, staffers from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a 1 million-member advocacy group founded by two former MoveOn.org organizers, was doing a brisk business handing out blue-and-white bumper stickers declaring, "I'm from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party."
Warren, the senator from Massachusetts who endeared herself to the left by pushing for student loan reform and greater Wall Street regulation, long ago surpassed Obama as a darling of the left, said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
The president's attempt to pass sweeping gun control legislation after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School offered a glimmer of hope for liberals, Green said, but that soon faded.
"The American people want to believe in something, someone, and there are moments like the gun debate when the president did what progressives wanted all along, which is propose the boldest possible bill and barnstorm the country fighting for it," he said.
"But on things like foreclosures, and even jobs, there is the absence of a policy. On some things he is just wrong, and on other things he is just absent. Why isn't he giving a speech on jobs every single week? Why isn't he owning that issue? He is almost treating his presidency like he is treading water. There are people who want to rally behind his leadership if he is willing to lead, but he is not."
Obama recorded a video message for the conference that ran during the opening night of speeches on Thursday. It was sandwiched between the address by Dean and another by Sandra Fluke, the attorney and women's rights activist who became a Democratic celebrity during the 2012 presidential race when radio talker Rush Limbaugh called her a "slut" for advocating for greater access to contraceptives.
"We won't always agree on everything, and I know you'll tell me when we don't, but if we work together, I am confident we will keep moving this country forward," Obama said in the video, which was met by tepid applause though it highlighted accomplishments such as increasing home sales and passing an extension of the Violence Against Women Act.
The president's complicated relationship with his party's activist wing is, in a certain sense, as institutional as it is ideological. Every president, liberal or conservative, has been forced to make compromises that rankled even his most loyal supporters.
Left has long record of restlessness
But Obama's other challenge is that the political left has long had a knack for restlessness, even with one of its own occupying the Oval Office.
Until the second term of President George W. Bush exposed his party's fault lines, Republicans for decades had a prized tradition of marching in lockstep with party leadership, especially when the GOP held the White House.
The Democratic Party, meanwhile, is routinely disparaged -- even by its own professional class in Washington -- as less a party than a feuding and loosely affiliated federation of special interests and demographic groups: organized labor, abortion rights supporters, environmentalists, racial minorities, students and others.
"Every president has to operate within the framework of a lot of competing interests and organizations that are supporting or against him, especially Democrats," said Jann Dorothy, a Netroots attendee from Sacramento, California, who is supportive of the president. "He has to always balance the various constituencies that are out there. It's a bit like herding cats."
Dorothy said that "a lot of people here are frustrated, very upset" about the NSA surveillance and data collection programs that former contractor Edward Snowden revealed this month.
Obama's approval rating has slipped in the wake of revelations about his administration's sweeping surveillance programs, but Democrats continue to give him high marks. A CNN/ORC International poll from this week shows Obama's approval rating among Democrats at 83%, down six percentage points from last month. Among liberals the rating fell three points to 75%
CNN Poll: Obama numbers fall into generation gap
But the lanyard-wearing Netroots crowd bristled at party labels. They were more likely to identify themselves with a particular cause -- opposing the Keystone pipeline, for instance, or halting forced deportations of illegal immigrants. Breakout sessions at the conference largely focused on tactical matters such as media strategy and grass-roots organizing, not passing Obama's political agenda.
"I don't think there is a terribly strong allegiance to the Democratic Party here," Dean said in an interview with CNN.
It is a demanding bunch. Everyone who came to Netroots arrived with a pet issue or two, but it was difficult on the conference's first day to find anyone who said the president had done enough to satisfy his or her demands.
The exceptions to that rule were supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, who applauded the president for backing same-sex marriage and said the administration has accomplished most of what they wanted.
Still, many questions about the president from a reporter were met with shrugs and the occasional eye roll.
The tension revealed itself in a roundtable session Thursday morning with leaders from Organizing for Action, a grass-roots advocacy group that sprang from Obama's last campaign.
Does group exist only to push Obama's agenda?
The group seeks to pressure members of Congress to back the White House's agenda, largely through local media events and partnerships with sympathetic interest groups such as Planned Parenthood.
But several activists who attended the roundtable pointedly questioned the group's executive director, Jon Carson, about its mission: Is its goal just to help Obama get his agenda passed? Or does it care about other progressive issues that don't quite jell with Obama's objectives?
The topic of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport crude oil reserves from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, was repeatedly broached. Several attendees doubted Organizing for Action's sincerity on climate change given the president's punting on a decision on construction of the 1,700-mile pipeline.
"Sometimes the administration is standing in the way of the agenda we all voted for," one participant said.
Carson gamely tried to manage the situation.
"I think what I would say is, we do partnerships primarily on specific actions," he said. "That's what we are offering. We wouldn't ask anyone, 'Let's make sure 100% of our agenda lines up before we go yell at (Sen.) Kelly Ayotte before her vote on background checks.' But when we do line up our agendas on what we care about, we will find at least 80% matching."
Sara El-Amine, the group's national organizing director, said, "We can't be all things to everyone."
Despite the evident frustration, there were no hints of outright anger about Obama among the convention participants. He is still their president, and as Dean pointed out, it could be much worse.
Former Obama campaign staffers wandered the hallways sharing hugs with friends in the blogger community, and Obama T-shirts are a frequent sight on the backs of conference-goers. Booze-soaked parties are as much a part of the agenda as networking and political organizing. The 2016 presidential race and discussions about putative front-runner Hillary Clinton are only conversation topics when brought up by reporters.
Stop Hillary effort launches
The anxiety here is hard to define, but it might have something to do with the fact that liberals find themselves in the unusual position of being two-time winners on a grand scale.
For a progressive movement that started as an underdog insurgency fighting back against the powerful Bush administration, it's kind of weird to be on top for five years running. These activists crashed the gate a long time ago. Their ambitions are a bit less sweeping, more prosaic and narrowly focused.
"It's exciting to be coming together after we all performed really well as a party," said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman for Emily's List, a group that supports female Democratic candidates. "We ran really good candidates; we had really good issues and we won. So I think now we all get to stand around and talk about what do we do with a win, which might not be the most natural position for everybody here.

Syrian refugees face resentment in Lebanon
By Mohammed Jamjoom, CNN
updated 3:29 PM EDT, Tue July 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
More than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, U.N. says
Resentment toward Syrian refugees is on the rise in Lebanon
Syrians say they're destitute and face discrimination in new country
"The Syrians took our world away from us," Lebanese boy says
Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- He escaped the war, but life's no happier now for Omar. The 8-year-old Syrian refugee longs for friends back in Qusayr, hard hit by a civil war that grinds on. He also misses days in school -- when the most he had to worry about was finishing his homework.
"I work so I can bring money for my family," says Omar. His mother, like other refugees, asked that their last names not be used as they are worried for their safety.
Eddie Izzard: In Syrian refugee camps, another day of childhood is lost
I met Omar on a hot, dusty day in Lebanon's wind-swept Bekaa Valley. We were interviewing his mother when Omar and his 14-year-old brother came zooming by on a motorbike. They had just finished gathering eggs at a nearby farm -- what little money the kids make is the only way their family is able to survive.
The job is hard, but Omar went through an even more difficult experience recently.

U.N.: 5,000 Syrians dying every month
"They hit us," he says timidly, describing how Lebanese boys his age beat him up.
"They said to me," he adds, embarrassed and close to tears, " 'Damn every Syrian.' "
Omar now faces a different kind of brutality -- a harsh reality reflected in the weary faces of kids all around. Their eyes make them seem far older. There's no childhood spark, with smiles few and far between.
I ask a 15-year-old girl what life's been like for her here.
"Life?" She asks unbelievingly -- as if the question were a farce.
"We manage to live, but it's nothing like before."
She's forced to share a small tent with nine others. She says her circumstances are difficult, but at the same time, she feels blessed with what her family even has.
In makeshift refugee camps such as this one, the overwhelming feeling is sadness. The Syrians interviewed say they can't believe their lives have come to this -- adding how they're not just destitute, but they're also facing discrimination.
Bushra, a Syrian woman in her 40s, says she's still shocked at the kinds of hateful words she's heard since arriving.
"Some people say to me, 'God bless Bashar al-Assad's hands,' " she says, " 'the hands that slaughtered you all -- you deserve worse.' "
Bushra says it's told as a joke, but she and her family aren't laughing.
The United Nations says more than 600,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring Lebanon, a tiny country of about 4 million people. Aid workers warn resentment toward Syrian refugees is on the rise here.
"The crisis entered its third year now," says Patricia Mouammar with World Vision, a humanitarian aid and development organization. "And the Lebanese community -- even though very generous at the beginning of this crisis, now they cannot take the burden."
Mouammar says there are many reasons for increasing tensions.
"Rent -- the prices of the rent have gone up, up to 400% in some areas," she says. "Salary wages plummeted, and Syrian refugees are working for less, and they're sharing homes with multiple families. And everyone is feeling that -- everyone is feeling the burden on the Lebanese hosting communities."
Mouammar says her organization is "calling for the humanitarian aid to direct more assistance toward both communities -- the Syrian refugees and the Lebanese communities."
It's gotten so bad that some Lebanese families have even been displaced.
Taha, a Lebanese father, says his family's former landlord kicked them out when a recently arrived Syrian family was willing to pay double the rent.
His younger son's anger is clear as day.
"The Syrians took our world away from us," says 9-year-old Iyad. "There's nothing left for us."
His father's outrage, however, is reserved for others.
"We're not against Syrians -- we have to help the refugees," Taha says. "But our government has to take care of us, too."
Pointing to his oldest, he says, "My son here, now he has to work too -- it's awful."
There's no indication the teenager has heard us. He sits and stares -- his hopelessness and exhaustion apparent. He isn't just drained. Like so many Syrian children, he's also desperate.

Yahoo is getting a new logo
By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 9:21 PM EDT, Wed August 7, 2013 | Filed under: Web
Yahoo unveiled its simple new logo on Thursday September 5, after 30 days of showing runner-up logos that didn't make the cut. The overall the look is cleaner and thinner, and it is a new sans-serif typeface. The logo is still purple, though a shade darker, and features all the usual uppercase letters in the same order finished off by the signature exclamation point.
Yahoo announced last month that it would unveil a new corporate logo -- the first such change since the company was founded 18 years ago. Take a look at other tech companies that have changed their logos over the years:
In 2009, America Online developed a simple logo that can be incorporated onto different backgrounds, as seen on this large banner at the AOL headquarters.
Jon Miller, former chairman and CEO of AOL, is photographed with the logo the company used from 1996 to 2005.
E-commerce company eBay keeps its bright, primary colors of the former logo with the current logo that was introduced in 2012.
Here's eBay logo with its bright, overlapping letters that was used from 1995 to 2012.
A man looks at a computer monitor showing the old and new Twitter logos. The social networking company dropped the name and now uses the bird image alone.
Twitter's logo before the bird was added in 2010.
In 2012, software company Microsoft adopted a new logo using the design of the old Windows logo.
Founder Bill Gates with the Microsoft logo that was created in 1987 and is still used on some of the company's products.
The current Xerox logo is displayed at the Macworld iWorld 2012 conference. Xerox is well known for photocopiers and printers. It also handles digital production printing.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Yahoo will unveil a new corporate logo September 4 The new look will retain the purple color and, yes, the exclamation point
Yahoo will display a different variation of the logo for each of the next 30 days
(CNN) -- Under CEO Marissa Mayer, Yahoo might still be trying to shed its image as a relic of the 1990s Internet era.
But hey, it's getting a new logo!
Yahoo announced Wednesday that it will unveil a new corporate logo September 4 -- the first such change since the company was founded 18 years ago. The new look will retain the current purple color scheme and, yes, its trademark exclamation point. Yodel away, Yahoo fans.
"Over the past year, there's been a renewed sense of purpose and progress at Yahoo!, and we want everything we do to reflect this spirit of innovation," Chief Marketing Officer Kathy Savitt wrote in a blog post. "While the company is rapidly evolving, our logo — the essence of our brand — should too."
The current Yahoo logo sits on a sign outside its campus in Sunnyvale, California.
To build some buzz around the new logo, the Internet company will display a different variation of the logo on its homepage and throughout its network in the United States for each of the next 30 days. The first example, shown above, opts for a more streamlined look, although the second "O" is larger than the first, reflecting -- in Yahoo's words -- the company's " fun, vibrant, and welcoming" character.
The variations on the new logo -- this video clip offers a potential preview -- also will be showcased each day on Yahoo's Twitter account (#dailylogo).
Why the interest in Yahoo CEO? Mayer has been working to reinvent the struggling Yahoo since she took over leadership of the company in July of last year. In the past 12 months Yahoo has bought more than 16 startups, including the popular Tumblr blogging platform, and reinvigorated its older brands such as photo site Flickr.
Under her reign, Yahoo's stock price has climbed from $15 to almost $30 (it's currently at $27), although some analysts remain skeptical about the company's long-term fortunes.
Yahoo's rebranding follows similar logo changes by other aging Internet giants, including AOL, eBay and Microsoft.
"The new logo will be a modern redesign that's more reflective of our reimagined design and new experiences," Savitt said.

History mystery: What became of the ground zero flag?
By Phil Gast, CNN
updated 9:57 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN Films production looks at flag raised at World Trade Center
It became a potent symbol of unity across America
While the real one went missing, did the substitute serve same purpose?
Co-directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, CNN Films' "The Flag" examines what happened to the flag raised on the site of the World Trade Center by three firemen, immortalized in one of the most iconic photographs of that day. Tune in tonight at 9 ET on CNN.
(CNN) -- For the warrior or the would-be rescuer -- the heroes -- there is no time to appreciate what one click of a camera shutter means to a suffering nation.
Six Marines still had an enemy to fight after they raised the American flag on Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi. Three would die in that 1945 battle.
On Sept. 11, 2001, three New York City firefighters joined those who rushed to the World Trade Center to search for survivors who would never be found. Late that afternoon, they raised a small flag removed from a nearby boat. A monochromatic wall of gray debris soared in the background.
"There's no self-pity in that picture," said Capt. Patrick Burns, U.S. Navy liaison to New York, at the time.
The photographs of the flag-raisings at Iwo Jima and ground zero quickly became icons, moments in time that galvanized Americans who found new solidarity and unity.
Firefighters George Johnson, Dan McWilliams and Billy Eisengrein raise a flag at ground zero in New York after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001. The scene was immortalized by photographer Thomas E. Franklin. The image has been widely reproduced in the decade since it was first published. View 25 of history's most iconic photographs.
The now-famous photograph was never featured on the front page of The Record, the newspaper Franklin works for in Bergen County, New Jersey. The photo appeared on page 32 on September 12, 2001.
On September 13, 2001, the front page of Britain's "The Sun" draws the comparison between the image at the World Trade Center and Joe Rosenthal's 1945 photograph of U.S. troops raising a flag in Iwo Jima during World War II.
Newsweek features Franklin's photo on its cover on September 24, 2001.
Firemen re-create the flag raising during the 2001 World Series in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 27, 2001.
A firetruck that features a mural depicting a firefighter raising the flag is unveiled to the public in Clintonville, Wisconsin, on January 20, 2002. The truck was donated to the New York Fire Department.
The scene captured by Franklin also made its way onto a commemorative coin.
Artist Jim Conrad designed a sculptured bronze version of the flag raising in honor of the Rev. Mychal Judge, a New York Fire Department chaplain who lost his life while administering last rites on September 11, 2001. Conrad is seen polishing the sculpture in 2002 at his home in Lakewood, Colorado.
President George W. Bush unveils a "Heroes of 2001" stamp issued by the Postal Service on March 11, 2002, to raise funds to assist the families of emergency relief workers killed or permanently disabled as a result of the World Trade Center attacks. He is joined at the White House by the firefighters who are featured in the image, from left, Eisengrein, Johnson and McWilliams. The stamp is displayed at a ceremony outside of the Brooklyn Borough Hall in New York on July 2, 2002. From left, Brooklyn Postmaster Joseph Lubrano, Borough President Marty Markowitz and Harold Meyers of the New York City Fire Department were in attendance.
NASCAR driver Jamie McMurray decorated the hood of his car with a replica of the "Heroes of 2001" stamp. A crew member helps ready the car at the Daytona International Speedway in 2002.
The image can also be found on T-shirts, like this one worn by Venita Bradford at a memorial service in Energy, Illinois, on September 11, 2002.
A version of the photograph appears on a commemorative knife. A snow globe owned by collector Josef Kardinal depicts the flag raising at ground zero. He is seen in 2006 at his home in Nuremberg, Germany.
A 40-foot-tall bronze monument named "To Lift a Nation" depicts the famous scene. Pictured at a warehouse in 2007, the sculpture is now part of the permanent collection at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Park in Emmitsburg, Maryland.

The iconic image has also been turned into a pair of earrings. Wax figures of the firefighters are displayed during the "HOPE: Humanity And Heroism" exhibition at Madame Tussauds in Washington on May 10, 2013.

Iconic image of 9/11 flag raising
'That's not a picture. It's an icon'
And while the whereabouts of the Iwo Jima flag are known (it's at the National Museum of the Marine Corps), the fate of the World Trade Center site 3-foot-by-5-foot flag became a mystery.
Old Glory: 'What makes us American'
CNN Films' "The Flag," which premieres Wednesday night on CNN, explores what may have happened to it.
It's a story replete with mystery.
Within hours of its raising, the flag disappeared from the World Trade Center site. The makers of the film documented this by looking at the background of photos taken soon after.
The flag that subsequently flew over Yankee Stadium as a patriotic rebuke to terrorism, and fluttered over the USS Roosevelt as the aircraft carrier sent missions over Afghanistan, was represented as the same flag that was raised.
The original flag was "either misplaced, stolen or secreted away by unknown forces in the chaos of ground zero," the film's directors said in a statement.
Help look for the flag
Raised flag became a national symbol
Dishonesty was not behind the story of the flag's travels, said Michael Tucker, who produced, wrote and directed "The Flag" with his wife, Petra Epperlein. There were more important things to do than keep up with a single flag, which was quickly joined by several others.
"(For) people who were down there, the most important thing for them was recovering people, even when they knew there were no survivors," Tucker said.
When an official was sent to pick up the flag a week or so later, he apparently received a larger flag, and it was flown at subsequent events.
"They had no reason to believe it wasn't the flag," Tucker said.
The story of the missing flag includes a larger, more philosophical question: Is it the actual flag that is most important -- or the ideals it represents?
For its part, the WTC flag photo -- taken by Tom Franklin of the Record newspaper in Bergen, New Jersey -- quickly became a symbol.
It was plastered on the cover of Newsweek, with the words, "God Bless America," and the image could be seen on everything from coffee cups to tattoos.
"Most people will see it happen once or twice in their lifetime -- where the whole nation stands together," said Tucker.
"It was the worst of times and probably the best of America," Tucker told CNN on Tuesday.
The makers of "The Flag" spoke with several photographers about going to ground zero and the heartbreaking scenes that awaited. The film is partly forensic, with an expert comparing photos of the original flag and others that appear to be larger.
Among those interviewed were the couple who owned the yacht from which the flag was taken by a firefighter to hang at the WTC site.
They wanted to donate the flag to the Smithsonian Institution and asked about a year after the attacks to borrow the signed flag briefly for a ceremony.
"When we got the flag, we were quite stunned that it was the wrong flag," said Shirley Dreifus. "... This wraps around the two of us, and we're not the thinnest people on Earth ... So we knew right away it was the wrong flag."
Learn more than you ever knew about "The Flag"
Does it matter whether it was the real flag?
Woven throughout the film, which is based on a book by David Friend, are discussions about the powerful nature of a flag.
"We're not a country based on religion or ethnicity, or even cultural heritage" Burns told the filmmakers. "We're a country based on ideas and a philosophy. And that's what the flag is."
Jodi Goglio, who works for Eder Flag, said a flag "makes you feel that we are bigger than just ourselves."
A young crew member of the USS Roosevelt wiped away tears as she described having the supposed WTC flag on board.
"It just makes what you're doing so much more, wow, meaningful," she said.
When asked whether it mattered whether the flag was recovered, a visitor to the 9/11 memorial said, "It would matter. It would matter to me." Another said, "I think it would to the families who lost their loved ones." Among those who died were 343 firefighters.
Thomas Koehler, a retired detective with the New York Police Department, said he would rather not know what became of the WTC flag.
"If you had the actual flag ... the cynic in me (would say), people want it. You put a price on it. ... then it becomes something else."
Tucker got a firsthand taste of a flag's power while making "Gunner Palace" with Epperlein.
Released in 2004, the documentary tells the story of a group of American soldiers who fought in Baghdad.
The Iraqi insurgency was growing, and Tucker, an American, wanted to leave in spring 2004 for his home, then in Germany.
He stayed at a U.S. facility at the airport and awoke to find a small folded American flag under his pillow, a customary gift made by some group.
"I was so overwhelmed with emotion. That flag means home," Tucker said. "While that experience is not uniquely American, when you are thousands of miles from home, under stress, and you see the colors -- it reminds you of your people."
The Flag: What makes an image unforgettable?
