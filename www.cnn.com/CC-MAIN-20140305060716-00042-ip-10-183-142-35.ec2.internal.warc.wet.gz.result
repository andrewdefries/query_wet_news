(CNN) -- Documents obtained by CNN reveal the United States knew about, and even condoned, embargo-breaking oil sales by Saddam Hussein's regime, and did so to shore up alliances with Iraq's neighbors.The oil trade with countries such as Turkey and Jordan appears to have been an open secret inside the U.S. government and the United Nations for years.The unclassified State Department documents sent to congressional committees with oversight of U.S. foreign policy divulge that the United States deemed such sales to be in the "national interest," even though they generated billions of dollars in unmonitored revenue for Saddam's regime.The trade also generated a needed source of oil and commerce for Iraq's major trading partners, Turkey and Jordan."It was in the national security interest, because we depended on the stability in Turkey and the stability in Jordan in order to encircle Saddam Hussein," Edward Walker, a former assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, told CNN when asked about the memo documents."We had a great amount of cooperation with the Jordanians on the intelligence side, and with the Turks as well, so we were getting value out of the relationship," said Walker, who served in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. The memos obtained by CNN explain why both administrations waived restrictions on U.S. economic aid to those countries for engaging in otherwise prohibited trade with Iraq. The justifications came at a time when the United States was a staunch backer of U.N. sanctions on Iraq imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990."Despite United Nations Security Council Resolutions," a 1998 memo signed by President Clinton's deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, said, "Jordan continues to import oil from Iraq."But Jordan had a "lack of economically viable alternatives" to Iraqi oil, Talbott's memo said.Talbott's memo lauded Jordan's commitment to the Middle East peace process, citing the late King Hussein's personal efforts to broker a resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."Timely, reliable assistance from the United States fosters the political stability and economic well-being critical to Jordan's continuing role as a regional leader for peace," Talbott said.Identical language was used four years later in a 2002 memo by Richard Armitage, undersecretary of state under President George W. Bush."Jordan has made clear its choice for peace and normalization with Israel," Armitage said, calling Jordan "an important U.S. friend" and citing its 2001 free trade treaty with the United States."U.S. assistance provides the Jordanian government needed flexibility to pursue policies that are of critical importance to U.S. national security and to foreign policy objectives in the Middle East," Armitage said.Economic and military ties to Turkey were cited by Talbott and Armitage in justifying waivers of U.S. penalties to Iraq's northern neighbor. Indeed, their memos advocated hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the U.S. allies.Talbott's memo praised Turkey for deploying troops to the peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, policing heroin trafficking through Turkey, and cooperating with enforcement of the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq by allowing U.S. and British jets to use Incirlik, Turkey, as a base.Armitage's memo said Turkey "provides irreplaceable assistance in countering the threat the Baghdad regime poses" and lauded the U.S. ally for sending troops to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks."The primacy of Turkey's role as a front-line ally in the war on terrorism is expected to assume even greater prominence and urgency as the global war on terrorism continues," Armitage said.Deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told CNN Tuesday the waivers were given to Jordan and Turkey every year since 1998. He called both countries "special cases" in which the money Saddam made through the smuggling did not allow him weapons. "With Jordan and Turkey the circumstances were unique," Ereli said. "We approached them in a way that preserved key alliances and didn't help the regime of Saddam Hussein." He added that Saddam's smuggling to Syria, which the United States tried to curtail, raised far more concerns because of the possibility of "dual use" goods reaching Iraq.Illicit revenueEstimates of how much revenue Iraq earned from these tolerated side sales of its oil to Jordan and Turkey, as well as to Syria and Egypt, range from $5.7 billion to $13.6 billion.This illicit revenue far exceeds the estimates of what Saddam pocketed through illegal surcharges on his U.N.-approved oil exports and illegal kickbacks on subsequent Iraqi purchases of food, medicine, and supplies -- $1.7 billion to $4.4 billion -- during the maligned seven-year U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq.The Government Accountability Office estimated last July that Iraq earned $5.7 billion from smuggling oil out of the country, especially to Jordan, Turkey, and Syria between 1996 and 2002.A CIA-backed Iraq Survey Group report by former Iraq weapons inspector Charles Duelfer estimated last October that Saddam acquired $8 billion by smuggling oil to Jordan, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt through 2003, when oil for food ended with the toppling of Saddam.The Senate Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations estimated last November that the Iraqi regime earned $13.6 billion by smuggling oil during the sanctions period it defined as 1991-2003, or five years before oil-for-food started.The oil-for-food program is being investigated by U.S. congressional committees, the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a special committee appointed by the United Nations and led by former Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Paul Volcker.Volcker's committee is to issue an interim report on Thursday. (Full story)In an interview last month with the U.S.-based Arabic-language TV station Al Hurrah, Volcker said, "The big figures are smuggling, which took place before the oil-for-food program started, and it continued while the oil-for-food program was in place."'Either silent or complicit'Rep. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, one of five panels probing the oil-for-food program, told CNN the United States was "complicit in undermining" the U.N. sanctions on Iraq. "How is it that you stand on a moral footing to go after the U.N. when they're responsible for 15 percent maybe of the ill-gotten gains, and we were part and complicit of him getting 85 percent of the money?" Menendez asked."Where was our voice on the committee that was overseeing this on the Security Council?"The reality is that we were either silent or complicit, and that is fundamentally wrong."Former State Department diplomat Walker said, "It was almost a 'don't ask, don't tell' kind of policy. It was accepted in the Security Council. No one challenged it." John Ruggie, a former senior adviser to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said U.S. diplomats focused on assuring U.N.-approved shipments to Iraq were free of military components, and the United States felt Jordan and Turkey needed to be compensated for the adverse impact of the sanctions.Ruggie said, "The secretary of state of the United States said each and every year that those illegal sales were in the national security interest of the United States. So it wasn't just that the U.S. was looking the other way."Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Troops are ready for the end of 'don't ask, don't tell' By Roland S. Martin, CNN Senior Political Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTSRoland Martin speaks to Army Command Sgt. Maj. Marvin HillHill says the right leadership can deal with repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"Martin says opponents of repeal should listen to the military, as they said they wouldHe criticizes McCain for opposing repeal after top military leaders advised in favor of itEditor's note: Roland Martin is a syndicated columnist and author of "The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House." He is a commentator for TV One Cable network and host/managing editor of its Sunday morning news show, Washington Watch with Roland Martin. (CNN) -- One of the reasons Defense Secretary Robert Gates commissioned a study on how the military feels about gays serving openly was because it was ridiculous to listen to politicians rambling on and on, and not to those who have to do the heavy lifting. When the results were released, they showed more than two-thirds believe their work wouldn't be harmed by changing the 17-year-old law. That was clear evidence to many that the law needed to be overturned. But after massive flip-floppers like Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona ignored the advice of the defense secretary and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and continued to come up with reasons why the policy needs to be kept, it's no surprise the measure failed this week to get beyond a GOP filibuster. It was largely Republicans who blocked the measure from being debated in the Senate, with supporters only able to muster 57 of the needed 60 votes. The only Democrat to go along with the Republican opponents was Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Supporters of the repeal say they have the votes to pass the measure, but who knows if moderate Republicans will come up with more reasons why they can't support the legislation? The one thing that is absolutely clear is that it is time for this law to be revoked. 'Don't ask, don't tell' fails in Senate

Afghanistan
Roland S. Martin
In an interview on my TV One Cable Network Sunday morning news show, "Washington Watch," I talked with the top enlisted officer serving in Afghanistan, Command Sgt. Maj. Marvin Hill, who made it clear that soldiers serving on the battlefield can be led to implement the changes if Congress will act. "I'm thinking that the -- the troops are ready for something like this," the Memphis, Tennessee, native said. "They are well led. We know that if there is a change, that that change will have to be led, and it's going to have to be led by senior leaders such as myself and -- and others across the battlefield. "Senior leaders are the ones (who are) going to set the tone in the unit and enable the unit to move forward." When McCain was behaving like a reasonable politician whose word could be trusted, he said if the top brass in the military supported repealing "don't ask, don't tell," he -- a former Navy pilot and POW -- would follow their lead. That was when more folks were against the measure. Now that the winds have shifted, so has McCain, and he has promised to filibuster any effort to change the law. As for members of the military who are as dead set against repealing the law as McCain, Hill said it might be time for them to find another line of work. "If there are people who cannot deal with the change, then they're going to have to do what's best for their troops and best for the organization and best for the military service and exit the military service, so that we can move forward -- if that's the way that we have to go," said Hill, who served three tours of duty in Iraq before moving to Afghanistan. That's what we call leadership. No flip-flops. No double-talk. Just straight talk. You know, the stuff McCain used to be known for. When we have members of our military shedding blood on the battlefield, it is nonsensical that we would be using sexual orientation as a reason to discharge able-bodied men and women willing to serve their country. I'll bet $1,000 that if someone was on the front lines and mired in a fierce firefight, they wouldn't give a flip if the person coming to their aid were homosexual. All that matters is that a fellow soldier wasn't leaving his or her comrade on the battlefield there to fend for himself or herself. Our soldiers are showing tremendous courage on the battlefield. It would be nice if our political leaders in Washington had an ounce of their courage and commitment to get rid of a law that serves no usefulness in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.

Embracing adventure in Vietnam
By Julie Hays, CNN
updated 4:58 PM EDT, Fri March 23, 2012
My Son Sanctuary, a series of temples built centuries ago, was the religious and political epicenter of the Champa Kingdom. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a dramatic example of the influence of Indian Hinduism in central Vietnam.
Motorbike traffic floods the streets of Hanoi's Old Quarter. North Vietnam used Hoa Lo Prison, often referred to as the Hanoi Hilton, to house prisoners of war during the Vietnam War, including Sen. John McCain. The prison is now a museum and popular tourist spot in Hanoi.
A seafood stall displays plates of dried shrimp and squid at a market in Hanoi's Old Quarter. Cat Ba Town is on the southern tip of Cat Ba Island. It offers beautiful views of the bay, fresh seafood and affordable accommodations attracting backpackers from all over the world. The main street is lined with tall, narrow buildings, most of which are hotels catering to backpackers.
Large networks of floating villages hide in the shadows of the karsts in Halong Bay. Brightly colored huts are built on grids of floating barrels and beams.
A climber scales the craggy walls of the Polish Pillar in Halong Bay. The limestone pillar is a popular spot for the sport of deep-water soloing, where climbers ascend without ropes or gear and rely on the depth of the water to protect them when they fall or jump.
Rock climbers scale two routes on Moody's Beach in Halong Bay in Vietnam.
A short kayak trip from a tourist boat anchored in Halong Bay takes visitors to Tiger Beach, home to a popular sport climbing wall. Kayaking is a great way to get a view of the bay, but beware of the tides.
The city of Hoi An is known for its coastal cuisine. Many restaurants offer cooking classes, where travelers try their hand at regional specialties. This seafood salad with Vietnamese herbs is a creation of students at the Red Bridge Cooking School.
A vendor at an outdoor market in a village near the city of Hoi An displays stingrays for sale. Hoi An is known for the colorful lanterns that line the streets and stores of the historic district. Lantern vendors hawk their creations on street corners every night.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A first-time visit to Vietnam includes rock climbing and cooking school
Cat Ba, a backpacker's island paradise, is an affordable getaway in Halong Bay
Experiencing Hanoi means embracing the chaos at street level
(CNN) -- I clung white-knuckled to the back of my friend's motorbike as the two of us zipped around the streets of Hanoi.
We buzzed past a man sitting in a barber's chair on the sidewalk of a main road. The man was peering into an oval mirror tacked to a tree as the barber clipped away.
"See! O.I.V!" my friend said.
"What?" I asked, trying to figure out what I had seen as much as what he just said.
"O.I.V.," he repeated. "Only in Vietnam."
It was the first day of my 11-day tour through northern and central Vietnam, and the adventure had just begun.
Taste your travels with foodie vacations Vietnam was never at the top of my list of places to visit -- that is until my old roommate from Atlanta took a job in Hanoi.
When my rock-climbing partner, with a level of sanity as questionable as my own, found out climbing was on our itinerary, he decided to join in.
We'd start in Hanoi and take in the city sights, make our way to Cat Ba Island for a little climbing and finally to Hoi An along the central coast for some relaxation.
Hanoi at street level
We flew in to the capital, where traffic signals and street signs, if they exist, seem more like suggestions than law.
The streets are the heart and soul of Hanoi. They're where people gather for everything from dinner to shoe repair, and the only way to take in the city is to plunge into the traffic.
So we did, starting with a walking tour of the Old Quarter.
Roughly 1,000 years old, the Old Quarter developed as craftsmen gathered around the old palace to peddle their wares. The narrow streets eventually became the central marketplace and business area, but it retains much of its ancient charm.
The buildings are only a few stories tall, narrow and deep, and artisans and merchants still line the sidewalks.
The streets are named after what you may find on them -- tinwork on Hang Thiec and silk on Hang Gai. Hang Dau was once home to fragrant oil merchants, but now tourists and locals walk the street looking for a great deal on shoes.
After watching a tinsmith melt and mold what appeared to be a sprinkler head, another wonder of the Hanoi streets caught my eye, or rather my taste buds.
On the balcony of a coffee shop near the Old Quarter, I had my first sip of café sua da -- Vietnamese iced coffee.
It is dark and thick like espresso, but served iced and creamed with a couple of spoonfuls of sweetened condensed milk. I was addicted at first sip.
Climbing on Cat Ba Island
One taxi, three buses and a speedboat away from Hanoi we found the small island of Cat Ba in Halong Bay.
Halong Bay was named one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature in 2011 and is easily recognized by the hundreds of limestone karsts that jut sharply out of the turquoise waters.
Where much of the area has watered down the wilderness experience to cater to tourists, Cat Ba attracts a more low-maintenance traveler -- the "Tây ba lô."
"It means 'Western backpacker,' " my friend explained. "But it also means they think you're cheap."
Cat Ba is a popular spot for backpackers from all over the world who have developed a reputation for their stinginess. Accommodations are basic, and prices are low.
Tall, narrow hotels line the main road, each with an amazing view of the harbor. Rooms go for dollars a day, and the cafes feature fresh seafood on the cheap.
But the real draw of the island is away from the main drag, so our first morning we caught a ride on a tourist boat to a beachside climbing site.
As we meandered through the waters of the bay, a unique nautical culture revealed itself. Because the land is often too rocky to cultivate but the bay is rich in sea life, locals have made the water their home.
Large networks of floating villages hide in the shadows of the karsts. Brightly colored huts are built on grids of floating barrels and beams with frontyards made of fishing nets.
Our boat dropped anchor off the shore of a deserted beach. We loaded our climbing gear onto kayaks and paddled over.
We scaled the jagged walls of Tiger and Moody's beaches in solitude, taking in the beauty of Halong Bay from the top of the vertical cliffs.
In addition to experiencing the bay's natural beauty, you can't help but stumble upon history.
We explored the island during a break between climbing routes and found a natural cave with a man-made concrete slab for a floor, most likely created as a hideout during the Vietnam War (or the American War, as it's known in Vietnam).
Although I never discovered the history of that exact cave, back on Cat Ba we toured another war-era relic with a local guide.
Hospital Cave is a three story, bomb-proof structure built into a natural cave. It was a hospital and a safe house for the Viet Cong during the war, complete with a kitchen, surgical rooms and a theater.
We also traded $8 cash for two motorbikes (no rental agreement required) and sped up the windy, lush road to Cannon Fort.
Cannon Fort was built in the 1940s and later used during the war. Two cannons remain hidden in its crevices, and it's a spectacular place to take in a sunset.
High class in Hoi An
After braving the traffic in the city and the cliffs (and jellyfish) of the bay, I deemed the last part of our trip as R&R time, and the ancient city of Hoi An did not disappoint.
Most port cities in Vietnam have met one of two fates: They have either grown into large industrial harbors such as Da Nang or shriveled over time.
Hoi An is different. Its narrow streets with lantern-lit storefronts and a fusion of various styles of traditional Asian architecture give it a quaint feel.
Two of the city's specialties are clothing and food. The first you can get made to order. The second you can make yourself.
Every other storefront in the old town is a tailor's shop where you can design your own clothing, pick the fabrics and have it sewn overnight. If you find the right tailor, you can walk away with quality, high-style clothing made to fit at big-box store prices.
As for the food, Hoi An is a unique blend of northern and southern flavors with specialties such as white rose dumplings and the Hoi An pancake. Many of the cafes offer cooking classes so you can master the flavors of the city and take them home with you.
Our cooking class started with a tour of the local market, where we picked up a few fresh ingredients and learned about the local food culture. It turns out turmeric will cure all that ails you, according to Vietnamese tradition, and durian -- a very smelly fruit -- is an acquired taste.
After a leisurely boat ride, we arrived at the Red Bridge Cooking School. Under its thatched portico, we learned to make rice paper and spring rolls, cook in a clay pot and fry Banh Xeo, a shrimp and rice pancake.
Trying to re-create that rice paper turned into an epic disaster back in the States, but for an afternoon, we were masters of the trade.
Not for everyone, not forever
From the madness of Hanoi to the untamed beauty of Cat Ba -- each of our destinations offered a unique glimpse into Vietnamese culture.
It's not for everyone, but for those willing to brave the unknown, the country is ripe with untapped adventures.
Hurry though. Sprawling resorts are popping up, and the booming tourism business has many young people learning how to cater to the nuances of Western culture more often than celebrating their own.
Vietnam is a country on the cusp. In another decade, it may be a cookie-cutter tourist oasis. But for now, the spirit of Vietnam remains.

Hillary Clinton treated for blood clot in her head
From Elise Labott, CNN updated 7:27 AM EST, Tue January 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The clot was found in the vein between the brain and the skull behind her right ear
NEW: It did not result in a stroke or neurological damage, Clinton's doctors said
NEW: Clinton's doctors expect her to make a full recovery
(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was treated with blood thinners on Monday at a New York hospital to help dissolve a blood clot in her head and doctors were confident she would make a full recovery.
Clinton was admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday due to the clot that was discovered during a follow-up exam related to a concussion she suffered this month, her spokesman, Philippe Reines, said.
The clot was located in the vein between the brain and and the skull behind Clinton's right ear and did not result in any stroke or neurological damage, her doctors said in a statement.
Clinton was treated with blood thinners to help dissolve the clot and would be released once the medication dose had been established, they said.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured in October 2012, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington. Here's a look at her life and career through the years:
Before she married Bill Clinton, she was Hillary Rodham. Here, Rodham talks about student protests in 1969, which she supported in her commencement speech at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
Rodham, center, a lawyer for the Rodino Committee, and John Doar, left, chief counsel for the committee, bring impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon in the Judiciary Committee hearing room at the U.S. Capitol in 1974. Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton helps first lady Rosalynn Carter on a campaign swing through Arkansas in June 1979. Also seen in the photo is Hillary Clinton, center background.

Blood clots: 4 things you need to know
Clinton, 65, was suffering from a stomach virus earlier this month when she fainted because of dehydration, causing the concussion.
Blood clots "are clumps that occur when blood hardens from a liquid to a solid," according to the National Institutes for Health.
Clots can form inside veins or arteries or even the heart, the NIH says. "A blockage in the vein will usually cause fluid buildup and swelling," the NIH website says. Among the possible threats: Sometimes, a "clot can break loose and travel from one location in the body to another."

Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home.
She was scheduled to return to work at the State Department this week after being sidelined for most of the past month.
Her illness forced her to bow out of testifying on December 20 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the deadly September attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
Clinton, a one-time presidential candidate who is the source of constant speculation she might run again in 2016, plans to step down from the State Department once a replacement is confirmed by the Senate.
President Barack Obama has nominated Sen. John Kerry to succeed her.

Tire plant, other buildings in Oklahoma damaged by strong storm
By Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 9:01 PM EDT, Wed April 17, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A powerful storm causes damage near Lawton, Oklahoma, a sheriff says There are no immediate reports of injuries, though some buildings are damaged
Parts of Kansas, Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma faced tornado threats
The severe weather threat moves east Thursday, with parts of nine states in danger
(CNN) -- A strong storm Wednesday evening damaged a Goodyear tire plant and other buildings around Lawton, Oklahoma, Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley said.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
A tornado watch was in effect Wednesday night for that area, as were a severe thunderstorm warning and a flash flood warning, according to the National Weather Service.
Hundreds of flights canceled in Denver and Chicago
Earlier Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center reported "significant severe weather is expected over parts of the southern/central plains later today and tonight."
The center, which is part of the National Weather Service, predicted that southeastern Kansas, western Missouri, northern Texas and most of Oklahoma were the areas most likely to be hit by "potentially significant and long-tracked" tornadoes.
Lawton, Oklahoma, for instance, was hit by showers and thunderstorms Wednesday night, though conditions should improve in that city -- located about 85 miles southwest of Oklahoma City -- as the week goes on.
By then, the threat of damaging weather will have moved farther east. The storm prediction center is forecasting a moderate chance of severe weather on Thursday for a narrow stretch that nonetheless touches nine states, from Michigan in the north to Louisiana in the south.

Court bans Musharraf from Pakistani politics
By CNN Staff
updated 5:41 AM EDT, Wed May 1, 2013
Pervez Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The ruling by the high court in Peshawar follows similar rulings from lower courts
Musharraf, who is accused of wrongdoing in office, can appeal
He had been in exile before he returned to Pakistan recently
Elections are to be held next month
(CNN) -- A court in Pakistan has banned former President Pervez Musharraf from politics for life.
Tuesday's move -- which can appealed by the controversial figure -- is another barrier in the roadblock Musharraf faces as he tries to get back into his country's political mix.
The ruling by the high court in Peshawar follows similar ruling from lower courts and the Election Commission. Musharraf can pursue an appeal in the Peshawar court or take it to the country's Supreme Court. There was no immediate comment from Musharraf's camp.
National elections are scheduled for next month.
Former President Musharraf in court
Secret drone deal between Pakistan, U.S.
Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan recently under heavy security.
After his return, Musharraf was placed in house arrest by an anti-terrorism court over allegations he illegally ordered the detention of judges in 2007. He denies the charges against him.
The ex-military strongman still has to face two other cases dating from his time in power.
The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- before she was assassinated in 2007, weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office.
Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006.

Ke$ha: Malaysian authorities cancel show, threaten jail
From Jessica King, CNN
updated 9:56 PM EDT, Sun October 27, 2013
File photo of Ke$ha at Hyde Park on July 2 in London, England.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The show was supposed to be on Saturday
Promoters said Ke$ha changed her show to comply with Malaysian culture
"to be clear. I did NOT cancel," the singer tweets
(CNN) -- Sultry singer Ke$ha is known for her party anthems about binge drinking and dating.
And maybe that was the reason Malaysian authorities pulled the plug on her concert set for Saturday at a Kuala Lumpur stadium.
But whatever the reason for the show cancellation, Ke$ha wasn't happy about it.
The singer took to Twitter to defend herself.
"To be clear. I did NOT cancel. I was not allowed to play. and then I was going to play anyways and was threatened with imprisonment," she wrote from her official Twitter account.
Officials at Malaysia's ministry of communications and multimedia could not immediately be reached for comment.
Promoters Livescape Asia said they tried to comply with Malaysian rules.
They even worked with the artist to "modify the show to suit the Malaysian culture and sensitivities, including having made adjustments to her song lyrics, wardrobe changes, and a set list that was modified to specifically adhere to the guidelines set forth by the authorities," the promoters said.
The promoters said the decision to cancel the show could cost them more than $350,000.
This is not the first time Ke$ha has dealt with a form of censorship.
Last year, after an elementary school mass shooting in Connecticut that left 20 children dead, some radio stations temporarily stopped playing Ke$ha's popular song "Die Young."
At the time, the pop star said she understood the decision.
"I'm so so so sorry for anyone who has been effected by this tragedy," she posted on Twitter. "I understand why my song is now inappropriate. words cannot express."

Born 3.5 months early, Ward Miles Miller weighed only 1 pound, 13 ounces. The Millers couldn't hold Miles for the first four days of his life. Instead, Benjamin Scot Miller holds his son's tiny hand, letting Ward know he isn't alone. Benjamin and Lyndsey Miller spend time with their son in the NICU at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Lyndsey Miller looks adoringly at her son in the NICU while she cradles his tiny head surrounded by tubes and wires. "One doctor told us straight up the first night that there was a 50-50 chance that he would be normal," said Benjamin Miller, a professional photographer. "We definitely prayed and prayed."
The early birth wasn't Ward's only challenge. At 10 days old, a scan revealed blood in his brain tissue. His father remembers crying and praying the whole way to the hospital that day. "And then you get there and you see him, and he's laying there. He's still the same old self," Benjamin Miller said. Ward spent the first 107 days of his life in the NICU at Nationwide Children's Hospital.
Lyndsey Miller kisses her son's tiny head. Once the Millers were able to hold their son, his dad says it was hard to let go. They spent as much time with Ward in the NICU as the hospital allowed. Ward finally got to go home after spending more than 100 days in the NICU. "Everything was leading up to that day, and to have him there was amazing, " his dad told CNN.
Dad and son take a nap at home.
Today, Ward is 16-months-old and has no major health issues, except for an inflammation in his throat. "All the doctors who meet him and we say he was 15 weeks early, they just can't believe it," Benjamin Miller said. "He doesn't even look like he was a preemie."
Ward gets a ride on his dad's shoulders.
Benjamin Miller tells CNN that his 16-month-old son is thriving and on track developmentally with his age group. Ward watches football with his dad from the comfort of their living room. Ward gives a big gummy smile to the camera. His dad keeps a close eye on his son from behind. Ward runs around the house in his walker like a normal toddler.
Ward examines himself in the mirror.
Lyndsey Miller gives her son a big kiss in his batman pajamas. Ward's parents think he's a superhero, so it's only fitting he wears batman pajamas. Today Ward is a happy and mostly healthy little boy. A chunky 16-month-old Ward Miles Miller is thriving. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Benjamin Miller made a video of his son's first year of life
Ward was born 15 weeks early and had bleeding in his brain
Ward Miles Miller is now mostly healthy
(CNN) -- Benjamin Scot Miller and his wife, Lyndsey, didn't expect to be parents on July 16, 2012.
The Ohio couple's son wasn't due for another 3½ months. But the cramps that Lyndsey felt that day at work were actually contractions. Doctors could not stop the baby from being born that day.
Ward Miles Miller was a delicate 12 inches long. He weighed 1 pound, 13 ounces, but soon dropped to 1 pound 7 ounces.
This viral video will make you cry
"One doctor told us straight up the first night that there was a 50/50 chance that he would be normal," said Benjamin Miller, a professional photographer. "We definitely prayed and prayed."
Dad chronicles baby born 15 weeks early
Miller captured some of the key moments in Ward's journey and stitched them together in a video running almost seven minutes long, now hugely popular on Vimeo.
Watch the video of Ward's first year
Miller's footage shows how Lyndsey Miller first held her son, at 4 days old, when Ward was covered in tubes and cords. Hospital staff helped position the baby and the medical equipment so he could nestle against his mother's chest.

In the video, Ward's mother looks straight at the camera and smiles, gently stroking the baby, then suddenly tilts her head down and covers her mouth with her hand in a flood of tearful emotion.
The early birth wasn't Ward's only challenge. At 10 days old, a scan revealed blood in his brain tissue, meaning blood had gotten in there at some point. His father remembers crying and praying the whole way to the hospital that day.
"And then you get there and you see him, and he's laying there. He's still the same old self," he said. "We just felt so bad. He has no control over this. It's not his fault."
Over time, the bleed didn't grow, and the blood was slowly reabsorbed by the brain. The problem has not persisted.
Ward finally got to go home after spending more than 100 days in the NICU at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. "HOME" is displayed in large capital letters in the video.
"When we finally brought him home, it was amazing," Miller said. "That was the day. Everything was leading up to that day, and to have him there was amazing. It was how it was supposed to be from the get-go. We had to wait 107 days before we could experience that, so it was just amazing."
Miller had originally wanted to prepare a video for his son's first birthday, but after that day went by, he found the next best opportunity: October 31, the anniversary of Ward's homecoming and one day before Lyndsey's birthday.
The video found a large audience online; it's been watched more than 3.6 million times.
"It's definitely spreading awareness about NICUs," Ward's dad said. "People have no idea ... that there are these NICUs with these babies holding on and parents scared out of their wits, and it's going on every day all around the nation."
The main comments Miller has been getting on the video are from other fathers who sharing their stories. Miller is struck by how similar their tales are.
"Pretty much everyone is saying, like, 'That was me. This video could have been me. That is exactly what I went through,' " Miller said.
Today, Ward is technically 16 months old, but since he wasn't supposed to be born until October 27, 2012, he seems just over a year old, Miller said.
"All the doctors who meet him and we say he was 15 weeks early, they just can't believe it," Miller said. "He doesn't even look like he was a preemie."
It's possible that the brain bleeding could result in problems later on, Miller said, but so far Ward doesn't need any speech or physical therapy.
"He just had his 15-month developmental assessment, and he's right on track with his age group," he said.
The child has no major health issues except for one: an inflammation in his throat. He sometimes vomits once every two days, which may be related to an allergy, but the family isn't sure. They have "a great doctor" helping, though, Miller said.
Ward has seen the video on his mother's iPad and likes watching himself, Miller said.
"But yeah, he doesn't understand it," Miller said, "and it's not going to be until he's probably 16, 17, 18 that it really sets in, what's happened."

A musical education
I'm surprised how little attention the death of Ahmet Ertegun is receiving. The man co-founded Atlantic Records, and -- with his brother and partner Nesuhi, partner Herb Abramson, executive and producer Jerry Wexler and producer Tom Dowd -- helped guide the careers of dozens of artists, many of them geniuses in their own right.If you're looking for a musical education, listen to the "Atlantic Rhythm & Blues" box, eight discs of powerful music and enlightening history: Stick McGhee, Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, Ray Charles, the Drifters, the Coasters, Stax/Volt, Aretha. Ertegun helped make that happen.(Not to mention Atlantic's rock roster: The (Young) Rascals, Buffalo Springfield, Led Zeppelin ...)Music executives don't always inspire admiration, and Lord knows the music business too often forgets about music. But listen to any Atlantic record from the label's golden age and it's obvious that Ertegun and his colleagues were also music lovers. They had ears.He will be missed.

Peter Boyle, 1935-2006
Peter Boyle is dead. The actor, best known for his role as Frank Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond," was 71.Many obituaries are rightly going to play up Boyle's performances in "Raymond" and the film "Young Frankenstein," but I'd like to add a plug for one of my favorite films: "The Candidate."In that 1972 movie, Boyle plays Marvin Lucas, the cynically efficient campaign manager of Bill McKay (Robert Redford). McKay, though the son of a former governor, is a political neophyte, and it's Lucas who must guide him through the electoral maze of a California senatorial campaign.Though Redford gives a great performance -- perhaps his best -- Boyle is the engine of the movie, a ball of energy constantly goading the ever-reluctant McKay onward. He can be blunt, he can be less than scrupulous (and he chips away at McKay's ideals, one by one), but when the election is over and McKay (spoiler!) comes out on top, even the newly minted senator knows who's in charge."What do we do now?" he famously asks Lucas in the movie's last line.Unbelievably, Boyle wasn't nominated for an Oscar for "The Candidate" -- he wasn't for anything, not "Joe" or "Young Frankenstein" or "Monster's Ball" -- and despite several Emmy nominations, he only won one, that for an "X-Files" guest spot. Which only goes to show that sometimes the best performances look so easy they're often overlooked. Peter Boyle, to his credit, seldom was.

Mel, sex, and violence
Hearts ripped out of chests and held aloft in all their pulsating, graphic glory as thousands of people cheer in delirious approval. Heads decapitated and tossed as gifts to the crowd, people rushing to catch them with the same fervor and delight as a child catching a foul ball in their mitt at a baseball game. Just two of many such violent, over-the-top, gut-wrenching, stomach-turning scenes in Mel Gibson's masterful piece of moviemaking, the R-rated "Apocalypto," which opened at No. 1 at the box office. Now imagine a movie featuring a man and a woman madly in love -- so much in love they can't keep their hands off each other. In this movie, which tells a compelling story that is also masterful, they repeatedly make love to each other and we see them naked (as we see the Mayan tribesmen and women in "Apocalypto"). The scenes are as sexually explicit as "Apocalypto" is violently explicit and nothing is left to the imagination. How would that movie be rated? R or NC-17? Go see another movie to find out the likely answer. "This Film Is Not Yet Rated" is a devastating indictment of the mysterious MPAA ratings board -- a group whose methods can seem like madness, fraught with illogic and hypocrisy. "This Film" blows the proverbial lid off the secretive MPAA, revealing its until-now shadowy members. It unpeels, layer by layer, the thick skin encasing the MPAA to reveal a thin-skinned group whose actions have tremendous financial and moral implications. So as we struggle with morals and values -- which by their very nature are subjective -- how do we explain the following: The moral and not-so-moral majority seem willing to accept that we, as a society, have little problem with graphic violence on the scale seen in "Apocalypto." Adults feel comfortable watching it with their kids by their side, just another family entertainment outing of gorging on popcorn, pretzel bites, hot dog and Twizzlers while consuming buckets of on-screen violence.But if you were to substitute sex for the violence, there would be apoplexy and outrage, a rush to shield the eyes. If those same parents watched with their kids as lovemaking ensued on screen, the uncomfortable seat-shifting would surely be intense enough to loosen the floor bolts that hold the chairs in place. The double standard we allow with violence -- whether it be at the movies, on TV shows or in videogames -- can not be explained rationally. As someone once said, "Don't confuse me with logic."
