RANCHO DEL CIELO, California (CNN) -- A wildfire fueled by gusts of wind over drought-parched land burned just four miles from the ranch that served as former President Ronald Reagan's western White House, but firefighters expect it to be contained within two days and not threaten the ranch unless there is an unexpected shift in the weather, a Santa Barbara County fire official said."I would not say it's an imminent threat," said Santa Barbara County Fire Captain Mike Patarak, who commanded the crew sent to the ranch to check its vulnerability and water availability.Smoke from the blaze could be seen on the horizon from the entrance to the 688-acre Rancho del Cielo -- or "ranch in the sky" -- but it remained four miles to the west and moved no closer on Sunday, Patarak said.The weather over the next several days is expected to remain favorable for containing the fire, he said. If the winds do shift, it could pose a threat to the Reagan Ranch, he said."It's a little bit more exposed than some, depending on the weather, but it has good defensibility and a good water supply," Patarak said.Andrew Coffin, a spokesman for Young America's Foundation, which bought the ranch in 1998 to preserve as a historic site, said there is concern."There's definitely concern that it will cross the ranch property, but it's primarily dependent on the direction of the wind," Coffin said. The property's owners were confident that the modest 1,500-square-foot ranch home where the former president spent many quiet days would be protected."There's a pretty good chance that, even if the property burns, we'd be able to save the house," Coffin said.The ranch has its own fire-suppression system -- an elevated sprinkler system to soak the buildings and grass and a fire-retardant gel that can coat the buildings in the event of brush fires.There have been no reported injuries, but three out buildings have been destroyed in the fire's path, said Barry Peckham, spokesman for the Los Padres National Forest.The fire started Saturday around noon (3 p.m. EDT) 10 miles west of the Reagan ranch in the canyon area known as the Gaviota Pass and moved eastward toward the ranch along the Gaviota Coast, fire information officials said.The blaze has scorched more than 6,500 acres and led to the voluntary evacuation of 300-500 people from the Hollister Ranch community, west of the Gabiota Pass, east to Refugio Road, said Peckham."Most of the residents are scattered throughout the canyon," Peckham said. Those residents were allowed to return home Sunday evening.The evacuation included residents along Refugio Road and Highway 101 leading to the ranch were evacuated, but the ranch manager volunteered to stay, Coffin said.The strongest threat came Saturday, when 150 residents in the Hollister Ranch community were threatened during the initial stages of the fire, Peckham said.The Reagan ranch, not to be confused with the Reagan Ranch Center in downtown Santa Barbara, is not open to the public, but students and schools can schedule educational tours through the Young America's Foundation. Many of Nancy and Ronald Reagan's personal effects remain in the ranch home."We're preserving the property," Coffin said. "It came to us fully intact, with personal items -- to the president and Mrs. Reagan's clothes in the closet. It's a place where future young leaders can come and learn about his legacy."Members of Reagan's administration often visited the ranch.Reagan once said of the serene natural property, according to the ranch's Web site, "We relax at the ranch, which if not heaven itself, probably has the same zip code."The Reagan ranch comprises several buildings, including the home, a guest house, a small cottage next the guest house, a barn and garage, the ranch manager's home, the Secret Service command post and a hay barn, which holds a piece of the Berlin Wall.Reagan died Saturday in Los Angeles at 93 after battling Alzheimer's disease for 10 years.Five days of mourning are planned this week, including a state funeral in Washington and burial Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in nearby Simi Valley.

Domestic terror: Who's most dangerous?Eco-terrorists are now above ultra-right extremists on the FBI chartsBy Henry Schuster CNN
Editor's Note: Henry Schuster, a senior producer in CNN's Investigative Unit and author of "Hunting Eric Rudolph," has been covering terrorism for more than a decade. Each week in "Tracking Terror," he reports on people and organizations driving international and domestic terrorism and efforts to combat those. Earth Liberation Front members said they attacked buildings in Vail, Colorado, in 1998 to protect wildcats. RELATED

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Watching Eric Rudolph be sentenced to life in prison this week for his terror bombings, I wondered whether he and his followers represent the future of domestic terrorism or the past.After all, it's been nine years since he bombed the 1996 Olympics. That was little more than a year after Timothy McVeigh bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.Rudolph's last bombing, of a family planning clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, was in early 1998. Did it mark the end of the era when America's homegrown threat came primarily from right-wing extremists?The FBI believes Rudolph and McVeigh are part of the past.Instead, the agency sees a new threat: "The No. 1 domestic terrorism threat is the eco-terrorism, animal-rights movement," said John Lewis, an FBI deputy assistant director and top official in charge of domestic terrorism.Not so fast, says a monitor of domestic terrorist groups on both ends of the spectrum."It is simply ludicrous to describe animal rights and eco-terrorism as the No. 1 threat," said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He believes those following the paths of Rudolph and McVeigh are still a clear and present danger.Trying to decide which is the most dangerous domestic threat - far right-wing militants or eco- and pro-animal radicals - is, in some ways, analogous to deciding whether Osama bin Laden or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi poses the biggest international threat.But if you are the FBI or Department of Homeland Security, your domestic terror priority drives how finite resources are allocated -- especially when so much attention and money is focused on al Qaeda and international terror.Increasing violenceHere's how the animal rights and eco-terrorists made it to the top of the FBI charts."There is nothing else going on in this country, over the last several years, that is racking up the high number of violent crimes and terrorist actions, arsons, etc, that this particular area of domestic terrorism has caused," Lewis testified to a Senate committee earlier this year.Lewis said that from January 1990 to June 2004, "animal and environmental rights extremists have claimed credit for more than 1,200 [attacks], resulting in millions of dollars of damages and monetary loss."The FBI is worried about mounting rhetoric from the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), whose members regularly break into labs, destroy equipment and threaten scientists; and the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), whose supporters attack SUVs and housing developments. Consider the words of Jerry Vlasak, a physician who is a well-known activist in the animal advocacy movement in Los Angeles. He said he's not a member of ALF, but makes it his mission to publicize their actions. To Vlasak, anyone who does testing on live animals is a "vivisector."Vlasak made some incendiary comments at an animal rights conference in 2003. "I think there is a use for violence in our movement," Vlasak was reported as saying.He called violence morally acceptable at times. "If vivisectors were being killed, I think it would give other vivisectors pause. If there were prominent vivisectors being assassinated, there would be a trickle-down effect ... strictly from a fear and intimidation factor, that would be an effective action.""You wouldn't need to see too many assassinations" before vivisection declined, he said.The FBI admits it has had a hard time penetrating ALF and ELF. Actions are usually taken by small groups of people, acting autonomously, and e-mailing or faxing results to people like Vlasak, who publicize the results.The movement prides itself on this sort of independent cell structure and the lack of central leadership.Other threatsBut to date, Vlasak notwithstanding, no one has died from any of these attacks. And nothing on the terror scale of Oklahoma City or the 1996 Olympics has been committed, said Potok. My worry is that, just as in the years running up to the Oklahoma City bombing, ... we will ignore a world of violence emanating from our own extreme right.
-- Mark Potok, Southern Poverty Law Center
"A single person from the American extreme right managed to murder 168 people in a stroke," he said, referring to Oklahoma City. "There was a Ku Klux Klan plot in the late '90s that contemplated killing 30,000 people."Potok was referring to a plan by four Klan members to blow up a natural gas refinery near Fort Worth, Texas, in 1997. It never happened.Potok agreed with Lewis and the FBI that the ALF-ELF movement poses a danger. "I don't mean to diminish their activities. They've caused huge property damage and there is very little question they will kill someone these days."But he says that -- since Oklahoma City -- 15 police officers have been killed by right-wing extremists and his group has produced a list of some 60 plots by white supremacists and other anti-government radicals during that time - including, of course, Rudolph's bombing campaign."It is difficult to understand how the leaders of our major national security organizations can see it this way," Potok said, referring to the FBI's ranking of ALF and ELF as major domestic terrorism threats.Potok thinks politics is behind the decision: Political pressure from the White House and conservative Republicans toward the environmental movement is, in part, the reason eco-terrorism is now the priority, he said."My worry is that, just as in the years running up to the Oklahoma City bombing, ... we will ignore a world of violence emanating from our own extreme right."Rudolph victims' viewsFor Eric Rudolph's victims, who vented their anger during the sentencing hearing, there is no debate over relative dangers. To them, Rudolph remains the past, present and future of terrorism.Victims and family of victims offered heart-rending accounts of how their lives had been changed by Rudolph's bombs. Some forgave him. Others cursed him.Most didn't accept his apology for the Olympic Park bombing. Rudolph refused to apologize for the other bombings - of a family planning clinic and a gay club in Atlanta. His bombings killed two people and severely maimed another.It was absolutely quiet in the courtroom as Rudolph was led out -- the only sound you could hear came from the shackles on his feet.Even as he disappeared, the question remained - have we seen the last of his sort and does the future of domestic terrorism hold something new - even something we have not yet experienced?Which domestic terror group do you think poses the worst threat?

TSA to look at Vitter airport incidentStory Highlights TSA gathers information about alleged incident involving Louisiana Sen. David Vitter Vitter reportedly had angry confrontation with airport worker Vitter says media account of incident is overblown Next Article in Politics » From Ted Barrett CNN Congressional Producer	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is looking into a report that Louisiana Sen. David Vitter had an angry altercation with an airline worker at Washington Dulles International Airport last week. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter reportedly went into a "tirade" with a Washington Dulles International Airport worker. The agency is not doing a formal investigation, TSA spokesman Sterling Payne told CNN, but it is gathering information to determine if one is needed. "We are looking into the reported incident," Payne said. An aide to Vitter said Friday morning the Republican senator had not been contacted by the TSA and maintains the media account of the incident is overblown. Roll Call had a report in its gossip column earlier this week, based on an unnamed eyewitness, that Vitter arrived at the airport 20 minutes before his United Airlines flight was scheduled to depart. The door to the boarding bridge was already closed, but Vitter opened it anyway, triggering an alarm. The paper said an airline worker warned him not to enter the walkway, which led to a "tirade" by Vitter who "remained defiant." The source told Roll Call the senator left the area before airport police arrived. Vitter has refused to answer reporters' questions about the incident, but in a statement Wednesday described his actions more innocently and the Roll Call report "silly." "After being delayed on the Senate floor ensuring a vote on my anti-pay raise amendment and in a rush to make my flight home for town hall meetings the next day, I accidentally went through the wrong door at the gate," he said. "I did have a conversation with an airline employee, but it was certainly not like this silly gossip column made it out to be." Vitter has been the subject of unwelcome headlines before. In 2007, he was linked to a Washington, D.C., prostitution ring. He denied allegations he had relationships with prostitutes, but apologized for "a very serious sin." Joel DiGrado, Vitter's spokesman, said the congressman would not comment further on the issue.

Gates apologizes for Afghan-Pakistani border incident By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe defense secretary meets with a Pakistani generalHe calls the deaths of border guards "unintentional"Pakistan closed a main crossing on the border, blocking NATO supply trucks Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates apologized to a Pakistani general Wednesday for the recent deaths of Pakistani border guards in a U.S. helicopter strike, a Pentagon spokesman said. Pakistani Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani met Wednesday morning with Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, and other officials in Washington. The deaths prompted the Pakistanis to temporarily close a crossing used by trucks that haul material to NATO-led troops from Pakistan into Afghanistan. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said two guards died last month in a U.S. helicopter strike when the crew mistook them for insurgents and fired at them over the Afghan border in Pakistan. Gates called the deaths "unintentional," said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. He said the officials also discussed ways of improving military coordination along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the long-term relations between the United States and Pakistan.

N.C. plan a step back toward segregation By Benjamin Todd Jealous and Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSBenjamin Todd Jealous and Rev. Dr. William Barber II critical of Wake County, N.C., schools planThey say Tea Party-backed idea for "neighborhood schools" would upend desegregationKids in diverse schools fare better on many measures, studies show, they sayWriters: We must fight back at this move, which threatens to spread to other states

Tea Party Movement
Editor's note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP. The Rev. Dr. William Barber II is the president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. (CNN) -- The yearning to return to the antebellum South is not just being reflected in this year's celebration of the Confederacy, but also in growing efforts to reverse years of successful school integration. Nearly 60 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that state laws establishing separate public schools for children of color were unconstitutional. Today, in the great state of North Carolina, where the Democratic Party will hold its next convention, we are fighting the same battle against a Tea Party-backed effort to send our children to separate schools. In the last few months, extreme right-wing members of North Carolina's Wake County have advanced an agenda of "neighborhood schooling" that would drastically reduce school diversity and roll back years of progress and integration. Neighborhood schools, when implemented, usually mean some children get public schools that are racially identifiable and high-poverty, while others get schools that are selective, highly resourced and in effect function as "private" schools for the white and affluent. Research confirms that students in racially diverse schools do better in math and reading and display a marked increase in critical thinking. A 2006 study showed that the Latino and African American gains in math were much greater in diverse schools than in segregated ones. Other studies have shown that diverse high schools have smaller gaps in reading than schools with few or no students of color. In Wake County, they are trying to fix something that isn't broken. In a school board survey, 94 percent of parents said they support the current system; 86 percent of all students already go to schools within 5 miles of their homes. We cannot allow the North Carolina faction to roll back the clock to the 1950s. We know that separate is not equal; separate is unequal, immoral and detrimental to children of all races. Many believe that education in a racially integrated environment enhances the ability of our work force to compete in a global marketplace. It was a diverse school system that produced great American leaders like Xerox CEO Ursula Burns and President Barack Obama, who would not have had the opportunity to thrive in a segregated system. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan criticized the Wake County school board in a letter to the Washington Post. "America's strength has always been a function of its diversity, so it is troubling to see North Carolina's Wake County school board take steps to reverse a long-standing policy to promote racial diversity in its schools," he wrote. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is investigating the board's decision, after the state chapter of the NAACP and other groups filed a complaint last year. The great irony here is that the proponents of this campaign are so unwilling to learn from the past. Generally, Tea Party advocates have leaned hard on our nation's Constitution to defend their actions and beliefs. But the 14th Amendment to the Constitution ensures equal protection under the law for all citizens. By promoting segregation, the Tea Party members are abandoning their own guiding document, as well as their ability to use the power of hindsight to make informed decisions. Even late-night television hosts view the situation as laughable. "The Colbert Report" recently included a segment to highlight the absurdity of removing successful school diversity programs. Stephen Colbert remarked that the omission would "undo the doing of what was already done ... making the problem worse before making it better." Those who dismiss this issue as a local concern should consider that Wake County is emblematic of a larger problem. School boards across the country, including Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois and elsewhere in North Carolina, have problems with segregation or racial achievement gaps in classrooms. And several like-minded school board members in those states are hoping to replicate the experiment unfolding in North Carolina. North Carolina could become a social justice battleground, just as Arizona has been in the immigration debate. Wake County is becoming a symbol of attempts to return to the days pre-Brown v. Board of Education, just as 60 years ago, Birmingham, Alabama, woke the nation to the immoral costs of segregating our nation. We must foster a sustained and outspoken opposition to turning the clock back. It is in America's best interests to march together toward the goal of quality schools for all children. In every fight, the NAACP has raised only one goal: to guarantee every child in America a high-quality, constitutional, diverse and well-funded education. We cannot let Wake County become an unfortunate harbinger of things to come. We must rally together and ensure that our voices are heard. Americans' rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are closely related and interdependent. Quality health care ensures that students are at their best to learn. Strong educational equality creates access to productive employment and innovation. These jobs create a pathway to home ownership and boost our economy. This cyclic model highlights the basic needs of all of us. We invite all who hold an interest in securing these rights to join our efforts. Our legacy demands nothing less. What a sad comment on our times that in 2011, people of conscience have to lock hands and demonstrate once again against segregation. But on Saturday, February 12, that is what we did, marching along with NAACP activists and members of over 100 other organizations to the State Capitol in Raleigh, North Carolina, to demand, among other things, that our schools remain desegregated. The demonstration, called the Historic Thousands on Jones Street (HK on J) march, placed special emphasis on equitable school practices, economic injustice and equal protection under the law. The marchers rallied behind a chorus of "Forward Together, Not One Step Back." It is imperative that we bring that ideal to reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous and the Rev. Dr. William Barber II.

Putting the pride back into PSG: Qatari owners aim to be world's best
updated 4:58 AM EST, Thu March 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Paris Saint-Germain president tells CNN he wants to make club biggest in the world
Nasser Al-Khelaifi in charge of running club after Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani's takeover
PSG are coached by former AC Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti and are second in French league
Al-Khelaifi says it is the aim of PSG's owner to attract the best players in the world
(CNN) -- The president of Paris Saint-Germain says fans of the French club have overcome initial reservations about their new Qatari owners and have bought into their mission to make PSG the biggest team in the world.
Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN World Sport that his vision for the club centers around attracting the finest players on the planet to ply their trade in the French capital and turning PSG into a profitable enterprise.
Currently led by former AC Milan and Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti, PSG are in contention to win their first Ligue 1 title since 1994 and are close to securing their dream of competing in the European Champions League.
So can PSG conquer the footballing world and become as big as Spanish and European champions Barcelona?

The signing of Argentina midfielder Javier Pastore for a reported fee of $57 million in June 2011 demonstrated the new wealth at PSG's disposal.
PSG appointed former Juventus and Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti in December in a bid to secure the club's first French league title since 1994. The vastly experienced Italian has won the presitgious European Champions League twice with AC Milan.
PSG are battling at the top of the table for their first Ligue 1 title in 18-years. Here, the players celebrate a late equaliser against 2008 French champions Lyon which secured a point in an enthralling 4-4 draw.

"This is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world," he told World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto.
Doha's investment in sport
"We are not saying we are going to be the best club in the world, because it's really tough; you've got history behind other clubs in the (English) Premier League or Spanish or Italian leagues so we are going to try and make it.
"For us, of course, with the passion of football you know we love football, we love Paris. Paris is a great city and it's really that Paris deserved to have a big club in the world and that's why we came to Paris and bought PSG.
"In the beginning some of the people for sure, they were against us but now I believe most of them or all of them they are with us, supporting us and PSG. Honestly I am so proud today of where we are."
Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani bought a 70% share of PSG through his Qatar Sports Investments company in June 2011 and installed 38-year-old Al-Khelaifi as president.
The ex-tennis professional recruited Leonardo as general manager and the Brazilian World Cup winner wasted little time in utilizing the new wealth at his disposal to splash a reputed $57 million on Argentina midfielder Javier Pastore.

Another signal of the club's intent to make waves in Europe came with their failed pursuits of Manchester City's Argentina striker Carlos Tevez and former Manchester United and Real Madrid star David Beckham.
This is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the worldNasser Al-Khelaifi
But despite the vast sums of money being spent, Al-Khelaifi insists it is a long-term target of PSG to make the club profitable, and recruit players from the pool of young talent available in the French capital.
"That is our strategy," he said. "In five years we want to make money -- also you know we love football, we came to Paris as I said to be one of the biggest clubs in Europe.
"You know, our advantage for sure it's Paris, it's the capital, twelve million people live in and around Paris, you have got a lot of talented kids around Paris.
"You know the best French players come from Paris. If you see Thierry Henry, (Lilian) Thuram, Nicolas Anelka you know it's really worth it to look for them and look for the new (Lionel) Messi. Why not from Paris?"
But for now, the immediate target is to end the club's 18-year wait for the French league title, and the lucrative rewards it would deliver in terms of a Champions League place.
"It's going to be great in this stadium to see us playing against Barcelona or Real Madrid," Al-Khelaifi said. "This is one of our dreams."

Gay marriage support: Obama's most courageous move
By Charles Kaiser, Special to CNN
updated 6:06 AM EDT, Thu May 10, 2012
The historic Greenwich Village gay bar, Stonewall Inn, invites customers to celebrate Obama's support of gay marriage.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Charles Kaiser: Obama's stance on gay rights has effect similar to Civil Rights Act His statement instantly obliterated doubts of millions of his gay supporters, he writes
Gallup Poll: 65% of Democrats, 57% of independents support same-sex marriage
Gay supporters, he says, now feel they helped elect a transformational president
Editor's note: Charles Kaiser is the author of "The Gay Metropolis" and "1968 in America," a former reporter for The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, and a former press critic for Newsweek.
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's blockbuster announcement that he is in favor of full marriage equality is the most courageous thing he has done since he entered the White House three and a half years ago.
Coming after his successful strategy to get Congress to repeal don't ask, don't tell so that gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military and the decision of his Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in federal courts, he has now done nearly as much for gay people as Lyndon Johnson did for African-Americans with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Obama: 'Same-sex couples should be able to get married'
People like me, who were among his most passionate supporters in 2008, felt a sense of gigantic relief. The man who seemed like such a courageous candidate four years ago finally sounded like a genuinely courageous president.
Charles Kaiser
Coming so soon after his decision not to sign an executive order that would have banned discrimination against gays and lesbians among federal contractors, Wednesday's statement instantly obliterated the doubts of millions of his gay supporters.
In some ways, the momentum of his own presidency on gay rights made Wednesday's declaration inevitable. In his interview with ABC News, the president himself cited the end of don't ask, don't tell as one reason he felt compelled to speak out.

Quinn: This is amazing
The gay marriage debate
Obama: Gay marriage 'should be legal'
Romney: My view same on gay marriage
"I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that don't ask, don't tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married," the president said.
Many polls have shown healthy majorities among Americans younger than 30 in favor of marriage equality, and the president noted that even college Republicans who oppose the rest of his policies "are very clear that when it comes to same-sex equality or, you know, sexual orientation that they believe in equality."
The other two facts that probably made his decision easiest were contained in a Gallup Poll released this week, which showed that 65% of Democrats and 57% of independents agree that gay marriage should be legal.
What made the decision most difficult is the closeness of the presidential race in battleground states such as Ohio and North Carolina -- especially after North Carolina residents voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to change the state constitution so that not only marriage but all forms of domestic partnership would be banned for same-sex couples.
The effect on the president's base was immediate and electric.
Andrew Tobias, the long-time treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, said that most "LGBT donors were already willing to focus on all the great stuff that has been done and how much more we'll get done if he's re-elected. But today has ramped up the enthusiasm dramatically. I've gotten calls and five-figure credit card authorizations already from people who were just waiting for this. The enthusiasm level is very high."
Former New York City Mayor Edward Koch is a strong supporter of the president. The dean of New York Democrats also has one of the oldest and strongest records in support of gay rights of any modern American politician, having first come out in favor of the repeal of New York State's anti-sodomy law in 1962.
When informed of the president's action by CNN.com, Koch said, "Someone should write a play about this -- there's so much drama here!"
"The question will be, was he pushed, or are these his real feelings?" Koch continued. "I believe this is how he really feels. I commend him for doing this."
The former mayor pointed out that until today, the president was getting the "worst of both worlds" by continuing to say that his feelings were evolving on this subject.
"He was evolving into dust. And now he has evolved into a major figure who should be thanked by the country."
Among the president's most fervent supporters, a latent fear remains that this announcement could cost him the election. But a new feeling offers gigantic compensation: the conviction that we really did elect a genuinely transformational president.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Kaiser.

West Bank meeting canceled after Israel bars envoys
By Guy Azriel and Enas Muthaffar, CNN

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki described the barring of envoys as "a total Israeli diplomatic failure."

Foreign minister: Envoys are from countries that have no diplomatic relations with Israel
Palestinian officials are discussing alternative locations for the meeting
Jerusalem (CNN) -- Diplomatic talks in the West Bank were canceled Sunday after Israel denied entry to five envoys, the Palestinian foreign ministry said.
Palestinian officials were discussing alternative locations for the Non-Aligned Movement committee meeting, the ministry said.
The envoys banned from attending the meeting were foreign ministers from Algeria, Cuba, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said.
"We decided, given the circumstances, that those representatives of countries that have no diplomatic relationships with Israel will not be allowed to fly to Ramallah from Jordan," he said.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki described the move as "a total Israeli diplomatic failure."
"It seems that the Israeli leadership couldn't tolerate any further the accumulative successes being made by the Palestinian leadership and particularly the Palestinian diplomacy in terms of making tremendous gains and achievements (on) all fronts. That's why they have taken a decision to undermine the possibility of holding the meeting, of having a successful meeting," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki said.
Palmor, the spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said "nothing constructive" had ever come out of the group's Palestine committee.
"It would be foolish to expect anything constructive this time around from the committee given their venue and past record," he said.

Shot Pakistani schoolgirl can stand, communicate, hospital says
By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 12:39 PM EDT, Sat October 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Hospital releases first photographs of Malala since she was admitted for treatment
Malala understands where she is and wants to thank people for their support, hospital says
Malala is communicating through written notes; she can't talk because of a tracheotomy tube
She was shot after she defied the Taliban by insisting on girls' right to education
London (CNN) -- Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousufzai stood with the aid of nurses Friday for the first time since her shooting and is "communicating very freely," according to the director of the UK hospital where she is undergoing treatment.
Malala can't talk because she has a tracheotomy tube inserted to protect her airway, which was swollen after her gunshot injury, but she is writing coherent sentences, said Dave Rosser, director of University Hospitals Birmingham.
"We have no reason to believe she won't be able to talk when the tube is out, which may be in the next few days," he said.
She "is not out of the woods yet" but is doing very well, he added.
Taliban stifle media over Malala attack
The latest progress report -- more detailed than previous updates -- suggests that the girl shot after she defied the Taliban by insisting on the right of girls to go to school could make a good recovery.
Malala shooting: An eye opener?
The history of the Pakistani Taliban
Gordon Brown: Malala attack 'unspeakable'
Malala's friend: No regrets
There "is certainly physical damage to the brain" from the bullet that entered Malala's head, Rosser said, but she appears to be functioning well intellectually and has the motor control to stand, with help from nurses.
Malala: A global symbol but still just a kid
"Whether there's any subtle intellectual or memory deficits down the line, it's too early to say," he said.
Queen Elizabeth Hospital released the first photographs of Malala since she was admitted on Sunday after being flown from Pakistan. She looks bruised and wan but clearly conscious.
Rosser said Malala, who is aware of her surroundings and appears to have some memory of what happened, had agreed that the hospital could tell the public more about her medical condition.
"She is keen that people share the details. She is also keen that I thank people for their support and their interest, because she's obviously aware of the amount of interest this is generating around the world," he said.
One of the first things she asked nurses Tuesday afternoon, as she gradually regained consciousness, was what country she was in, he said.
Social media: Messages for Malala
"There is every sign that she understands why she's here," he said. "It's a very difficult position for her, because she's gone from being on her school bus, and the next thing she will be consciously aware of is being in a strange hospital in a different country. So she seems to have understood why she is no longer in Pakistan and what is happening to her."
Malala has spoken to hospital staff in Urdu and seems to understand English, he said.
Many well-wishers have sent messages of support for the teen, and the hospital has set up a bank account for donations.
In terms of Malala's care, the key concern for doctors at present is to treat signs of infection probably related to the path the bullet took through her body, Rosser said.
The bullet entered above the back of her left eye, traveled down through her jaw and into her left shoulder, lodging in the tissue above her shoulder blade, he said. Her skull and jaw were damaged by its passage.
MRI scans also show that the bullet grazed the side of her brain, he said, although in such cases, most of the damage tends to be caused by shock waves from the shot.
Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by attack
The hospital is trying to arrange for the 15-year-old to listen to her father on the phone, although she cannot speak because of the tracheotomy tube, he added.
Malala is likely to spend another couple of weeks recovering before the team of specialists considers reconstructive surgery on her skull, using either a piece of bone that was initially removed or a titanium plate, Rosser said. She may also need surgery on her jaw joint.
Malala inspires others to fight for education
"It certainly would be over-optimistic to say there won't be any further problems, but it is possible she will make a smooth recovery," he said, adding that she probably faces weeks in the hospital even if all goes well.
Doctors and nurses are trying very hard to limit communication to her medical needs rather than risk setting back her recovery by discussing the trauma of the attack, he said.
The shooting in the northwestern district of Swat last week, which left Malala battling to recover from her injuries, generated a wave of shock and anger in Pakistan and around the world.
The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the act, but they didn't appear to have anticipated the level of revulsion and condemnation that it would provoke.
Thousands of people joined in rallies across Pakistan in support of the wounded teen, and calls have grown for a strong response from the government.
Authorities are investigating the attack and say they have made a number of arrests.

Japan OKs Dreamliners to fly again
From Junko Ogura, CNN
updated 5:38 AM EDT, Fri April 26, 2013
Japan's two largest 787 operators reportedly have begun installing modified lithium ion batteries on their 787 jets. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Japanese decision follows a directive from U.S. aviation authorities
Japanese airlines, the biggest Dreamliner operators, are installing new batteries
It remains unclear exactly when they will resume flights of the Boeing planes
Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan has authorized passenger airlines to resume flights of Boeing 787 Dreamliners in the country starting Friday, authorities said.
The move follows the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's online posting Thursday of a directive outlining the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again after faulty battery systems grounded the aircraft earlier this year.
The directive goes into effect upon publication Friday in the U.S. Federal Register.
The Japanese transport ministry said All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, the world's two largest Dreamliner operators, have already begun installing modified lithium ion batteries on their 787 jets.
Dreamliner doesn't stop Boeing growth
The Dreamliner can do THAT?
But it remains unclear precisely when the two airlines will resume scheduled passenger flights of the Boeing planes.
Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by the Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question.
Last week, the FAA cleared Boeing to make fixes to the problematic battery system. Boeing said it was deploying teams to help the airlines install the redesigned system.
The Dreamliner's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East, where long-haul flights account for much of an airline's business.

Review: 'Gravity' is out of this world
By Owen Gleiberman, EW
updated 7:32 AM EDT, Mon October 7, 2013
Sandra Bullock is once again riding high with Oscar buzz, this time for her performance the new film "Gravity" (out October 4). Here she arrives for the opening ceremony of the 70th Venice Film Festival and the screening of the movie at the competition in August. It's been a charmed life and career for the actress...
In 1992, Bullock costarred with Tate Donovan in the comedy "Love Potion #9." The pair dated for a bit after filming ended. The actress portrays Agnes von Kurowsky in the 1996 drama "In Love and War."
Bullock and John Travolta have some fun in Las Vegas after being named the 1996 National Association of Theatre Owners' female and male stars of the year.
Bullock plays a single mom embarking on a new romance in the 1998 movie, "Hope Floats." Also in 1998, Bullock and Nicole Kidman star as witches in the film "Practical Magic."
Bullock and Ben Affleck star in "Forces of Nature" in 1999.
A role in "28 Days" in 2000 allows Bullock to further display her acting chops as a woman forced to enter rehab.
Michael Caine walks with Bullock in a scene from the 2000 film "Miss Congeniality."

Ryan Reynolds and Bullock shake things up in 2009's "The Proposal."
Mary Horowitz (Bullock) thinks she's in love with cable news cameraman Steve (Bradley Cooper) in the 2009 film "All About Steve." The film went on to be nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards in 2010, with Bullock winning for "worst actress" -- ironically, the same year she won the best actress Oscar for "The Blind Side."
Lily Collins, Bullock, Tim McGraw, Jae Head and Quinton Aaron say grace in a scene from "The Blind Side."
Bullock accepts the best actress award for "The Blind Side" during the 82nd Annual Academy Awards in March 2010 in Hollywood, California. Bullock stars as Linda Schell and Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell in the 2011 drama "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close."
Bullock and her son, Louis, are spotted on the streets of Manhattan in 2011.
Melissa McCarthy and Bullock bring the funny as law enforcement partners in 2013's "The Heat."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in "Gravity"
Reviewer says ebb and flow of the story is deeply organic
EW gives it a grade of "A"
(EW.com) -- In "Gravity," George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut who looks amusingly like Buzz Lightyear, and Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer who is taking her first voyage into space and is having a hard time keeping her lunch down.
They float around in the inky silent darkness, bobbing and gliding, with Earth spread out beneath them like a giant luminescent screensaver. Even when tethered to a spacecraft, the two are really out there, exhilaratingly and terrifyingly free. The miracle of the movie is the way that director Alfonso Cuarón, using special effects and 3-D with a nearly poetic simplicity and command, places the audience right up there in space along with them. Gravity is an awesome technological daydream of a movie, one that might be classified as science fiction, except that it isn't a futuristic fantasy. It's a tale of disaster and grief and survival rooted in the possibilities of space travel as they exist today. Part of what makes the film so thrilling is that it gives its characters no easy outs.
The famous 10-minute tracking shot in Cuarón's "Children of Men" was a bravura act of staging, yet watching it, you could tell that it was thought-out and choreographed. In Gravity, though, the director works in such an ingeniously flowing and sustained way that his images all but transcend the essential visual grammar of ''the shot.'' The camera glides through space, twirling and doubling back, following the characters through pod doors and into the cramped interiors of satellites and then out again, giving the entire movie the spontaneous feel of a single unbroken shot — a free-floating galactic reverie.
Sandra Bullock keeps defying 'Gravity' with her career
At the beginning we hear radio burbles of talk between the astronauts and Houston, and then, almost imperceptibly, a spacecraft drifts into view from the right side of the screen — it's a U.S. shuttle, and the astronauts are walking outside of it, attempting to repair a problem on the ship. You'll surely be reminded of "2001: A Space Odyssey," because what Cuarón echoes from Kubrick's great film — and what still seems eerily surreal in an outer-space movie — is the creeping rhythm of space, the weightlessness that places everything in a trance, turning the action into moment-to-moment semi-slow motion, a feeling of life suspended. Simply as an out-of-this-world, zero-friction ''ride,'' "Gravity" is unforgettable, yet the real essence of Cuarón's achievement is that the film's technical virtuosity and its emotional grip become one.
Clooney: Not interested in space travel
What's behind the science of 'Gravity'
Clooney's Matt Kowalski and Bullock's Ryan Stone are on a routine mission, but then there's a bulletin from Houston. A Russian satellite has exploded, causing a chain reaction. A shower of debris is about to come flying right at them, so they must abort the mission. It's too late, though: The debris hits them, full force (the 3-D places us right in the hurtling metal thick of it), tearing the ship apart. Seconds later, there is no ship. They are lost in space.
What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity'
The ebb and flow of "Gravity's" story is deeply organic — it seems to be making itself up as it goes along, and that's how it hooks us. Yet what sustains our absorption is a rather tricky synthesis between our involvement in the characters' plight and our head-scratching wonder at the matter-of-fact way that the film brings the physical realities of space to life: the sheer cosmic terror of it, the images of satellites cluttered with drifting matter, from chess rooks to tears. The actors are phenomenal. Clooney shows a haunting chivalry beneath his bluster, and Bullock is as desperate and resourceful and anxious and brave as Sigourney Weaver in the last half of Alien. When Stone wriggles, slowly, out of her space suit, we realize that we're seeing a tale of rebirth, and Bullock's acting attains a new purity. She floats through this movie yet grounds it, letting "Gravity" connect with all of us these days who feel just a little adrift. Grade: A

The vessels can carry helicopters, vehicles that can surmount debris piles
The U.S. military will bring supplies, but they will be handed out by local leaders
Washington (CNN) -- The hundreds of thousands of typhoon victims in the Philippines need help, and they need it now, the U.S. Marine Corps general in charge of the U.S. military relief effort says.
Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy told CNN he needs immediate dispatch of U.S. Navy amphibious ships that carry equipment to produce potable water and the variety of helicopters, small boats, trucks and other supplies needed in the relief effort.
"They are the Swiss army knife of the U.S. military," Kennedy said of the amphibious ships, speaking to CNN in a telephone interview from the Philippines.
The Pentagon appeared to be heeding his call. Two U.S. Navy amphibious ships are now sailing from their home base in Sasebo, Japan, to Okinawa, where they will pick up Marines and continue on to the Philippines, a U.S. military official said Tuesday evening.
Three warships that are home-ported in the Pacific are also under orders to prepare to deploy in the next 48 hours, a senior Pentagon official told CNN.
Pentagon press secretary George Little said the military is working hard to give Kennedy whatever he needs. He said 250 U.S. service members are now in the Philippines, and they have delivered 107,000 pounds of relief supplies.

Kennedy said the most crucial need right now is to provide shelter for the tens of thousands of displaced people, as well as food, water and sanitation. The situation is so dire there may not even be enough time or capability to fly in portable toilets, and human waste might have to be burned in place, he said.
While U.S. Marines are on the ground providing aid and more U.S. military help has been dispatched, Kennedy said more help is urgently needed.
"The rest of the world needs to get mobilized, the rest of the donor community," he told NBC News. "A week from now will be too late. "
"We can't wait," said Martin Romualdez, a Philippines congressman. "People have gone three days without any clean water, food and medication," he told CNN's "Piers Morgan Live." "People are getting desperate."
Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on Friday as one of the most powerful storms recorded.
By Tuesday, officials had counted 1,774 deaths from the storm. Authorities had said Haiyan may have taken as many as 10,000 lives, but Philippines President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that the death toll would more likely be about 2,000 or 2,500 people.
Projected death toll falls, but tensions rise amid aid bottlenecks
With wind gusts well above 200 mph and a massive storm surge, the storm displaced at least 800,000 people, the United Nations said Tuesday.
More than 2 million people need food aid, the Philippine government said.
Compounding relief efforts Tuesday was a new tropical low, Zoraida, which has dumped 4 inches of rain in some of the hard-hit areas. That makes the amphibious ships Kennedy has asked for even more vital.
The amphibious ships have tracked "assault amphibious vehicles" that can carry supplies and move over and through piles of debris to distribution points where aid is needed most.
Typhoon Haiyan: 'The one building that survived the storm'
The Pentagon has dispatched the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which was visiting Hong Kong, to the disaster area. Two cruisers, three destroyers and a supply ship are joining the carrier for the mission, Little said.
"The George Washington can produce more than 400,000 gallons of fresh water per day. As you know, and as a reminder, a U.S. Navy carrier, the USS Lincoln, supported tsunami relief operations in 2004 in the Pacific, providing much needed capabilities to operations ashore," Little said.
The U.S. military relief effort will take supplies to distribution points, but those supplies will be then handed out by Philippines forces, Kennedy said. Local forces are in the best position to know community leaders and make sure those in the most need are getting the help, he added.
As of Tuesday night in the Philippines, lights and radars were being assembled at the airport in Tacloban, at the heart of the disaster zone, and the facility was expected to be running full day and nighttime operations within 24 hours, he said.

We can prevent fatal ODs like Hoffman's
By Ethan Nadelmann and Tony Newman
updated 8:31 PM EST, Tue February 4, 2014
Philip Seymour Hoffman appears in 2013's "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire." Hoffman played the role of Plutarch, the head game maker in the film. He was expected to also appear in the following films of the very successful franchise. He was found dead in his Manhattan apartment Sunday of an apparent drug overdose. Click through for more highlights from his career:

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Writers: Actor Hoffman's death one of 105 people who die each day from overdose in U.S.
They say people will use heroin or opiates no matter what, so challenge is to help people Writers: Make treatment easy, pass laws that let people call 911 without fear of arrest They say we need to educate ourselves about treatments that might sound radical but work
Editor's note: Ethan Nadelmann is the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, the leading organization in the United States promoting alternatives to the war on drugs. Tony Newman is the director of media relations at the Drug Policy Alliance. (CNN) -- People are mourning the tragic overdose death of Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was found Sunday morning alone in his New York apartment with a needle in his arm and empty bags of heroin.
When a beloved celebrity such as Hoffman dies of an overdose, it's front page news. But his death serves as a reminder that 105 people are dying in the United States every day from an overdose involving heroin or pharmaceutical opioids. With more than 30,000 deaths annually, accidental overdose has overtaken car accidents as our country's leading cause of accidental death for people 25 to 64.

Tony Newman
The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the drug war did nothing to prevent a dramatic increase in overdose fatalities; indeed, those very policies likely increased the number of people who die from an overdose.
Some people are going to use heroin, or play around with pharmaceutical opiates, no matter what we say and no matter what the government does. The real challenge is to do what we can to help people stay alive.
Here are seven steps that can help:
1. Make treatment available to those who want and need it: It is tragic that so many people who need treatment can't get it. It is outrageous that we taxpayers spend, on average, $30,000 a year to incarcerate someone with a drug problem, but we skimp on treatment programs that are less expensive and more effective in reducing illegal drug use and other crime. Too many people who want treatment are told there are no open slots and turned away.
Philip Seymour Hoffman's 'everyman' brilliance
2. Offer methadone and buprenorphine to those with opioid addiction: Methadone and buprenorphine have been the gold-standard treatment for opioid addiction for decades. These replacement therapies can allow people to live normal lives without the highs and lows of illegal heroin and other opioids.
We need to remove the obstacles to making these life-saving medications more readily available and end the stigma that discourages people from seeking out the most effective treatment.
3. Honest drug education: We urge young people to stay clear of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, but the reality is many will experiment with using substances no matter what. We must teach them the risks and consequences of drug use.
Police: Heroin found in Hoffman's home
Remembering Philip Seymour Hoffman
Philip Seymour Hoffman's memorable scenes
Most overdose deaths are a result of mixing opioids and alcohol but most people don't know that. Anyone who receives a prescription for a pain medication, knows a person misusing heroin or other opioids or who cares about keeping people alive, needs to know the incredible risks of mixing with alcohol.
4. Good Samaritan laws for 911 callers: Most people who overdose don't die. But the chance of surviving an overdose, like that of surviving a heart attack, depends greatly on how fast one receives medical assistance. Unfortunately people are afraid to call 911 because they don't know if the police who respond will focus on arresting those present rather than saving someone's life.
Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have passed "911 Good Samaritan" laws that encourage people to call for help without fear of arrest. Although it appears Hoffman was alone when he overdosed, thousands of others are not. People need to call for help. It should never be a crime to call 911 to help save a life.

Naloxone: Could it have saved Hoffman?
5. Make naloxone, the antidote to an overdose, more available: Naloxone is a safe, generic, inexpensive, nonnarcotic drug that works quickly and is easy to administer. It has saved hundreds of thousands of lives but could be saving many more.
Many states are just starting to take some great steps to get naloxone in the hands of more people, including law enforcement and emergency responders. Anyone who uses opioids for any reason at all should have naloxone readily available, and friends and family who know how to administer it.
There's no really good reason, moreover, why this antidote should only be available by prescription. If we really want to save lives, pharmacists should be allowed to sell it to whoever needs it.
6. Supervised injection facilities: Dozens of cities around the world have supervised injection facilities where people can inject their drugs in a clean, safe place with medical professionals on hand.
These facilities eliminate overdose fatalities, reduce dangerous drug consumption practices as well as HIV and hepatitis C, minimize the public nuisance of people using drugs in public places and more than pay for themselves by reducing the need for criminal justice and emergency medical services. It has been particularly successful in Canada.
The scientific consensus demonstrating the benefits of these facilities has yet to result in one such facility being opened anywhere in the United States. It's time already.
7. Heroin-assisted treatment: Conventional treatments do not work for many people addicted to opioids and want to stop taking them. That's why more than a half dozen countries in Europe and Canada have developed a second-line option: heroin-assisted treatment.
With this treatment, pharmacological heroin is administered under strict controls in a clinical setting to those who have failed to succeed with other treatment options. Virtually every published evaluation of HAT has shown extremely positive outcomes: major reductions in illicit drug use, crime, disease and overdose; and improvements in health, well-being, social reintegration and treatment retention.
No one can know for sure whether Philip Seymour Hoffman would still be alive if these seven steps had been implemented, but we can be certain that far fewer Americans would die accidentally from an overdose if they were.
While our country continues to mourn his death, we need to educate ourselves about the best policies and practices to reduce these tragic losses. Some of these ideas may make us uncomfortable, but we need to embrace them as soon as possible. Our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters are counting on it.
The cost of a slow learning curve is simply too great.
