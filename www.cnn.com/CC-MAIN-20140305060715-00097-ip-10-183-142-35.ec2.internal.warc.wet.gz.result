Cash-strapped travelers redeem airmiles to save moneyStory Highlights This year there is expected to be the largest ever increase in air mile redemption Some business travelers are cashing in miles to save money Others feel they can no longer get the seats they want for free But as oil prices drop, airlines are reinstating offers and benefits for frequent flyersNext Article in Travel » By Emma Clarke For CNN LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the global recession bites, frequent flyers are cashing in more airmiles and loyalty points to subsidize routine travel needs. For some business travelers, the appeal of frequent-flier awards is fading. American Airlines has seen a 10-15 percent increase in redemption over 2007 on AAdvantage, its frequent flier program. InterContinental Hotels Group, that owns Intercontinental, Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, is reporting "record levels" of redemptions from their Priority Club members around the world. Frequent-flier guru and publisher of InsideFlyer magazine, Randy Petersen, expects to see the largest ever increase in reward redemption this year. In an average year, he says, redemption is narrowed to popular and select destinations. But rather than save up points for a family holiday in Hawaii or a weekend break in Paris, frequent flyers are surrendering their hard-earned points on routine business trips and family emergencies. "They may not be getting great value," he says, "but they think it is better to use the miles and save their money." Eighteen months ago, IHG customers accumulated loyalty points for the occasional splurge in a hotel. Now they are spending them on everyday goods such as fuel, wine, or Christmas shopping. As IHG chief executive, Andy Cosslett told CNN in October, "suddenly loyalty points mean a lot. Now they're a currency." Improvements in booking tools have also encouraged travelers to spend miles, says Petersen. Frequent flyer programs now add partner airlines' award seats into their online booking process. And new online facilities such as calendars also give customers a clearer view of seat availability. Another spur for the run on airmiles has been a growing disenchantment among business travelers with award programs. These days there are too many passengers chasing too few seats, frequent flyers complain. Airlines are also raising mileage standards and shortening expiration periods, making it more difficult for them to get the seats they want for free. In early September, Continental Airlines decided to change rules for its OnePass program which means members now earn the actual miles flown rather than a minimum of 500 miles per flight. A barrage of complaints forced a partial retraction which means elite members are exempt from the change. American Airlines' AAdvantage program has imposed a $50 charge to upgrade a one-way domestic flight from economy, and a $350 charge for some international flights.

Business Traveller in November: Facing the downturn
Global tourism feels the squeeze
Virgin Atlantic will reduce the number of miles earned by some of its Flying Club passengers from 1 December. Upper Class passengers traveling on discounted or non-flexible tickets will earn 150 per cent of the base flown miles, down from 200 percent. High flyers, such as forum user, RichardInSF, posting on FlyerTalk, an online forum for frequent travelers, says it is time to burn rather than earn points. "US carriers are devaluing frequent flyer miles so much that it's time to burn and then not bother going forward," he says. But these changes need not spell trouble for business travelers, says Petersen. In fact, they help preserve premium awards for the most active members and frequent flyers of programs. As he explains, airlines continue to add partners to their programs making it easier to earn miles on anything from hotels to groceries. Award level increases are a way to keep up with over inflation, or more miles being earned, he says. "Without increases like these, airlines would endanger themselves to having anyone walking down the street earning miles in first class." That said, he adds, there have been some "disappointments" in recent months, such as the decision by airlines to attach a fuel surcharge on frequent flyer redemptions. "This has clearly exposed that airlines are treating these programs as an extension of their airline business, and not programs to reward their best customers," he says. But as the oil price drops, allowing airlines once again to make money flying people around the world, they are reinstating benefits for frequent flyers and introducing attractive short-term promotions to fill seats. Fuel surcharges have receded across most airlines' programs. US Airways has reinstated bonus miles and 500-minimum-miles benefits for customers with Preferred membership in its Dividend Miles program. British Airways is offering Executive Club members 50 percent off all return standard redemption bookings until midnight GMT on 28 November. Qantas released 1.5 million FrequentFlyer seats on for travel between December 1 and February 29. As the benefits return, Peterson expects travelers' fixation with earning and spending miles to continue unabated. "While pundits cry out that frequent flyer miles have lost their appeal, membership will grow another 8 to 11 percent this year," he says. "There are absolutely no signs that these programs are failing." Getting the most from your points Plan ahead - book very early or last minute to get the best deals Do your research - the Internet can bring you a "treasure trove of information," says Petersen. Be flexible - shop around for flights that require fewer miles to redeem. Instead of flying Friday, Saturday or Sunday, try to book midweek. And instead of Orlando, one of the top award destinations, look at Miami, or Tampa, or cities around it. Know the program - pay attention to when your miles expire and keep the account active. You could take a survey on the Internet and earn enough miles to keep your miles active.

My 'green limo' is saving the world John Leguizamo saves the worldSTORY HIGHLIGHTSJohn Leguizamo thinks urban biking is a winner all-aroundIt cuts carbon emissions, saves time, improves healthNew York added 200 miles of bike lanes, saw 45 percent increase in bike commutingAdded benefit: "You learn to curse in every language"

New York City
New York (CNN) -- When writer-actor John Leguizamo shows up to do a show in New York, fans outside the theater are surprised to see him ride up on a bicycle. "People go, 'Hey, John, I thought you'd be in a limo.' "This is my limo, my green limo. I'm saving the planet for your kids and your grandkids," says the performer, who has starred in award-winning one-man shows on Broadway and appeared in dozens of films and TV shows. Biking gets you places faster, reduces your carbon footprint, lowers noise, makes you fit and lowers your stress level -- unless you get impaled on the door of a suddenly opened cab or cut off by a guy from New Jersey. Leguizamo thinks urban biking is a form of transportation that dramatically improves the environment and riders' physical and mental health. New York City's government shares Leguizamo's enthusiasm about biking, having added 200 miles of bike lanes in the past three years. The city says it has seen a 45 percent increase in commuting by bike. Leguizamo took CNN on a tour of his favorite biking spots and shared his thoughts about the best way to get anywhere fast in the nation's biggest city: CNN: How long have you been biking? Leguizamo: I started biking when I was 7 years old, and I've been biking in Manhattan ever since I got that first bike. I grew up in Queens. Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Astoria, Corona, I started going to high school in Manhattan when I was 15, and I moved to Manhattan when I started going to NYU. In high school, on the weekends I would bike to Central Park over the 59th Street bridge. Very Paul Simon and Garfunkel. At NYU, my bike was stolen. The pole I locked it to was a fake pole, and I came back and the pole was gone. I thought at first that I had chained my bike on a different block, but then I realized there was a hole in the concrete. CNN: Why should people bike? Leguizamo: There are a lot of great reasons. First of all, we all want to lower our carbon footprint, and this is one of the great ways, reduce pollution, reduce traffic, reduce noise pollution, improve your heart with reduced stress. When you're out there, it makes you friendlier. You get a little bike rage, but that's only when people cross you. I usually get to places with a lot of great energy and a lot more relaxed. I just saw this old good lady, she must have been in her late 60s, and she had like an adult tricycle, and she had her guitar in the back and a loud horn, and she was smiling and biking down Fifth Avenue. It was great. And for a lot of people who can't run, biking is a lot less stress on your knees. CNN: What are the biggest risks of biking in New York City? Leguizamo: Kamikaze cabs, buses, tourists, people from New Jersey. A Jersey plate will always try to cut you off for sure. And you know Miami and Connecticut plates are always going to go way slow, but that's not as dangerous. And then the crazy pedestrian that comes out between two big vans that block the view, that jump out. There's more danger for them than for you, but you don't want to hurt nobody, either. Opening the door on the street side, my God, that's the most dangerous: passengers opening up the street door instead of the curb door. That should be taught in school. That should be part of your SATs. It's amazing too the amount of cursing you hear from drivers, bikers, cabbies. You learn to curse in every language. CNN: How can you get started biking? Leguizamo: Start slowly in parks until you get maximum skill, and then start taking less busy streets. Just go slow. Don't try to race. If you go slow, you will learn all the urban tactics that you need for biking in Manhattan. You will learn that people are going to do the craziest things. People are going to cut you off. Expect the unexpected at every second. You gotta look for potholes, doors swinging, pedestrians. It's a massive amount of focus.--John Leguizamo
You gotta look for potholes, doors swinging, pedestrians. It's a massive amount of focus. But the fact that you survive and you're home, you feel incredible. And it's so great. It relieves so much stress. I always lose weight. It keeps my cardio up, too. Every time I get tested, they say, "You have the heart of a 20-year old." They're not talking about my liver. CNN: What about the equipment you need? Leguizamo: Get a recycled bicycle, recycle a bicycle, you know, something old and beat up. If you can't and you're too high-maintenance, get something really fancy and wreck it. Get sandpaper and a screwdriver, and you got to mess it up. Because if it looks shiny and nice, no matter what massive lock you have, somebody's going to cut it. If you recycle a bicycle, you get the cheapest lock, and you don't have to carry that massive chain that will weigh you down. You got to have some rain fenders, some rain guards, or then you can only bike and be messy. You can't bike in your suit as much if it rains. And if you're going to ride at night, you've got to have lights, either on your bike or your helmet. I like it on the helmet because people can really see you. And get a front light and a back light. And you need something for the hem of your pants. Either tuck them in your sock or get one of those little pant grips. When I don't pay attention, my jeans have gotten caught many times on the chain. Wear elbow pads, wrist guards, a Kevlar vest. It's Manhattan. Although we're not the murder capital any more. Is it Philadelphia? Or Arkansas? CNN: What about the tourists who come to New York? Should they try biking at all? Leguizamo: No, not in Manhattan. You have to know what you're doing. You can bike on the West Side Highway. That's good for kids and tourists. In Manhattan, you need to know the terrain. You gotta be alert and know what those signs of danger are. If you're a tourist, you're going to be looking at the Empire State Building. "Look at how big and beautiful all those Art Deco buildings are." All of a sudden: Pow. Crash.

Karzai to Petraeus: Apologies are not enough By the CNN Wire Staff Afghan President Hamid Karzai says condemning civilian deaths does not ease his citizen's pain, his office says. STORY HIGHLIGHTSKarzai and Petraeus have a private talk Sunday on civilian deathsPetraeus repeats his apology for the death of 9 Afghan boys Obama has already called it a "tragic accident" Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Apologies are not sufficient when it comes to civilian casualties, Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the NATO commander Sunday, days after a NATO airstrike killed nine Afghan boys. Karzai told Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, that incidents of civilian casualties during coalition military operations are the main reason for tensions in the U.S.-Afghan relationship and he demanded there be no more, according to a statement from Karzai's office. The comments came in a private conversation between the two men Sunday, according to an official with NATO's International Security Assistance Force who asked not to be named. Petraeus made a public apology Wednesday for the deaths, which happened the day before in the province of Kunar, along Afghanistan's eastern border. U.S. President Barack Obama also expressed regret for the deaths, calling it a "tragic accident." A White House statement said Obama and Karzai agreed that such incidents undermine shared U.S. and Afghan efforts in fighting terrorism. 2010: Inquiry into civilian deaths

Civilian Casualties
The incident happened after insurgents in mountains above a coalition base launched a rocket attack that wounded a U.S. civilian, according to U.S. Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez. Troops returned fire and insurgents later shot another rocket at the troops. Two attack helicopters flew to the location where they were told the rockets originated, identified who they thought were insurgents and killed nine people. Rodriguez said. Later, they found that the slain people were boys cutting wood. Rodriguez called the incident "a terrible mistake" and promised disciplinary action if warranted. The statement from Karzai's office said Petraeus repeated his apology Sunday and promised "it will not happen again." Karzai said the Afghan people are suffering as a result of civilian casualties and that apologizing and condemning these actions cannot ease their pain, according to his office. "The trust of Afghanistan's government and people definitively depend on this issue," Karzai told Petraeus. Recurrence of such incidents, he said, is "unacceptable." The NATO force official said Sunday, "We take all civilian casualties very seriously. In light of the recent event that tragically killed nine children, commanders have been given the direction to review our tactical directive that is intended to reduce civilian casualties to the absolute minimum. We will continue to reinforce the need to protect the lives of innocent Afghans as we pursue a ruthless enemy." Rodriguez said last week such incidents are "rare" when considering all the operations the coalition undertakes. He said a lot of time is spent training soldiers on how to engage the right targets and that directives are constantly reviewed. "We have done much better preventing civilian casualties," he said. "But we acknowledge we have to do better." Rodriguez said the military understands families' grief over such deaths, and he said soldiers "feel worse than they can express" when they "do something terrible like mistakenly killing young boys." "They have to live with that for the rest of their lives," he said. Rodriguez also urged Afghans to help their security forces battle insurgents. Karzai previously noted the Tuesday incident occurred less than 10 days after another one "that left many civilians dead in the same province." On February 20, Kunar Governor Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said 64 civilians had died in a joint operation by the NATO force and Afghan security forces over several days. The dead included 20 women and 15 children, he said. Petraeus recently directed military commanders in Afghanistan to review changes meant to minimize civilian casualties. He has ordered commanders to brief helicopter attack crews again on the changes, he said. CNN's Barbara Starr and Matiullah Mati contributed to this report

Did registry know man accused in hepatitis C outbreak was earlier fired?
From Elizabeth Cohen, Senior Medical Correspondent
updated 12:46 PM EDT, Sat July 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Arizona did not complete investigation of David Kwiatkowski
NEW: Public defender declines to comment
Kwiatkowski worked in at least eight states as a lab technician
He also worked at a New Hampshire hospital where 30 patients got hepatitis C
(CNN) -- A spokesman for a national registry of radiologic technologists declined Friday to say whether the group was aware of a 2010 incident in which David Kwiatkowski allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and was fired from an Arizona hospital.
After being fired from the Phoenix hospital, Kwiatkowski went on to work at four more hospitals in four other states.
He was arrested this month in New Hampshire in connection with stealing drugs from a hospital, and it's believed he infected 30 people in that state with hepatitis C through infected syringes.
Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position.
The registry's website says Kwiatkowski's certification was "summarily suspended" as of July 2012.
Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN.
Hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire strikes fear in 7 other states
"I looked in the toilet and spotted a 5 cc syringe and a needle floating in the water," the employee said in a statement submitted to the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency. "The label was a blue fentanyl label... He then said 'Shit ... I am going to jail.'"
Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic frequently used in hospitals. Kwiatkowski flushed the syringe and needle down the toilet, according to the employee.
Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. He then relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist.
"I don't have the resources nor money to fight the accusations," Kwiatkowski wrote at the time.
A few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania, and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before working in New Hampshire.
The agency that placed Kwiatkowski in the Arizona job reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency, Springboard, Inc.
A spokesman for the national registry said they're investigating the allegations against Kwiatkowski. "Because we have strict confidentiality policies, the status of an ongoing investigation is not released," the registry said in a statement.
Christopher Cook, a spokesman for the registry, declined to comment further.
The director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state.
"We had no jurisdiction," said Aubrey Godwin. "If drugs or alcohol were involved, we would want to get blood tests done, but he was out of state, so it was sort of hard to implement."
An expert in so-called "drug diversion" said it's not uncommon for healthcare professionals to leave a state when they're being investigated for drug use.
"They just move on to the next job," said John Burke, president of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators. "This is a much bigger problem than most people realize."
Godwin, the director of the Arizona licensing board, said he's not sure if his group reported the 2010 incident to the national registry.
"It's not clear. I can't say. It would have been just a phone call, and I don't remember a phone call, but I'm not sure on that one," he told CNN.
In the Exeter case, Kwiatkowski has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product, namely a hospital syringe, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. He is suspected of stealing fentanyl, the affidavit said.
Hepatitis C is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses. It is typically asymptomatic, going undetected until liver damage shows up, according to the Mayo Clinic.
New Hampshire's health department is asking everyone who was a patient in Exeter's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between April 1, 2011, and May 25 of this year be tested.
Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his "routine duties to transport patients," an Exeter Hospital statement said. But it added he "was not involved with procedures or patient care."
Exeter, in a statement, said it conducted a background check and took other steps before hiring Kwiatkowski full time.
U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas said his office interviewed employees at Exeter who said they had seen Kwiatkowski acting strangely, one time sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes.
"One of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home," Kacavas said. "He provided a plausible explanation for his condition, which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck."
According to state, county and hospital officials, he worked as a radiology technician and medical technician in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations:
-- Oakwood Annapolis Hospital in Wayne, Michigan, January to September 2007;
-- Saint Francis Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, November 2007 to February 2008;
-- UPMC Presbyterian, Pittsburgh, March 2008 to May 2008;
-- Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, May 2008 to November 2008;
-- Southern Maryland Hospital, Clinton, Maryland, December 2008 to February 2009;
-- Maryvale Hospital, Phoenix, March to June 2009;
-- Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, July 2009 to January 2010;
-- Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore, January 2010 to March 2010;
-- Arizona Heart Hospital, Phoenix, March 2010 to April 2010;
-- Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, April 2010;
-- Hays Medical Center, Hays, Kansas, May 2010 to September 2010;
-- Houston Medical Center, Warner Robins, Georgia, October 2010 to March 2011.
-- Exeter Hospital, Exeter, New Hampshire, April 2011 to July 2012.
Institutions say they are calling former patients and offering free testing, and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is helping state health officers and hospitals tackle the problem.
Kwiatkowski was arrested earlier this month after police found him in a Massachusetts hotel room "in an intoxicated state" and took him to a hospital, the affidavit states. He is now being held in the Strafford County, New Hampshire, jail. He could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted.
Kwiatkowski appeared in New Hampshire federal court Tuesday and waived his right to a detention hearing. Kacavas said it is possible more charges could be filed.
Bjorn Lange, a public defender representing Kwiatkowski, told CNN Friday he would have no comment.

Journalist who embarrassed Greeks with Swiss bank accounts is acquitted
From Diana Magnay, CNN
updated 8:20 PM EDT, Thu November 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "People had been blackmailed ... doesn't this need to stop?" Vaxevanis says
Kostas Vaxevanis has been acquitted of violating Greece's data protection law
His magazine published a list of names of about 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts
Authorities face questions over why there has been no probe of possible tax evasion Athens, Greece (CNN) -- A Greek investigative journalist was acquitted of criminal charges Thursday after he published the names of about 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts, a move that embarrassed the country's political and business elite.
Kostas Vaxevanis, the editor of the magazine Hot Doc, was charged with violating Greece's data protection law. He was arrested on Sunday, a day after his magazine published the list, and acquitted Thursday night, defense attorney Harris Ikonomopoulos said.
The names were known as the "Lagarde list," because they were given by Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, to her Greek counterpart in August 2010. Lagarde is now the International Monetary Fund chief. Vaxevanis defended his decision to publish on the grounds that the data came from a reliable source and that it was in the public interest for it to be released.
"In the last two years various names had been thrown about," he told reporters outside the courthouse Thursday. "People had been blackmailed. Fake lists were circulated. The political system is being destabilized. There was a fake list that had half the Greek lawmakers' names on it. Doesn't this need to stop?"
While it is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account, and there is no evidence that anyone broke the law, suspicions are high in Greece that some of those named in the list may have opened the accounts to avoid paying taxes to the Greek state.
Greek media questioned whether the failure to investigate those named for possible tax evasion might have been the result of an attempt by politicians to protect a wealthy elite. A parliamentary committee is looking into why no investigation was carried out either under former Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou or his successor, Evangelos Venizelos.
The ministers said the data had been handed over to the fraud office, but officials there said they had never been formally instructed to investigate who on the list was or wasn't dodging taxes. French and German authorities, who were given similar lists, did pursue some of those named for alleged tax evasion.
Greek authorities now face public suspicion that they tried to shoot the messenger by sending Vaxevanis immediately to court, while for two years they effectively sat on the list and took no action. Ikonomopoulos said his client should have been praised for his courage in bringing the list to light rather than being taken to court.
"The Greek government needs to investigate this list and any other lists they may have their hands on," Ikonomopoulos told CNN.
"But first and foremost, the Greek government needs to reinstate effective governance, checks and balances and accountability and transparency mechanisms, in order for whatever is done to be productive," he said. "We can't afford any more injustice, we can't afford any more mismanagement and we can certainly not afford lies that are smearing public life and are delegitimizing the public personnel in total at a time we need to work together."
CNN's Florence Davey-Attlee contributed to this report.

Pretzel bag leads feds to child porn suspect in California
By Mike M. Ahlers, CNN
updated 8:27 PM EDT, Thu May 16, 2013
Federal authorities on Thursday, May 16, said they had arrested David John Stevens, 58, of Salinas, and believe him to be the man in four videos allegedly depicted sexual assaults on a young girl.
Thanks to a tip from the public, the "John Doe" suspected child molester was arrested on Tuesday, May 15, less than 24 hours after photos of the suspect were released. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released edited stills from a child pornography video and appealed to the public for help.
Danish National Police launched the investigation May 3 after discovering four videos on the Internet the previous day.
Three factors led Danish investigators to believe the crime occurred in the United States: the background, some products visible in the video, and the man's appearance.
Investigators say that a pretzel bag in the background helped narrow down the man's location. The Frito-Lay Rold Gold pretzels were in packaging only distributed in the United States. The case took on added urgency because officials believed the victim -- a girl age 7 to 9 -- was likely still being abused.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A tip leads federal authorities to arrest a California man suspected of child pornography
The girl in several videos is safe, but other possible victims are being sought
Danish officials found the videos online earlier this month and alerted U.S. authorities
A pretzel bag available only in the U.S. and Canada narrowed the search
Washington (CNN) -- In a fast-moving child abuse investigation that started two weeks ago in Denmark, U.S. officials this week arrested a suspect in northern California and are now trying to determine whether there are additional child victims.
Federal authorities Thursday said they had arrested David John Stevens, 58, of Salinas, and believe him to be the man in four videos allegedly depicting sexual assaults on a young girl.
The girl, officials said, has been identified and protected. But based on interviews with witnesses, authorities "believe there may be additional unidentified child victims," the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said.
It could not be determined Thursday whether Stevens had an attorney.
The investigation was unusually quick, beginning May 4 when Danish National Police discovered four videos that had been posted on the Internet the previous day. Three videos were date-stamped April 14, and the fourth was dated April 27. Investigators were concerned that given the timeliness of the videos, the abuse might be ongoing.
Danish authorities, believing that the videos were shot in the U.S., shared them with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit.
ICE investigators observed a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos. By studying Frito-Lay websites, they learned that Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the United States and Canada. ICE investigators believe the bag is exclusively distributed in the United States.
On Tuesday afternoon, ICE investigators asked the public for help and released several photos culled from the video. On Wednesday, someone called the tip line, leading to Stevens' arrest that evening, ICE said. Investigators seized evidence related to the case at the suspect's Salinas home, ICE said.
The agency is asking anyone with further information regarding Stevens to call ICE's tip line at 866-347-2423 or the Salinas Police Department's Investigations Division at 831-758-7226. The public may also contact the Salinas Police Department anonymously by calling 831-775-4222 or by contacting the We-Tip line at 800-78-CRIME.
"When the (Homeland Security Investigations) special agents investigating this case ran out of leads, we turned to the media and the general public for help," ICE Director John Morton said in a statement. "A day later, a tip from the public has led to the capture of an alleged predator and more importantly, the rescue of a child. I applaud our investigators, the media and the brave individual who provided critical information. Without the public's help we would not have solved this case."

Bill Hader on life after 'SNL'
By Mike Ayers, Special to CNN
updated 4:12 PM EDT, Thu July 25, 2013
Bill Hader is nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series Emmy for "Saturday Night Live."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bill Hader has a busy summer after his exit from "Saturday Night Live"
He'll star in "The To Do List" and "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"
The star says he's come a long way from his days editing "Iron Chef: America"
He hopes he'll soon direct a movie
(CNN) -- Comedian/actor Bill Hader has departed "Saturday Night Live" after eight seasons, but it's not like he's strapped for work.
This Friday, Hader will be seen prominently in the raunchy summer comedy "The To Do List" opposite Aubrey Plaza, Rachel Bilson, Donald Glover and Scott Porter. The film comes from Hader's wife, writer/director Maggie Carey, so he's particularly close to this project.
Later this summer, he'll reprise his role as the voice of Flint Lockwood in "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."
CNN spoke with Hader about his Emmy nomination, why he's moving back to California and his take on humor's long shelf life.
CNN: "The To Do List" is set in the early '90s, an era that a lot of people these days feel nostalgic about. What's funny to you about this time period?
Bill Hader: I don't really know what's funny about it. Everything is so tech now; everyone is so connected that way. It's interesting in this movie that I have to tell Aubrey Plaza's character something, and I have to go to her house. Which you would never do now. The whole movie would be done in two seconds now. It was the last time when things were in that '50s vein. Now, if I leave my cell phone at the house, I assume my house is on fire.
CNN: You play a slacker pool manager, but you yourself are not a slacker. Did you ever go through a stoner phase?
Hader: No, I never did. I actually don't smoke pot that much. I've never been a big pot smoker. And when I do smoke pot, friends always say, "I feel like I'm smoking pot with my dad." I was always the designated driver; I never drank that much. Not out of some moral thing. It's that I wasn't that interested in that. I was more of the drinking coffee at the coffee shop crowd.
Oddly enough, I wasn't a very good student. I didn't apply myself that well. I wasn't good at doing things I wasn't interested in. I used to think I was just slow, and a nice teacher said, "oh, you're actually really smart, you don't give a s*** about anything."
CNN: Along with playing the lead, you're also billed as a producer. Are you looking to do more behind-the-scenes work in the future, like, say, Will Ferrell does?
Hader: Yeah. I'd love to direct a movie. That's initially what I wanted to do. Acting was never something on my radar. I just did it as a fun extension of wanting to direct. I thought I should act to know what actors go through. I realized the acting thing really took. (Laughs.)
CNN: Last week, the Emmy nominations came out, and it was the first time a male "Saturday Night Live" cast member has been nominated twice for "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series." Have you been in a "comedy sweet spot" the last few years, the way a basketball player might get hot shooting three pointers?
Hader: I don't know if it's that or ... I don't know. I try not to think about it too much, or I'll go crazy. I used to always think that there was a shelf life on being funny. But I work with ("South Park" creators) Matt (Stone) and Trey (Parker), and their show is in its 16th season, and every season is funnier. They figure out new things to do.
Martin Short, when he comes by ("Saturday Night Live"), he's still the funniest human being on the planet. Fred Willard still makes me laugh. All these people I liked growing up are still making me laugh. I try not to think about it too much in terms of myself.
CNN: That's probably good. You need to get some sleep.
Hader: It's not very healthy to think about yourself on those terms. You'll go nuts. Oddly enough, I have really bad stage fright -- getting up in front of people. And I made a living going on live television.
CNN: Would you be paranoid about the reactions after, or was it more of a "once it's done, it's done"?
Hader: I'd be done with it. I've done sketches on the show -- I don't think I've ever finished anything and thought, "oh, that was great." I'm always like "uhhhh ... Why didn't I do this?" It's like a trap that I try to wiggle out of on-air. A mental trap.
I prepare stuff so compulsively. I'm constantly rereading. I'm constantly rereading the sketch, going over it. So I know it so well, and if the slightest thing doesn't get a laugh, it used to throw me. Toward my last couple seasons on the show, I'd purposely do something I've never done before. Not so much say things but give a different look or pause differently. Something that my brain would say "oh, you screwed up," and suddenly I would relax.
Every Saturday morning, I'd wake up, and I'd immediately start pacing. I could not make my body stop moving. I thought if I stopped moving, it would sink in that I have to go on live television tonight.
CNN: It seems like leaving "Saturday Night Live" might be good for your health.
Hader: Yeah, good for my mental health. No, I say all this, but in the moment, when it's happening, it's actually fun. Especially if people are laughing.
CNN: What was the conversation with Lorne Michaels like? How does someone resign from this iconic show?
Hader: I went into his office in February, and I think he knew that I was going to move to California. That's what it was really about. We got a family, and I want a backyard. That's how it started.
It was really just excruciating small talk and then getting into the issue of the leaving. Generally, Lorne said, "I totally get it, you have a family. I would love it if you stayed, but I get it." Around May, I said I wanted to announce it, and that's how it went.
It definitely was hard. People will say that they cried. I thought I was going to pass out. When it was addressed and happened, it felt like a weight had been put on my shoulder or a weight had been lifted. All I know is that the room started tilting a bit. It was a physical reaction to saying the words "I'm leaving." It was crazy. I didn't have a career. I worked as an editor on "Iron Chef: America" before "SNL." It's the reason people know me.
CNN: That's quite a jump, from "Iron Chef: America" to "SNL."
Hader: It was scary. For four years, I was waiting for them to figure out they made a giant mistake. I still can't really believe it.
CNN: Stefon has certainly entered the hall of fame of "SNL" characters. Was he your favorite?
Hader: He was one of my favorites. Herb Welch, the reporter who was a real ****head, I loved playing him. What I liked about doing Stefon is that you could play it kind of subtle. It was right at the camera.
