Behind the scenes at the Academy AwardsStory Highlights When you're inside the theater, the whole show seems to work, and you feel part of it Stagehands guide the changing of the sets during the commercial breaks Seeing five Best Actors presenting Oscars on the same stage was pretty amazing The Oscars can still astonish -- they still know how to put on the big musical number Next Article in Entertainment » Read VIDEO PHOTOS By Jay Kernis Managing Editor, CNN/US	In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Jay Kernis reports on what it was like inside the Kodak Theatre at the Academy Awards. Hugh Jackman, the host of the 81st Academy Awards, speaks to the audience at the Kodak Theatre on Sunday.more photos » LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When you're at home, you can sit back and be critical. When you're inside the theater, the whole show seems to work, especially the big production numbers. Maybe it was a particularly well-produced show this year, but when you're in the audience, you feel part of it -- even way up in the second mezzanine. I've been at the Oscars to cover them, but this is the first time I've ever been inside the ceremonies. I was there with my 17-year-old son, Noah. When you arrive on the red carpet, you enter a security tent and show your ticket and driver's license. You notice that the tent is bisected by red velvet ropes and, with a friendly and practiced technique, celebrities are moved to the left of the rope and others to the right. This way, celebs leave the tent closer to the cameras and the fantasy that you might have that everybody in a gown or tux are somehow equals on one night sort of disappears.

Highlights from the ceremony
In Depth: Academy Award Spotlight
If you ever were curious about what happens during the commercial breaks: Stagehands with really powerful flashlights guide the changing of the sets and curtains; they make sure empty orchestra seats are filled; host Hugh Jackman introduces his parents; they show a short film about the power of the movies that got cut from the show in progress; Jackman hands his wife a plate of cookies, thinking she probably was hungry; and he later points out that the guy playing the cello on stage in the Academy Award Orchestra was actor Dermot Mulroney. Who knew? Watch a report on the night's big winners » The show was best when it demonstrated that Hollywood can still do what it has always done well: getting your attention and holding it -- seeing five Best Actors presenting Oscars on the same stage was pretty amazing. So is Best Actor Sean Penn's self-awareness. The Oscars can still astonish: They still know how to put on the big musical number, with a hundred dancing performers in top hats, moving with Busby Berkeley precision. They still know how to break your heart: Heath Ledger's parents and sister received his Academy Award and said that they did so in celebration. But I bet they'd rather have had him accept it. And for all of the breathtaking special effects that Hollywood can muster, for all the star power in the theater last night, there was something remarkable about seeing Philippe Petit in person -- the wire walker who, in 1974, hovered between the World Trade Center towers for 45 minutes. There was something joyous about watching him balance an Oscar statue on his chin.

Obama should have given Congress more say on Libya By John B. Larson, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSJohn Larson commends Obama and Clinton for working with the U.N. to respond to LibyaBut, Larson says, Obama committed U.S. military without consulting the full CongressLarson: War Powers Act limits president's ability to commit forces without Congress' OKHe says president needs to describe mission: cost, length, reason, exit strategyEditor's note: U.S. Rep. John B. Larson represents the 1st Congressional District of Connecticut. He serves as the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and is on the House Ways and Means Committee. (CNN) -- It's a story we've heard many times before. An African nation is in revolt against a brutal dictator, who is using his military to attempt to crush the uprising. However, this time, the war in Libya is front-page news in America because our military, and our international allies, are actively engaged in combat to try to end the violence. There is no question -- Col. Moammar Gadhafi is committing atrocious acts of violence against his own people. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be commended for working with the United Nations and our allies to shape a strong international response. With that said, I am very concerned that the president committed America's military to operations in the region without true consultation with the Congress. Call this what they will, we are waging war -- while still engaged on two other fronts -- which will likely require substantial resources over a long period of time. Following the Vietnam War, Congress adopted the War Powers Act to limit the president's ability to commit U.S. forces in the absence of congressional approval. While I understand the president is acting within the letter of the law, I stand by the intent of that act: "To insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities." His responsibility to the nation is to justify why this action was necessary and what the scope will be. --Rep. John Larson

Libya
I know the administration conferred with congressional leaders from both parties -- and I am gratified by that -- but I feel strongly that, as an equal branch of government that was clearly intended by our Founding Fathers to be involved in decisions on the use of military force, the full Congress should have been more informed and involved in this decision. Given our current fiscal constraints, and our military's current responsibilities, this decision truly deserved -- and still deserves -- a robust debate about questions such as: -- What is our mission? -- How long will the mission take? -- What is our exit strategy? -- What is the cost? -- And why Libya, but not the Ivory Coast, or other conflicts around the globe? I know President Obama has thought those questions through, and I know he can answer them. I know he didn't take this action lightly. He consulted with our military leaders and the international community. Duly elected representatives of the American people need to be consulted as well. His responsibility to the nation is to justify why this action was necessary and what the scope will be. As a Congress that represents the nation, we can't commit these resources without an explanation. Make no mistake. I am an ardent supporter of President Obama. It's the Constitution, however, that lays out the importance of consultation with the people's House. And I believe that using our military against another nation, even a brutal regime like Gadhafi's, requires that Congress both be informed and exercise our constitutional authority. I have called for the president to come before Congress, and I sincerely hope he responds. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John B. Larson.

Republicans lost the culture war By William J. Bennett, CNN Contributor
updated 10:16 AM EST, Wed November 14, 2012
Republicans who suffered defeat in the election have to regain influence on cultural issues, says William Bennett.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
William Bennett: Democrats played identity politics in the presidential race
Bennett: Voters believed it because they have been preached at for the past 50 years
He says liberals succeeded in focusing national discourse on gender, race, etc.
Bennett: It's time for Republicans to begin framing political and cultural discussions
Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.
(CNN) -- President Obama won the 2012 presidential election by accumulating some of the most one-sided electoral constituencies in modern political history.
Looking at a breakdown of the 2012 election exit polling, Obama won the 18- to 29-year-old vote 60% to 37%, in spite of the fact that half of all recent college graduates are unemployed or underemployed.
He won women by 11 points and unmarried women by an incredible 36 points. The marriage gap was far greater than the gender gap.
William Bennett
Obama won African-Americans with 93% of the vote, virtually unchanged from the 95% he won in 2008.

Latinos, one of the fastest growing demographics, went 71% to 27% in favor of Obama. And he won with Asians by a similarly enormous margin.
Among those who make less than $50,000 a year, Obama won 60% to 38%.
Jindal: 'Stop being the stupid party'
Mitt Romney, on the other hand, won white voters 59% to 39% and those making over $50,000 a year by 53% to 45%.
Republican lessons from Romney's loss
Graham: GOP going in the wrong direction
How Republicans can avoid 'GOP-ocalypse'
This was the drumbeat of the Obama campaign. To women they said: Republicans are waging a "war on women," trying to outlaw abortion and contraception and would take them back to their rights in the 1950s. To minorities they said: Republicans are anti-government services, cold-blooded individualists, and cannot represent minority communities. To middle and low income Americans they said: Republicans are the party of the rich, who will slash taxes for only the richest Americans and cut social safety nets for the poor.
Rather than offer a broad sweeping vision for the country, Democrats played identity politics. Republicans were the culprits, and women, young adults, black, Latinos, etc... were the victims. And voters believed it. Why? For the same reason this litany -- gender, race, ethnicity, class -- sound so familiar.
Opinion: Democrats, don't get too cocky
Voters believed it, not because it was something new or groundbreaking, but because this has been the template of many of our character-building institutions -- our public schools, our colleges, and public universities -- for the past 50 years. Go to any major university in America and this is the mindset that is taught, preached, and ingested. It also gets an assist from television drama, from the movies, and from much of the mainstream media.
For decades liberals have succeeded in defining the national discourse, the terms of discussion, and, therefore, the election, in these terms. They have successfully set the parameters and focus of the national and political dialogue as predominantly about gender, race, ethnicity, and class. This is the paradigm, the template through which many Americans, probably a majority, more or less view the world, our country, and the election. It is a divisive strategy and Democrats have targeted and exploited those divides.
Poll: Fiscal cliff headache for middle class
How else can we explain that more young people now favor socialism to capitalism?
According to a Pew Research poll taken last year, 49% of Americans age 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such a view has roots.
So while we Republicans opine about election strategies and changing demographics, and appropriately so as that is our immediate order of business, in the long run we must address the problem at its source: the culture.
Politics are downstream from the culture. Plato summarized the two most important questions in a society: Who teaches the young and what do we teach them?
For the past 50 years liberals have had majority control of the character-forming institutions. If the national dialogue stays on their terms -- gender, race, ethnicity, class -- Republicans will continue to lose.
Opinion: Failure to attract millennials is sinking the GOP
We must counter the discourse and speak and educate in terms of family, faith, freedom, principle, values, work, country, community, improvement, growth, and equality of opportunity. No longer can the Republican Party be solely the party of business. Who controls the terms of discussion, dialogue, and education controls the country and, therefore, the election.
It's time for Republicans to take it back. This will require much work and time, but there is no more important business.

Messi passes another milestone as Barca ease 15 clear
updated 6:10 PM EST, Sat February 16, 2013
On song, yet again. Lionel Messi scored his 300th goal for Barcelona on Saturday in a 2-1 win over Granada. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lionel Messi continues to rewrite record books with more landmarks passed for Barcelona
Argentine scores 300th and 301st goal for Catalan club in 2-1 win to take season tally to 36 in league
Juventus crash to 1-0 defeat at Roma Serie A; Napoli can close gap to two points with win on Sunday League leaders travel to Napoli for top-of-the-table clash on March 1 (CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 300th goal for Barcelona then promptly scored his 301st as the La Liga leaders came from behind to beat Granada 2-1 on Saturday.
The Argentine pounced when Granada keeper Tono could only parry a Cesc Fabregas drive in the 50th minute to level the scores after Nigeria striker Odion Ighalo has given the home side the lead in the 26th minute.
The poacher then turned game-winner 17 minutes from the end, curling a free kick over the wall and past the flailing hand of Toto to register his 36th goal of the Barca's league campaign.

Lionel Messi breaks goal scoring record
Lionel Messi celebrates after matching Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year, netting in the 16th minute of Barcelona's match against Real Betis in December 2012. Just nine minutes later the Argentina star passed the German's 1972 milestone. Messi passed Muller with three more possible matches to play in 2012. Then a three-time world player of the year, he went on to win a record fourth Ballon d'Or in January, The 25-year-old crept within one goal of Muller's record with two goals against Athletic Bilbao in a 5-1 victory in December. Click here to see a map of Messi's first 84 goals of 2012.
Messi made a quick recovery to be fit for the Betis game, having been injured after coming on as a substitute during a Champions League match against Benfica.
Messi enjoyed a stellar 2012. With a hat-trick against Grenada in March, he equaled and broke the all-time goalscoring record for Barcelona in official matches of 232 set by Cesar Rodriguez.
A hat-trick against Malaga in May took Messi to 68 goals for the 2011-12 season, edging him past the record for goals in a European season set by Bayern Munich's Muller in 1972-73.
Muller was one of the most predatory strikers in football history, winning both the World Cup and the Europan Championship with West Germany. Click here to see a comparison of Muller and Messi.
Messi also had a standout year for the Argentina national team. He scored 12 goals for his country in 2012, including a hat-trick against archrivals Brazil in June.
Messi became Barca's all-time leading goalscorer in "El Clasico" matches against Real Madrid in August 2012. His free-kick in that match was his 15th in the fixture against Barca's archrivals.

Lionel Messi's record year
Messi has now scored in the last 14 league games to help the Catalans to a 15-point lead over second-place Atletico Madrid who travel to Valladolid on Sunday.
Neighbors, Real Madrid -- who are third in the table -- also play on Sunday, hosting sixth-place Rayo Vallecano.
In Saturday's other games, Getafe beat relegation-threatened Celta Vigo 3-1 to climb to 11th in the table.
Malaga remain in fourth place after a 1-0 win over struggling Athletic Bilbao -- who have won only once in the last eight league games.
Read: Arsenal slump to cup defeat
Over in Serie A, league leaders Juventus lost for the second time this year going down 1-0 at Roma.
The Giallorossi, who sacked coach Zdenek Zeman at the beginning of February, finally ended a miserable league run in 2013 (two points from six games) thanks to a 58th minute goal from Francesco Totti.
Interim manager Aurelio Andreazzoli had said before the game that his team "won't lack commitment" against the Italian champions and so it proved as Roma arrested their freefall down the table and instead climb to seventh above Udinese and Catania -- ahead of their games against Genoa and Bologna on Sunday.
Read: Juventus leaves Celtic's Champions League dream in tatters
Juventus stay five points clear at the top, but if Napoli beat Sampdoria on Sunday the gap will close to two points and make the league leaders trip to the Stadio San Paulo on March 1 an even more mouth-watering prospect.
In Serie A's other Saturday fixture, Chievo drew 1-1 with relegation-threatened Palermo.

Google captures view from world's tallest building
By Arion McNicoll, for CNN
updated 2:06 AM EDT, Thu July 4, 2013
The incredible view from the 80th floor of the Burj Khalifa, captured by Google Street View.
Users can wander through the building from the lower levels up to the observation deck on the 124th floor. The tools for navigating through the building will be familiar to anyone who has used Google Street View. But on the left-hand side of the screen there is an extra widget which allows users to select the floor they wish to explore.
Visitors captured by Google's 360 degree Street View camera look out from the world's highest observation deck.
Street View uses face detection technology to blur people's faces, such as those of this couple on the 124th floor. Google admits that in some cases its technology has accidentally blurred the faces of horses and even statues.
The project also captures the Burj Khalifa's surrounding grounds, including the fountains in the building's forecourt.
The team shooting the Burj Khalifa was led by Street View program manager Pascal Malite. The entire project took about three days.
The Burj Khalifa featured in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. One scene featured Tom Cruise swinging from the windows and climbing the side of the massive structure.
In Arabic Burj means tower, and the building is named after Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates.
The Burj Khalifa was officially opened on Jan 4, 2010 with a spectacular fireworks show. It was held 1,325 days after excavation work started, and was attended by over 6,000 guests.
Construction of the tower began in 2004. The completed building has 900 apartments, 304 hotel rooms and 2,857 parking spaces.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Google captures world's tallest building Burj Khalifa with Street View
Users can see images from the basement up to the 163rd floor
It is the first time Street View has been used in the Middle East
(CNN) -- Fancy a stroll around the observation deck of the tallest building in the world?
Normally, doing so would involve a flight to Dubai, an expensive hotel room and a struggle through traffic under blazing sunshine. But now you can take it all in from the comfort of your own living room.
Google has launched a new project capturing a 360-degree view of the iconic Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- a building so enormous it is sometimes referred to as the "vertical city."
The images taken by Google allow users to navigate through the building, using Street View technology, which the company generally uses to map cities. Users can explore the structure from the opulent basement entrance hall to the highest occupied apartment in the world on the building's 163rd floor.
To compile the images, Google's photographers used state of the art equipment and battled 40 mph winds at the top of the building's spire, 828 meters (2,716 feet) above ground level.
The pictures will be the first time Street View has been used in the Middle East, and the first collection of images to feature a skyscraper.
The Burj Khalifa is the tallest man-made structure in the world. Modeled on principles of classical Islamic architecture. The building took six years and more than 22 million man-hours to erect.
The edifice's massive foundations required over 58,900 cubic yards of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes. Close to 26,000 glass panels, each individually hand-cut, were used in the exterior cladding -- equivalent to 17 soccer fields of material.
Google's Street View technology had to be specially adapted to document buildings such as this. The 360 degree cameras are mounted on a backpack which can be carried by a single operator. Other landmarks and natural wonders like the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon have also been captured by the technology.

Marines investigate photos from Iraq that reportedly show troops burning bodies By Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell and Dana Ford, CNN
updated 7:05 PM EST, Wed January 15, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Islamic custom strictly forbids cremation
TMZ.com publishes images that purport to show Marines burning human remains
The gossip website says the photographs were shot in Falluja in 2004
Falluja was the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents
(CNN) -- The Marine Corps is working to determine the authenticity of photos published by TMZ.com that purport to show Marines burning the bodies of what appear to be Iraqi insurgents.
The celebrity and gossip website said it has 41 photographs believed shot in Falluja in 2004. It published eight on Wednesday, saying the rest of the images were too graphic.
"The actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members, nor do they represent the honorable and professional service of the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan," the Defense Department said.
"The Marine Corps is currently investigating the veracity of these photos, circumstances involved, and if possible, the identities of the service members involved. The findings from this investigation will determine whether we are able to move forward with any investigation into possible wrongdoing."
Female Marines can't do three pull-ups?
Among the published photographs, a person in a Marine uniform appears to be pouring gasoline or some other flammable liquid on the bodies of insurgents. The remains are shown ablaze, and then charred.
Islamic custom strictly forbids cremation.
In another photograph, a Marine poses for the camera next to a human skull.
"There are well over a dozen bodies in the pics and some are covered with flies and one is being eaten by a dog," TMZ.com reported.
It said it turned the photographs over to the Pentagon last week and that U.S. Central Command had reviewed them to see whether they had previously been brought to its attention. They had not.
During the Iraq war, Falluja was the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents. The battles were among the worst Marines had seen since Vietnam, said former Marine Capt. Jonathan Rue.
"This looks really bad, but we don't know exactly what was happening, and we don't know what the circumstances were. Nor do we know exactly who was in those photos," he said.
If the images prove authentic, it wouldn't be the first time Marines have come under fire for the treatment of enemy bodies.
In July 2011, Marines urinated on dead Taliban fighters and posed for photographs with the corpses in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.
The incident did not come to light publicly until January of the following year, when a 39-second video showing the desecration was posted on the Internet. The video inflamed tensions over the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.
"People in battlefield situations do very strange and reprehensible things, and maybe that's simply part of life, and that's why you need to have a military justice system that can punish people and hopefully discourage this kind of conduct in the future," said Eugene Fidell, with Yale Law School, in response to the recently-published photographs.
"That isn't going to be an answer however to people in Iraq, who are likely to be very infuriated by this."
