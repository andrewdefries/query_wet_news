Bishop to priest: Admit paternity
Story Tools
PARIS, France (Reuters) -- A French bishop has ordered a priest to admit to fathering three children after his affair became public, but allowed the 80-year-old to remain a cleric, sparking debate on celibacy in largely Roman Catholic France.
The priest, a member of the Sees diocese in Normandy in northern France, fathered a boy, Olivier, and two girls during a long-running affair with a woman named only as Francoise.
"We found out after Olivier sent an e-mail to the bishop," Father Jacques Roger, a spokesman for the diocese, said on Tuesday after the story became national news.
In his letter, Olivier, at 33 the oldest of the three, complained of growing up without a father and suffering from not being recognized by the priest as his son.
"The bishop asked the priest to assume responsibility to ease the suffering of the children," said Roger, adding the priest had been paying child support for his offspring.
News of the priest's affair with a woman met with sympathetic comments in French media more used to reporting on clerical misdeeds with underage boys. About 30 cases of priests abusing children have been uncovered in France in recent years.
The story first emerged last month when Francoise spoke out on television about having children fathered by priests.
Realising the cleric was his father, Olivier wrote to the bishop to ask for help.
"There are many priests who don't live according to the laws of chastity and celibacy," said Elisabeth Szen of Plein Jour (Daylight), a group for women who are involved with members of the clergy and campaign to shake off their clandestine status.
"The Catholic Church does not act quickly, and it is hard to say when the celibacy rule will finally be abolished, but we think one day it will happen."
However, others were less sure of change.
"The church does not work through listening to pressure groups or to the media," said Roger. Pope John Paul II has defended celibacy as a vital part of Catholic tradition.
The man, semi-retired before the affair became public, was asked not to perform any more public duties but was allowed to remain a priest and was not excluded from the church.
"We would like him to meet (his children)," Roger said.

Memo blasts air traffic controller and supervisor over 'kids' incident Children talk to pilots at JFKSTORY HIGHLIGHTS Memo says conduct of control personnel in the past "has been exemplary" Memo goes on to say the "lapse in judgment" slights the agency's credibility The FAA has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operation areas New York (CNN) -- "Unauthorized and unprofessional" is how an internal memo describes the conduct of an air traffic controller, who allegedly allowed his two young children to speak with pilots on an air traffic control frequency, and his supervisor, who allegedly allowed it to happen. The memo, dated February 25, was written after the facilities manager for the air traffic control tower at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport learned about the incident, a source who has seen the memo told CNN. "The display of professionalism in the past by the control personnel at this facility has been exemplary," the memo said. "However, a lapse in judgment for what may seem a minor transgression diminishes our credibility and slights the high standards of professionalism." It was not immediately clear what prompted the manager to write the memo or how he found out about the incident, the source said. The incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at JFK, the Federal Aviation Administration said this week, and the controller and the supervisor have been placed on paid administrative leave. "We have an incredible team of professionals who safely control our nation's skies every single day. This kind of behavior does not reflect the true caliber of our workforce," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in the statement Wednesday. Babbitt was referring to the February 16 incident involving the controller's young son, who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a JetBlue flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent Aeromexico flight. Later, an FAA official, who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, said the controller brought his daughter into the same tower the following day, and the child was allowed to talk with pilots of two planes. A separate source said the supervisor "should be making sure that things like this don't happen." Yet another source familiar with the investigation said the two children are twins. The controller who brought the children to work later reported that he had done so, the source said. The controller and supervisor involved are veteran employees, the official said. Dave Pascoe owner of the Web site where the recording of the air traffic communications is posted, told CNN he thinks the attention the incident has drawn is "ridiculous" and it has been "blown out of proportion." In the recording, a child says, "JetBlue 171, cleared for takeoff." A man then tells the plane, "Here's what you get, guys, when the kids are out of school." The pilot chuckles and says, "Wish I could bring my kid to work." The same pilot later tells the child, "Awesome job." Video: Air traffic trouble

During the recording, which is dated February 17, the child also speaks to an apparent Aeromexico flight. A recording from the following day, when the daughter was reportedly in the tower, also was posted on the Web site. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. February 16. Pascoe said most people "in the aviation community felt like this was (not) anything more than a noble thing, that a father would take his kid to work." "It was one incident where a kid was up in the control tower," he said. "If you know anything about aviation, you know that the air traffic control towers are highly supervised. ... A father was taking a child to work and let the kid clear planes for takeoff and now the world thinks it's an unsafe place." The FAA has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas during its investigation into the incident. Babbitt has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing controllers, issued a statement, saying its members "do not condone this type of behavior in any way."CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.

Showcasing art of the 'uncooked' By Cassie Spodak, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTS The "Outsider Art Fair" begins this weekend in New York City The fair features untraditional artwork from inmates and the mentally disabled Artwork includes calendars made of M&M wrappers and robots made from coffee pots When you think of "inside" you think of safe, says one art expert (CNN) -- At first, it was just a way for mental health professionals to treat their patients, but today, it's called "Outsider Art." French artist Jean DuBuffet first coined the term "L'Art Brut," or literally "Rough Art," in the 1940s when he found psychiatric patients, children and prisoners with unusual artistic skill. The term stood for untrained artists "uncooked" by mainstream society. It has since been translated to "Outsider Art," but it has also become much more elusive to define. At the Outsider Art Fair in New York City, which starts this weekend, it means anything from drawings written on stationery from "State Lunatic Asylum No. 3," to calendars made of M&M wrappers and scraps of newspaper, to robots made from coffee pots, irons and sprinkler heads. John Beardsley, an adjunct professor at the Harvard Design School, describes outsider artists as individuals isolated from the mainstream culture. "DuBuffet said it's not only separate, but antagonistic to "cooked" culture. Purity always was, or used to be, a key concept," Beardsley said. But Beardsley questions whether anyone can really be untouched by mainstream culture in today's world of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. "We all grow up touched by culture. Even back in the teens and 20s there was a traffic of images," says Beardsley. "It's only gotten more complicated and more compromised." So what exactly is Outsider Art in 2011? First founded in 1992, the Outsider Air Fair is held each February in New York City and now involves 26 dealers and hundreds of pieces of artwork. Stanford Smith, who first founded the show as an outgrowth of an American Folk Art fair, works closely with different dealers and galleries to find artists who are authentically "outsiders." Smith defines outsider artists as "people on the outside of mainstream society, prison inmates, people who are autistic, people who live outside the boundaries of what normal people consider society." Some of the artists featured are no longer alive, their artwork only discovered after their death. But many of the present-day artists have varying understandings of their own status as "outsiders." The Fountain Gallery, part of a nonprofit that seeks to provide services and community for individuals with mental illnesses, brought their artist members to the fair. Gallery director Jason Bowman says artists have described their illnesses as "dangerous gifts." "It's not something you would necessarily want, but it also brings extraordinary work," Bowman said. Fountain Gallery artist BSpin, a 31-year-old woman dealing with mental illness, is exhibiting drawings depicting nude women and instruments. The unheard music of her pieces symbolizes her struggle with her illness. The "negative music" of her past made it difficult to be an artist. The vibrant colors and shapes of her current pieces are a celebration of the "positive music" present now. For BSpin, the "outsider" label is a way for her to own what makes her different. "For me to be called outsider art is really kind of a badge of honor." It's something that I need to do to survive, it doesn't even factor in that I'm making art.--Keith Pavia

However, Keith Pavia, also of Fountain Gallery, feels very differently about being labeled as an outsider. Pavia is 44 years old and studied art at the Pratt Institute and the New York Studio School. He suffers from bipolar disorder. "When you think of 'inside' you think of 'safe'," Pavia said. "As soon as you say 'outside' you think of the guy with the face pressed up against the glass, looking in. " Pavia walks the line between mainstream and outsider status but feels comfortable in both. For Pavia, the goal is artistic expression that isn't self-conscious. "What I respond to in outsider art, there's kind of a purity to it and I feel like a lot of the work that I see around here, people are channeling from a subconscious place," Pavia said. "It's something that I need to do to survive, it doesn't even factor in that I'm making art." The Outsider Art Fair grapples with the changing definition of "outsider" but it also stays true to Jean DuBuffet's vision of Art Brut. The Christian Berst Gallery from France is featured in the fair exhibiting one of DuBuffet's original discoveries. Henriette Zéphir is now 91, but in 1967 Jean DuBuffet literally begged her to have an exhibition of the drawings she had made as a spiritual medium. Christian Berst said Zéphir is still surprised when people tell her what she does is art. "For her it has nothing to do with art, it has to do with a dialogue between her and her spirits," Berst said. "What makes this work so interesting is that it's not made for the market. It's the work from inside coming out."

Singing legend Etta James dies at 73
By Todd Leopold, CNN
updated 7:31 PM EST, Tue December 11, 2012
Etta James, here performing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2009, died Friday, January 20, due to complications from leukeimia, said her longtime friend and manager, Lupe De Leon. The singer was 73.
Etta James released her debut album, "At Last," in 1961. She released her next studio album, "The Second Time Around," later that year.
The singer released her first live album, "Etta James Rocks the House," in 1964.
James performs in St. Louis in October 1986.
The singer receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003.
The "At Last" singer was portrayed by Beyonce in the film "Cadillac Records." The movie, loosely based on James' record label, Chess Records, premiered in 2008.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Etta James died from complications from leukemia at 73
She overcame her addiction throughout her career
The award winning singer earned six Grammys
James was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
(CNN) -- Etta James, whose assertive, earthy voice lit up such hits as "The Wallflower," "Something's Got a Hold on Me" and the wedding favorite "At Last," has died, according to her longtime friend and manager, Lupe De Leon. She was 73.
She died from complications from leukemia with her husband, Artis Mills, and her sons by her side, De Leon said.
She was diagnosed with leukemia in 2010, and also suffered from dementia and hepatitis C. James died at a hospital in Riverside, California. She would have turned 74 Wednesday.
" This is a tremendous loss for the family, her friends and fans around the world," De Leon said. "She was a true original who could sing it all -- her music defied category.
"I worked with Etta for over 30 years. She was my friend and I will miss her always."

2003: Etta James reflects on her career
2008: Etta James at 'Cadillac Records'
The powerhouse singer, known as "Miss Peaches," lived an eventful life. She first hit the charts as a teenager, taking "The Wallflower (Roll With Me, Henry)" -- an "answer record" to Hank Ballard's "Work With Me, Annie" -- to No. 1 on the R&B charts in 1955. She joined Chess Records in 1960 and had a string of R&B and pop hits, many with lush string arrangements. After a mid-decade fade, she re-emerged in 1967 with a more hard-edged, soulful sound.
Throughout her career, James overcame a heroin addiction, opened for the Rolling Stones, won six Grammys and was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite her ups and downs -- including a number of health problems -- she maintained an optimistic attitude.
"Most of the songs I sing, they have that blue feeling to it. They have that sorry feeling. And I don't know what I'm sorry about," she told CNN's Denise Quan in 2002. "I don't!"
Through it all, she was a spitfire beloved by contemporaries and young up-and-comers.
"Etta James is unmanageable, and I'm the closest thing she's ever had to a manager," Lupe DeLeon, her manager of 30-plus years, told CNN in admiration.
British songstress Adele named James as one of her favorite singers, along with Aretha Franklin.
"If you were to look up the word singer in the dictionary, you'd see their names," Adele said in an interview.
Etta James was born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles to a teen mother and unknown father. (She suspected her father was the pool player Minnesota Fats.)
Her birth mother initially took little responsibility and James was raised by a series of people, notably a pair of boardinghouse owners. But she was recognized from a young age for her booming voice, showcased in a South Central Los Angeles church.
In 1950, her mother took her to San Francisco, where James formed a group called the Peaches. Singer Johnny Otis, best known for "Willie and the Hand Jive," discovered her and had her sing a song he wrote using Ballard's tune as a model. "The Wallflower," with responses from "Louie Louie" songwriter Richard Berry, made James an R&B star.
Her signing to Chess introduced her to a broader audience, as the record label's co-owner, Leonard Chess, believed she should do pop hits. Among her recordings were "Stormy Weather," the Lena Horne classic originally from 1933; "A Sunday Kind of Love," which dates from 1946; and most notably, "At Last," a 1941 number that was originally a hit for Glenn Miller.
James' version of "At Last" starts out with swooning strings and the singer enters with confident gusto, dazzlingly maintaining a mood of joy and romance. Though the song failed to make the Top 40 upon its 1961 release -- though it did hit the R&B Top 10 -- its emotional punch has long made it a favorite at weddings.
James' career suffered in the mid-'60s when the British Invasion took over the pop charts and as she fought some personal demons. But she got a boost when she started recording at Rick Hall's FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Her hits included the brassy "Tell Mama" and the raw "I'd Rather Go Blind," the latter later notably covered by Rod Stewart.
She entered rehab in the 1970s for her drug problem but re-established herself with live performances and an album produced by noted R&B mastermind Jerry Wexler. After another stint in rehab -- this time at the Betty Ford Clinic -- she made a comeback album, "Seven Year Itch," in 1988.
James mastered a range of styles -- from R&B and soul to jazz and blues -- but she was always one step behind the popular genre of the day, said Michael Coyle, a Colgate University professor who has written about jazz and R&B and reviews records for Cadence Magazine.
"She never really got her moment in the sun," Coyle said.
But James soldiered on, and by the end of her life she had made so much meaningful music that she was considered a living legend. "By the mid-'90s, she's survived so long that people start to look up to her," Coyle said.
James was portrayed by pop star Beyonce in the 2008 film "Cadillac Records," about Chess. After Beyonce sang "At Last" at one of President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural balls, James lashed out: "I can't stand Beyonce. She had no business up there singing my song that I've been singing forever." She later told the New York Daily News she was joking.
Earlier this year, news reports revealed that the singer's estate was being contested in a legal struggle between her husband, Artis Mills, and son Donto James. (Donto and her other son, Sametto, both played in her band.)
Over the years, James had her share of health problems. In the late 1990s she reportedly weighed more than 400 pounds and required a scooter to get around. In 2003 she had gastric bypass surgery and dropped more than half the weight, according to People magazine.
However, until her latest issues, James maintained a steady touring schedule and appeared full of energy even when sitting down -- as she sometimes did on stage, due to bad knees and her weight battles.
Even while sitting down, James gave it her all on stage, singing as though possessed, caressing every note like a long-lost love. If that seemed a little much to critics, well, the legendary singer had a show to put on, she told Quan.
"They said that Etta James is still vulgar," she said in the 2002 interview. "I said, 'Oh, how dare 'em say I'm still real vulgar! I'm vulgar because I dance in the chair?' What would they want me to do? Want me to just be still or something like that?
"I gotta do something."

The enemy within: Who's stealing your company's secrets?
By Rose Hoare, CNN
updated 6:26 AM EDT, Tue August 7, 2012
Nearly a third of workers would take information to a new job if they were fired, according to a new study.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Study: One in seven European workers have taken confidential information to new job
Employees are most inclined to take documents they've worked on
Almost a third confessed they would deliberately take files if they were sacked
London (CNN) -- When considering risks to their business, employers tend to worry about hackers or burglars, but the biggest threat to security might come from within.
According to a study conducted by information management company Iron Mountain, a third of 2,031 European office workers surveyed admitted that they had taken or forwarded confidential information out of the office, and one in seven had taken confidential information with them to a new job.
Another 31% said they would deliberately remove and share confidential information if they were fired.
Data breach is a common concern for businesses, but Peter Eglinton, Iron Mountain's Senior Vice President for UK, Ireland & Norway, says they tend to focus too much on monitoring for attacks from outside, while "the people side of the organization and the hard copy are forgotten about."
You can see who's hacking in and taking information, but people don't leave a trail.Peter Eglinton, Iron Mountain
"You can see who's hacking in and taking information, but people don't leave a trail," he says. "Therefore, if you don't have good policies in place, it's very difficult to work out what has happened with information."
Although we may not always consider the data we work with day in and day out to be particularly exciting, Eglinton says that in any given business there are several functions that might use or create information that's commercially valuable or subject to privacy laws.
"HR or finance will have an awful lot of access to very sensitive information," Eglinton says. "Sales and marketing will have access to customer data, and some of the service organizations will have a lot of information about their patients or their customers."

Of the workers who admitted to taking confidential information to a new job, half said they believed they had a right to take information, and most said they took information because they had been involved in its creation.
Although pervasive, this sense of ownership is misguided, says Eglinton. "The information you create in your daily work doesn't belong to you because you created it," he says, "it belongs to the organization that's paying you to do that job."
The study also revealed that most of those who had taken information when they left a job had relieved their employers of customer databases.

This, according to Chris Pounder of UK data protection training organization Amberhawk, is "a dangerous thing to do." Privacy laws vary from country to country, but in the EU, for example, any processing of information that relates to a living person is a breach of the Data Protection Directive.
Although some consultants and lawyers might be able to negotiate permission to transfer clients with them when they leave a company, Pounder says: "If an employee took a database of customers without the consent of their employer, they are risking a criminal offense.
"And if they did it to set up their own business, they're also vulnerable for someone taking a civil case for damages."
The information you create in your daily work doesn't belong to you because you created it.Peter Eglinton, Iron Mountain
Besides, making a gift of illegally obtained information is unlikely to ingratiate you to a new boss. Pounder points out that a new employer who knowingly receives personal data obtained in breach of data protection laws could also be liable for damages caused.
So, what can businesses do to protect their data?
Information management companies offer solutions ranging from encryption software to systems that allow organizations to track the whereabouts of files across multiple sites. But Eglinton thinks simply communicating policies regarding information ownership is a good first step towards alleviating the problem.
"I don't think you need to have security guards on the door every day, but reminding people of the policy, and auditing those processes, would go a long way towards managing information more securely," he says.
Regardless of how information leaves a company -- whether due to malice, professional pride or as more businesses allow telecommuting -- Eglinton believes there is always cause for concern.
Even those who take documents home for entirely legitimate reasons and with their employer's consent might be endangering security. "How do you manage information created on the train on the way into work?" he asks. "And how do you manage that information thereafter? If people are taking information out of the office, how do you know that information comes back or is securely destroyed?"
Eglinton predicts that, as the volume of information created grows, executives need to consider "not just the value you get from information, but how you protect it, because it's a hugely valuable asset, but often nobody has responsibility for it."

Why you should talk about sex before marriage
By Ian Kerner, Special to CNN
updated 5:39 AM EST, Thu January 24, 2013
Good sex before marriage may not last, experts say, as people's sexual needs may change over the years.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
People's bodies and desires change over time, experts say
Couples need to talk honestly about sex before tying the knot, Ian Kerner says
A therapist can help get the conversation started, Kerner says
Editor's note: Ian Kerner, a sexuality counselor and New York Times best-selling author, writes about sex and relationships for CNN Health. Read more from him on his website, GoodInBed.
(CNN) -- Most couples tying the knot don't want to wait until the honeymoon to know if things are going to work in the bedroom, and would agree that having sex before marriage is an important way to establish if there's a basic level of sexual compatibility.
But -- without getting into the moral pros and cons of premarital sex -- that may not always be the case.
"Just because you have good sex, and a lot of it, before marriage doesn't mean it will be that way for your entire life," says social psychologist Justin Lehmiller.
"Our bodies and desires naturally change over time in response to both age and major life events, such as having children, and these changes don't affect everyone in the same way. This means that one partner's sexual needs and wants often change at a much faster rate than the other's, resulting in discrepancies that can precipitate conflict, adultery and divorce."
Ian Kerner
You can't judge the rest of your sex life by your current experiences, especially if you've had a whirlwind romance. In the beginning of your relationship, you're both under the influence of a potent biochemical cocktail of infatuation hormones.
"A person's inherent need for sensation is not necessarily obvious in the early stages of a relationship, when love itself is a novelty and carries its own thrills," says Marvin Zuckerman, a professor at the University of Delaware whose research involves sensation-seeking. "It's when the sex becomes routine that problems occur."
Why we cheat: Sex and cheating
That's why I recommend that couples talk openly and honestly about sex -- whether or not they're already having it -- before they walk down the aisle.
Your smartphone may be powering down your relationship
"As a newlywed sex educator, I've been surprised at how much marriage has changed our sex life in ways I would never have anticipated," says Emily Nagoski, author of the book "A Scientific Guide to Successful Relationships."
"Based on my experience, I think that the best thing a couple can do is talk through a wide range of hypothetical scenarios -- what if one person's interest in sex changes a lot, either increase or decrease? What if one of you gets cancer or is in a car accident and loses sensation below the waist? These 'what ifs' aren't about having a plan for every contingency; they're about practicing your collaborative problem-solving skills."
But talking about sex isn't always easy, even for couples who plan to share everything with each other. Most of us have had some sex education somewhere in the past, but nobody ever taught us how to have a constructive conversation with a partner about the sex we're having.
"When you're not able to openly talk about sexual preferences with your partner, those bedroom problems will resurface in other aspects of their relationship, and can lead to misdirected frustration," says Patty Brisben, a sex education advocate and entrepreneur.
For those couples who are too inhibited to get this conversation started on their own, a trip to a marriage and family therapist should be a priority.
Hate your body? 4 ways to get your sex life back
"Premarital counseling provides a safe space for couples to discuss their sexual hopes, fears and expectations," says Ami Bhalodkar, a New York marriage and family therapist. "Counselors can help couples initiate and engage in conversations about sex in ways that are tailored to their particular style of communication, cultural/religious background and overall level of comfort and emotional safety -- be it through journaling, making art, reflecting on poetry and music, playing a card game or participating in a speaker/listener dialogue.
"Regardless of the methods used, once couples have broken the silence around this issue, they report feeling incredibly relieved and more secure and optimistic about their sexual future together."
So keep an eye on the long view. "This person is going to be sleeping next to you every night for the rest of your lives -- decades, hopefully," Nagoski says.
"Without making a little effort to try new things, it can get routine, fast. Trying new things together isn't really about the things you try, it's about the sense of adventure as you explore together."
If you're curious about whether or not you and your partner are on the same page, you can each take this survey entitled "What Are You Up for in the Bedroom?" created by Kristen Mark, author of the book "Good in Bed Guide to Sexual Adventure."
By talking about your concerns and expectations now, you can build a strong foundation for a healthy, happy sex life -- till death do you part.
Says Amy Levine, sex coach and founder of Ignite Your Pleasure: "The key is to become sexually empowered and confident before marriage. For some people this may happen by being sexually experienced before they meet their potential spouse, but it's also about taking care of their sexual health, feeling good in their own skin, knowing what turns them on and off and being communicative about their needs, wants and desires."

Why Taliban would talk as U.S. withdrawal looms
By Nic Robertson, CNN
updated 12:10 PM EDT, Thu June 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN's Nic Robertson discusses Hamid Karzai's decisions to pull back from talks
The peace process is not over, but compromise seems to be in short supply
Taliban group agreeing to talks is the one that was in charge of Afghanistan for 9/11 attacks
Taliban might think that if civil war returns to Afghanistan, they may not be successful
(CNN) -- As is so often the case in Afghanistan, turmoil and confusion have clouded this week's announcement of peace talks involving the United States and the Taliban in Doha, Qatar.
CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson explains what's happening, and why.
What are we talking about?
The Taliban have opened an office in Qatar with an eye toward beginning talks there with Afghan and U.S. officials to end the fighting in Afghanistan. U.S. officials are expected to meet Thursday with Taliban representatives in Doha, but Afghanistan said Wednesday it won't participate.
What's gone wrong?
Afghan Taliban to meet with U.S., Karzai
Uncertainty marks Afghan handover
Afghan President Hamid Karzai is upset about how the Taliban portrayed themselves in opening their Qatar office, and he feels there's a rush to talks. He wants to be in control the peace process, and he isn't.
So he's pulled his delegation to the Doha talks and backed out of direct discussions with the United States about what happens after 2014, when NATO withdraws from Afghanistan.
Taliban talks announced
Who's saying what?
Karzai says there are "contradictions between acts and statements of the U.S. in regard to the peace process." He says that the Taliban are emphasizing a continuation of the fighting and that "foreign powers" -- read Pakistan -- "are behind the opening of the Taliban office" in Qatar.
The Taliban, which angered Afghan officials by flying their flag and provocatively calling themselves the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, say they're "fighting to bring an end to the occupation" by NATO forces.
At their office in Doha, Taliban make changes
Is the peace process over?
It's unlikely -- everyone has something to gain from a successful negotiation. The United States would get a dignified exit for most of its forces and an agreement on a long-term presence in Afghanistan. Karzai would get the legacy he craves as a peacemaker, and the Taliban would get a say in how the country is run.
President Barack Obama said we should expect "bumps in the road" and warned that this would be "a difficult process." And this is not the first time Karzai has stalled things.
But this is not a good start. Compromise seems to be in short supply.
What about the killing of 4 U.S. soldiers by the Taliban?
It is worrying that this came hours after the Taliban statement Tuesday. Is it coincidence or backlash? Some Taliban field commanders are unhappy with their representatives in Qatar, and behind the scenes, those close to the Taliban fear an uptick in violence near Kabul.
There's a risk that hard-liners will undermine leaders they don't trust in these talks. That's true in most peace negotiations. Some think representatives in Qatar will do Pakistan's bidding and want out of the fight now. Others may fight long after the majority agrees to peace.
Why is U.S. now brokering peace with Taliban?
Is there a grand bargain to be had?
International representatives close to the process in the past have told me not to rule it out. A bargain, where the Taliban accept U.S. bases in Afghanistan beyond the 2014 pullout date and where they agree not to attack them, is possible. The same people also say don't hold your breath, this has been a long time coming.
What are the demands?
The Taliban must renounce al Qaeda. In the past, the Taliban have demanded that all foreign troops leave the country and have asked for specific percentages of representation in the Afghan political and military structures. They also want their prisoners released from U.S.-controlled detention.
Taliban officials have said in the past that theirs is a national struggle and that al Qaeda has an international agenda. However, they would take support where they could get it. The demand to renounce al Qaeda has been made to the Taliban since their first tentative "talks" in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in 2008.
Which Taliban are we talking about?
The Taliban of Mullah Omar, the Afghan leader or the Emir of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before September 2001. His right-hand man, Tayyab Agha, heads the Taliban mission in Qatar. Other principal Taliban and Afghan opposition factions include the Haqqani faction, the TTP or Pakistani Mehsud faction and the Hekmatyar faction in the North East.
Those close to Mullah Omar's Taliban say the vast majority of Taliban support him.
International representatives close to the process say that while that may be true, powerful groups like the Haqqanis could continue an insurgency even if Mullah Omar makes peace with Kabul.
Why would the Taliban talk now?
The civil war that the Taliban had all but won in 2001 has gone into remission with the presence of international forces. If the Taliban were to fight for the whole country again, they may not do so well.
The civil war bubbles beneath the surface, and should it resurface, the former northern warlords who have profited from the U.S. presence would make a Taliban fight for supremacy much harder. In short, they may get a better deal at the table than on the battlefield.
Why has it taken so much time to get talks going?
Karzai on several occasions felt bypassed by backdoor U.S. conversations with the Taliban in Qatar. He reportedly blocked progress. The Taliban also walked out on talks when Taliban prisoners at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay were not released as they had expected.
Where is Mullah Omar, and why's that important?
He is widely believed to be in Pakistan, unable to move freely without Pakistan's approval. That's what his supporters believe, although Pakistan has denied it. Pakistan wants a say in Afghanistan's future. If Afghanistan drifted toward Pakistan's archenemy India, its sphere of influence would be upset.
What influence will Pakistan have on the talks?
Agha, Mullah Omar's representative, could not have established an office in Qatar and be in a position to talk to Afghans and Americans without Pakistan's permission. That's the understanding of some in the Taliban, at least.
Karzai and U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan. The ISI denies that.
What hiccups can we expect?
Karzai says the next talks must be in Afghanistan. That is unlikely to sit well with Pakistan.
But just to get to this point has been very difficult. For the talks to work, all sides will need to be committed.

GOP turns new fire on Clinton after Benghazi report
By Matt Smith, CNN
updated 6:57 PM EST, Thu January 16, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Clinton adviser blasts "the prism of politics" around Benghazi
"Sounds like the 2016 presidential race has now started," senator says
Senate committee finds Benghazi attack was likely preventable
Republicans blast Clinton in addendum to report; committee leader calls that unfair
(CNN) -- She's mentioned by name only once in 85 pages, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was back under a Republican microscope after a Senate report on the killings of four Americans in Libya.
"Sounds like the 2016 presidential race has now started," Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, told CNN.
Clinton leads early polls of potential Democratic presidential contenders. GOP leaders quickly focused their fire on her after the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the 2012 assault on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was "likely preventable" based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, State Department computer specialist Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed in that attack.
The Senate report spread the blame between the State Department and the intelligence community. State Department officials should have beefed up security in Libya's second-largest city because of general warnings that U.S. personnel were at risk. The intelligence community could have flagged potential threats on "extremist-affiliated social media," the report says. In addition, the report says intelligence officials inaccurately reported that a protest might have led to the attack, and took too long to correct the erroneous reports -- "which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers."
It follows a 2013 report by the State Department's Accountability Review Board, which resulted in the reassignment of four State Department officials.
But questions around security and intelligence as well as the changing explanation in the days that followed the attack -- which occurred in the heat of the 2012 presidential race -- led to allegations of a cover-up and repeated Republican calls for more explanation from the Obama administration. Wednesday's report did little to quiet them.
"It raises questions that I think need to be answered before we can put this to rest," said Coats, one of five Republicans who blasted Clinton in a statement of "additional views" tacked onto the end of the report -- the only part of the document that identifies her directly. They argued that as secretary of state, Clinton bore "ultimate accountability" for security at the Benghazi mission, "and we believe there should be a full examination of her role in these events, including on the night of the attacks."
"In this case, there are a lot of finger pointing elsewhere as to failures of the process and failures of the agency, et cetera," Coats said. "But no one really has stood up and said, 'I take responsibility for this.' That's important. The American people want justice done here and closure to this issue."
Clinton, who left office in February 2013, has said she accepts responsibility for the Benghazi deaths.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Clinton adviser told CNN, "Four Americans lost their lives. We have never and will never approach this tragedy through the prism of politics. If others continue to do so for their own gain, they're going to have to do it without us."
But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN that Clinton "has to clear the air on Benghazi" if she wants to be president.
"She has a lot of accomplishments. She's a very accomplished woman. But, under her leadership, the consulate became a death trap," said Graham, who doesn't sit on the Intelligence Committee.
And Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said, "The American people hold all of us accountable who are in responsibility. She should be held accountable."
But comments like that drew a sharp response from the committee's chairwoman, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, on Thursday. In a statement issued by her office, Feinstein said claims that the report blames Clinton for the Benghazi deaths are "patently false," and that the Republican addendum "unfairly criticizes Secretary Clinton."
Wednesday, Feinstein told CNN's The Situation Room that "it's interesting that the first thing out of the box is something that's political."
And at the White House, spokesman Jay Carney criticized what he called "a very politicized effort on this that has seen a lot of conspiracy theories floated, reported on as fact, and then debunked."
"Our interest is in getting those who are responsible, bringing them to justice, and taking the steps necessary to ensure that this kind of thing can't happen again or is far less likely to happen again," Carney said Thursday.
But efforts to bring the perpetrators -- identified as members of a variety of Islamic militant groups, some affiliated with al Qaeda -- to justice have been frustrated by the lack of "political incentive or will" by Libyan authorities to prosecute those believed responsible, the Senate report states. In addition, it noted, up to 15 people who had assisted the probe have been killed since September 2012, though it wasn't clear if the deaths were related to the probe.
CNN's Elise Labott and Paul Courson contributed to this report.
