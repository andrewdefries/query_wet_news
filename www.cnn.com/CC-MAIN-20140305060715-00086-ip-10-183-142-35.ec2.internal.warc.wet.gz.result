Study: Alcohol 'most harmful drug,' followed by crack and heroin By the CNN Wire Staff The Lancet, a British medical journal, lists alcohol as the most harmful drug among a list of 20 drugs.

London, England (CNN) -- Alcohol ranks "most harmful" among a list of 20 drugs, beating out crack and heroin when assessed for its potential harm to the individual imbibing and harm to others, according to study results released by a British medical journal. A panel of experts from the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs weighed the physical, psychological, and social problems caused by the drugs and determined that alcohol was the most harmful overall, according to an article on the study released by The Lancet on Sunday. Using a new scale to evaluate harms to individual users and others, alcohol received a score of 72 on a scale of 1 to 100, the study says. It was compared to 19 other drugs using 16 criteria: nine related to the adverse effects the drug has on an individual and seven on its harm against others. That makes it almost three times as harmful as cocaine or tobacco, according to the article, which is slated to be published on The Lancet's website Monday and in an upcoming print edition of the journal. Heroin, crack cocaine and methamphetamine were the most harmful drugs to individuals, the study says, while alcohol, heroin and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others. In the article, the panelists said their findings show that Britain's three-tiered drug classification system, which places drugs into different categories that determine criminal penalties for possession and dealing, has "little relation to the evidence of harm." Panelists also noted that the rankings confirm other studies that say that "aggressively targeting alcohol harms is a valid and necessary public health strategy." The Lancet article was co-authored by David Nutt, a professor and Britain's former chief drug adviser, who caused controversy last year after he published an article saying ecstasy was not as dangerous as riding a horse. "So why are harmful sporting activities allowed, whereas relatively less harmful drugs are not?" Nutt wrote in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. "I believe this reflects a societal approach which does not adequately balance the relative risks of drugs against their harms." Nutt later apologized to to anyone offended by the article and to those who have lost loved ones to ecstasy. He said he had no intention of trivializing the dangers of the drug and that he only wanted to compare the risks. In the article released by The Lancet on Sunday, ecstasy's harmfulness ranking -- 9 -- indicates it is only one-eighth as harmful as alcohol. The study was funded by the London-based Centre for Crime and Justice studies.

(CNN) -- Seven Colombian national police officers were killed Sunday in an attack by suspected guerrillas in northern Colombia, defense ministry spokesman Javier Flores told CNN. The police were engaged in a routine patrol near the city of Tibu when they were ambushed by an explosive device, he said. The National Liberation Army, or ELN, guerrillas operate in the area and were suspected of being behind the attack, Flores said. In a separate incident in the south of the country, three soldiers were killed in a confrontation with FARC guerrillas, he said. The attacks come on Colombia's election day, where a runoff will decide who will succeed President Alvaro Uribe, who held a tough stance against the guerrilla groups. Share this on:

E.coli: Is my salad safe? By Bryony Jones, for CNN Experts say washing, peeling and cooking vegetables can help cut the risk of E.coli contamination STORY HIGHLIGHTSE.coli outbreak linked to salad vegetables has left 18 people deadExperts say bacteria from animal waste is likely to blameWashing, peeling or cooking vegetables can help cut risk of illness (CNN) -- From milk powder tainted with industrial chemicals in China to eggs contaminated with salmonella in the UK, food safety scares are nothing new, but the latest -- a deadly outbreak of E.coli in Germany is different. While previous scandals have left consumers wary of burgers, ready-made sauces and juicy t-bone steaks, this case has struck at those who thought they were doing all they could to eat healthily: Salad vegetables are emerging as the prime suspect. Health experts are working against the clock to find the exact source of the killer strain of E.coli which has left 16 dead and hundreds more sick, some of whom are critically ill with kidney and neurological complications. The outbreak, focused on the northern German city of Hamburg, has spread to 10 countries worldwide, and left health authorities at its epicenter warning people not to eat raw vegetables. "The source is still a mystery," Dr Jörg Debatin, director of the Hamburg Medical Center, told CNN. "At this point, we still have to assume it has something to do with vegetables.

"For people living in northern Germany, or visiting northern Germany, the advice is to refrain from eating raw vegetables: No cucumbers, no tomatoes, no salads. "To sum it up, either peel it, cook it or leave it. That's a good way to live by, and fortunately there are lots of other things we can eat." Dr Nicola Holden, from Scotland's James Hutton Institute, said that while food poisoning was usually linked to meat and eggs, cases relating to vegetables appeared to be on the increase. "We have seen a rise in the number of outbreaks associated instead with fresh fruit and vegetables; in particular foods that are eaten raw or lightly cooked, like salad vegetables, fresh fruit and sprouted beans," she said. Molecular microbiologist Dr Alan McNally, from Nottingham Trent University, said large-scale E.coli outbreaks in the US and Japan in recent years had both been linked to salad vegetables. McNally told CNN such cases were usually linked to contamination from animal waste, either in groundwater, water used in irrigation, or in slurry spread on fields as fertilizer. Holden said that as well as landing directly on the plants, the bacteria were also absorbed into their edible parts -- the leaves and fruit -- through their root systems, meaning that washing alone was not always enough to get rid of contaminants. "The threat to human health occurs because these bacteria are not simply sitting on the surface of the plant and are particularly difficult to remove post-harvest," she said. Health authorities say the case is a reminder of the importance of basic food hygiene practices, such as keeping surfaces and utensils clean. "Simple precautions like hand-washing and not preparing food for other people when you're sick should prevent the spread from one person to another," Robert Tauxe, of the U.S. Center for Disease Control told CNN. But experts insist there is no need for widespread worry. "This outbreak seems to be confined to northern Germany, even the cases elsewhere are linked to there, and so there's absolutely no cause for concern," McNally told CNN. "It's always a good idea to wash fruit and vegetables, but people don't need to get paranoid about eating salad." Share this on:

Aging stylishly, online and in the streets
By Emanuella Grinberg, CNN
updated 10:47 AM EDT, Sat April 28, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Advanced Style, Idiosyncratic Fashionistas blogs show older women dressing to impress
They dress to be seen and to make the point that youth is not necessarily beauty
"Life is too short to worry about what people are going to think of you," blogger says
Message resonates with younger generation embracing style as personal, not trend-oriented
Editor's note: This article was originally published April 27, 2012.
New York (CNN) -- Tziporah Salamon typically starts with a hat to create the "painting" of herself that she presents to the world.
On this particular Thursday night, she's dressing for dinner with a new friend she met at the Japan Society art deco exhibit opening in New York. As she looks over her meticulously curated vintage collection, she decides it has to be the "pierrot" clown motif. It's one of her favorites, and it has the kind of whimsy that makes an impression.
She picks a hat -- no, a different one -- and pulls on a black Comme de Garcons pom-pom sweater over black silk pants (bought on second markdown from Saks). Next, a cropped, red wool sweater with billowy sleeves, a chunky bracelet and red clip-on earrings from her vanity -- home to a colorful array of bracelets and clip-on earrings near a framed black-and-white headshot of a younger Warren Beatty. Now pointy black patent-leather flats, red and black gloves, a black Victorian ribbon collar wrapped several times around her neck. Finally, a splash of bright red lipstick followed by the piece de resistance: a tiered, black felt hat with accordion pleats with two red tassels hanging from the top.
"I love playing dress up. For me, it's play and pleasure and my life is so blessed because of it," she says. "I get a lot of attention and people love me for it."
At 62, Salamon is part of a movement "of a certain age," yes, but not aging like its parents.
On the streets of New York, in fashion blogs from around the country and even in ad campaigns, women like Salamon are finding a new audience for their sartorial choices, and their belief that youth is not necessarily beauty: This is about personal style, not fashion or trends, and these are not the years to fade into sweatpants and muumuus. It's the time to be noticed, and not for looking young.
Whether Salamon is substitute-teaching public school kids, treasure-hunting in a thrift store or performing her one-woman show, she dresses to be seen. She bikes to most appointments on her busy calendar and boasts that she can walk into any bathroom or hotel in the world, no questions asked, because of the way she looks. People routinely snap her photo on the street; she keeps a scrapbook of her appearances in New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham's "On the Street" feature.
People like Salamon are challenging the notion that they have nothing more to offer the world in their advanced age by dressing in a way that brings them joy and elicits positive reaction from others. It's a way for them to defy stereotypes about aging while coming to terms with their own mortality.
"Women at a certain age become invisible and by dressing this way I'm not invisible," says Salamon, whose parents worked as a tailor and dressmaker. "If anything, my style just got more pronounced as I grew to know myself better and better. I make fewer mistakes now that I am at this age and know myself and what looks good on me and what I like."

Yes, a lucky few age with grace and style in the age of movies and magazines that feature pretty young things with smooth skin and shapeless figures. Magazines like Vogue and Harper's Bazaar put out occasional "Ageless Style" features, but even those salvos can be patronizing as far as some aging fashionistas are concerned.
Overheard on CNN.com: Readers weigh in on stylish seniors
It's nice to see actors older than 40, but it's always the same cast of characters: Kristin Scott Thomas, Susan Sarandon, Julianne Moore. And who, apart from other celebrities, can relate to them anyway?
"What they show in magazines doesn't make sense and it's not realistic," said Valerie, half the duo that runs the Idiosyncratic Fashionistas blog. "That's what they look like on red carpet, but what does a 60-year-old look like going to the supermarket?"
Online, older women with some tech savvy have created a place to share their favorite hats, latest thrift store finds and wearable shoes that aren't branded with the words "easy" or "ortho."
The baby boomer gal pals known as the Idiosyncratic Fashionistas said they started the blog because of the positive feedback they got from friends, family and strangers whose jaws dropped when they saw the pair in patterned shifts and multidimensional hats.
Valerie and Jean (they go by first names to keep professional and private lives separate) met through Salamon at a New York vintage market in 2008. Now, they finish each other's sentences and dress to complement each other at museums, fashion shows and meetups with friends, including some they met through the blog.
"'Growing old gracefully' is an outdated concept," their blog proclaims, "we prefer 'growing old with verve.'"

During a recent Sunday brunch on a patio in the East Village, they dressed in designer vintage, thrift store and sample sale finds with jewelry courtesy of Bakelite and Pylones. A young woman sitting at the next table asked to take their picture for her blog. "You're what makes New York great," another young admirer told them.
"We do have this critical mass thing going when it's both of us, like we're more approachable when we're together. People confess things to us, they say they could never dress like that," Jean said between nibbles from a fruit plate.
"We tell them, why not? You're not hurting anyone," Valerie interjected.
"Our approach is positive. We're trying to build up our compadres to encourage them to be more out there in the world," Jean continued. "We hate the word 'empower' but that's kind of it. Life is too short to worry about what people are going to think of you."
Photojournalist Ari Seth Cohen documents street style of people older than 50 on his blog, Advanced Style. His subjects include 100-year-old Ruth Kobin, who attributes her vitality to weekly pilates, and 81-year-old dancer Jacquie "Tajah" Murdock, who once worked as a typist by day and Apollo chorus girl by night.
"A lot of women are scared of aging so I wanted to present images of women who feel better as they age," the 30-year-old photojournalist said. "It starts with style, but once you start talking about style, the discussion turns to lifestyle and how to live life to the fullest."
Since its launch in 2008, the blog has led to a book, which goes on sale May 22 with a foreword by Dita Von Teese, and a documentary film. It has also made Cohen a quasi-expert on "aging stylishly," someone who is sought after by journalists, filmmakers and everyday people for perspective on aging and access to the Advanced Style muses.
Appearances in the blog have led some women to modeling gigs for a variety of brands, from K-Mart to cane maker OMHU. In the past two years, they've made the rounds on morning talk shows and appeared in articles with headlines about "fearless, fashionable 'glam-mas.'"
Cohen launched the blog as an homage to his stylish late grandmother and his "best friend." He's forged relationships with the women who appear on Advanced Style, accompanying them to social events, collaborating on projects or just dropping by for tea and counsel.
It's not just about dressing outlandishly, although a distinct look helps anybody stand out on the streets of New York, Cohen said. It's more about how they carry themselves and the aura they project.
"All the women I come across -- and some men -- share this confidence and inner peace with who they are," he said. "Many of them will tell you they never felt as good about themselves as they do now, and for them, style is just one thing that keeps them going."
The fashion and beauty industry is starting to notice them, too. The baby boomers are getting into their 60s, and have a game-changing reputation and money to spend. High fashion and the beauty industry have tipped their hat to women older than 50 in recent years with campaigns such as Lauren Hutton for Alexis Bittar jewelry and Gitte Lee for French apparel brand Celine. MAC Cosmetics launched a collaboration with 92-year-old fashion icon Iris Apfel, perhaps the style movement's best-known representative.
"People get bored seeing the same thing all the time and big luxury brands are trying to push the envelope from an artistic standpoint," said Zan Ludlum, a casting director who has seen modeling opportunities for women on Cohen's blog. "They're using them to raise the point of conversation that these women are beautiful and worth being celebrated."
It's a risk not all brands will take, Ludlum said. But when an older woman arrives for a shoot, the bustle of the room stands still for her.
"Everyone is quiet and interested in hearing what they have to say," she said. "The biggest art director in the world takes a step back from the rush, the machine quiets and everyone's just like 'Wow, we're so lucky to be in this amazing woman's presence.'"
It's a feeling 24-year-old Brianna Hurley knows well. In some ways, she feels like she has acquired a life's worth of wisdom through her work at Off Broadway Boutique with owner Lynn Dell, New York's self-styled "countess of glamour."

It's a message that's starting to resonate with some of her peers, she said, as her generation embraces the idea of style as personal and unique instead of simply something you follow.
"It's about the freedom to dress and wear what you want, and that's what Lynn and these women are all about," she said. "It starts from style but it flows into all aspects of their lives. They've taught me to take care of myself and be kind to people, with simple things like saying hello and treating people with respect."
"It's humanity at its most dramatic," Hurley said. "These women go through a lot, deaths, illnesses, personal health, but they're classy about how they deal with it."
For many, that's where blogs come in, as a means of working through the kinks of aging within the framework of style. After 33 years together, Judith Boyd's husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer in 2005. Throughout the stress of Nelson's treatment, Boyd realized that piecing together outfits seemed to help her and her husband.
"He loved it when I walked out the door dressed to the nines," Boyd said in a recent phone interview from her home in Denver, Colorado.
She launched her blog, Style Crone, in 2010 inspired in part by Advanced Style. It began with a series of photographs that were part of the couple's ritual during her husband's treatment.
"Nelson would take a picture of my chemo outfit as we were waiting and I would blog as he was receiving chemo," the retired psychiatric nurse said. "It was a way to lighten the experience and to talk about it."
Nelson died in 2011, and her grief poured into her clothes and onto her blog. In a post titled "The Color of Grief," she wrote how disoriented and confused she was three months after her husband's death; she couldn't even choose an outfit.
"It's been healing for me to continue to express myself during my husband's illness and death and during the grieving process," she said. "The feedback I get from friends and followers on the blog also helps get me through. We hold each other up."
In her lighter moments, there's her biannual "hat room transition," in which she takes out her spring and summer hats and tucks away those for fall and winter. She wore a lilac-print dress and a felt hat, a little spring, a little winter.
"In the middle of the hat room transition, in the middle of the seasonal transition, in the middle of the [Style Crone's] transition," she wrote, "an outfit of transition was created with the inspiration of lilacs."
The realities of age aren't lost on these women. They've had time to grow up, to experience life's emotional extremes and still wake up the next day. Those twists and turns have not only infused their personality but also the way they dress and see themselves as they age.
"After my 50th birthday, I saw a picture of myself and it startled me, the wrinkles in my face," said Salamon.
"In that moment the reality of my age became apparent. Do I love my wrinkles? No. But I don't dwell on them. I look at my smile, my neck, my shoulders, other parts that are beautiful."
Judgments around ageism are part of why the Idiosyncratic Fashionistas prefer to conceal their last names and their actual ages. Both have full-time jobs and don't want the "frivolity" of their extracurricular activities to undermine their professionalism.
"If I didn't work for a living I wouldn't care," Valerie said. "I'll never be a spring chicken again and I'm fine with that. I just wish all these things weren't attached."

For some women, society's renewed fascination with aging gracefully has given them a new starring role, their last chance to leave an impression on the world.
"I'm amazed at how in this late stage I'm getting all this attention," 92-year-old Ilona Royce-Smithkin said.
Royce-Smithkin was interesting before she met Cohen on the street two years ago. She spent most of the 20th century as an acclaimed painter with illustrious subjects such as Tennessee Williams and Ayn Rand. But it wasn't until the last five years that she truly came into her own and became comfortable with herself, she says.
"I'm no longer a little mouse," she said. "I'm much more into fashion now, I can dare to be extravagant."
For the last decade, she has been wooing audiences in Provincetown, Massachusetts, with songs by Edith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich in her annual "Eyelash Cabaret."
The attention she's earned as an Advanced Style muse has further catapulted her into the limelight, she says. Through the blog, she earned a modeling gig for a cane company and numerous admirers who call her for the secret to vitality at 92. There's also a fair bit of interest in her fake eyelashes, which she makes from her own red hair (daily cleanings are part of maintenance).
A small woman with a sweet accent that recalls her eastern European youth, she says she has become more aware of colors with age and is willing to take greater risks. A silver coiled letter organizer crawls up her wrist in a nod to her habit of "rescuing clothes." She has created scarves from umbrellas and a jacket out of a teddy bear. To her, it's all part of being true to herself and waking up each day with a smile.
She finds beauty in small things, like a tree dancing in the wind outside the window of her tiny West Village apartment, where she has lived for 58 years.
"Young people are too quickly in older life, they have no childhood. It's like speeding up strawberries to grow," she said. "They look great, but there's no taste."
In the case of some women, it can take a lifetime to figure out who you are. But if you're lucky, you'll make it to 100, like Ruth Kobin.
Her style hasn't changed much over the years, she said, but it's just as important now as ever to look classy and elegant. Even when she was in the hospital in early April for stitches on her arm, she always wore lipstick to give her face some color: "you never know who you'll run into."
A former stage actress who appeared in Hollywood movies in the 1940s, she never grew into the idea of pants or blue jeans and hates to see women in bare legs. She still favors a minimalist approach of buying quality goods that will last and gets rid of items that she hasn't woarn in two years.
To keep her mind sharp and her body fit, she relies on a steady routine of daily pilates and weekly private sessions. You're only as old as you feel, after all.
"As people get older they drift into a lassitude that certainly is not good," she said. "The older I get, I don't dwell on it."

Heavy precipitation expected from Texas to New England
By CNN Staff
updated 2:48 AM EST, Wed January 16, 2013
Water gushes from the Kentucky Dam near Paducah on Tuesday, January 15, 2013.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: More than 18 miles of interstate closed in one section on Louisiana
A stalled front brings snow, ice, heavy rain and possible flooding
Nearly 200 flights are canceled at Dallas airport
Parts of Mississippi are under a state of emergency
(CNN) -- A slew of weather warnings and watches extended Tuesday from northeastern Texas to southern Maine as a stalled frontal system threatened some areas with heavy snow and others with significant rain.
The National Weather Service said snow is likely in southern New England and the northern Mid-Atlantic states. Flash floods are possible in parts of the Southeast.
Traveling conditions in several states have already become precarious.
More than 170 departing flights from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were canceled due to freezing rain at destinations throughout the South.

In Louisiana, police in DeSoto Parish had responded to at least 20 incidents, many on Interstate 49. Lt. Donnie Barber of the sheriff's office said there were no reports of life-threatening injuries.
According to the Louisiana Transportation Department, more than 18 miles of Interstate 220 near Shreveport were closed.
Many bridges in northern Mississippi were iced over, said Brett Carr, a spokesman with that state's emergency management agency.
Carr added that several hundred power customers in Greenville, near the Mississippi River, were in the dark.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency "for all counties impacted by the freezing rain, flooding and severe weather."
Tennessee also has issued a state of emergency for areas affected by the weather.
The state's emergency operations center was calling in staff to monitor power outages and assist counties with roadways, said Dean Flener, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
The state of emergency allows local governments to call on aid from the state.
The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was taking the unusual flood-prevention measure of spilling 1.5 million gallons of water per second through the Kentucky Dam near Paducah from the Tennessee River into the Ohio River. The dam usually puts out 400,000 gallons per second, a spokesman said.
CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
It's the 35th anniversary of Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking "Rumours"
A special anniversary reissue of "Rumours" is now available
In April, the group will tour for the first time in three years
(CNN) -- It's 35 years after the release of Fleetwood Mac's groundbreaking album "Rumours," and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are holding hands.
Maybe it's true that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it's a put-on, knowing that fans are still intrigued by the complicated interpersonal drama that drives the band.
"Rumours" gave listeners a voyeuristic peek into the messy romantic lives of the quintet. "Go Your Own Way" was Buckingham's anguished kiss-off to Nicks. "Don't Stop" was Christine McVie's song of encouragement to her soon-to-be ex-husband, John McVie.
A special anniversary reissue of "Rumours" is now available, with expanded and deluxe versions featuring previously unreleased demos and early takes, along with a dozen live recordings from the group's 1977 world tour.
At 35, still the 'perfect album'
In April, Nicks and Buckingham will join drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie for their first tour in three years. In addition to their arsenal of beloved hits, they're hoping to crowd-test three newly recorded tracks.
"We have two brand new songs and one really, really old song," Nicks said.
The "old" tune predates Fleetwood Mac: an unreleased nugget written for the "Buckingham Nicks" LP, which marks its 40th anniversary this year.
The two "new" tracks were penned by Buckingham. Last year, he went into the studio with Fleetwood and McVie to record eight songs they hoped would become the catalyst for a new Fleetwood Mac album. But Nicks had reservations.
"We really didn't want to rent a house for a year and then make a whole record with 13, 14, 15 songs on it, then have most of the people who are thinking about buying it buy one song," she explained. "So we did the three songs, and we'll see how the world reacts to that. If they love those three songs, then maybe they might talk us into doing something else."
Maybe Nicks and Buckingham's hand-holding isn't for the cameras. Maybe it's to remind each other that despite their differences, they remain personally supportive and unified in their commitment to the juggernaut that is Fleetwood Mac -- even if it means playing mostly vintage hits for their upcoming tour.
"That's okay," Buckingham conceded. "That's part and parcel with what we do."
"We laugh," added Nicks, "but (the classics are) why we all have a beautiful house."

Looking for transformation in Myanmar
By Hilary Whiteman, CNN
updated 3:58 AM EDT, Thu June 6, 2013
Traders in Bogalay Market in Yangon, Myanmar. Click on the circles to see what they say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two years ago, Myanmar started unraveling decades of military rule
President Thein Sein vows to free all political prisoners
Despite reforms, locals are not convinced of change
Naypyidaw, Myanmar (CNN) -- Around seven years ago, a sparse tract of land north of the cluttered chaos of Yangon was anointed Myanmar's new capital by the country's former military leaders.
Buildings were hastily erected in the new city of Naypyidaw to cater to an influx of arrivals, and later dozens of hotels moved in to meet demand for foreign visitors. These hotels sit one after the other on the sides of an eight-lane highway lined with newly planted trees.
They are all but full this week as more than 900 guests bed down for two days of talks around the typically wordy World Economic Forum theme of "Courageous Transformation for Inclusion and Integration."
Two years ago, the world watched with a mixture of skepticism and awe as President Thein Sein took office and set about unraveling decades of oppressive military rule.
Coke investing in transformed Myanmar Myanmar: A revolution in progress
Ethnic violence threatening Myanmar?
Myanmar's business boom On Tuesday in a national radio address, the Burmese president took another step forward by announcing the imminent release of all political prisoners.
Since taking power in 2010, Thein Sein has freed dozens of prisoners of conscience, but activists have been pushing for the release of around 200 more.
According to state run newspaper, the New Light of Myanmar, Thein Sein said the prisoner release scheme was executed "with the sheer intention of forging national reconciliation," adding that political gain was not the government's motive.
Thein Sein's efforts to rectify the wrongs of the past have scored him political points with foreign leaders and investors, however not all locals are convinced that the country's transformation is doing anything for them.
Early Tuesday morning in the busy Bogalay Market in downtown Yangon, traders told CNN that they had seen little change.
Change in Myanmar: The market view
Win Shwe stood in a long coat at the market entrance, raising his hand every now and then as if to bless passersby. The 72-year-old was begging for a note or two of the local currency, the kyat. The typically dirty, crumpled notes are worth about 940 to one U.S. dollar. Two hundred kyat gets you a ride on a crowded bus. More buys a decent meal.
"This is a transformation time. But for poor people, nothing's changed. The government mechanism is corruption," he said, dropping his hand rolled cigarette onto the floor.
Nearby, Khin Than Win, 52, sits with her daughter Yin Yin Htay at their flower stall. "I agree that this is a transformation time," she says. "But I see that the streets and the roads are wider than before. That's the only change."
Thein Sein said Tuesday that the country's transition from military rule to democracy will take time.

Economic potential in Myanmar
"As the task is huge, there have been tangible changes rather than vivid changes. When there are vivid changes, our national economy will make progress with momentum," he said.
There are fears though that any progress in the national economy hinges on the country's ability to dampen ethnic tensions that have recently flared in northern parts of the country.
At least 50 people have been arrested after rioting in Lashio, which erupted last week after a Buddhist woman was allegedly doused in petrol and set alight, according to the Myanmar Times.
A mosque, Islamic school and hundreds of houses and businesses owned by Muslims were torched before the government imposed martial law and sent in troops.
It follows the murder of Muslim children and teachers in Meiktila by an angry mob in March.
The government has achieved some success in negotiating peace with ethnic rebels around the country, most recently signing a seven-point agreement in Kachin State, but the religious violence is relatively new and poses additional problems for the country's leaders.
On Thursday, Thein Sein officially opened the World Economic Forum in Naypyidaw to an audience eager for assurance that problems can be resolved.
Myanmar is due to assume the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) next year, giving it once more a leading role in the region after decades in the dark.
Over the past two years, most sanctions have slowly lifted and the shroud of fear that kept locals from talking has slipped away.
Money has poured in as foreign investors spied the rare opportunity to enter a market long deprived of choice and, in many cases, basic public services.
This week, U.S. beverage giant Coca-Cola made its move, opening a bottling plant to meet demand with a local source almost 60 years after it pulled out.
"This is a market of 60 plus million consumers just embarking on a journey to join the world community if you like. In a way the same excitement when we saw the Berlin Wall came down," CEO Muhtar Kent told CNN.
Excitement over the possibility of new growth is being tempered by very real concerns as the country works to repair years of neglect, cronyism and the deep mistrust of its people.

Why do more people die at Christmas, New Year's?
By Jen Christensen, CNN
updated 9:32 PM EST, Mon December 23, 2013
You have more of a chance of dying at the holidays than at any other time of the year.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CDC: Natural deaths spike on Christmas, the day after and New Year's
People who work with death have noticed the phenomenon for years
People who delay treatment and holiday hospital staffing may be to blame
Despite popular belief, the suicide rate doesn't spike at the holidays
(CNN) -- There are many well-known risk factors for death -- high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and Christmas.
Yes, Christmas.
Several studies show you have a greater chance of dying on Christmas, the day after Christmas or New Year's Day than any other single day of the year.
This is true for people who die of natural causes, which account for 93% of all deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
It's also true, researchers say, for people who die of the five most common diseases: circulatory problems, respiratory diseases, endocrine/nutritional/metabolic problems, digestive diseases and cancer.
There's a spike in deaths for all age groups on those days with one exception -- children.
David P. Phillips who was the lead author on a couple of these studies, noticed this trend when studying U.S. death certificates.
Specifically, Phillips, a professor in the sociology department at UC San Diego, and his team looked at the number of people who died in emergency settings and those who were considered dead on arrival between 1979 and 2004. They found a spike in deaths on those three days.
An earlier Phillips study from 2004 found a similar trend, specifically in cardiac deaths.
A more recent 2013 study in Britain found patients admitted to hospitals as emergencies on public holidays are significantly more likely to die than those admitted on other days of the week -- including weekends.
What do people die from during the holidays?
Studies show deaths spike on Christmas Day, the day after Christmas and New Year's Day.
What are people dying from?
-- Natural causes
-- Circulatory problems
-- Respiratory diseases
-- Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic problems
-- Digestive diseases
-- Cancer
Scientists still can't explain this phenomenon, although there are plenty of popular theories.
Andrew Meacham is the obituary writer at the Tampa Bay Times and president of the Society of Professional Obituary Writers. Over the years he has noticed his workload pick up over the holidays.
"We are always getting a slew of obits this time of year," Meacham said. "I noticed this happened pretty regularly so I did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too."
He wondered if stress or sadness had something to do with it.
"I've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hour or days or weeks or months. To me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here."
Phillips and his team looked at the number of deaths among the Alzheimer's population, theorizing they may be less aware of the holidays and the stress it can trigger.
If stress were solely to blame, he figured, their deaths wouldn't spike on Christmas or New Year's. But sure enough, he found cardiac deaths were slightly higher at the holidays when Alzheimer's was listed as a secondary cause of death.
More people do die in winter months than in any other season, so Phillips looked to see if there were more deaths in the states that experience colder temperatures.
That wasn't the case, either. The cardiac mortality peak is slightly smaller in the states that border Canada, compared to states that border the Gulf of Mexico, he found.
What about festive eating or drinking? Phillips' team found deaths were still up for people who were in inpatient treatment -- whose diet and alcohol consumption was strictly regulated. In fact, those who died with substance abuse listed as a secondary cause of death saw a smaller holiday peak than those who died from cardiac diseases alone.
Despite popular belief, the suicide rate doesn't spike at the holidays. In fact, the suicide rate in December is at its lowest -- it peaks in spring and fall. The homicide rate also goes down for the holidays.
Phillips thinks the true reason that Christmas and New Year's are a risk factor for death may actually have much more to do with access to care.
People who aren't feeling well may be putting off a trip to the hospital so they can stay with their family to celebrate Christmas or New Year's, he said.
Holiday staffing at the hospital may also be to blame, he said, citing statistics from Level 1 trauma centers.
"For those deaths, the spike was even sharper," Phillips said. "Those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff."
He said he hopes his research could help hospitals and patients plan accordingly.
If the worst does happen, resources are available.
For instance, Stephanie Kohler, family services coordinator at the nonprofit Lory's Place in St. Joseph, Michigan, said she and her staff are prepared to help families find a healthy way to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one.
"We want to make sure we are ready for any phone calls to make sure people are all right in their grief," Kohler said. "The holidays definitely are a harder time of year for people when this happens, especially since they are such a time steeped in tradition and family."
If you know someone who loses a loved one over the holiday, Kohler said be sure to be extra sensitive to their emotions.
"Everything can feel upside down for people. There are emotional landmines everywhere, so don't try to force anything," Kohler said. "You don't need to fill the air with words. Tell them you are ready to listen. That can be more powerful than you know."

WAR UPDATE
BATTLEFIELD
GROUND WAR
• Two more top Iraqis captured: The U.S. military announced it has taken another leader of Saddam Hussein's regime into custody. Humam Abd al-Khaliq Abd Al-Gafar, who served as minister of higher education and scientific research, was taken into custody Saturday, U.S. Central Command said Sunday. He was No. 54 on the U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis. Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Jamal Mustafa Abdallah Sultan al Tikriti, also was handed over to U.S. officials, according to a spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress, which arranged for the surrender. Full Story
• Future bases: The Bush administration wants ongoing access to military bases in Iraq, a U.S. senior military official told CNN Sunday, but also acknowledged that any access agreement would have to be negotiated with a whatever government emerges there. The story, first reported in The New York Times, is part of a larger expected administration and Pentagon review of future U.S. military presence in the region, the official said.
• Marines leave Baghdad: U.S. Marines pulled out of Baghdad Sunday, leaving it in the hands of the U.S. Army which is working with Iraqi police to try to bring order to the still chaotic capital. Full Story
• Fewer casualties: As the fighting winds down, U.S.-led coalition deaths so far in this war with Iraq are far fewer than those killed in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. At least 159 U.S. and British troops have died in the war, less than half the 358 coalition deaths in Desert Storm. Full Story | List of coalition fatalities

AIR WAR
• Stealth pilots: The pilots of the two U.S. Air Force F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters who flew the first strike mission of the war in Iraq, targeting a leadership compound in Baghdad, each had to overcome on-board malfunctions, the Air Force revealed Sunday. The information came to light in a press release announcing the pilots had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for performing the mission. The strike on the night of March 19 (the morning of March 20 in Iraq) had been described as hitting a "target of opportunity" -- a leadership compound where the United States had intelligence that Saddam Hussein might be hiding. 3D model: F-117
CASUALTIES
• Coalition: 159 coalition deaths reported, including 128 U.S. troops and 31 British soldiers and marines.
List of coalition fatalities
• Wounded: At least 495 U.S. service members have been wounded. No numbers are available for British forces.
• Iraq: Iraq has not released details of military casualties. U.S. military officials have reported thousands of Iraqi military deaths. Abu Dhabi TV, quoting official Iraqi sources, reported that 1,252 Iraqi civilians have been killed and 5,103 wounded. CNN cannot verify those figures.
POWs/MIAs
• Missing or captured: Two U.S. service members remain listed as missing in action.
Coalition POWs/MIAs
• Former POWS: Seven U.S. soldiers waved and smiled Friday from a balcony at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, their first official appearance since U.S. Marines rescued them from Iraqi guards who held them as prisoners of war for three weeks.
• Iraqi POWs: U.S. and British forces have released 887 prisoners of war since the beginning of the war because they were determined to be non-combatants, Pentagon officials said Friday. Roughly 6,800 Iraqi soldiers remain in coalition custody, according to U.S. Central Command.
