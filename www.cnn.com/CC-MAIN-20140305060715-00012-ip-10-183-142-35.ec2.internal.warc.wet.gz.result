(CNN) -- Democratic challenger John Barrow beat Republican Rep. Max Burns in the race for Georgia's 12th District seat, according to CNN projections. Burns, 45, a former Screven County Commission Chairman who serves on the House committees -- Agriculture, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Education and the Workforce -- was elected in 2002 but faced a difficult time earning re-election against Clarke County Commissioner John Barrow, 49.The race, which had been relatively calm for much of the summer and early fall, ended with a bang, as both candidates engaged in sharp rhetoric by early October.In their last debate, Burns and Barrow fired unfriendly salvos, illustrating the intensity of the race heading down the stretch. Barrow attacked Burns for supporting a national sales tax, which the Democrat said would raise taxes on the middle class while giving big business a break."He gets an A-plus on the big-business-friendly test. In fact, he's the teacher's pet," said Barrow, who was attacked in a Republican-funded TV ad for flunking a scorecard by his own Chamber of Commerce.Meanwhile, Burns accused his opponent of "dodging the issue" on same-sex marriage, a topic that was on the Georgia ballot November 2."It has been an issue he will not come out and be direct on," said Burns, who favored both the state and federal bans. "He's dodging the issue."Barrow and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did their best to portray Burns as a lackey for national Republicans, pointing to his votes for "foreign trade deals" and his opposition to drug re-importation.Burns retaliated by attempting to label Barrow a "liberal trial lawyer" and culturally out of step with this sprawling Eastern Georgia district.The district, which stretches from Athens to Augusta to Savannah, is 40 percent black. Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore garnered 54 percent of the vote there in 2000. But Democrats remained uneasy throughout the race, never releasing any polling data from the district, a sign that Burns' support may have been a little stronger than they expected.

Lawyer questions police version of raid that killed girlBy the CNN Wire Staff Aiyana Jones was shot and killed by police executing a search warrant, according to officials. STORY HIGHLIGHTSAttorney for family of girl killed in police raid says he has video footage of raidCrew from A&E network was filming for "The First 48," lawyer says 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley Jones died from bullet wound during the raid Police say officer's weapon fired after an encounter with an adult in the house (CNN) -- An attorney representing the family of a 7-year-old girl shot to death Sunday in a police raid is accusing the Detroit Police Department of misrepresenting the incident. In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV on Monday, Michigan attorney Geoffrey Fieger said he obtained video footage of the incident captured by a crew filming for the A&E network show, "The First 48." Fieger, who didn't say how he received the tape, said it shows officers rushing the home and throwing a flash grenade through a window before one officer fires into the home from the front porch. However, according to Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee, preliminary information indicates that members of the Detroit Police Special Response Team approached the house and announced themselves as police. Godbee cited the officers involved and at least one independent witness. Godbee said officers used a "flash bang" device, entered the home and encountered a 46-year-old female inside the front room. "Exactly what happened next is a matter still under investigation, but it appears the officer and the woman had some level of physical contact," Godbee said in a statement Sunday. "At about this time, the officer's weapon discharged one round which, tragically, struck 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley Jones in the neck/head area." Police were executing a search warrant in the search for the suspect in a shooting Friday that killed a high school student. Video: 7-year-old killed in Detroit police raid

Godbee said the 34-year-old suspect was found and arrested at the home where the girl was shot. In addition, a vehicle and a moped matching the descriptions of those involved in the shooting of 17-year-old Jarean Blake were also found, he said. Fieger called the explanation from police "entirely false." "Of course, I have seen the videotape and the videotape vividly portrays the fact that a percussion grenade device was thrown through the front window and a shot was fired immediately from the outside from the porch," he said. "No murder suspect was found in Aiyana's house," Fieger said in Monday's interview. "In fact, there's an upstairs apartment next door which the police did not have a search warrant for and that is where he surrendered, they went into that house too. But he was not in Aiyana's house." Aiyana's father, Charles Jones, also has denied that the suspect was in his home. Detroit police spokesman Phillip Cook told reporters Monday that he was not aware of the video and declined to comment. The investigation, he said, has been taken over by state police to preserve the "community's trust." A source at A&E, who asked not to be identified citing company policy, confirmed that a crew was on the scene and that the footage was confiscated by police. He would not comment on what the crew had captured on video. Another police spokesman said the department would not identify the suspect in Blake's shooting death until he has been formally charged by prosecutors. The suspect remains in custody. Godbee, in his statement Sunday, said he wished to "express to the family of Aiyana Jones the profound sorrow that we feel within the Detroit Police Department and throughout this community. We know that no words can do anything to take away the pain you are feeling at this time." Police obtained the "high-risk search warrant" based on intelligence, and it was approved by the prosecutor and a magistrate, Godbee said. "Because of the ruthless and violent nature of the suspect in this case, it was determined that it would be in the best interest of public safety to execute the search warrant as soon as possible and detain the suspect ... while we sought a murder warrant."

First trailer: Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing Lincoln' with Tom Hanks By James Hibberd, EW
updated 3:22 PM EST, Thu January 3, 2013
Tom Hanks narrates National Geographic Channels "Killing Lincoln."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Killing Lincoln" covers ground not included in the recent Spielberg film
It's National Geographic Channel's first scripted drama
"Killing Lincoln" is produced by Ridley and Tony Scott
(EW.com) -- National Geographic Channel's new film "Killing Lincoln" explores a key part of the 16th president's story that Steven Spielberg's big screen hit largely passed over.
Based on Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's bestselling book, Killing Lincoln chronicles the final days of President Lincoln (Billy Campbell) and the plot by his assassin John Wilkes Booth (Jesse Johnson). Below is the first trailer for the movie, which debuts next month.
"Killing Lincoln" spends time portraying both men as it builds toward, as narrator Tom Hanks puts it, "the most resonant crime in the history of the nation," and then chronicles the extensive manhunt to bring Booth to justice. The show's auspices are quite impressive. In addition to Hanks, Killing Lincoln is produced by Ridley and Tony Scott (the latter having joined the production before his death last year) and is directed by Adrian Moat (Gettysburg). "This is really the Lincoln story you've never seen before," Ridley Scott says.
"Killing Lincoln" marks Nat Geo's first scripted drama. Here's the debut preview. There's a couple brief interview snippets with the actors and producers, but the home stretch of the two-minute video is a theatrical-style trailer.
Below, some previously released quotes from Johnson and Campbell about their performances:
"The prevailing image of Booth is one of a two-dimensional, mustache-twirling villain," Johnson says. "My job was to dig deeper. Show that he was as complex as a Shakespearean character he portrayed on the stage. Demonstrate the artistry, obsession and Southern rigor as well as the virulent disdain for an 'inferior' president that culminated into his own bloody, one-act play."
Adds Campbell: "Lincoln is so adored, so universally revered today that it's easy to forget he was a controversial president — one with many enemies — in fact he repeatedly dreamt of his own assassination. We felt it important to convey this hidden side of Lincoln, this sense of his almost wasting away with premonitions of death, even as he was outwardly so poised and steadfast through the closing of the war."

Transocean pleads guilty, fined 2nd-biggest penalty for Gulf spill
By Michael Martinez, CNN
updated 4:32 PM EST, Thu February 14, 2013
Workers clean a beach in South Pass, Louisiana, in May 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Transocean Deepwater Inc. will pay $400 million and other penalties
Company pleads guilty to criminal conduct in violating the Clean Water Act
Transocean also receives five years of probation, the maximum under law
11 workers were killed and 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled in 2010 disaster
(CNN) -- Transocean Deepwater Inc. will pay the second-largest environmental fine in U.S. history for its role in the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Justice Department said Thursday.
The company was sentenced to pay $400 million and other penalties after it pleaded guilty in a Louisiana federal court Thursday to violating the Clean Water Act by its illegal conduct leading to the disaster, Attorney General Eric Holder said.
Eleven workers were killed when the Transocean oil rig exploded. The blast and ensuing fire damaged the rig, causing 4.9 million barrels of oil to spill into the Gulf, according to a 2011 report by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
The nation's largest environmental crime penalty was the $4 billion paid by BP Exploration and Production Inc. for its role in the disaster, federal authorities said. BP contracted Transocean to do the drilling and had BP officials on the rig.

"Transocean's guilty plea and sentencing are the latest steps in the department's ongoing efforts to seek justice on behalf of the victims of the Deepwater Horizon disaster," said Holder.
Most of the $400 million will be used to restore and rebuild the Gulf coast region, authorities said.
"The Deepwater Horizon explosion was a senseless tragedy that could have been avoided," Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said in a statement. "With today's guilty plea, BP and Transocean have now both been held criminally accountable for their roles in this disaster."
U.S. District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo of the Eastern District of Louisiana accepted Transocean's guilty plea, which it agreed to in a deal with the government in January.
In its plea, Transocean admitted that its crew on the Deepwater Horizon rig was acting at the direction of BP's well site leaders and were "negligent in failing to investigate fully clear indications that the Macondo well was not secure and that oil and gas were flowing into the well," the Justice Department said.
The Macondo well was the source of the oil spill.
Under the plea agreement, Transocean was also sentenced to five years of probation, the maximum term of probation under law, the Justice Department said.
A separate proposal for a civil consent decree is pending before U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier of the Eastern District of Louisiana, and that proposal would impose a record $1 billion civil Clean Water Act penalty, the Justice Department said.

Gottfried: Jonathan Winters was mad brilliant
By Gilbert Gottfried, Special to CNN
updated 8:38 PM EDT, Fri April 12, 2013
Comedian Jonathan Winters died on Thursday, April 11, at his Montecito, California, home, a business associate told CNN. He was 87. Winters appears here on "The Jonathan Winters Show" in 1956. Click to see more pictures of the man known for his comic irreverence:
Winters attends the TV Land Awards in 2008. Over the years his appearances on various TV shows made him a beloved figure in the entertainment world. Other comedians hailed him as a "genius."
Mickey Rooney, left, and Marvin Kaplan join Winters for a July 2012 screening of "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" in Beverly Hills, California. Winters stood out in Stanley Kramer's 1963 comedy all-star film as a truck driver who destroys a gas station.
Karen Kramer, the widow of director Stanley Kramer, and her daughter Kat Kramer embrace Winters at the TV Land Awards in 2008. The late filmmaker helped revive Winters' career after illness with "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
Robin Williams honors Winters on the TV Land Awards in 2008. Williams has often credited Winters as a big influence. They starred together on the sitcom "Mork & Mindy."
Winters celebrates turning 80 at an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences event in December 2005. Winters, who never had a breakout role, appeared in the 1967 film "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad."
Winters, here circa 1960, started out in nightclubs before becoming popular on television, especially in his appearances on "The Tonight Show."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gilbert Gottfried: Jonathan Winters' mental health struggle and creativity made him brilliant
He says like many comedians, such as Robin Williams, Winters' fearlessness influenced him
He says Winters spent much time alone as a child developing characters
When he met Winters, Gottfried spent hilarious time with him. He should be long remembered
Editor's note: Gilbert Gottfried is a comedian and actor. Follow him on Twitter @realgilbert. (CNN) -- Jonathan Winters was not always in his right mind. I don't mean that only in the showbiz sense, but in the mental health sense. Jonathan, who died Thursday, was a nut as a comic, but also manic depressive and was institutionalized at least once in his life. He was also brilliantly talented. And the combination of his mental troubles and amazing talent made him the legendary performer that he was. He recognized this himself, telling an NPR reporter in 2011, "I need that pain — whatever it is — to call upon it from time to time, no matter how bad it was."
That's a common concern for performers when they go into therapy or other treatment; ditto performers who give up drugs and alcohol. They worry: If I don't have that pain, where do I draw my creativity from?
Gilbert Gottfried
Jonathan needn't have worried. He was a bottomless well of creativity. He was someone who could pick up a paper clip and do three hours of impromptu comedy on it.
I was always a fan of the way he could work without a net. There was a fearless, just crazy attitude about him--of not caring, not being afraid -- that always appealed to me. He influenced me and many other comics.
When you watch Robin Williams, you can see a lot of Jonathan Winters. Robin is the first one to admit that; he worshiped Jonathan Winters. He insisted that Jonathan be written in as a regular on "Mork and Mindy." They wrote him in as an overgrown child, which was perfect casting.
It was natural that Jonathan would get into comedy. He was an only child with divorced parents, a father he said was alcoholic, and he had lots of time alone to make up voices and characters in his room. When Jonathan met his future wife, he had just lost his wristwatch, the story goes. He was upset about this. But then, his wife saw an ad for a talent contest where the first prize was, believe it or not, a wristwatch. She was certain he would win and he did. His career in comedy followed.

I've also heard that when his future wife, Eileen, told her father that she and Jonathan would get married, he gave them an ultimatum: that after a certain period, if Jonathan didn't make it in showbiz, he would have to get a real job to support her. Luckily, he went on to work in radio and later as a stand-up comedian in New York. He made it onto TV, appearing on Jack Paar and Steve Allen's shows and later was in films, like "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
He made comedy albums that won Grammys and eventually also won an Emmy for a sitcom, in 1991. One bit he did was "Jonathan's Attic" where he was put in a room with a bunch of odds and ends, props, wigs, etc., and he was left to his own devices. He always could pick up anything and turn it into comedy.
Comedian Jonathan Winters dies
1989: Jonathan Winters says 'goodnight'
Once I was appearing on a television show that Jonathan was appearing on, too. That was the first and only time, sadly, that I met him. He saw me, recognized me and invited me to come into his dressing room and sit down. He then started talking, no rhyme nor reason to any of it, but it was all funny. He would tell sad stories about his life and you'd start laughing. He told me, for example, that his father drilled it into his head to save his money and not fool around with women. "And now," he said, pointing to himself, "I have no money,"-- and then, pointing downward toward his crotch, "and Mr. Pencil doesn't work."
Every now and then, I would get tired and start drifting off. Jonathan would snap his fingers at me and go, "Come back Gilbert. Are you zoning out there?" And then immediately, he'd have me laughing again.
In a TV interview I saw not long ago, Cheech Marin spoke about how he lived near Jonathan Winters and would always see him in the supermarket. He'd be walking up and down the aisles, doing voices, shtick and talking to himself. Cheech would wait a little while, then go over to him and say, "Jonathan, I think it's time to just buy something and leave."
I found out about Jonathan Winters' death a day after it happened. That seems wrong. A talent like his should be more revered. The world knew about Kim Kardashian's divorce before she did. But Jonathan seems to have been forgotten. Well, I can only speak for myself, but I certainly will never forget him.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Some 3,000 flights canceled Friday after more than 2,600 cancellations Thursday
NEW: A man who fell through the ice in New Jersey is rescued, official says NEW: Weather service says system will bring "coldest air in 2 decades"
Some 140 million Americans will have temperatures of 0 or below, CNN estimates
Are you experiencing winter weather? Send your photos and video of ice, storms and snow to iReport. (CNN) -- In a few days, people in the Midwest and Northern Plains will have reason to be jealous of what their countrymen in the Northeast are going through now -- digging out from as much as 2 feet of snow, dealing with the effect of blizzard-level winds, and feeling the heat of below-zero temperatures.
Because as cold as it is now, it's practically tropical compared to what's coming.
Think lows in the -20s Fahrenheit across North Dakota and Minnesota, with wind chills of -50 or even more frigid, according to the National Weather Service.
Sunday night in Chicago will be a brisk minus 16 to 20, or 35 below to 45 below zero if you factor in the Windy City's wind.
Those at Lambeau Field for the Green Bay Packers vs. San Francisco 49ers NFL game may cheer against overtime, given that the wind chill may dip to 50 below in Wisconsin that night. As the weather service's Twin Cities, Minnesota, division warns, "Exposed flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes with wind chills colder than 50 below."
The same agency tweeted that this system will produce "the coldest air in two decades."
In fact, between Friday and Wednesday, nearly 140 million Americans -- nearly half the nation -- will experience temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or below, according to a CNN calculation.
As Packers head coach Mike McCarthy said Friday: "This is not the norm."
Northeast prepares as nor'easter looms
A frosty welcome for Bill de Blasio
Brutal snow storm bears down on U.S.
How cold is it in your town?
'The snow was absolutely insane'
It's not like those who braved the latest storm have it easy.
Just ask Ford Fischer. The CNN iReporter spent part of Friday trying to clear the driveway around his home in Boxford, Massachusetts, where the weather service said more snow -- 23.8 inches -- fell than in any other community hit by the Thursday-into-Friday nor'easter. Every time he finished a spot, he'd turn around and see it covered with snow again.
"The snow was absolutely insane," Fischer said, "and totally nonstop."
Even after the snow was done, he and others affected by this storm system were in for a tough few hours, thanks to the cold.
Temperatures in parts of New York City, where as much as 8 inches of snow fell, were predicted to drop to zero Friday night for the first time since January 1994. It was also set to dip below zero, with minus 17 wind chill, in Boston after nearly 18 inches of snow.
Fears of widespread power outages didn't come to bear, despite blizzard-level winds in some places. By 5 p.m. Wednesday, major utilities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England were reporting just over 1,100 outages, a far cry from a major nor'easter last February that knocked out electricity to more than 630,000 customers.
As happens with such weather, there was tragedy as well.
Three people died in car accidents in Pennsylvania -- including one man crushed as he was moving street salt with a forklift. Emergency management agency spokesman Cory Angell said these deaths were weather-related. In Byron, New York, a 71-year-old woman wandered away from her home Thursday night and was later found dead in the snow in a wooded area about 100 yards away, the Genesee County Sheriff's Office reported.
In Oakland, New Jersey, a calamity was averted when authorities rescued a 34-year-old man who fell through ice in Ringwood State Park as he tried to retrieve one of his snowshoes, said environmental protection department spokesman Larry Ragonese.
Air traffic delays abound
Then there were the thousands stuck at airports nationwide because of system-wide delays -- though at least they were suffering inside, not in the frigid cold.
FlightAware.com, which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems, said about 3,000 flights were canceled for Friday within, into or out of the United States. That's after more than 2,600 U.S. flights were canceled on Thursday.
Though the temperature in Las Vegas was 52 degrees -- above zero -- passengers there were also feeling the storm's sting. Long lines formed inside McCarran International Airport at the counters for Southwest Airlines, which had canceled many of its flights from Chicago. The airline carries 40% of the airport's passengers, according to Chris Hayes, an airport spokesman.
"We are doing everything possible to get back up and running as soon as possible," Southwest Airlines spokesman Dan Landson said on Friday afternoon.
Flights resumed by late Friday morning in much of New England, though delays were common, and ticket holders were urged to check with their airlines.
Barb Plooster had planned to fly Friday from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Grand Rapids, Michigan, but her flight was canceled. She told CNN affiliate WICU that she was on the phone with United Airlines for five hours trying to find a way to get home, but concluded she will have to wait until Monday. "We got a warm place to stay, get to visit the kids, the grandkids, so it's OK," she said.
Historically cold arctic air mass
This being winter, after all, there's more snow coming -- and perhaps more delays, more accidents, and more headaches.
One storm threatened to bring blizzard conditions to North Dakota as well as parts of South Dakota and Minnesota on Friday night and Saturday, the weather service said.
And cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Cincinnati -- the latter of which will play host to a Bengals vs. San Diego Chargers NFL football game -- could get hit with significant snow Sunday and Monday.
Some areas will get some reprieve as temperatures rise in the coming days. But they better not get too comfortable, as the temperatures will reverse course starting Sunday.
Parts of the Midwest could see temperatures not recorded in 15 to 20 years, and for a painful stretch. Chicago, for instance, could see subzero temperatures from Sunday evening until Wednesday.
Even areas as far south as Nashville, Tennessee, could be basking in zero-degree cold as the arctic air mass dives southward at the beginning of next week.
That's not just an inconvenience: That cold is dangerous. And it's why school will be canceled in places like Milwaukee and the entire state of Minnesota -- areas hardly unaccustomed to Old Man Winter's bite -- on Monday.
"I have made this decision to protect all our children from the dangerously cold temperatures," Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said in explaining his decision to call off classes statewide.
CNN's Rande Iaboni, Brandon Miller, Dave Hennen, Sherri Pugh, Lateef Mungin, Jareen Imam, Kristin Hamill, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.

White House Releases Documents On Gore Fund-raiser
Documents show Gore raised 'hard money' from the White House
WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, Sep. 3) -- Vice President Al Gore's office released a stack of documents Tuesday purporting to show he was unaware that an April 1996 event at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raiser.
The move came two days before the Senate committee investigating campaign fund-raising resumes its hearings, with a focus on Gore and the now-infamous fund-raiser at the Hsi Lai temple in suburban Los Angeles on April 29, 1996. That event, organized by former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, the elusive figure at the center of the controversy, raised about $140,000. Election law forbids fund-raisers at religious sites, and the vice president has maintained he was never informed that the temple event was more than what he termed "community outreach."
One of the documents, though, is a memo from Gore to his scheduler Kimberly Tilley which refers to two "fundraisers" scheduled for that day. In a March 15 e-mail where Gore discussed a New York invitation, the vice president told Tilley "If we have already booked the fundraisers, then we have to decline."
Though White House officials say Gore was referring to events that were later dropped from the schedule, the Senate committee, led by Tennessee Republican Fred Thompson, is expected to query Tilley or Gore's deputy chief of staff, David Strauss, about the discrepancies this week.
Poor communication?
If Gore didn't know the true nature of the event, the released materials -- which include memos, electronic messages and briefing papers -- suggest his close staff members were well aware.
An April 11 memo from Huang to Tilley describes the Hsi Lai temple event as a "Fundraising lunch for Vice President Gore." An April 24 e-mail from White House staffer John B. Emerson describes a "DNC funder for lunch."
Two documents from Harold Ickes, former White House deputy chief of staff, list Gore as attending a Los Angeles fund-raiser. One has the target amount as $250,000, the other $325,000. Gore's aides have previously said the vice president never saw those memos.
In releasing the documents, Gore's aides appear to be taking the offensive on what probably has been the vice president's greatest political embarrassment.
Gore raised hard money from his office
But the vice president's embarrassments may get worse before they get better, following revelations that at least $120,000 of $695,000 Gore raised over the phone from his White House office went into so-called "hard money" accounts at the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
White House officials insist Gore didn't know it was standard operating procedure for the DNC to use some of the so-called "soft money" he was raising from his controversial calls last year as hard money. Soft money is the unregulated and unrestricted sums that are used for general party building purposes, while hard money is federally restricted and can be used to help individual candidates.
The distinction is important because Attorney General Janet Reno has claimed that since Gore was only raising soft money there was no need to seek an independent counsel to investigate. It would be different, she has said, if he were raising hard money from the White House.
Gore's aides say he thought he was raising soft money but DNC officials say they routinely used some of the money raised during Gore's 46 phone calls as hard money, even though the donors themselves may have been unaware of where their money wound up.
Individuals can contribute $20,000 in hard money and the DNC says that if these individual donors had not yet "maxed out" their contributions, their practice was to use some of the soft money to do so.
