Rivals sign Zimbabwe power-share dealStory Highlights Zimbabwe's political rivals sign power-sharing deal Deal intended to end violent political crisis that has paralyzed the country Robert Mugabe to stay president while rival Morgan Tsvangirai becomes PMNext Article in World » Read VIDEO HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's political rivals set aside deep differences Monday to sign a power-sharing deal intended to end the violent crisis that has paralyzed the country since the disputed election in March. To jubilant cheers, longtime Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe shook hands with rival Morgan Tsvangirai at the ceremony. "Divisions, polarization and hatred belong to the past," Tsvangirai said after the deal was signed. "Let us not be divided by our past, but united by our hope for the future." Under the deal, Mugabe remains president, while Tsvangirai becomes prime minister and coordinator of government affairs. The leaders of the 14-member Southern African Development Community attended the signing of the agreement, which was brokered by South African leader Thabo Mbeki after months of protracted debate. Third party leader Arthur Mutambara will become deputy prime minister under the agreement which he called "a compromise document, flaws, warts and all." The leaders of the 14 member Southern African Development Community (SADC) attended the signing of the agreement, which was brokered by South African leader Thabo Mbeki after months of protracted debate. Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Mutambara joined hands with Mbeki after exchanging the signed papers, a remarkable scene just months after political violence spread across Zimbabwe in the wake of the disputed elections. Watch leaders join hands at signing ceremony » President Mugabe, the 84-year-old veteran leader of Zimbabwe since 1980, was also effusive in his talk of unity among former rivals. "We have to walk and walk the same route," Mugabe said. But Mugabe said Britain and the United States must keep out of Zimbabwe's politics, which he called a "salient principal" that must be observed by the new government. He accused Britain -- "our erstwhile colonial master" -- of pushing for regime change because it still had designs on Zimbabwe's natural resources. "As we move forward, as long as certain salient principles are recognized, we will find room for agreement," he said. Tsvangirai called for the international community to resume sending food and medical aid to Zimbabwe, which was slowed by the violence that followed the elections. His top priority, he said, is to address "devastating food shortages. "The policies in the past have made Zimbabwe a nation where the healthy flee and the sickly die," he said. Under the agreement, Mugabe will chair a Cabinet. Tsvangirai will be prime minister, responsible for policy formulation and implementation and will preside over a council of ministers. Zimbabwe has had no Cabinet since the March presidential election that started the current political impasse. The Cabinet and council of ministers will confer on government affairs and policy issues. The Cabinet will be the policy-making body and the council of ministers will be a liaison platform. Mugabe will be in charge of all state security affairs. Tsvangirai will supervise all ministers and deal with day-to-day government issues and will head government business in parliament. ZANU-PF will have 15 ministers in the council and the MDC will have 13. Mutambara's MDC splinter group will have three. "There is going to be a new constitution in 18 months after which it will be assessed whether there must be a fresh election," a ZANU-PF source said. The deal ends months of waiting for a country torn apart after the presidential vote in March. Tsvangirai won the most votes in that election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. He withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters. Regardless of the details of the deal, the main issue facing the leaders now is how to resuscitate Zimbabwe's economy, which is in a freefall. Once a prosperous nation, Zimbabwe now has the world's highest inflation -- officially at 11.2 million percent. The country is experiencing acute shortages of foreign currency, fuel, electricity, medicines, and basic food like corn meal, milk, and bread. More than 5 million people out of a population of about 13 million are said to have fled the country.

Keeping Flash off the iPad could hurt, Adobe saysBy Doug Gross, CNN Adobe has fueded with Apple over the fact that iPhones and iPads don't run Flash animation. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Adobe says keeping Flash off of Apple products is a "risk factor" Business "could be harmed" by customers going elsewhere for video, games, company says Comments were part of filing with federal Securities and Exchange Commission Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment RELATED TOPICS
Adobe Systems Inc.
Apple Inc.
Apple iPad
(CNN) -- Adobe, the makers of the Flash animation platform, said Apple's refusal to run Flash on the iPad, iPhone and other products could hurt the company's bottom line. The comments were part of an official quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "[T]o the extent new releases of operating systems or other third-party products, platforms or devices, such as the Apple iPhone or iPad, make it more difficult for our products to perform, and our customers are persuaded to use alternative technologies, our business could be harmed," read the report. The statement came in a section of the quarterly report outlining risk factors that could make Adobe's business not perform as well as predicted. Like other Apple products, the iPad -- released Saturday -- does not run Flash, making some games and videos unusable. Apple CEO Steve Jobs has reportedly called Flash "buggy" and a memory hog. But there's also a financial aspect to the dispute. Roughly three-quarters of the video on the Internet uses Flash, and allowing it on Apple products would give customers options other than applications sold through the official Apple store. Fortune: Why is Steve Jobs Flash-obsessed? The Adobe filing said it's hard to know what kind of products to develop when it's unclear what platforms will be able to run them. "The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share ... ," the report said. Apple and Adobe have long traded barbs over the issue. While most computers in the United States and abroad run Flash, and many game developers write for it, the company clearly would like access to Apple's devoted and highly plugged-in customer base. iPhone users, as well as those who choose other phones, frequently cite the lack of Flash as one of the phone's drawbacks. Risk statements like Adobe's are a routine part of SEC filings. Even the rosiest predictions include a list of things the company thinks could possibly make it underperform. Apple did not immediately respond to an e-mail from CNN.com seeking comment for this report.

Computer virus Stuxnet a 'game changer,' DHS official tells SenateBy Pam Benson, CNN National Security Producer | Filed under: Web Sean McGurk, head of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Center, says Stuxnet is without precedent. STORY HIGHLIGHTSA Senate panel hears testimony about a new computer wormIt's called Stuxnet, and it targets computers that run critical infrastructure systemsThe Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity chief calls it a "game changer" Washington (CNN) -- A highly complex computer attack that may have been targeting Iran's nuclear power plants is posing a serious security threat to critical infrastructure worldwide, according to government and cyber-industry experts testifying Wednesday on Capitol Hill. The computer worm known as Stuxnet was discovered this past July and specifically targets computers that run critical infrastructure such as the electric power grid, water treatment and oil and gas pipelines. The head of the Cybersecurity Center at the Department of Homeland Security said Stuxnet is an incredibly large, complex threat with capabilities never seen before. "This code can automatically enter a system, steal the formula for the product you are manufacturing, alter the ingredients being mixed in your product, and indicate to the operator and your anti-virus software that everything is functioning as expected," Sean McGurk told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. McGurk called the development of Stuxnet a "game changer." Stuxnet threatens computer systems
Cyberworm 'targets Iran'
McGurk said there is not enough knowledge to identify what specifically was the target of the attack. "To say it was specifically designed to target a particular facility is very difficult for anyone to say with assurance," said McGurk. However, a study by the Symantec Corporation, a cybersecurity firm, indicated Iran's nuclear plants could be the intended target. "Stuxnet is a threat targeting a specific industrial control system likely in Iran, such as a gas pipeline or power plant," according to the report. Symantec official Dean Turner told the lawmakers that "even if something like this is tied to one particular country or group of countries, the ability of it to have a global reach is enormous." He said there were approximately 44,000 unique Stuxnet infections worldwide with 1,600 of them in the United States. Nearly 60 percent of the global infections were in Iran. Who was behind the attack also remains a mystery. DHS's McGurk said the department's analysis of the code did not point to where it was developed. The Symantec study did not identify a source of the attack. The sophistication of the malware makes it unlikely it could easily be duplicated by others. "Stuxnet has such complexity requiring significant rescues to develop that few attackers will be capable of producing a similar threat," Turner said. The discovery of Stuxnet was a wake up call to government and industry, agreed all those who testified. Michael Assante, the president of the National Board of Information Security Examiners said, "We're not only susceptible, but we're not very well prepared." Enhanced cooperation between the federal government and private sector was cited as one key component to fending off cyber threats. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, lamented that critical cybersecurity legislation needed to combat cyber threats will have to wait until the new Congress convenes next year. "I'm sorry to say it seems unlikely we can pass this bill in this lame-duck session, although we should. I've been disappointed that the administration and some other committees that have an interest in this issue have been slow to engage," said Lieberman.

Bond girls through the years
By Stephanie Goldberg, CNN
updated 6:12 PM EST, Mon November 5, 2012
Ursula Andress played Honey Ryder opposite Sean Connery's James Bond in the 1962 film "Dr. No." Bond first sees Ryder as she emerges from the ocean wearing a white bikini. She asks him, "What are you doing here? Looking for shells?" He replies, "No. I'm just looking."
Bond girl Tatiana Romanova was played by Daniela Bianchi in "From Russia with Love." A corporal in the Soviet army, Romanova saved Bond's life in the 1963 movie, which is regarded by many as one of the best "Bond" films of all time.
Pilot Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman, claimed to be immune to Bond's charm in 1964's "Goldfinger." However, Galore eventually falls for 007.
After Bond saved Domino Derval, played by Claudine Auger, from drowning in 1965's "Thunderball," she returned the favor by shooting Largo in the back before he could kill Bond. Derval is one Bond girl who is rarely out of a bikini.
Mie Hama's Kissy Suzuki marries Bond in a mock wedding ceremony while he's undercover as a fisherman in 1967's "You Only Live Twice."
Daniel Craig, among others, has called Diana Rigg's Teresa di Vicenzo one of the most memorable Bond girls of all time. The only girl to actually marry Bond (George Lazenby), Teresa di Vicenzo is killed shortly after they tie the knot in 1969's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service."
Jill St. John played diamond smuggler Tiffany Case in "Diamonds Are Forever." Bond is pretending to be Peter Franks when he and Case meet in the 1971 movie, which marked Connery's last turn as 007.
Jane Seymour's Solitaire loses her ability to see the future after losing her virginity to Roger Moore's Bond in 1973's "Live and Let Die."
Bond's ditzy assistant Mary Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland, eventually helps save the day in the 1974 flick "The Man with the Golden Gun."
In 1977's "The Spy Who Loved Me," Barbara Bach's Anya Amasova attempts to take revenge on Bond for killing her lover. However, she can't bring herself to do it after developing feelings for him.
Space scientist/astronaut/CIA agent Holly Goodhead, played by Lois Chiles, flies with Bond to Drax's space station in 1979's "Moonraker."
After witnessing her parents' assassination, Carole Bouquet's Melina Havelock teams up with Bond and eventually saves his life. Instead of donning an iconic bikini, Havelock bares it all to go skinny-dipping with 007 in 1981's "For Your Eyes Only."
Maud Adams starred alongside Moore's Bond as Octopussy in the 1983 film of the same name. The jewel smuggler and circus owner alerts Bond of a bomb, making her another girl to save his life.
The heir to an oil tycoon, Stacey Sutton, played by Tanya Roberts, works as a geologist in "A View to a Kill."
Bond shoots a gun out of cellist Kara Milovy's hands in 1987's "The Living Daylights." Maryam d'Abo played Milovy opposite Timothy Dalton's Bond.
Bond girl Pam Bouvier, played by Carey Lowell, works as a pilot and assists Bond in his mission in 1989's "License to Kill."
Izabella Scorupco played Natalya Simonova in 1995's "GoldenEye," which marked Pierce Brosnan's first turn as 007. Simonova is a Russian computer programmer who helps Bond save the day. Another Bond girl who claims to be immune to Bond's charm, Chinese agent Wai Lin, played by Michelle Yeoh, eventually falls for him in 1997's "Tomorrow Never Dies."
Denise Richards is atomic physicist Dr. Christmas Jones in the 1999 film "The World Is Not Enough." Halle Berry's Giacinta Johnson earned the nickname Jinx because she was born on Friday the 13th. In homage to Andress' Honey Ryder, audiences first see Berry as she emerges from the ocean wearing an orange bikini in 2002's "Die Another Day."
In 2006's "Casino Royale," Daniel Craig's Bond fell for Eva Green's Vesper Lynd.
Olga Kurylenko played Camille Montes in "Quantum of Solace." The former Bolivian agent is first seen in Bond's getaway car in the 2008 film.
Latest Bond girl Sévérine, played by Bérénice Marlohe, helps Bond track Raoul Silva in "Skyfall," which is due out on Friday, November 9.

Former Guatemalan president: U.S. money laundering charges are political 'revenge'
By Miguel Salay and Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
updated 5:19 PM EST, Thu January 31, 2013
Former Guatemalan President (2000-2004) Alfonso Portillo during a hearing in court in Guatemala City, May 9, 2011.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is facing extradition to the United States
He used the presidency as his personal ATM, U.S. federal prosecutor says
Portillo says he was targeted because he "did not support...the invasion in Iraq"
A State Department spokeswoman declines to comment on his extradition
Guatemala City (CNN) -- Disgraced, imprisoned and facing money laundering charges in the United States, former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is reigniting his defense.
The leader of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004, Portillo has always denied the charges against him and now says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies seeking revenge.
READ: Guatemala authorizes extradition of former president to U.S.
"It is revenge that was organized and a result of a conspiracy among certain sectors, as much those in economic power in Guatemala as my enemies and ideological adversaries in the United States, to get revenge against me and remove me from the political scene," Portillo said in an exclusive interview with CNN en Español broadcast Thursday morning.
Chain-link fences and barbed wire surrounded him as he spoke to the network from the courtyard of a Guatemalan prison this week.

In addition to airing his grievances with the media, Portillo said earlier this month that he will file a complaint before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, alleging that his rights have been violated by authorities. He alleges he was denied due process in his first extradition from Mexico to Guatemala in 2008 and by a second extradition request by the United States.
Portillo said right-wing political adversaries in the United States engineered the charges against him.
"In the United States it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right. They are charging me for being the only president who did not support with his signature nor with his permission the invasion in Iraq," Portillo said. "So, I know that it is not only illegal. I know that it is eminently political, my detention in Guatemala."
But U.S. prosecutors have said it was Portillo who abused the political system, accusing him of using his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars intended for his country's people.
"Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM," Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. "Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people."
An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, "a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts."
After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010.
Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer has yet to take place.
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the extradition case.
Portillo told CNN en Español that he never laundered money in U.S. banks.
"If deposits were made," he said, "they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit. In order for there to be laundering, the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity."
Guatemalan courts have previously acquitted Portillo of embezzlement allegations -- something that Portillo says shows that the U.S. accusations against him are baseless.
Portillo responded directly to the charge concerning the $1.5 million that the United States says was intended for school children. That money, Portillo said, was something he had requested and received before he became president. From the beginning, that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter's studies, and that is what it was used for, Portillo said.
Despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process, Portillo said he believes he will get a fair trial in the United States.
"I have confidence that at least I will have a transparent, impartial, objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods," he said. A fair trial would not be possible in Guatemala, he added.
In the meantime, prison life hasn't been too bad, the former president said.
"I think pain and suffering make men better, make women better, make human beings better," he said.
In the three years he has spent in prison, he has read more than 100 books and seen more movies, he said.
"I don't regret anything. And I know this has some purpose. It will accomplish something in my life," Portillo said. "Let God decide my destiny, and let history condemn or absolve me."

Representatives knock Sen. Saxby Chambliss' comments on sexual assault
By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 7:53 AM EDT, Wed June 5, 2013
U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence ranking member Sen. Saxby Chambliss on November 16, 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Chambliss suggested hormones may be partly responsible for assaults in the military
The Georgia senator commented in a hearing on sexual assaults in the military
He was criticized by representatives from both parties
Criminals, not hormones, are the cause, says an Ohio congressman (CNN) -- Representatives from both political parties on Tuesday slammed U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss after he said that hormones may be partly responsible for sexual assaults in the military.
His controversial comments came during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the subject.
Addressing top military officials, Chambliss, R-Georgia, said: "The young folks that are coming into each of your services are anywhere from 17 to 22-23. Gee whiz -- the hormone level created by nature sets in place the possibility for these types of things to occur.

"So we've got to be very careful on how we address it on our side, but guys, we're not doing our job. You're not doing yours, and we're not doing ours with the rates that we are seeing on sexual assaults.

"As I said to start with, you recognize it. We recognize it, and we got to figure this thing out because we simply can't tolerate it."
Military chiefs oppose removing commanders from sexual assault probes
The response was swift.
Republican Rep. Mike Turner, co-chairman of the military sexual assault prevention caucus, issued a statement saying criminals, not hormones, cause sexual assaults.

"Perpetuating this line of thinking does nothing to help change the culture of our military. We must be focused on combating this issue directly. The numbers speak for themselves," the Ohio representative said.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, called for Chambliss to apologize.
Navy football players investigated in sex assault complaint
"For a United States senator, or anyone, to write off sexual assault and the personal violation of a woman or a man to the raging hormones of youth shows just how dramatically out of touch the Republican Party is," she told MSNBC.
"I think he should think about whether if, God forbid, a sexual assault happened to a daughter of his, would he think it was OK for a senator to just chalk the assault up to raging hormones?"

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Alleged victim says he was attacked when he tried to get into a photo with Brown
NEW: Brown allegedly said "I'm not down with that gay s--t" Brown and a bodyguard were booked at D.C.'s Second District police station
Brown is on probation for a felony domestic violence conviction involving Rihanna
(CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown and a bodyguard were arrested Sunday morning and charged with felony assault, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said.
The arrest could have serious legal consequence for Brown, 24, since he is serving probation for the felony domestic violence conviction relating to his 2009 attack on former girlfriend Rihanna.
Brown and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy allegedly attacked a man with their fists outside the W Hotel in downtown Washington at 4:25 a.m. Sunday, police said.
The police incident report obtained by CNN identified the alleged victim as Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland. Parker did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment.
Parker told police that he tried to jump into a photo that Brown was posing for with a female fan on the sidewalk when the singer said, "I'm not down with that gay s--t" and "I feel like boxing," the police report said. Parker said that Brown then punched him in the face with his closed fist, the report said.
Chris Brown arrested in D.C. Parker said Brown's bodyguard -- who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 240 pounds -- stepped between them and punched Parker in the face, the report said. The bodyguard then grabbed Brown by his arm and pulled him toward his tour bus, which was parked near by, it said.
Brown and the bodyguard were taken into custody and were being held at the Second District police station, police said. Both men were later transferred to a central jail cell block for processing, police said,
Parker was treated and released at a hospital for treatment for a bruised and swollen face, police spokesman Anthony Clay told CNN.
Brown was in Washington to host a "homecoming party" at The Park at Fourteen nightclub Saturday night, according to his Twitter feed, just four blocks away from where he was arrested Sunday morning.
His representative and lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment Sunday.
Brown is on probation in California for a felony domestic violence conviction involving Rihanna. Any arrest could be considered a violation of that probation, which could result in jail time.
Prosecutors filed probation violation charges against him twice in the past year, resulting in the judge ordering him to complete an additional 1,000 hours of community service.
In August: Brown ordered to 1,000 hours community labor
Brown was arrested in February 2009 for punching Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. The altercation left the face of Rihanna, also a chart-topping singer, bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards.
He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and ordered to spend more than 1,400 hours in "labor-oriented service."
His probation reports were glowing until the past year, when the district attorney's office accused him of not completing the 1,400 hours of community labor, which he was allowed to do in his home state of Virginia.
Brown calls out Jay-Z in new interview
He was also accused of hit-and-run after a minor traffic crash earlier this year. The driver of the other car told investigators that Brown "went ballistic" and screamed at her after his Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street.
In August, Brown's lawyer reached a settlement with prosecutors to end their efforts to revoke his probation. The deal called for Brown to complete another 1,000 hours of community service.
Probation rules require Brown to stay out of all legal trouble. Even an arrest that does not lead to a conviction could result in a probation violation charge.
He is scheduled to appear before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin on November 20 for a probation status hearing.
