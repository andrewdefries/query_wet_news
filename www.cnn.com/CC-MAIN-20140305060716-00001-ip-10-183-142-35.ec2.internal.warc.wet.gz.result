The CNN Wire: Monday, Nov. 5Next Article in World » Editor's Note: The CNN Wire is a running log of the latest news from CNN World Headquarters, reported by CNN's correspondents and producers, and The CNN Wire editors. "Posted" times are Eastern Time. Pakistani forces brutally enforce emergency measure; thousands arrested LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces used tear gas and batons Monday on lawyers and journalists demonstrating against President Pervez Musharraf's weekend declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan. Thousands of journalists, attorneys, opposition figures and human rights representatives have been jailed in the crackdown that began Saturday when Musharraf declared the state of emergency, suspending the country's constitution and sparking the demonstrations. Across the country, police stations are so packed with detainees that authorities have begun using schools as temporary holding cells. Despite strong pressure from the United States, Britain and other countries to reverse his decision, Musharraf has been unresponsive and unapologetic, according to diplomatic officials who met Monday with the president to deliver their concerns, particularly about "heavy-handed" measures taken in Lahore. According to a press release from Musharraf, "The president assured the diplomats that efforts were being made in a phased manner to move toward complete democracy." (Posted 9:25 p.m.) ICE chief apologizes for Halloween costume party From CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Secretary of Homeland Security says DHS will conduct an inquiry into a Halloween costume party hosted by a top immigration official after some employees said they were offended by a man dressed in striped prison outfit, dreadlocks and darkened skin make-up. Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and host of the fundraising party, was on a three-judge panel that originally cited the prisoner costume for "originality." Myers later apologized for "a few of the costumes," calling them "inappropriate and offensive." She said she and other senior managers "deeply regret that this happened." A department photographer photographed Myers with the man, but the photograph or photographs were deleted after it was determined the costume was offensive, ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. Between 50 and 75 people attended the party, which was a fundraiser for the Combined Federal Campaign, a federal government collection of charities. (Posted 9:21 p.m.) Report: Weak security mistakenly lets thousands cross U.S. border WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite heightened attention to border security in the six years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, government watchdogs have found that thousands of people who shouldn't have been admitted to the United States were mistakenly allowed in last year because of security lapses at legal border crossings. The number of inadmissible aliens who managed to enter through official ports of entry in 2006 was not disclosed in Monday's report from the Government Accountability Office. However, a source who has seen a full version of the report, in which those statistics were included, put the total at 21,000. The author of the GAO report, Richard Stana, said most of those who were wrongly allowed to enter were economic migrants who did not present a security risk. Understaffing and turnover at Customs and Border Protection, the agency which mans the nation's 326 land, sea and air ports of entry, has contributed to the problem, according to the GAO report. However, investigators also cited weak management controls and complacency and inattentiveness by some CBP officers. (Posted 7:49 p.m.) Federal monitors dispatched to 4 states for local elections From Justice Producer Terry Frieden WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than one hundred federal civil rights monitors have been dispatched from Washington to cities in four states to keep an eye on polling locations Tuesday where language barriers and race-related problems have occurred in past local elections. The Justice Department said monitors have been sent to Boston and Springfield, Mass., and to Reading, Pa., because of ballot issues and language assistance. A federal court order entered in Boston in 2005 required the city to provide information, ballots, and voting assistance in Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. In Springfield, a 2006 court order required voting assistance and materials for Spanish-speaking voters. Spanish language voting access is also the issue in Reading. Federal observers were also sent to Anderson, Ind., and to five counties in Mississippi where racial issues have flared in past local elections. (Posted 7:41 p.m.) Defense contractor convicted of bribing ex-congressman Cunningham (CNN) -- A federal jury in San Diego convicted defense contractor Brent Wilkes of bribing imprisoned ex-congressman Randy "Duke" Cunningham on Monday, taking three days of deliberations to find Wilkes guilty on 13 corruption counts. Wilkes was accused of providing more than $700,000 to Cunningham in exchange for the southern California Republican's help steering more than $70 million in defense contracts to Wilkes and another contractor, Mitchell Wade. Jurors began deliberating Wednesday after a three-week trial, finding Wilkes guilty of bribery, conspiracy, money laundering and 10 counts of wire fraud, assistant U.S. attorney Phillip Halpern said. Prosecutors accused Wilkes of paying off a half-million-dollar note on the congressman's California home; picking up the tab for vacation outings, private jet travel and limousines; buying Cunningham a $14,000 speedboat; and having an employee line up prostitutes for himself and the lawmaker during a two-night stay in Hawaii. Wilkes could face up to 20 years in prison at sentencing, which Halpern said has been set for Jan. 28. His lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. (Posted 7:10 p.m.) U.S. Air Force grounds fighters operating in Afghanistan WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A mandatory grounding of Air Force F-15s has been expanded to cover those flying combat missions over Afghanistan after a crash in Missouri last week, Air Force officials said Monday. The F-15Es in Afghanistan can fly only in emergency situations to protect U.S. and coalition troops in a battle, according to Maj. John Elolf, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force Central Command. On Saturday, the Air Force grounded all models of its F-15 fleet on "non-mission critical" flight status for inspection after the crash of an older model F-15C Friday. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but Air Force officials said it was a structural failure and the plane broke apart in flight. Grounding the planes flying over Afghanistan moves the inspections to now cover "mission critical" F-15s. --From CNN Pentagon Producer Mike Mount (Posted 5:27 p.m.) Writers on both coasts participate on first day of WGA strike (CNN) -- Late-night television shows readied themselves Monday for reruns as movie and television writers manned picket lines on both sides of the country on the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against studios and production companies. Comedian and late-night talk show host Jay Leno, carrying donuts to the dozens of pickets marching outside of NBC's studios in Burbank, Calif., told reporters that he wouldn't cross the picket line. Earlier on Monday, his show, as well as several other late-night shows -- among them "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," "The Late Show with David Letterman," and "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson" -- announced they will be showing reruns "until further notice." Additionally, "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report" will begin showing reruns Monday night, said Comedy Central's vice president, Steve Albani. (Posted 4:47 p.m.) U.S. to aid crackdown on Kurdish 'enemy' in Iraq, Bush tells Turkish PM WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States will help Iraq and Turkey crack down on Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq, President Bush said Monday after meeting with Turkey's prime minister, telling reporters that U.S. and Turkish commanders will share intelligence on the rebels. With Turkey threatening to launch cross-border raids against the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, Bush pointed to the weekend release of 12 Turkish soldiers captured by the rebels as evidence that a crackdown is under way. "I've assured the prime minister that we're working very carefully and closely with people in the Kurdish part of Iraq to help deal with the movement of these people, to help locate and find and stop the leadership of the PKK from continuing doing what they're doing," he said. The United States and the European Union consider the group a terrorist organization, and Bush called it "an enemy of Turkey, a free Iraq and the United States of America." He said top U.S. and Turkish military officials have set up an arrangement to keep in touch with each other and with the U.S. commander in Baghdad, Gen. David Petraeus. (Posted 4:18 p.m.) Top former general breaks with Chavez over constitutional changes CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- The ex-general credited with helping President Hugo Chavez turn the tide during an abortive coup in 2002 broke with his former mentor Monday, saying that Chavez's proposed constitutional changes would themselves represent a coup d'etat against the constitutional system. Approval of the proposed changes "would in effect finalize a coup d'etat, brazenly violating the constitution," former Defense Minister Raul Baduel said at a news conference. "The Venezuelan people should categorically reject this fraud." Venezuela's pro-Chavez National Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly approved a package of 69 changes to the 1999 Constitution. The changes would institutionalize Chavez's bid to implant a new model of development -- called "Socialism for the 21st Century" -- in the country while strengthening the power of the executive to rule by decree. It would also change electoral rules and allow a sitting president to seek unlimited re-election -- grandfathering Chavez into that system. (Posted 4:08 p.m.) Center-left Colom wins Guatemala's presidential race GUATEMALA CITY (CNN) -- Alvaro Colom of the center-left National Union of Hope party was declared Monday the official victor in Sunday's presidential election. "God was with Sandrita and me," said Colom late Sunday night, referring to his wife Sandra. "Thanks to the Guatemalan people for making this civic holiday such a marvelous day." It was the 56-year-old industrial engineer's third try for the presidency and his first to succeed. Of the 2.7 million valid votes cast nationwide, Colom won 1.4 million (53 percent) versus 1.3 million (47 percent) for his challenger, retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the conservative Patriot Party, according to the nation's official Web site, which said 100 percent of the vote had been counted. (Posted 3:04 p.m.) Young environmental activists hit Capitol Hill on climate change WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of young people are urging Congress to push the United States ahead in fighting global climate change, encouraged by several lawmakers Monday who addressed their rally on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol. "The young people of America are coming to Washington to say they want action now," said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., after he accepted a symbolic box of petitions of support for environmental and energy bills. "They're walking the corridors, they're lobbying the House and Senate, and I think they're making a big difference." The House and Senate in coming weeks will vote on the Safe Climate Act and the Global Warming Reduction Act, among other bills. Lawmakers will also consider a proposal to tighten the provisions of the Clean Water Act that were relaxed during the Bush administration. --From CNN's Paul Courson (Posted 2:50 p.m.) Thompson adviser resigns after drug pleas disclosed WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A friend and adviser to Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson resigned from the campaign Monday after weekend news reports disclosed his more than 20-year-old drug convictions. Phillip Martin stepped down as chairman of the First Day Founders committee for Thompson after The Washington Post reported his record Sunday, Martin told CNN. The former Tennessee senator's campaign has paid him more than $100,000 for use of a private jet, the newspaper reported. "The focus of this campaign should be on Fred Thompson's positions on the issues and his outstanding leadership ability, not on mistakes I made some 24 years ago. I deeply regret any embarrassment this has caused," Martin said in a statement issued Monday. The Post reported Sunday that Martin had pleaded guilty to selling marijuana in 1979 and pleaded no contest to cocaine-trafficking charges in 1983. He received probation both times. (Posted 2:43 p.m.) Time Warner CEO Parsons to step aside; will keep chairmanship NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- After a more than five-year stint running media conglomerate Time Warner, chairman and chief executive officer Richard Parsons announced Monday that he will resign as CEO as of Jan. 1. The company said Parsons is turning over the CEO reins to Jeffrey Bewkes, currently the president and chief operating officer of Time Warner. Parsons will remain chairman. The announcement has been long-expected as Parsons' contract with Time Warner expires in May 2008. Time Warner, in addition to being the parent company of CNN and CNNMoney.com, owns the Warner Bros. movie studio, Internet company AOL and a majority stake in Time Warner Cable. (Posted 2:24 p.m.) Bush, Turkish PM discuss Iraq border crisis WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister arrived at the White House on Monday for talks with President Bush on the border crisis with Iraq, an effort to prevent a Turkish assault on Kurdish rebels based across the Iraqi frontier. NATO ally Turkey has put tens of thousands of troops along the border after a series of attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, that have killed dozens of Turkish troops and civilians. The Turkish parliament has authorized cross-border raids against the PKK, but Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had said he would stay any decision until after his talks with Bush. The Bush administration is offering to share intelligence on the rebels for "limited and targeted exercises" by Turkey, White House spokesman Dana Perino said Monday. "We agree the PKK are terrorists and they should be stopped," she said. (Posted 2:20 p.m.) Researcher: Dangerous cholesterol drug's effectiveness demands attention ORLANDO (CNNMoney.com) -- A researcher unveiled Monday the results of a failed Pfizer Inc. study showing that an experimental but dangerous cholesterol drug offers medical benefits too significant to be ignored. The drug, torcetrapib, which Pfizer discontinued last year because too many patients died in the study, was nonetheless very effective in controlling cholesterol levels, said Dr. Phillip Barter, lead researcher in the study and professor of the Heart Research Institute in Sydney, Australia. The dangers associated with torcetrapib were already well-known, but its benefits had not been disclosed in detail before Monday. The test results could reignite interest in this class of drugs, known as cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors and is of great significance to other companies as well as Pfizer. --By CNNMoney.com's Aaron Smith (Posted 1:50 p.m.) Rice believes Israeli-Palestinian moving toward peace negotiations RAMALLAH, West Bank (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in the Middle East again to help restart peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, said Monday she is "tremendously impressed" by the resolve of both sides to find solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At a news conference with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Rice said she believes a proposed summit in Annapolis later this year can be the start of productive bargaining toward a two-state solution. "We appear to be on course to prepare seriously for continuous ongoing negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis for the establishment of a Palestinian state for the first time in many years, in seven years. We need to focus to make certain that everything that we do creates the best possible atmosphere for the day after Annapolis as well as for Annapolis," said Rice. While Israel and the Palestinians have not yet settled on a pre-conference declaration of principals and no date has been set for the Annapolis conference, Rice expressed optimism that both sides are finding common ground. (Posted 1:33 p.m.) Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan says he has escaped from house arrest LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan said Monday that he has escaped from house arrest and has no intention of turning himself in. "I will continue with my movement," Khan told Pakistani independent network GEO-TV from an undisclosed location. "The government has a very clear plan, the way they have beaten up the lawyers and arrested people and the way they barged into my house. "They want to create fear and chaos." Khan, a former captain of the Pakistani cricket team, heads the Movement for Justice party, which campaigns for an independent judiciary in Pakistan. He had been confined to his home in Lahore since early Sunday, when uniformed and plainclothes police surrounded the building and informed him he was under house arrest. (Posted 1:05 p.m.) Taiwanese fishing boat freed by Somali pirates WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A third ship hijacked by Somali pirates was released Monday, the U.S. Navy said. The Ching Fong Hwa, a Taiwanese fishing boat, and its crew, most of whom are Chinese, had been held alongside two other boats, which were released on Sunday, the Navy said. The Navy said that after the boat and its crew were released, a Somali boat picked up the pirates and returned them to Somalia. The USS James E. William then escorted the Hwa from the area. Navy sailors from the William boarded the Hwa to evaluate the crew and provide any needed aid. The Hwa was pirated in late April or early May, according to the Navy, which added that two ships in the area remain under pirate control. (Posted 12:25 p.m.) Writers demonstrate in New York on first day of WGA strike NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dozens of writers picketed Monday morning outside NBC studios in Rockefeller Plaza, carrying signs and yelling, on the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against studios and production companies. The writers' union says the strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. PT (3:01 a.m. ET), is necessary to protect their future incomes as the shows they write are increasingly distributed over new media, primarily through Internet downloading. A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales. This had been considered the major stumbling block to a deal. The union's statement early Monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its DVD proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning Internet distribution that "makes a mockery of any residual," the statement said. AMPTP President Nick Counter placed the blamed for the failed talks on the negotiators for the writers."We made an attempt at meeting them in a number of their key areas, including Internet streaming and jurisdiction in new media," he said. (Posted noon) 2 killed in Baghdad roadside bombing BAGHDAD (CNN) -- A roadside bomb in southeastern Baghdad on Monday killed at least two Iraqis and wounded six, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said.

The effort was launched during the holy month of Ramadan. --From CNN's Jomana Karadsheh (Posted 11:44 a.m.) Boats freed by pirates were fishing trawlers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy on Monday identified two Tanzanian-flagged fishing boats that were released Sunday by pirates off the east coast of Somalia as Mavuno I and Mavuno II. The trawlers were pirated in May. They were to meet with a U.S. Navy ship, which was to provide escort and humanitarian assistance to the crews, the Navy said. In all, 24 sailors of various nationalities were freed Sunday, about six months after pirates took over their ships, a U.S. military official told CNN. (Posted 11:43 a.m.) Pentagon postpones military meeting with Pakistan WASHINGTON (CNN) --- The Pentagon has postponed a meeting scheduled this week in Pakistan between top U.S. and Pakistani military and defense officials, in what appears to be the first step in a new cooler relationship with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman confirmed the postponement of the meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday and indicated no new date has been set. Undersecretary of Defense Eric Edelman, the top U.S. defense policy official, had been planning to represent the United States at the meeting of the bilateral defense consultative group. Separately, a Pentagon official confirmed that "over half" of all U.S. military logistics and supplies for the war in Afghanistan come through Pakistan, so access is vital, the official said. Whitman also confirmed the United States is reviewing all elements of military and security aid to Pakistan and no decisions have been made.

Bush is expected to comment on the Pakistan situation after a scheduled Oval Office meeting this afternoon with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to Perino. In an off-camera morning briefing, Perino told reporters the United States is "deeply disturbed by the proclamation of emergency in Pakistan." She said Washington "cannot support emergency rule or the extreme measures taken during the emergency." (Posted 11:02 a.m.) Bayer suspends marketing of clotting drug used in heart surgery (CNN) -- Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corp. announced Monday it has suspended marketing of a clotting drug used to prevent bleeding in heart surgery. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it requested the suspension pending a review of preliminary results from a Canadian study that suggested the drug, Trasylol, is linked to an increased risk of dying. "FDA requested the suspension in the interest of patient safety based on the serious nature of the outcomes suggested in the preliminary data," the agency said in a posting on its Web site. "FDA has not yet received full study data but expects to act quickly with Bayer, the study's researchers at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, and other regulatory agencies to undertake a thorough analysis of data to better understand the risks and benefits of Trasylol." Since there are few treatment options for patients at risk for major bleeding during heart surgery, the FDA said it is working with Bayer to phase out use of Trasylol so that supplies of other drugs approved for that purpose do not run out. (Posted 10:58 a.m.) Demonstrators in London call for end to Pakistan emergency LONDON (CNN) -- About 120 demonstrators gathered in front of the Pakistani High Commission in London Monday to protest against an emergency declaration by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

Africa (CNN) -- U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey said Monday that allegations of abuse at her South African girls school are "devastating" but she is proud of the students who reported it, saying "their lights will not be diminished by this experience." Winfrey spoke via satellite link from Chicago to address media in Johannesburg hours after a 27-year-old school matron was charged with 13 counts of abuse and assault at Winfrey's $40 million academy, which opened in January.

William Fallon confirmed to CNN in an exclusive interview. "I told him the idea of doing this was not a good one and that there might be alternatives," Fallon said in a phone interview from Kyrgyzstan. "I gave him my opinion about the potential consequences and the likely reactions." Musharraf did not directly inform Fallon of his decision during their meeting on Friday, but it was clear what he planned to do, according to senior U.S. officials familiar with what was said in the meeting. --From CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr (Posted 9:27 a.m.) Head of MI5 says 2,000 people in Britain a threat to security, people as young as 15 involved in terror-related activity LONDON (CNN) -- The head of Britain's intelligence services warned Monday there are at least 2,000 people living in Britain who pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaida-inspired terrorism. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, said that individuals as young as 15 are being implicated in terrorist-related activity, during a speech to journalists.

Monday's crackdown turned violent in several cities, including Lahore, where police -- using tear gas and batons -- clashed with lawyers and journalists outside the city's courthouse. As they did in widespread protests earlier this year, Pakistan's lawyers are leading the charge against Musharraf's latest move to squash any attempt by the Supreme Court to limit his grip on power.

Cao described his meeting with Gates as "pragmatic, candid, and productive" and said future military exchanges will "deepen our friendship and cooperation." The two men emphasized bilateral cooperation and communication, but they also discussed the issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions. (Posted 6 a.m.) Pens down: Film, TV writers go on strike LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- The writers who make up the words for most of the movies and television shows produced in the United States will be walking picket lines outside of major studios in New York and Los Angeles Monday morning as the Writers Guild of America has launched a strike against producers. The writers union said a strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. Monday, is necessary to protect their future incomes as the shows they write are increasingly distributed over new media, primarily Internet downloading. While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, most television shows that are more topical -- especially late night TV -- are expected to immediately go to re-runs. A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite a major concession by the writers as they dropped their demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales. This had been considered the major stumbling block to a deal. (Posted 5:36 a.m.) Baghdad reporter missing for two weeks freed by captors (CNN) -- A Baghdad correspondent for Radio Free Iraq who had been missing for two weeks has been freed by her captors, according to her employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. She is Jumana al-Obaidi, 29, works for Radio Free Iraq. RFE/RL's Arabic-language service, "All of us at RFE/RL are very relieved Jumana's ordeal is over," said RFE/RL President Jeff Gedmin, who added that "journalists like Jumana put their lives on the line every day. They are dedicated journalists, brave people, and Iraqi patriots. We are proud to know them." Al-Obaidi had been taken from her car on October 22 when she was headed for an interview at the Iraqi Environment Ministry. Her driver, a man in his late 20s named Abdullah, was shot and killed and his body was found dumped. (Posted 5:25 a.m.) Bush, Turkish PM set to meet on Iraqi-Turkish border crisis WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Turkish prime minister is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Monday, with the tensions along the Iraqi-Turkish border topping the agenda. The visit of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan comes as the United States and Iraq attempt to persuade Turkey to shun launching a major cross-border offensive into Iraq to fight Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, guerrillas who have conducted attacks against Turkish targets. "The president looks forward to continuing discussions with the prime minister on a range of issues on our common agenda, including the fight against terrorism, in particular our joint efforts to counter the PKK, and the promotion of peace and stability in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and the broader Middle East," the White House said in a recent statement about the meeting. Another topic on the agenda will be "U.S. support for Turkey's accession to the European Union and Turkey's efforts toward that goal." (Posted 4:45 a.m.) Police arrest more lawyers, block roads to courts; U.S. postpones defense visit to Pakistan ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan police, using tear gas and batons, clashed with lawyers and journalists outside the Lahore courthouse Monday, as they continued to enforce President Pervez Musharraf's emergency declaration. More than 1,500 lawyers were arrested across Pakistan, including 1,200 in Lahore, on Monday and police blocked roads leading to courthouses in major cities. The government denied Monday that Musharraf had himself been placed under house arrest, a rumor that was circulating widely through the country. A spokesman for the People's Party of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called Musharraf's declaration an "act of terror" against civil society and predicted it marked "the beginning of the end of Musharraf." Pakistani Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao told CNN that parliamentary elections -- which had been set for January -- would not be held until "things become normal." (Posted 4:45 a.m.) Police arrest more lawyers, block roads to courts LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan police, using tear gas and batons, clashed with lawyers and journalists outside the Lahore courthouse Monday, as they continued to enforce President Pervez Musharraf's emergency declaration. CNN's Mohsin Naqvi, who was in the crowd, said police were brutally beating the lawyers and the journalists who were covering the story. While Naqvi said he was not hit, he was coughing from the tear gas. More than a thousand lawyers were arrested across Pakistan Monday and police blocked roads leading to courthouses in major cities. The United States, in reaction, postponed a Pentagon official's visit to Pakistan this week for a yearly meeting with his Pakistani defense counterpart. (Posted 2:53 a.m.) Pens down: TV, film writers go on strike LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- The final effort to avoid a writers strike, which could cripple Hollywood's movie and television production, ended in failure Sunday evening, according to a spokesman for the Writers Guild of America. Producers and the writers union are divided on how much residual compensation writers should be paid when their work is distributed through new media, including DVD and the Internet. A federal mediator conducted a day-long negotiating session with both sides in Los Angeles Sunday. While the strike officially begins at midnight in each time zone, the pickets are scheduled to begin outside major studios in Los Angeles and New York at 9 a.m. (Posted 2:12 a.m.) U.S. postpones high-level defense talks with Pakistan BEIJING (CNN) -- A Pentagon delegation will not travel to Pakistan this week as had been planned for a yearly meeting with their Pakistani defense counterparts because of President Pervez Musharraf's emergency declaration and suspension of Pakistan's constitution, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said. Undersecretary of Defense Eric Edelman had been set to visit Pakistan on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the decision was made Sunday to postpone his trip, according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. The announcement was made in Beijing, where Defense Sec. Robert Gates is meeting with his Chinese counterpart. "The message is consistent throughout the U.S. government expressing dissapointment at the declaration," Morrell said. "The United States wants a return to law-based democratic government." Earlier in Beijing, Gates called Pakistan an important ally in the war on terror "We are considering all our options," Gates said. "We are not willing to risk ongong operations in the war on terror." (Posted 1:10 a.m.) Center-left Colom wins Guatemala's presidential race GUATEMALA CITY (CNN) -- Alvaro Colom of the center-left National Union of Hope party defeated retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the conservative Patriot Party in Guatemala's presidential race Sunday, according to results posted on the official election Web site. Colom gathered nearly 53 percent of the vote to Molina's 47 percent, with 97 percent of the ballots counted, the election tribunal said.

NASCAR, meet the electric Chevy VoltStory Highlights General Motors unveils its Volt to the media at a NASCAR track in Texas GM hopes the Volt will become the first mass-produced, plug-in electric car in 2010 "Fans would pack up. . .and leave," says a NASCAR fan at the prospect of Volt races Chevrolet: Marketing the car is a balancing act between blue- and red-state AmericaNext Article in Technology » By Beau Estes CNN FORT WORTH, Texas (CNN) -- Imagine a sun-swept Texas afternoon in 2015. After the roar of a ceremonial flyover, a Texas Motor Speedway crowd of 200,000 rises to its feet in anticipation of NASCAR's signature moment. Chevrolet may have a challenge in marketing its Chevrolet Volt -- an electric car -- to NASCAR fans. The celeb du jour grabs the microphone and bellows, "Gentlemen, start your engines!" As the fans join in a full-throated cheer, 43 of the world's best drivers reach down and press a button. What follows is unprecedented: pin-dropping silence, save for 43 small clicks. This scenario isn't as unfathomable as it may seem. In fact, in a sport whose fans often wear their American pride on their sleeves along with the image of their favorite driver, it may offer a strongly pro-American vision of the future. NASCAR, meet the Chevrolet Volt, which General Motors believes will become the first mass-produced plug-in electric car on American roads by late 2010. The latest symbol of GM's new mantra, "From gas-friendly to gas-free," the Volt was unveiled to the media last week at Texas Motor Speedway, in the heart of NASCAR country. Electric cars, with their quiet engines, turning laps in silence every Sunday on the NASCAR circuit? It may be a tough sell. "Fans would pack up their Budweiser and leave," said Mike Nichols, a Dallas resident and NASCAR fan. Other racing enthusiasts were more welcoming. "Just as long as it's fast as heck and it's good racing," said Jim Mero, a record-setting Corvette Driver and Chevy engineer, "everything will be OK." Don't Miss Plug-in electric cars set to debut in 2010
At last week's media event, which was closed to the public, a silver Volt prototype sat mere feet from a fleet of GM's current models. Everything from Chevy's iconic ZR1 Corvette to its hydrogen fuel-cell version of the Equinox sport-utility vehicle was on display. The car that gave the media the biggest charge, however, was the Volt. In a country saddled with spiking gas prices and increasing gas shortages, the Volt is seen by some as a potential savior. Engine-roaring, oil-dripping NASCAR, however, has historically resisted change. Only last year did NASCAR convert to unleaded fuel, and its cars still contain another relic of the past: a carburetor. Chevrolet understands that marketing the Volt, which was announced in 2007, might be a balancing act between blue- and red-state America. "We are attracting the 'green' crowd and the 'tech' crowd," explained Cristi Landy, the Volt's product marketing manager. "But this car has mass appeal to a broader audience." GM hopes that NASCAR fans, who tend to be staunchly patriotic, will appreciate that electric cars will probably reduce America's reliance on foreign oil -- especially on oil from nations that might be hostile toward the United States. "Yes, we get it, and with fervor," said John Frost, a 60-year old NASCAR fan from Davidsonville, Maryland. "We are for the elimination of U.S. dependency on foreign oil. We're no dummies." Still, don't look for Chevrolet to necessarily trot out the American flag in the marketing plan. "There is a fear that if we position this as a 'pro-American' car, it will upset some of the environmentally conscious crowd," explained Pete Lewis, who works in program operations at GM. "And we want it to be embraced by everyone." The Volt is expected to travel 40 miles on a single charge from a wall socket before an engine kicks in to generate electrical power. GM also promises a top speed of about 100 mph and a zero-to-60 time of roughly 9 seconds, specs that won't impress NASCAR fans used to seeing race cars roaring past at 200 mph. "NASCAR is a total body experience," Frost said. "The sound of 750 horsepower times 43 cars -- lots of gas guzzling, internal combustion, unbridled horsepower. There's nothing like it. No matter what they do, they can never replace the thunder that is NASCAR." In the end, selling a gearless Volt to NASCAR gearheads may come down to one basic question: Is the car fun? "If you sit behind the wheel," said GM fuel-cell expert Mark Vann, "it's pretty cool." "We feel that this is a superior solution versus what other competitors have done with hybrids. This car [offers] an electric performance," added Landy, conveying both the literal and metaphorical meanings of the word. "It will give you great off-the-line torque and a lot of low-end torque. It really. . .will be exciting to drive."

Arizona schools chief says ethnic studies law takes focus off raceBy the CNN Wire Staff Ethnic studies law racist?STORY HIGHLIGHTSLaw aims "to get schools to teach kids to treat each other as individuals," he saysHe says Tucson ethnic studies curriculum "divided the kids into different races"Law bans classes that promote overthrow of U.S., resentment of other racial groupsMeasure criticized by educators, citizens who say the classes don't promote resentment (CNN) -- The top proponent of the new Arizona law targeting the state's ethnic studies programs defends the controversial measure, which bans ethnic studies classes that "promote resentment" of other racial groups. State Schools Superintendent Tom Horne told CNN's "American Morning" on Thursday that the legislation is "designed to get schools to teach kids to treat each other as individuals and not on the basis of what race they were born into." Horne said he believes that the "fundamental American value is that we are individuals" and "not exemplars of the race we happen to be born into. What's important is what we know, what we can do, what is our character." The superintendent has been targeting an ethnic studies curriculum in Tucson that he says "divided the kids into different races" -- African studies for African-Americans, "Raza" studies for Latino youths and Asian studies for Asians.

"In the Raza studies, they were teaching kids that the United States is oppressive, they were making them angry. They used a Marxist book, the 'Pedagogy of the Oppressed,' " he said. Signed into law on Tuesday, the new legislation forbids classes "designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group" that advocate "the overthrow of the United States government" or "resentment toward a race or class of people." It also forbids classes that "advocate ethnic solidarity" instead of treating pupils as individuals. The measure has drawn criticism from educators and citizens who say the classes don't promote resentment. U.N. human rights experts criticized the legislation, saying "everyone has the right to seek and develop cultural knowledge and to know and understand his or her own culture and that of others through education and information." Kyrsten Sinema, a Democratic state legislator who appeared on "American Morning" with Horne, disagreed with the superintendent's contention that students were divided according to race or ethnicity. "The fact is very clear that these courses are open to all students. Any student of any race and ethnicity can take an African-American class. Similarly, they can take an Asian-American studies class and learn about the history of Japanese internment camps. That's an important part of the American education system," she said. Sinema said the courses aren't designed for one race, and they help foster an understanding of different cultures. "I think it is important for students to learn about their own cultural heritage and to have the opportunity to learn about our cultures and ethnicities that make up the diverse and wonderful state of Arizona," she said. Horne said the state's social studies standards "require all kids to learn about all different cultures." He said they "shouldn't be ghettoized into certain cultures where they learn only about the culture of the race they have been born into. That's contrary to American values." The ethnic studies legislation comes on the heels of a new state immigration law that has led to calls to boycott Arizona businesses and the state itself. The law requires immigrants in Arizona to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants.

Obama can't kick his legacy down the road
By Gloria Borger, CNN Chief Political Analyst
updated 10:30 AM EST, Wed February 20, 2013
President Obama has a small window of opportunity to get Congress to act on his priorities, Gloria Borger says.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gloria Borger: Prospect of deep budget cuts was designed to compel compromise
She says the "unthinkable" cuts now have many supporters
The likelihood that cuts may happen shows new level of D.C. dysfunction, she says
Borger: President may want a 2014 House victory, but action needed now
(CNN) -- So let's try to recount why we are where we are. In August 2011, Washington was trying to figure out how to raise the debt ceiling -- so the US might continue to pay its bills -- when a stunt was hatched: Kick the can down the road.
And not only kick it down the road, but do it in a way that would eventually force Washington to do its job: Invent a punishment.
Gloria Borger
If the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal, the blunt instrument of across-the-board cuts in every area would await.
Unthinkable! Untenable!
Until now.
In fact, something designed to be worse than any conceivable agreement is now completely acceptable to many.

And not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable, they're even applauded. Some Republicans figure they'll never find a way to get 5% across-the-board domestic spending cuts like this again, so go for it. And some liberal Democrats likewise say 8% cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own, so go for it.
Opinion: Forced budget cuts a disaster for military
The result: A draconian plan designed to force the two sides to get together has now turned out to be too weak to do that.
And what does that tell us? More about the collapse of the political process than it does about the merits of any budget cuts. Official Washington has completely abdicated responsibility, taking its dysfunction to a new level -- which is really saying something.
We've learned since the election that the second-term president is feeling chipper. With re-election came the power to force Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy in the fiscal cliff negotiations, and good for him. Americans voted, and said that's what they wanted, and so it happened. Even the most sullen Republicans knew that tax fight had been lost.
Points on the board for the White House.
Obama: People will lose jobs over cuts
Explaining forced budget cuts
Now the evil "sequester" -- the forced budget cuts -- looms. And the president proposes what he calls a "balanced" approach: closing tax loopholes on the rich and budget cuts. It's something he knows Republicans will never go for. They raised taxes six weeks ago, and they're not going to do it again now. They already gave at the office. And Republicans also say, with some merit, that taxes were never meant to be a part of the discussion of across-the-board cuts. It's about spending.
Politics: Obama more emotional on spending cuts
Here's the problem: The election is over. Obama won, and he doesn't really have to keep telling us -- or showing us, via staged campaign-style events like the one Tuesday in which he used police officers as props while he opposed the forced spending cuts.
What we're waiting for is the plan to translate victory into effective governance.
Sure, there's no doubt the president has the upper hand. He's right to believe that GOP calls for austerity do not constitute a cohesive party platform. He knows that the GOP has no singular, effective leader, and that its message is unformed. And he's probably hoping that the next two years can be used effectively to further undermine the GOP and win back a Democratic majority in the House.
Slight problem: There's plenty of real work to be done, on the budget, on tax reform, on immigration, climate change and guns. A second-term president has a small window of opportunity. And a presidential legacy is not something that can be kicked down the road.

'Chewbacca bat,' stinky beetles and other bizarre species found in national park
By Teo Kermeliotis, for CNN
updated 5:34 AM EDT, Mon August 5, 2013
In April a team of scientists embarked on the first comprehensive biodiversity study in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. Pictured is the "Chewbacca bat" (Triaenops persicus) -- which was given its nickname because of its resemblance to the Star Wars character.
Here, one of the 33 species of frogs recorded during the expedition at the park's Cheringoma Plateau.
Gorongosa is a spectacular biodiversity haven that's relatively unknown compared to other natural parks dotting the African continent. "When you go there you have a chance to see Africa as it used to be hundreds of years ago," says Piotr Naskrecki, associate director of the Biodiversity Laboratory at Gorongosa National Park. "It's pretty much unspoiled."

During their four-week expedition, the scientists documented at least 1,200 species of animals and plants on the Cheringoma Plateau. Here, a tree orchid (Aerangis mystacidii), one of the 17 species of orchids found on the Cheringoma Plateau.
Melissotarsus emeryi is the world's only ant incapable of walking on flat surfaces. This species spends its life inside narrow passage deep in the wood of trees and can only move by pushing its short legs below and above the body at the same time.
Mozambican amphibian researcher Harith Farooq was one of the scientists participating at the biodiversity survey. Here, he is seen holding a Savannah monitor lizard, (which was later released).
The scientists say that the information recorded and collected during their expedition will help guide restoration efforts in Gorongosa. Here, a portrait of the Armored katydid (Enyaliopsis petersi).

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New species discovered by researchers in Mozambique
Scientists carried out first major biodiversity study in Gorongosa National Park Frog that can't hop and "Chewbacca bat" found in the park
The forest was ravaged by years of conflict and poaching
(CNN) -- A furry bat named after a notorious Star Wars character, bombardier beetles that unleash explosive, foul-smelling gas to defend themselves, ants that can't walk or stand on flat surfaces and a mysterious cave-dwelling frog that runs instead of hopping.
These bizarre and wildly interesting creatures are just some of the 1,200 species of animals and plants that have been documented for the first time by scientists in the Gorongosa National Park, a stunning biodiversity haven in central Mozambique.
In mid-April, a team of 15 local and international scientists ventured into the park's spectacular rolling woodlands, deep gorges and riverine forests to conduct the first comprehensive biodiversity survey in a remote and largely unexplored area that was ravaged by years of war and poaching.

For about four weeks, the biologists were transformed into nature detectives surveying the Cheringoma Plateau, the part of the park that was least known biologically. Armed with rubber boots, headlamps and a huge variety of sophisticated equipment, they embarked on a painstaking mission to document life in the area and discover the rare, threatened and new-to-science species that live in it.

They climbed giant trees and rapelled from limestone cliffs to get samples of organisms from almost inaccessible canyons; they used ultraviolet lights and pheromone traps to attract insects; remote cameras and traditional tracking techniques to document large mammals; ultrasonic sound detectors to record hard-to-get wildlife, mist nets to capture wild birds and pitfall traps for reptiles and amphibians.
"We found all kinds of really exciting things," says expedition leader Piotr Naskrecki, associate director of the soon-to-open Biodiversity Laboratory in Gorongosa.
"We've at least doubled the number of species that is known from the national park, probably closer to tripling it," he adds. "Some of them are new to Mozambique and some are new to science."
Discoveries
Major findings consisted of 182 species of birds, including four rare forest dwellers recorded for the first time in Gorongosa. They also found several species of cricket-like katydids that are new to science, as well as a leaf katydid that had not been seen alive since the 1800s, and 54 species of mammals, including diminutive elephant shrews.
Other highlights included more than 100 species of ants, 47 species of reptiles, 33 species of frogs, hundreds of species of beetles and more than 320 species of plants that are new to Mozambique.
And, of course, the "Chewbacca bat," (real name Triaenops persicus) named after Han Solo's hairy sidekick in the Star Wars movies, and a strange silver and black Kassina frog that is probably new to science.
"It was an extremely rich experience in terms of adding data to what we've known about the park," says Naskrecki, who is also an entomologist at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.
'Doomed place'

Sitting at the southernmost tip of the Great Rift Valley, Gorongosa used to be one of Africa's richest wildlife refuges, a natural wonderland teeming with large populations of buffalo, lions, elephants and hippos.
But it all changed in the mid-1970s when Mozambique descended into a bloody civil war. The conflict lasted until 1992 and had a devastating impact on Gorongosa.
The park was turned from a wildlife treasure into a battlefield. Thousands of animals roaming its open grasslands were killed by warring groups and entire populations of wildlife came close to extinction.

"After the war, there was very little left," says Naskrecki. "The place seemed to be doomed."
He explains that before the war the park sheltered some 14,000 African buffalo; after the conflict, there were about 100 of them. "The same thing with lions," adds Naskrecki. "There used to be about 2,000 lions in the park and after the war there were maybe 30 left," he continues. "It also had about 2,500 elephants and after the war it had only 200."
The decimation continued after the war with extensive poaching and illegal logging.
Restoration efforts
But hopes for the park's revival have returned in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Gorongosa Restoration Project, an initiative led by retired American IT entrepreneur Greg Carr, aiming to bring the fragile ecosystem back to its former glory.
Gorongosa National Park is successfully recovering from the damage caused by the 17 years of the civil war. Piotr Naskrecki, entomologist
In 2008, Carr's foundation signed a 20-year contract with the Mozambican government to rejuvenate and protect the park's diverse ecosystem, as well as create a thriving ecotourism industry that would benefit communities in the area.
Key to the restoration efforts is the documentation and studying of life in Gorongosa -- a process that started with the scientific expedition in mid-April.

Naskrecki says the information recorded and collected, which will be presented in its entirety in a report later this year, will help guide restoration efforts in the park. It will also provide proof that Gorongosa is still a biodiversity hotspot that needs to be protected from industrial development, such as mining.
"Every single species we found, every orchid, every katydid, every frog is a powerful argument for maintaining the protective status of this area," says Naskrecki
"The main point, however, is not that we found unusual, rare, or new species, but that we found so many of them and in thriving populations. All this indicates that Gorongosa National Park is successfully recovering from the damage caused by the 17 years of civil war, which left many of its species decimated.
"The small animals ... may seem insignificant compared to lions and elephants, which are also recovering nicely, but they are very good indicators of the health and richness of the Gorongosa ecosystem."

Dylan Farrow's response to Woody Allen
updated 3:33 PM EST, Sat February 8, 2014
() -- Once again, Woody Allen is attacking me and my family in an effort to discredit and silence me - but nothing he says or writes can change the truth. For 20 years, I have never wavered in describing what he did to me. I will carry the memories of surviving these experiences for the rest of my life.
His op-ed is the latest rehash of the same legalese, distortions, and outright lies he has leveled at me for the past 20 years. He insists my mother brought criminal charges - in fact, it was a pediatrician who reported the incident to the police based on my firsthand account. He suggests that no one complained of his misconduct prior to his assault on me - court documents show that he was in treatment for what his own therapist described as "inappropriate" behavior with me from as early as 1991. He offers a carefully worded claim that he passed a lie detector test - in fact, he refused to take the test administered by the state police (he hired someone to administer his own test, which authorities refused to accept as evidence). These and other misrepresentations have been rebutted in more detail by independent, highly respected journalists, including this most recent article here.
With all the attempts to misrepresent the facts, it is important to be reminded of the truth contained in court documents from the only final ruling in this case, by the New York Supreme Court in 1992. In denying my father all access to me, that court:
Debunked the "experts" my father claims exonerated him, calling them "colored by their loyalty to Mr. Allen", criticizing the author of their report (who never met me) for destroying all supporting documentation, and calling their conclusions "sanitized and therefore less credible". Included testimony from babysitters who witnessed inappropriate sexual behavior by my father toward me.
Found that "there is no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen's contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen's resort to the stereotypical 'woman scorned' defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult."
Concluded that the evidence "...proves that Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her."
Finally, the Connecticut State prosecutor found "probable cause" to prosecute, but made the decision not to in an effort to protect "the child victim", given my fragile state.
From the bottom of my heart, I will be forever grateful for the outpouring of support I have received from survivors and countless others. If speaking out about my experience can help others stand up to their tormentors, it will be worth the pain and suffering my father continues to inflict on me. Woody Allen has an arsenal of lawyers and publicists but the one thing he does not have on his side is the truth. I hope this is the end of his vicious attacks and of the media campaign by his lawyers and publicists, as he's promised. I won't let the truth be buried and I won't be silenced.
