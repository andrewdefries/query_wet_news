ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- President Bush arrived Sunday in Istanbul to attend the NATO summit with hopes of persuading the international body to help train Iraqi forces after Iraqis officially take control of their country on Wednesday. Bush's visit comes amid a report from Arab TV network Al-Jazeera that Iraqi terrorists kidnapped three Turkish citizens and threatened to behead them in 72 hours if Turkey does not pull its companies out of Iraq.According to the text read by the Al-Jazeera anchor, the kidnappers called on the people of Iraq to denounce Bush's visit to Turkey and to insist Turkish companies leave Iraq.Tens of thousands of Turks, many chanting anti-Bush slogans, demonstrated in the streets of Istanbul on Sunday.Bush traveled to Ankara, Turkey, on Saturday for advance meetings with Turkish leaders.U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is traveling with the president, said Bush assured Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan the United States is doing all it can to secure the safe release of the hostages. In his meeting with Erdogan, Bush also reiterated his backing for Turkey's European Union membership bid and said the country was a model for Muslim democracy."I appreciate so very much the example your country has set on how to be a Muslim country and at the same time a country which embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom," Bush said.In an effort to stem terrorist acts, Iraq's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi is asking NATO to help train Iraqi forces as his country takes the reins of power on Wednesday.In Ireland on Saturday for a summit with European Union leaders, Bush urged NATO to accept Allawi's request."They have to have their forces, their police well trained and well prepared to meet the threat of the few who want to derail the ambitions of the many," the U.S. leader said.Powell expressed confidence Sunday that NATO will give a positive response to Allawi's request for assistance in training troops."We'll certainly know tomorrow when NATO meets, but every indication I have now is that NATO is coming together to say that they would be willing to provide police and military training to Iraqi forces," Powell told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."National security adviser Condoleezza Rice told ABC's "This Week" that there is a "very good chance" that NATO will respond positively to Allawi's request.Allawi is considering a state of emergency to enforce law in Iraq after the June 30 handover.NATO Secretary-General Japp de Hoop Scheffer expressed confidence that Allawi's request will be debated and approved at Monday's summit in Istanbul."President Allawi will have an answer on what he has asked," de Hoop Scheffer said Saturday. De Hoop Scheffer said NATO ambassadors reached an initial agreement on Allawi's request at a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday.On Sunday, de Hoop Scheffer said NATO instructors could work both inside and outside Iraq to train Iraqi forces. "I cannot give you details on numbers as yet," he said. "NATO is going to do training. Training is essential. ... It can be both inside and outside the country." In an interview with Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore daily, de Hoop Scheffer said the world must not stand by and watch Iraq "go up in flames." He said NATO must also remain committed to Afghanistan, keeping its promise to the government there, Reuters reported. "The international community in its entirety, not just NATO, cannot allow itself to see Afghanistan return to being a safe haven for terrorism," he said. "The same goes for Iraq, which cannot go up in flames amid general indifference. Because the entire region would be destabilized." The 26-member alliance also will look for links with the Arab nations of the Middle East to help stabilize the region. Monday's summit comes just ahead of the June 30 handover in Iraq, and a key question in Istanbul will be whether NATO should formally take on a new role in Iraq.Seventeen member nations are already in Iraq individually helping the U.S.-led coalition. However, NATO members such as Germany and France opposed the war and say they will not send troops.A new U.N. resolution that recognizes Iraq's interim government has begun to bridge the gap.Bush's visit and the NATO summit are taking place under heavy security, after a devastating bomb blast killed four people and wounded a dozen others on Thursday.Turkey has deployed more than 25,000 security forces and established security perimeters around the summit venue, closing some 200 streets and re-routing commuter ferry boats away from ports near the site.Oil tankers have been banned from the Bosporus Strait, the waterway that connects Istanbul's Asian and European sides.Summit organizers fear a repeat of last November's terror attacks in Istanbul, when four suicide bombers killed more than 60 people, including the British consul.CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh and Robin Oakley contributed to this reportStory Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Space station won't have to dodge satellite debrisStory Highlights Avoidance maneuver not necessary to avoid satellite debris The exact size of the Soviet-era debris is unknown, scientists say Space station crew earlier was forced to take shelter because of other debris Next Article in Technology » Read EXPLAINER (CNN) -- NASA won't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a Soviet-era satellite spinning around Earth, the space agency announced Monday. NASA says debris won't threaten the international space station, seen here from Endeavour in November 2008. Mission controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston warned earlier that a piece of the Kosmos 1275 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early Tuesday morning. But after further study, NASA determined no evasive action would be needed, said Paul Dye, flight director for the space shuttle Discovery, which is en route to the station. "The latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern, so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be," Dye told reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Discovery lifted off from Florida on Sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. ET Tuesday. The spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager. The dimensions of the satellite debris were not known Monday. The object was expected to pass "on the fringes" of the 2 km-by-25 km-by-25 km (1.25 mile-by-15 mile-by-15 mile) safety zone controllers monitor, Dye said. "It's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000," he said. Don't Miss Space shuttle Discovery launches after repairs Space station has close call with orbiting junk
The space shuttle Discovery is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking Tuesday, but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris, said LeRoy Cain, the shuttle program's deputy manager. Last week, a piece of debris forced the space station's current crew -- astronauts Mike Fincke and Sandy Magnus, and cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov -- to take shelter in its escape capsule, a rare close call for the orbiting platform, NASA said. That object, a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission, was about 5 inches across, and moving at nearly 20,000 mph. It passed within 3 miles of the station early Thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way, controllers said. iReport.com: See, share your photos of launches and space Cain called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a "random" occurrence, but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk. "It's part of the business," he said. "It comes with the territory, and we'll continue to do whatever's necessary to avoid debris."

Israel to investigate timing of settlement announcement Clinton: Israeli action an insultSTORY HIGHLIGHTS Israel to look into announcement of housing project made during Vice President Biden's visit Housing units will be built in disputed East Jerusalem U.S. says settlement decision could derail talks between Israelis, Palestinians Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set up a team to investigate why officials announced new settlement construction in disputed territory while U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was visiting the country. Netanyahu announced the probe Sunday after a meeting with ministers the day before. "There was an unfortunate incident that was unintentional, and it was hurtful and surely should not have occurred," Netanyahu said Sunday morning. "We appointed a team that will find the chain of events in order to ensure procedures that make sure incidents like this do not happen in the future." The Israeli announcement of construction in East Jerusalem came during Biden's visit last week. It complicated U.S. efforts to set up so-called proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the timing of the announcement "insulting" to the United States. The construction, announced Tuesday, will be in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood, located in largely Arab East Jerusalem. Planning of the building project has taken several years and final approval won't come for more than a year, Netanyahu's office said, and actual construction is likely to take several more years. U.S. President Barack Obama's top adviser echoed Clinton's comments on the issue, calling the Israeli move an "affront" and an "insult." "What it did was it made more difficult a very difficult process," David Axelrod told ABC's "This Week." "We've just gotten proximity, so-called proximity talks, going between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and this seemed calculated to undermine that." Axelrod said Israel is a "strong and special ally" and for that reason, "this was not the right way to behave." White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called Netanyahu's expression of regret "a good start" in resolving the issue. "I think what would be an even better start is coming to the table with constructive ideas for constructive and trustful dialogue about moving the peace process forward," Gibbs told "Fox News Sunday." Gibbs added, "There's no doubt that that was not a bright spot for the Israeli government." Biden arrived in Israel on Monday, meeting first with Israeli President Shimon Peres at his official residence in Jerusalem and then with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden emphasized the close relationship between the United States and Israel as he met with Israeli leaders Tuesday, a visit that also touched on relations with the Palestinians and Iran. However, later Tuesday, after getting word of the settlement announcement, Biden said the United States condemned Israel's decision to build the 1,600 housing units in the Jerusalem neighborhood, calling it "a step that undermines the trust we need right now." The Israeli Interior Ministry said the construction plan was approved by a district committee, and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days. "I mean it was just really a very unfortunate and difficult moment for everyone -- the United States, our vice president who had gone to reassert our strong support for Israeli security -- and I regret deeply that that occurred and made that known," Clinton said Friday. Clinton added that she has no reason to believe that Netanyahu knew about the announcement during Biden's visit, but added, "He is the prime minister. Like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately, you are responsible." The controversy over Israel's announcement came just a day after George Mitchell, the Obama administration's special envoy for Middle East peace, announced that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted indirect talks. Mitchell said Monday that the two sides, with him acting as intermediary, had begun to discuss the "structure and scope" of the talks. "I will return to the region next week to continue our discussions," Mitchell said. "As we've said many times, we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible." Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled for more than a year, despite the Obama administration's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Under current agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel maintains full control over the West Bank and its borders, while the Palestinian government oversees administration of major population centers.CNN's Shira Medding contributed to this report.

Australia getting 'soft' says swim coach
By Madison Park, CNN
updated 5:25 AM EDT, Thu August 9, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Swim coach says Australian athletes are too busy socializing and getting "soft"
Ken Wood also trained China's double gold winner Ye Shiwen
Other athletes say Australia's performance in the Olympics has different factors
(CNN) -- An Australian swim coach has tough love for his compatriots in the Olympics this year: "We're getting too soft. Our work ethic has dropped down."
Ken Wood, the swim coach who helped train China's double gold winner Ye Shiwen, one of the Olympic surprises this year, said the Australians "cannot afford to be soft" to compete with Chinese swimmers.
Wood, a three-time Olympic coach with 40 years of experience, questioned the work ethic of Aussie athletes, saying those in London seemed to be more interested in socializing.
"They're running their mobile phones, Twittering and Facebook and everything else," Wood said. "It was more of a carnival atmosphere."
Australia, usually a swimming powerhouse, is grappling with a disappointing showing in the London Games this year, compared with its Beijing performance in 2008.
Wood has coached swimmers and record breakers such as Australia's Leisel Jones and Geoff Huegill. He first started coaching Ye when she was 14 years old. China has a system that identifies promising young talent between the ages of seven and 12, he said.

Why is Australia faltering at Games?

Australia's London Games shame
He called the unfounded allegations of doping surrounding Ye as "absolute rubbish."
"A lot of the credit has to go to Ye Shiwen's Chinese coach. He's done a great job with her," Wood said.
And the rising Chinese dominance in swimming is unlikely to fade, he added.
"It's not a matter of if China is going to be No. 1 in swimming nation, it's just when they will be," Wood said.
As of Thursday, Australia is 11th in the medal rankings, with 5 golds, 12 silvers and 9 bronze. Australia had finished the Beijing games with 14 gold medals and in 6th place in the medal rankings.
Australian media has bemoaned the country's performance, and the fact that the swimming nation has won one gold in the pool this Olympics. It has inspired a review of Australia's swimming program, headed by former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill.
Swimming legend Ian Thorpe has suggested that less funding for sports could be one of the factors contributing to the country's lacklustre showing.
"I think it would be great if we actually have a debate about this in Australia and actually talk about what the next 20 years of sport will look like. Sport needs to be included in the health budget," said the five-time gold medal winner.
London Olympics: Where is Australia?
Some Australian athletes have been pushing back on the criticism about their lack of gold medals in London.
"It's bloody hard to make an Olympics final, let alone get a medal," said Sally Pearson, who won silver in Beijing and also set a new Olympic record in a gold-winning performance in the 100m hurdles on Wednesday.
"I think it's quite silly saying silver and bronze don't get counted in a medal tally, because it feels like they're not worth anything and they certainly are."
She said she was "disappointed" by the response back home.
"To say that silver's not good enough -- it's rubbish," Pearson said.
Addressing the criticism of the Aussie team, she said: "We've come together as a really strong team. We're like a little family. I don't think anyone really feels we've done so badly, because we're so proud of everyone."

Howser grew up in Tennessee, graduated from the University of Tennessee, worked on a U.S. senator's staff and served in the U.S. Marine Corps, according to a biography posted on his company website. He then launched his television career at WSM in Nashville.
He moved on to a job hosting a magazine-style TV series at WCBS in New York before landing in Los Angeles in 1981 as a reporter for KCBS.
Six years later, Howser joined forces with KCET, a public television station, to produce a program known as "Videolog" showcasing the stories of all types of people.
That led to "California's Gold" and six other series about life in the Golden State, including "Visiting with Huell Howser," "Road Trip with Huell Howser," "California's Golden Parks," "California's Green," "California's Water" and "Downtown." In addition to California, his shows could be seen in Oregon, Nevada and Tennessee.
Less than 20 minutes after KCET posted news of Howser's death on its Facebook page, more than 150 fans had posted responses mourning his loss and remembering his impact on California and their lives.
They remembered him as "amazing," a "favorite" and "one-of-a-kind talent" who also possessed a "kind curiosity."
One man said that news of Howser's death "brought tears to my eyes like I lost a friend," and another remarked that "Sunday evenings will not be the same."
"So I guess God needed a host for 'Heaven's Gold,'" wrote another Facebook commenter. "We will miss you, but you will live on ... and on."

Physicians group labels obesity a disease
By Jacque Wilson, CNN
updated 2:07 PM EDT, Wed June 19, 2013
If you're in need of some inspiration to tackle your weight loss goal, look no further. CNN regularly profiles people who have lost a significant amount of weight. See their physical transformations by clicking through the gallery, then get started on your own. When you hit your goal weight, we want to hear about it. For years, Bryan Ganey worked the night shift, binging on fast food and soda for breakfast, lunch and dinner. By 37, he had a body mass index of 87 (anything more than 30 is considered obese). Then a pulmonary embolism changed his life. He says he's lost 370 pounds. Darrin Cook grew up in New Orleans, where food was the center of his family's life. After evacuating for Hurricane Katrina, food became a comfort and a reminder of home. At his heaviest, Cook weighed 390 pounds. Between 2006 and 2010, he lost 175 pounds. Cook now weighs 240. Michelle Jackson was terrified to turn 40 in 2013, fearing that a slowing metabolism would prevent her from ever getting healthy. Determined to take control, she dropped 100 pounds in less than two years and has continued to maintain her weight loss. Even her 10-year-old son has been inspired to pick up healthier habits. Mark Rucker's friends call him "The Beast" for a reason. Since February 2011 -- while dropping 100 pounds -- he's participated in a 5K, a 10K, a half-marathon, a marathon and an Ironman competition. Drew Manning's story shocked America. The fitness trainer purposely put on 70 pounds last year, only to drop it all in six months. Manning said his goal was to understand better what his clients were going through as they struggled to lose weight. Jordan Teuscher convinced his whole family to join the HealthyWage challenge. They lost a combined 255 pounds and won $10,000. Marriage, any good therapist will tell you, is a balancing act. For Angela and Willie Gillis, the act is easy. They've been best friends for more than 10 years and married for three. They say their individual strengths balance the other's weaknesses. They credit this sense of balance with helping them lose a combined 500 pounds.
LaVerne Hart gave her daughter two pieces of advice before succumbing to the cancer that had spread throughout her body. "Save money. Lose weight." Cherie Hart Steffen says her mother's words are forever etched into her brain. Since then, she's lost 85 pounds. After her college roommate died in 2009, Jacki Monaco treated her depression with junk food. Over the next two years, she gained 100 pounds. In 2011, she was diagnosed with binge eating disorder. She learned how to have a healthy relationship with food and has since dropped 70 pounds. Marcelo Cedeno lost more than 50 pounds after a friend told him he was "unconciously hurting himself" with his unhealthy eating habits. Cedeno started working out for an hour a day and made smarter food choices to drop the weight. Melissa Schaaf thought losing 80 pounds would be her biggest battle until she was diagnosed with stage I leiomyosarcoma. Schaaf says her gym and healthy eating habits helped get her through chemotherapy. The doctor had flat out told Dale Benzine: "Lose weight or die." Benzine decided to get gastric bypass surgery, reducing his stomach to the size of a golf ball. He's dropped 130 pounds by eating small, healthy portions multiple times a day. At her heaviest in March 2011, Theresa Borawski weighed 428 pounds. "I could no longer participate in life's activities and was forced to become a spectator while people around me lived their life," she wrote on iReport.com. "Today, I am 276 pounds lighter, 14 jean sizes smaller, and no longer need a wheelchair, walker or cane to get around."
At 310 pounds, Deidre Robinson knew she'd have restrictions at the theme park, but that didn't make her feel any less humiliated when she was told she couldn't ride the roller coaster with her daughter. Less than two years later, Robinson had dropped more than half her body weight -- going from a size 24 to a size 2.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The American Medical Association adopts a new policy on obesity
The change diagnoses nearly one-third of Americas with a medical condition
AMA decision could increase funding for future research, doctor reimbursement
(CNN) -- One word could have a big impact on the way doctors treat obesity in the United States.
The American Medical Association has adopted a new policy that officially labels obesity as a disease "requiring a range of medical interventions to advance obesity treatment and prevention," according to an AMA statement.
The physicians' group voted to approve the obesity policy, among others, on Tuesday during its annual meeting in Chicago.
The U.S. obesity rate increased almost 50% between 1997 and 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Today, nearly 30% of American adults are considered obese, and the problem is almost as prevalent in kids. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 30 years, the CDC says.

Obesity for adults is defined as having a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher. BMI is a way to measure body fat based on your weight and height. (Calculate your BMI here)
Being obese increases your risk factor for developing many serious conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, liver disease, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. In fact, obesity has been linked to almost every chronic disease in some way or another.
"Recognizing obesity as a disease will help change the way the medical community tackles this complex issue," AMA board member Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement.
Obesity has long been recognized as a disease by other groups, but this move by the AMA sends a strong signal to the medical community, said CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
Some experts worry suddenly declaring one-third of Americans "ill" or "sick" will increase the desire for quick interventions or medications and discourage people from making the lifestyle changes known to combat obesity.
On the other hand, AMA's declaration could help increase funding for future obesity research. It could also lead to payment for doctors who want to simply talk to patients about nutrition or exercise -- time that's not currently reimbursed by insurance plans.
Identifying obesity as a disease may also help in reducing the stigma often associated with being overweight, said Joe Nadglowski, president and CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition.
"Obesity has been considered for a long time to be a failure of personal responsibility -- a simple problem of eating too much and exercising too little," he said. "But it's a complex disease... we're hoping attitudes will change."
Nadglowski thinks the AMA's support is also an important step in helping people gain access to obesity treatment. Most forms of insurance do not cover obesity alone. For instance, an obese patient cannot hire a nutritionist or a trainer and have it covered by his or her plan simply to lose weight.
"We do cover treatment connected with a co-morbidity," says Don McLeod, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. "For example, if you have diabetes and obesity is aggravating the diabetes, we might cover obesity treatment as a way of treating the diabetes."
Obesity-related health care expenses cost Americans between $147 billion to $210 billion per year. Preventing and treating obesity before it leads to more serious diseases could help combat these costs, Nadglowski says.
AMA's decision comes at an interesting time. The Obesity Action Coalition has been working to introduce the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act in Congress.
The bill was re-introduced in the House on Wednesday and will be re-introduced in the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, according to the office of Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, one of the measure's sponsors. A similar bill last year stalled in committee.
The bill would increase obesity treatment options for Medicare patients, expand the types of providers who can offer obesity counseling and take away some obesity medication limits.

Banksy's NYC street art: Trashed or very quickly treasured
By Chris Boyette, CNN
updated 4:06 PM EDT, Wed October 30, 2013
A set of balloons that read "BANKSY!" tied to the side of a warehouse could be seen off the Long Island Expressway in Queens on Thursday, October 31. It is likely Banksy's final piece during his stint in New York. Banksy also offered up a T-shirt design on his site on October 31 for fans to download and print on their own.
A leopard placed on the wall of Yankee Stadium was revealed on October 30. "The Banality of the Banality of Evil," a work by the British street artist Banksy, actually started out as a thrift store painting in New York City.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Two dozen Banksy originals dot New York City
Many of the exhibits follow his signature street-art style
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has criticized his works
New York (CNN) -- The 24th piece in Banksy's monthlong street art residency in New York City is in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, on the garage door of Larry Flynt's infamous strip joint: The Hustler Club.
The famously anonymous British graffiti artist stenciled a man holding a bouquet of flowers.
INTERACTIVE: Explore Banksy in New York
"Waiting in vain... at the door of the club," reads the text accompanying photos of the stencil posted on Banksy's website.
Every day this month, Banksy has been unveiling new works of art around New York. The works are then announced on his website and posted to Instagram. Many of the surprise exhibits follow his signature street-art style: stencils spray-painted on streets, walls of buildings and under bridges.
Others include an animated YouTube video showing what appears to be footage of jihadist militants shooting down an animated Dumbo the Elephant and traveling installations, including a slaughterhouse delivery truck full of stuffed animals touring the city. Also produced are performance art pieces such as a dirt-smeared boy shining the shoes of a life-sized statue of Ronald McDonald.

Many of Banksy's pieces in The Big Apple don't last long after they are located, either defaced by local graffiti artists who don't like an outsider on their turf, or relocated and preserved to be sold to galleries and collectors by whomever owns the property Banksy happened to choose as his canvas.
Opinion: Banksy's insult shows he's clueless about New York
On Tuesday, Banksy created a 1/36 scale replica of the Great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinder blocks. A video posted to YouTube shows a team of men loading it into a truck, and the New York Post reported the owner of a nearby business moved the sculpture in response to a top-dollar bid to purchase the piece.
Fans of the mysterious graffiti artist worried for him Wednesday, when a sign posted on his website reading only, "Today's art has been canceled due to police activity."
Banksy didn't explain. NYPD Detective Marc Nell told CNN that police were made aware of the artist's statement when people called to ask about it, but they don't know to what he was referring.
The week before, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested Banksy is breaking the law with his guerrilla art exhibits.
Annette Markowski, an NYPD public information officer, told CNN police have not launched an investigation of Banksy because they have not received any complaints of vandalism related to the artist.
Banksy's reputation was made on the streets of London, and he seems to have made his art all over -- from New Orleans on the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina to the West Bank.
But until the end of the month, the politically charged, controversial graffiti artist is expected to remain in New York City.
Could the next Banksy come from Dubai?
