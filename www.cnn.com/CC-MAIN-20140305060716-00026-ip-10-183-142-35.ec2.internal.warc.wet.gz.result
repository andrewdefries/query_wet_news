Chayes: Too dangerous to tread without a turban
By Sarah Chayes Special to CNN Adjust font size:
Editor's note: Sarah Chayes covered the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan for National Public Radio in late 2001. She left journalism to run a major aid organization and is author of a new book, "The Punishment of Virtue: Inside Afghanistan after the Taliban."KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- "Sarah, I really think it would be better if you wore a turban when you drive around," Abd al-Ahad, one of the members of my cooperative, said earnestly over supper.The next day, he took a regulation 6-yard-long white silk turban home with him to cut it down, so it would not be so unwieldy for me to wear. He felt it was becoming just too dangerous for me not to blend in.I live and work in Kandahar, Afghanistan, fabled former capital of the Taliban regime and site of a rising insurgency. And I do drive around in a battered red pickup truck, which itself was Taliban booty in its day.But I can't drive everywhere I used to any more. I don't go to Panjwayi, for example, even though our cooperative has planted plots of roses there. Earlier this year, we attended district council meetings in Panjwayi all the time. But Panjwayi is now the frontline in what many dub a startling resurgence of the Taliban or their progeny. Since April, savage battles have pitted Taliban fighters against Afghan government forces backed by American or Canadian troops.For the ordinary people, the weathered greybeards, the extended families of 20 souls or more who tend serried ranks of grapevines leaning on mud walls, this struggle is between two factions, neither of which represents them. "The Taliban prey on us at night, and the government preys on us by day," said another member of my cooperative. "We don't know which way to turn."Her cousin's family had just left their land. Like hundreds of other village households on the outskirts of Kandahar, they abandoned their precious vineyards and moved to the relative safety of the city.Panjwayi district elders recently offered an arrangement to Taliban leaders."We don't have a dog in this fight. If you want to fight the government, that's your business," the district council president said to me, paraphrasing the elders' message. "We'll evacuate any village to serve as your battlefield. We'll empty the people out of it for as long as you want. But then, do your fighting there, don't come and hide among civilians."The salient point is this -- these villagers' fundamental concerns are not ideological; they are utterly practical. Afghans want from their government very much what we want from ours -- schools for their children, roads for bringing their produce to market, accountability, and some kind of say in their collective destiny.But the government the United States ushered into power after the fall of the Taliban has not delivered. This Afghan government -- in the form of soldiers who shake down passers-by for money or cell phones or judges who extract exorbitant bribes for doing their job or governors who arrogate land or natural resources for their personal use -- has disgusted Afghans with the very notion of "democracy," if this chaos they are experiencing is called democracy.For those of us who have been living in Kandahar since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the current insurgency is not surprising at all. We have been watching it develop for the past four years. It is the inevitable consequence of recruiting unsavory allies in the war on terror. It is the inevitable consequence of ignoring ordinary people's desire to be governed with dignity. Ironically, in Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the so-called war on terror, as it has been conducted, has arguably expanded terrorism, not defeated it.What is your take on this commentary? E-mail usThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer. This article is part of a series of occasional opinion pieces on CNN.com that offer a broad range of perspectives that express a variety of thoughts and points of view.Your responsesCNN.com asked readers for their thoughts on this commentary. We received a lot of excellent responses. Below you will find a small selection of those e-mails, some of which have been edited for length and spelling.When will the U.S. government ever learn? When you sleep with dogs, you end up with fleas. How can our government possibly justify putting criminals into power in Afghanistan and calling it democracy? We are very lucky to have people like those in NGOs around the world so that the people of war-torn nations don't think Americans are all like our so-called leaders. M. O'Connor, Hartford, ConnecticutWow, what an article. It pointed out how hard democracy can be to attain. The U.S quick fix is not that at all. Our country's push for democracy is like the missionaries' push for Christianity. They go in and make changes and leave or leave poorly trained people in authority. The missionaries disrupted culture, ways of everyday life, and left confused angry people whose beliefs they once had are now ... wrong? They now have nothing to fall back on. The United States left behind a democracy? Not quite. The Taliban regime, corrupt and harsh. Now they try to build a democracy, but it turns out that too is corrupt and bringing hardships to everyday life. Jo Gallagher, Colmar, PennsylvaniaI am surprised that this commentary does not reference the recent data from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime that just reported a 59 percent increase in opium cultivation from the previous year and an overall record. This largely is the economy of the Taliban and undermining any success of the struggling Afghanistan government. Peter Fasano, Atlanta, GeorgiaWe are also a fair way down the road to losing Afghanistan without making any permanent difference. Thugs still rule in Afghanistan, ordinary Afghanis are still oppressed, and the opium trade is worse than before. The only thing that's changed about Afghanistan is the identity of the thugs. Bonnie Wendorff, McFarland, WisconsinYou made the comment "Ironically, in Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the so-called war on terror, as it has been conducted, has arguably expanded terrorism, not defeated it." However, your article does not support that conclusion. Everything you described about Afghanistan was true throughout its history. Could you please provide more concrete examples from your personal experience that shows how the ranks of Islamic extremists have grown and the number of terror acts have increased? Also, how do you recommend reducing the localized violence and corruption, as well as dealing with those who plot international terror? R. Technuf, Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaI understand that the U.S. has commitment to the world, but if the Taliban can run freely within Afghanistan, then the U.S. can run out of Afghanistan. We need to stop all aid, withdraw our troops, pack it up and come home. Let the civil war begin. David Figueroa, Chicago, IllinoisI think that the author wrote a fine article. Welcome to reality. Should anyone not expect a certain amount of corruption within government appointments? The fact that the villagers feel squeezed by two groups of armed thugs should come to no surprise. Politics and corruption go hand in hand. Corrupt judges, police, politicians are nothing new to any part of the world. The amount of corruption will depend on the culture along with the economic stability of the region. I applaud the author for telling the story of the frustrations felt by the Afghan people.

Geithner: Economy healing, but deficit must go downStory Highlights Treasury secretary insists that the economic collapse is "not going to happen" Next year will be marked by job losses gradually slowing down Key to fixing the economy, Tim Geithner said, is to draw down the deficit Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. economy is no longer on the edge of collapse, but Americans face tough choices in reducing the national deficit, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Sunday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said Americans must have the will to help bring the deficit down. His assessment following a week of upbeat economic indicators was echoed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others, but Republican critics countered the country was mortgaging its future economic stability. Geithner said he expected continued economic improvement for the rest of 2009 and a reversal in job losses the following year. "What you're going to see first is growth turn positive," he said on the ABC program "This Week." Then the pace of job losses would slow, with job creation possible next year, Geithner said. In the meantime, he said, the government will consider extending unemployment benefits that will run out soon for more than a million Americans. Both Geithner and Greenspan, appearing on the same show, insisted that the economy would not collapse. They said, however, that emergency steps, including the bailout plan last year and the economic stimulus bill this year, are expanding the federal budget deficit to unsustainable levels. "We will not get this economy back on track, recovery will be not strong and sustained, unless we ... can convince the American people that we're going to have the will to bring these deficits down once recovery is firmly established," Geithner said. Geithner refused to rule out future tax increases, saying President Barack Obama's administration would take whatever steps were necessary to reduce the deficit once the economy recovers. Greenspan said he believed the government eventually will impose some kind of value-added tax to raise revenue. Don't Miss U.S., China agree to economic strategies
Commentary: Can U.S. afford trillion more in debt?
A value-added tax is assessed on the transfer of goods and services from production to delivery, with consumers ultimately paying higher prices. It differs from a sales tax, which is directly assessed on consumers when they buy something. Greenspan called a value-added tax "the least worst solution," saying it "the only thing that raises revenue in significant quantities without significantly impacting the economy." However, Republican Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana refused to credit government policies for the encouraging economic signals, saying progress has happened "in spite of the prescriptions of Washington." "I think what we're seeing in the economy now is the inherent resilience of the American economy and the American people," Pence said on "Fox News Sunday." "What I'm saying is that this piecemeal approach -- government handouts through a government bureaucracy -- is no substitute for broad-based tax relief and fiscal discipline in Washington." Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who lost to Obama in last year's presidential election, conceded that the $787 billion stimulus package had helped, maintained it was at too high a cost. "I think it's very clear that the stimulus has had some effect," McCain said on CNN's "State of the Union." "But, what I worry more than anything about is the long-term effects." "We have put trillions of additional debt on future generations of Americans," he said, adding: "The long-term consequences, I think, are going to be, unfortunately, devastating unless we do something about it." One issue -- the "cash for clunkers" provision in the stimulus package -- highlighted differences in the party's perspectives. The program, which provides payments of up to $4,500 for people who trade in gas-guzzling older vehicles for newer models with better fuel efficiency, is in danger of running out of money three months early because too many people rushed to take advantage of it. National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers hailed the program as "far more successful than people expected," in terms of car sales generated and environmental benefits. But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina said on "Fox News Sunday" it was a matter of short-term gain for long-term pain. "I just think this is a great example of the stupidity that's coming out of Washington right now, and I think Americans realize the numbers that we're throwing around don't work," DeMint said. "We estimated this would cost $1 billion. Now they're saying we need $2 billion more. Our children and grandchildren can't afford to make these car dealers well right now." On another issue of sharp divide -- overhauling the health-care system -- Geithner and Summers said it was necessary to halt spiraling costs that will greatly expand future deficits. "The first and most important thing in getting the federal deficit under control is substantial reform of the health care system," Summers said. Republicans oppose all three Democratic health care proposals voted out of congressional committees so far. Democratic and Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee are negotiating a compromise plan that would be the first bipartisan bill so far. The main debate is over a government-funded public option favored by Obama and Democrats, but opposed by Republicans. Democrats say the public option would provide needed competition to more expensive private health insurers, while Republicans call it a first step toward the government taking over the health care system. The Senate Finance negotiators are considering a provision to set up nonprofit health care cooperatives that would allow members to negotiate collective coverage plans as an alternative to a public option. McCain said Sunday he didn't like any of the ideas so far. "The co-ops remind us all of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," he said, referring to the mortgage finance giants taken over by the government last year during the economic crisis. "And so I have not seen a public option that, in my view, meets the test of what would really not eventually lead to a government takeover." Geithner, however, said all parties must recognize the need for what he called "a big, consequential reform" of health care. "Ideally, you want to do this with as broad a base of consensus as possible," he said. "But people on the Hill are going to have to make that choice. Do they want to help shape this and be part of it, or do they want this country, the United States of America, to go another several decades without doing what every other serious country has done, which is to give their citizens access to basic quality care?"

HIV in 2000s: Love, betrayal and a calling By Madison Park, CNN Tonya Rasberry, 36, works as a HIV/AIDS peer counselor. She is here with her kids, Seaduan, Erykah and Tionne Johnson. STORY HIGHLIGHTS30 years of HIV/AIDS has raised the stakes of unprotected sexWoman finds out her husband has AIDS, and takes care of himMore African-American and Hispanic women affected by HIV/AIDSOn June 5, 1981, the virus that would become known as HIV was mentioned for the first time in a medical publication. As we approach that anniversary, CNNHealth takes a look at 30 years of the epidemic that changed the world, through the eyes of people who have lived it. (CNN) -- Tonya Rasberry dialed her husband's number, her composure shaken and her nerves numb. She dreaded the call, but her husband picked up immediately. "I got my test results back," she told him. For a brief moment, silence hung in the air. "What'd the doctor say?" he asked. For the first time, the words fell out of her mouth: "I'm positive, too." Rasberry heard his telephone drop -- it clattered against the hospital's tiled floor. She could hear his muffled cry -- the painful, gut wrenching cry that shakes a person so hard they can't make a sound. "I ruined your life," he would tell her later. "I killed my family." Her husband had AIDS. And now, she had HIV. Rasberry could have thrown him out of their home, gathered their three kids and left him. Instead, she chose a different route. She forgave him. The modern epidemic In the 30 years of HIV/AIDS, the virus has changed the way people think about sex and has raised the stakes of unprotected intimacy. Since the virus was first reported on June 5, 1981, the disease has killed more than 25 million people worldwide. Today, about 33 million are living with HIV/AIDS -- more than a million in the United States. In the United States, the demographic of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has spread from gay men in the 1980s to heterosexual minority women in the 1990s and 2000s. It disproportionately affects people of color: African-Americans and Hispanics. "Although the numbers in the decades have been stable, the rates of the disease are unacceptably high," said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, about the toll on African-American and Hispanic women. "New diagnoses are 19-22 times of white women in the U.S. That's a startling statistic." Rasberry, 36, embodies another challenge of a modern day epidemic. She knew about HIV/AIDS from public health campaigns, but never imagined it would touch her -- after all, she was married. Many women believe they are in monogamous relationships and later find out they got HIV from their partners, said Ingrid Floyd, executive director of Iris House Inc., a program for HIV-positive women in Harlem. "How do you deal with that," Floyd said, "that your partner lives with the disease and never disclosed to you?" The virus attacks immune systems but also leaves patients with the sting of betrayal. Could they trust another person again? There's an even more difficult question. "For many of them, there's a fear of rejection," Floyd said. "If you're HIV-positive, there's the whole disclosure part. Is someone going to accept your HIV status?" Young love They met on a hot May night in 1994. A 19-year-old Rasberry had finished a day of busing tables at a Seattle seafood restaurant. She and her girlfriends had planned a night in the city. Dolled up in miniskirt and heels, they were crossing a street when a man called out to Rasberry. It was important that he talk to her, he said. He was with his friends and they bet that he couldn't talk to a gorgeous girl like her. Rasberry eyed the older man. She stood an inch taller. At 5 feet 5, he had a stocky build and broad shoulders, the structure of a former football player. But what he lacked in stature, he made up for in charisma. His name was Eric. Right away, she noticed he was nothing like other boys she had dated. He was a gentleman, always opening doors for her. And it was easy to get swept away at 19. He brought her to the nicest restaurants, surprised her with balloons and champagne. "He was a sweet guy," Rasberry said. "He took me everywhere -- vacations, shopping. I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread." A year later, Rasberry was pregnant with their first child, a boy, Seaduan. Two years later, they welcomed a girl, Erykah, and a year later, another daughter, Tionne. In 2000, the couple married in a simple garden ceremony in California. They raised the kids and a Labrador mix named Smokey in an apartment in Kent, near Seattle. Her husband traveled frequently. He told her he worked in construction. She suspected this wasn't the case. Later, she would learn he had a house in Ohio and a music studio in California. She warned him promiscuous behavior would hurt her and their kids. She wanted a regular family life or she would leave. "I felt like he was willing to make those changes," Rasberry said. "I felt like I could stick in there longer. Then, he got sick shortly after that." Paralysis On a summer night in 2002, Eric wasn't feeling well. After picking up pizza for dinner, he arrived home and crumpled to the floor. Maybe it was his diabetes. Maybe he just had too much sugar. By the time he arrived at the hospital, he couldn't move his right side. Half his face drooped and his right hand curled and froze in place. At 32, he had a brain infection called toxoplasmosis that had caused a stroke. Doctors were perplexed about how he had gotten it. After a slew of tests, his doctor told him: "You have AIDS." HIV/AIDS medications, while lifesaving, aren't as effective when the disease has advanced. In most cases, the patients who don't recover "weren't aware of their status, have co-morbid status, substance abuse, or other chronic illness that make it harder to take HIV medication," said Dr. Judith Currier, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. When patients like Eric are diagnosed in later stages, they are more vulnerable to infections. For patients like Rasberry, who start treatment in the earliest stage of the disease, life expectancy is close to people without HIV. A loss "I didn't have enough time to be sad for myself," Rasberry said about her diagnosis. "There was no time for that." Overnight, she became the breadwinner with four dependents: her paralyzed husband and her kids, all under 10. There was no time for anger. But Rasberry wondered, how had she become infected when she had tested negative for HIV for each of her pregnancies, in 1995, 1997 and 1999? Her children do not have HIV. Her gaze fell to her husband. The businessman who took pride in caring for his family had become bedridden. He was constantly fighting new infections. "I had to dress him and bathe him," Rasberry said. "From that moment, I was doing everything for him." A throat infection obstructed his ability to swallow, so a feeding tube was inserted. Every day, Rasberry pulverized his pills and cleaned his feeding tube. "There was nobody else I'd do that for," she said. Once 300 pounds, he shrank to a third that size. "Every time I changed him or fed him, he would apologize," Rasberry said. "He was sorry about the HIV -- that I had to do this. He just looked so sad." She told the kids their father was sick with diabetes. She took her HIV medication, then she went to work at a collection agency. At night, she'd get dinner for the family and try to help her husband through the night. She was wearing out. As his health faded, Eric went into hospice care in the Seattle area, then to a facility near his family in California. He died on October 6, 2004, from complications of AIDS related to pneumonia. He was 34. "I loved him," Rasberry said. "We have three gorgeous children. I had more good times in the relationship. I like to remember it for those things." A new bond Following her doctor's suggestion, Rasberry went to a woman's group called BABES Network-YWCA. There, she found a sisterhood of women who have been through the betrayals, the grief and the physical toll of HIV/AIDS. Tonya Rasberry sits with her children, from left, Erykah, 13, Tionne, 12, and Seaduan, 15. "A lot of these women and mothers were in relationships, trusting somebody," Rasberry said about the patients she met. "Now their whole life is different." She was paired with a counselor, Nicole Price, who had contracted HIV through a boyfriend. Even though HIV was no laughing matter, "Tonya has a great sense of humor and she's always making us laugh," Price said. Rasberry had a natural openness that put others at ease, even in difficult times, Price observed. It wasn't long before Rasberry became a peer counselor at BABES, guiding Seattle women through the health care and medication maze and the emotional minefield of HIV/AIDS disclosure. This year, the program lost its federal funding, so several staff members, including Rasberry, may lose their jobs in July. Even with the prospect of another loss, Rasberry continues to share her personal story at health events, women's shelters and juvenile detention centers. "HIV is not who I am," Rasberry says during her talks. "It's something I have." Rasberry tells others about her kids, ages 15, 13 and 12, who understand what Rasberry does. They hug her and tell her they're proud of Mom for making a difference. She sticks to her medication and has had no major health problems. Being so open about her HIV-status, Rasberry thought, would turn away love prospects. After all, her face has been plastered on Seattle buses urging residents to get tested for HIV. But last year, Rasberry met a woman at a bar. They struck up a conversation and exchanged phone numbers. Days later, Rasberry mustered her nerve to call her. They chatted pleasantly, until the woman asked what Rasberry did for a living. "I work as an HIV counselor, because I am HIV-positive," Rasberry answered. "Really?" the woman asked. Then, Rasberry braced for the rejection. It never came. The couple has been together nine months now. Rasberry's girlfriend said it's true HIV does not define her, her honesty does. And it only makes her more attractive.

House votes to repeal health care law against long odds By the CNN Wire Staff Pelosi: Health care repeal a no-goSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: McConnell pledges Senate voteNEW: Democrats Boren, McIntyre and Ross voted for repeal"It's a promise kept," a leading Republican says The repeal bill is unlikely to survive the Senate, however Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted to repeal the Obama administration's signature health-care legislation Wednesday evening, a vote the newly elected Republican majority called a fulfillment of their No. 1 campaign promise. The bill, dubbed the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act," passed 245-189. Three Democrats joined a unanimous Republican caucus on the vote. The legislation is unlikely to make it past the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he won't bring it to the floor for a vote. And even if it did, it would face a certain veto by President Barack Obama. But Rep. Mike Pence, a leading GOP conservative, dismissed Democratic criticism that Wednesday's vote was a "gimmick." "We have another term for it on our side of the aisle: It's a promise kept," he said. "And House Republicans are here to stand with the American people and say with one voice, 'We can do better.' We can do better than their government takeover of health care." Republicans have not presented an alternative bill to replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010 over their unanimous opposition. House Speaker John Boehner said Republicans will ask congressional committees to come up with "common-sense reforms" that will widen coverage while bringing down costs, but told reporters no "artificial deadlines" were needed. Most Republicans have acknowledged the virtual impossibility of an outright repeal, but have said they will try to cut funding to portions of the measure or eliminate specific provisions in the months ahead.

The nearly $900 billion health-care law passed Congress in 2010 over unanimous Republican opposition. It is estimated to extend health coverage to 32 million Americans when fully implemented -- the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. It bars health insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, eliminates lifetime caps on coverage and allows families to keep children on their policies until age 26. It requires Americans to obtain health insurance, but also provides subsidies for small businesses and individuals to obtain that coverage. It requires insurers to cover preventive care, and sets up an independent appeals process for people who feel their claims were unfairly denied. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, said the bill would bring back the "bad old days" for many Americans. "Let's talk about the insurance industry pre-reform. They could cancel your policy if you got sick, even though you had been paying the premiums for years. They could refuse to sell you a policy if they don't like the way you look or you had a minor health problem. We changed that," he said. Most Republicans argued the health-care law, passed over their unanimous opposition, will hamper prospects for long-term economic growth while doing little to slow spiraling medical costs -- and many of them, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, argued the law harms American freedoms. "This legislation we seek to repeal is rooted in having federal bureaucrats come between patients and their doctors," Cantor said. But Democrats defended the law, with some sharply criticizing Republican arguments as bogus. "You know, I want to just advise people watching at home playing that now-popular drinking game of 'You take a shot whenever Republicans say something that's not true:' Please assign a designated driver," said Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York. "This is going to be a long afternoon." Not all Democrats opposed the repeal effort, however. Reps. Dan Boren of Oklahoma, Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Mike Ross of Arkansas cast their lot with the Republicans. Republicans also are attempting to get the legislation struck down by federal courts. A federal judge in Florida on Wednesday allowed Ohio, Kansas, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Maine and Iowa to join a lawsuit filed there last year, bringing the total number of states in that case to 26. Virginia is pursuing a separate lawsuit, and Oklahoma says it will bring suit as well. A federal judge in Virginia ruled in December that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional, but two other judges have found the mandate passes constitutional scrutiny. Democrats have warned that a reversal would be catastrophic to small businesses and unfair to millions of Americans depending on the reform to guarantee coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services released an analysis Tuesday morning warning that almost 130 million nonelderly Americans with pre-existing conditions would be at risk of losing their insurance without the guarantees provided by the legislation. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says repealing the measure would cost up to $230 billion by 2021. Republicans dispute that figure, but they have nonetheless exempted the bill from House rules that forbid legislation from adding to the federal debt. In the Senate, Reid has dismissed the GOP repeal effort as "partisan grandstanding." But Cantor, whose fellow Republicans have filibustered large numbers of Democratic bills in the upper chamber, demanded the Senate take up the measure. "The American people deserve a full hearing. They deserve to see this legislation go to the Senate for a full vote," Cantor said. "The Senate ought not be a place that legislation goes into a dead end." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said after the vote that the Senate would vote on the House measure. "The Democratic leadership in the Senate doesn't want to vote on this bill, but I assure you, we will," McConnell said. "We should repeal this law and focus on common sense steps that actually lower costs and encourage private sector job creation." President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have continue to express strong support for the law, which is widely viewed as the president's signature domestic achievement. "I'm willing and eager to work with both Democrats and Republicans to improve the Affordable Care Act. But we can't go backward," Obama said in a statement Tuesday. Leading members of both parties agree on the need for a limited number of changes to the law. Specifically, they have expressed concern about a rule, scheduled to take effect in 2012, requiring businesses to issue 1099 tax forms to any individual or corporation from which they purchase more than $600 in goods or services in a year. "A lot of our small businesses came to me (after the health care overhaul passed) and said, 'There's a lot of paperwork I now have to fill out,' " Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation." "We can change that. That's something we can absolutely agree on." The Budget Office analysis indicates Republicans may have trouble moving ahead with their long-term strategy of cutting funding to the law. The measure includes $106 billion in new spending authorizations that Congress will eventually need to appropriate, according to Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf. But $86 billion of those authorizations cover politically sensitive programs that were in existence before the passage of health care reform. Funding for certain key provisions -- such as the law's Medicaid expansion and the extension of new insurance subsidies -- cannot be cut without a direct repeal vote. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Deirdre Walsh, and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.

Digital tools to preserve your friendships By Andrea Bartz and Brenna Ehrlich, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media Sometimes a friendship can take a turn for the gloomy.

Editor's note: Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz are the sarcastic brains behind humor blog and book Stuff Hipsters Hate. When they're not trolling Brooklyn for new material, Ehrlich works as an associate editor at Mashable.com and Bartz is news editor at Psychology Today. (CNN) -- Aren't friends the greatest? They pick you up when you're down, bring sunshine into your life and execute a litany of other cliches that are central to one's general sense of well-being. Sometimes, however, a friendship can take a turn for the gloomy, as a cloud fashioned of creeping annoyances (She gnashes her teeth! He always smells of tuna! She house-sat for a week, and when I returned, all my goldfish were dead!) obscures the sunshine in our hearts. Enter technology to save the overcast day. While the effect of social media on our interpersonal relationships is hotly contested among those ever-chattering pundits, a recent survey by The Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center gave the web a big old thumbs-up. Eighty-five percent of respondents said their social lives had been improved by it, so we're going to sally forth under that banner for now. Yes, ultimately, many friendships do decay. But there are a ton of apps and services out there that can mitigate those aforementioned annoyances enough that you can at least save the night. Your goldfish, however, are still likely doomed. If your friend is a cheapskate You're having a lovely brunch with a cadre of friends one slightly hung over Sunday morning -- stuffing your maw with eggs and collard greens and trying to remember all the mistakes you made last night -- when the check arrives. Your friends begin the old pass-around, and when the check gets to you, you count the bounty. One of your friends -- incidentally the one who ordered steak and eggs and at least five mimosas -- appears to have only tipped 50 cents. Rage boils in your stomach, marinated in hollandaise sauce, but you hold your tongue, slapping down enough dollars to cover your cheap "a" to the double "s" friend. Everyone has a pal like the one we just described, which is why everyone should probably sign up for Venmo, an iPhone/Android/Blackberry app that lets you make friend-to-friend payments via your phone (the app links your credit card to your cell). That way, when the bill comes, you can simply throw down your credit card, and then use the app to bill your friends for what they owe. Your pals will be happy that you're such a take-charge guy/gal (and relieved that they don't have to do math) and you can save your resentment for the next time said friend forces you to go see her in that off-off-off Broadway version of "Twelfth Night" re-imagined in LOLcat speech. If your friend is a mass-texter Text messages are awesome, a pleasing, digital epistle that tells you someone is thinking about you -- unless, of course, said text message is sent to 20 other friends, in which case, it's a blatant attempt to have plans with someone, anyone. (We even have a friend who dated a guy who would send the same solicitous message to multiple girls at once -- an obnoxious numbers game by which he ensured that he got laid by someone, anyone.) We're all guilty of sending texts to scads of friends at once in an effort to secure weekend plans (an exercise that leads to confusion and frustration), making GroupMe an essential addition to your app library. GroupMe is an Android/iPhone app that allows you to create what is essentially a chat room on your phone. Even people without smartphones can get in on the action, which is awesome for your friend Larry the Luddite and his Samsung Juke. So get a discussion going -- instead of crop-dusting everyone with a blanket invitation to something lame. If you're in a rut "Let's go to that bar." "Which bar?" "The one down on 11th." "We go there all the time. I've dated all the bartenders." "OK. How about that place on Grove?" "We went there last weekend." "That dive on Main?" "I hate the music." "We could just get drunk here and stare at the wall?" "[Sigh] OK, let's go to 11th. I think they hired a new chick, anyway." Ever had a conversation like the one above? Of course you have, because we're all creatures of habit. Sometimes, however, all it takes is an addition to a friend group to unlock a world of brand new activities, watering holes and borrowed clothing. That's where GrubWithUs comes in. The startup is a Meetup-esque service that allows you to eat family-style meals with a new group of people. Yes, there is the possibility that everyone you meet at the dinner will be horrifying and/or socially awkward, but at least then you'll have an amusing anecdote that you can share with your friend. Nothing brings us closer together than laughing at the misfortunes of others, am I right?

U.S. drone strikes kill 12 in Pakistan, officials say By Reza Sayah, CNN
updated 8:39 AM EST, Thu February 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A second drone strike is reported in North Waziristan
The area is believed to be a sanctuary for the Haqqani network Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two U.S. drone strikes killed 12 suspected insurgents Thursday morning in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border, two Pakistani intelligence officials said.
The drone fired two missiles at a suspected militant compound at a village outside Miranshan, the main town in North Waziristan, killing five suspected insurgents, the officials said.
A second drone strike killed seven suspected insurgents in a village near Mir Ali, North Waziristan, the officials said.
The drone fired three missiles at a suspected militant vehicle, they said.
The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
North Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region and widely believed to be a sanctuary for the Haqqani network and other militant groups that fuel the insurgency across the border in Afghanistan.
Based on a CNN count, Thursday's drone strikes were the sixth and seventh this year. There were more than 60 drone strikes last year and more than 110 in 2010.
The attacks have killed scores of militants, but human rights groups say the strikes have also killed hundreds of civilians, including children.
The United States does not publicly acknowledge its drone program, although President Barack Obama commented on such strikes in January and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta acknowledged the use of CIA predator drones in the region last year.

L.A. police use social media to get ID help on possible 'Grim Sleeper' victims
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 12:53 PM EDT, Sat October 20, 2012
Numerous victims in the Grim Sleeper killings remain unidentified. The suspect had many photos in his apartment, police say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Police post photos taken from collection of serial murders suspect
Public can view them on Facebook or Twitter
Lonnie David Franklin Jr. is charged with 10 murders
Police have widened scope of investigation to 230 killings
(CNN) -- Los Angeles police have posted the images of 42 women culled from the photo collection of the "Grim Sleeper" serial murder suspect on social media and the department website, officials announced Thursday.
The photographs were taken between 1976 and 2010, and the women in them have yet to be identified, police said in a news release.
If anyone recognizes one of the women, they can use Twitter (https://twitter.com/LAPDGrimSleeper) or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/pages/LAPD-Grim-Sleeper/269881769790597?fref=ts) to make a positive identification. The number to make an anonymous tip is 800-222-8477.
Lonnie David Franklin Jr., who was arrested in July 2010, is accused of killing women ranging from ages 14 to 36 between August 1985 and January 2007. Many of the victims were prostitutes, authorities have said in the past.
Lonnie David Franklin Jr. is accused of being the Los Angeles-area serial killer known as the Grim Sleeper. Most of the sleeper's victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said. All victims were shot; some were strangled too, an indictment alleges.
Authorities widened their inquiry to include all homicides that occurred in a general area of south Los Angeles where Franklin lived from the 1970s, when he got out of the military, through the 1980s, police spokeswoman Karen Rayner said in August 2011.
That amounts to about 230 murders, and even some that officials thought had been solved, she said.
Franklin, 59, has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of murder and one of attempted murder.
Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin.
Before his arrest, Franklin had worked for a time as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station, authorities said.
The killer was nicknamed the Grim Sleeper because he seemed to take long breaks between homicides, police said.

Rebel leader in Uganda for Congo crisis talks
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:18 AM EST, Fri November 23, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: U.K. minister calls on M23 to "stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately"
Uganda's president summoned M23's political leader to Kampala for discussions
Fierce fighting erupted Thursday in Sake, a city west of Goma
Oxfam warns of "the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths"
(CNN) -- A fight for the control of Sake, a strategically placed town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, raged Thursday, while regional leaders sought to end the crisis.
The political leader of M23, the rebel group that captured Goma, a key city near Sake, two days earlier, flew to Uganda Thursday for talks with that country's president.
The United Kingdom's minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, Thursday and immediately issued a statement saying "there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo" while calling on the DRC government to "address the underlying causes of the conflict."
"I call on the M23 to stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately," Simmonds said. "This would benefit the people of the DRC and is the will of the governments of the region and the whole international community."
Oxfam, which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area, warned Thursday that the fall of Goma to the rebels poses "a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths."
The M23 rebel group is fighting the Democratic Republic of Congo military for control of the country, and the violence is driving tens of thousands of Congolese out of their homes. Here on November 22, thousands fled the town of Sake and headed east to the camps for displaced in the village of Mugunga.
On November 26, M23 commanders refused to leave the city of Goma ahead of a midnight deadline imposed by regional leaders and the African Union. Pictured, rebel soldiers stand guard at the former Congolese army headquarters in Goma, on November 23, 2012.

Crisis escalates in DR Congo
Congolese rebels take over Goma
Rebels recruiting in the Congo
It estimates that 120,000 people are in urgent need of help, with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid.
"People are living in chaotic conditions," said Tariq Riebl, Oxfam's humanitarian coordinator. "There are real fears that cholera and other fatal water-borne diseases could spread, as shortages of power and water in Goma have left thousands of people with no choice but to get water straight from Lake Kivu."
Reporter Phil Moore, who was in Sake Thursday, said "the crack of heavy gunfire ripped through the town" in the afternoon, sending thousands of residents fleeing down the road to Goma.
"The road east to Goma was filled by people carrying bedding, cooking pots and whatever belongings they had to hand," Moore said. "One boy walked past with his six goats. Motorcycles sped past, three people squeezed onto the small seat, and minibuses were bursting with those fleeing renewed violence. The sound of mortar rounds exploding mixed with the rumble of thunder, rolling in from the north."
These refugees from Sake will suffer a difficult night, he said, "forced to sleep amongst the sharp, volcanic rock that defines the landscape on the edge of Lake Kivu. Seeking refuge in the Mugunga IDP camp, already filled with 50,000 people. There is little to eat, and no shelter."
The situation of who is fighting and who is in control is unclear, he said. Sake is strategic because it is a gateway to Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu.
"A motorcycle raced through the crowd saying that M23 had retreated from the town and were held up at a small stream crossing just outside of the city," Moore said. "As the thousands of fleeing civilians walked east towards a camp for the internally displaced, a truck filled with rebels raced from Goma towards Sake. Minutes later, they were followed by a column of a dozen rebels, running on foot, their pick-up truck having broken down further up the road. Bandoliers rattled around their necks as they carried PKM machine guns and Kalashnikov rifles, and some carried rocket-propelled grenades."
M23 political leader Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero was summoned to Kampala by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is hosting a conference of regional leaders Saturday aimed at ending the crisis in the DRC, according to an M23 source close to Lugerero.
DRC President Joseph Kabila and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda were also in Kampala for the International Conference for the Great Lakes Region, which is set to start there Saturday.
When the M23 rebel movement gained control of Goma earlier this week, it announced that it plans to "liberate" the entire country.
An M23 spokesman said Tuesday that the capture of Goma, the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces, was just the beginning.
"We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government," Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred at Goma's stadium, according to a Congolese reporter there.
Kazarama said that once the rebels overthrow the government, they will call for elections.
Kinshasa, the country's capital, lies nearly 1,000 miles west of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
The eastern part of the DRC, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide in that country.
The M23 group was named for the peace deal of March 23, 2009, which they accuse the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions.
Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.
CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.

Official: Egypt balloon explosion probe can take 2 weeks
By Adam Makary, Saad Abedine and Mariano Castillo, CNN updated 11:14 AM EST, Wed February 27, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: No foul play is suspected, official says
The Tuesday accident was the world's deadliest hot air balloon accident in at least 20 years
Officials: Passengers in the balloon included 19 foreign tourists
Luxor province bans all hot air balloon flights until further notice
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
Cairo (CNN) -- An official investigation into the cause of a balloon accident that killed 19 people in Egypt could take two weeks, the governor of Luxor province said Wednesday.
The Tuesday accident was the world's deadliest hot air balloon accident in at least 20 years.
Preliminary investigations confirmed no foul play was involved when gas canisters aboard the balloon exploded, causing it to plummet about 1,000 feet (300 meters) to the ground, Gov. Ezzat Saad said.
CNN iReport: After tragedy, vacationers recall glorious balloon rides in Egypt
As the balloon prepared to land Tuesday morning, an explosion pierced the air, followed by billowing smoke.

How to stay safe in a hot air balloon
"My first thought was that it was sugar cane that was burning," said Christopher Michel, a photographer who was a passenger in another balloon at the time.
Smoke from the burning sugar cane painted the ancient city of Luxor below with an eerie haziness.
Luxor balloon disaster 'blow' for Egyptian tourism
But the concern shown by the balloon pilot and the blaring sirens from emergency vehicles told Michel that something was wrong. He could not imagine the extent:
One of the balloons had exploded, and its 21 passengers and operators plummeted about 1,000 feet (300 meters) to the ground.
"This juxtaposition of this great beauty and this wonderful country and this horrible tragedy is just really shocking," Michel said. "We all feel terrible."
It was an early, dark morning, Michel said, and uneventful for 45 minutes until they started to descend. He was overlooking mud-brick buildings and fields, with the Valley of the Kings in the distance, when the explosion shattered the quiet of the morning.
Passengers in the balloon included 19 foreign tourists: nine from Hong Kong, four from Japan, three from Britain, two from France and one from Hungary, officials said.
How safe is hot air ballooning?
An Egyptian pilot and another Egyptian were also aboard, Luxor province spokesman Badawi al-Masri said.
Balloon rides offering panoramic aerial views of the Nile River and the ancient temples of Karnak and Hatshepsut are a popular tourist attraction in Luxor, about a nine-hour drive southeast of Cairo.
"You can see Valley of the Kings in the background bordered by farmland," Pauline Liang of Vancouver, Canada, told CNN's iReport last year. "Below were banana farms, and behind us was the city of Luxor. There was a great contrast between desert landscape, lush farmland and urban development."
Tuesday's crash prompted the governor to ban all hot air balloon flights until further notice.
Luxor is among Egypt's top tourist draws. Visitors go to see ancient temples and tombs, and travel sites often recommend the hot air balloon trips.
The last hot air balloon accident in Luxor occurred in 2009, when 16 foreign tourists were injured after a balloon struck a cell phone transmission tower.
Until Tuesday's incident, the deadliest accident in recent memory took place in 1989, when 13 people were killed as two hot air balloons collided in Australia.

Why a man eats another man's heart
By James Dawes, Special to CNN
updated 6:51 AM EDT, Thu May 16, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A video shows a Syrian rebel carving the heart out of a dead soldier and eating it
James Dawes: How can ordinary men commit such horrific acts?
He says there are some men who are natural monsters, but most monsters are made Dawes: The same steps used for creating monsters can show how to stop atrocities
Editor's note: James Dawes, director of the Program in Human Rights at Macalester College, is the author of "Evil Men" (Harvard University Press, 2013). (CNN) -- A Syrian rebel carves the heart out of a dead man and bites it. His comrades nearby cheer: "God is great."
This is from a video that is circulating on the Internet. The appalling footage has all the world asking: What kind of people could do this?
We tell ourselves these men must be monsters, people utterly unlike us, people we could never understand. But we don't say this because it is true. We say this because it is comforting to think so. The far more frightening possibility we must face is that such evil is not diabolically inhuman or beyond understanding. It is human -- very human.
James Dawes
How can ordinary men commit such horrific acts? The war criminals I have met did not start out by desecrating corpses, torturing villagers or murdering children. They got there slowly. There are some men who are natural monsters, but most monsters are made.
This is how you make them.
First, take a man (and yes, it is most often a man) and isolate him. Separate him from his family and friends and put him in an information bubble, an echo chamber cut off from the outside world. Make him conform to the values of his new group by exploiting his insecurity and need for approval. This is the first step in any war.
Second, train him to think that the world is painted in black and white, not shades of gray. Train him in either-or, binary thinking. Either you are my friend or my enemy. Either you are pure or impure. Either the people you love are safe or they are in immediate peril. Either you are all right or you are all wrong.

Syrian refugees stuck in limbo
Third, physically exhaust him. Break down his body and spirit -- through brutal training or prolonged combat -- until he can't think straight. Subject him to a system of harsh and arbitrary punishment and equally arbitrary rewards. Condition him to feel helpless. A man who feels like he has lost control over his life is a dangerous man, because hurting others feels like control.
Fourth -- and this is the most important part -- start small. Work up to atrocity step by step. Put him into a strange and frightening environment with minimal regulation. Let the aggression escalate. Each violent act he commits while trying to survive will make the next act feel easier, more natural.
The first time he kills a villager, it is terrifying. The second time, it is hard. The third or fourth time, it starts to feel almost easy. Eventually, he finds himself competing with his fellow soldiers to see who can do it fastest, most often, most creatively.
Watching videos like this, and thinking thoughts like this, it is easy to lose hope. In war, are we doomed always to descend into barbarism?
The answer is no. The nightmare video from Syria is not inevitable. The very same steps used for creating monsters can also be used to stop monstrosity -- you just need to reverse the steps. Some people are born moral heroes, but most are made. And this is how you make them.
First, take a young man and start small. Work up to altruism and moral courage step by step. Each small thing he does to attend to the suffering of another or stand up against injustice will make the next act feel easier, more natural. Second, give him a clear system of rules with predictable consequences. Teach him he has the ability to make choices about his life, and that these choices matter. Third, teach him that the world's problems aren't as simple as us-versus-them, good-versus-evil. Teach him that there aren't easy solutions to complex problems. Teach him to tolerate, without fear and anxiety, life's difficult ambiguity and uncertainty.
And finally -- to those of you, like me, who are parents of young boys -- teach him to seek out "the other": Other clubs and groups, other sources of information, other places to see, other kinds of people, other cultural values. Spoil him with diversity, so that if there ever comes a time when he is called to war, he will always remember to see the world through the other's eyes. He will fight, but he will fight against an enemy that he sees as a person, like him. He will see their humanity, and in so doing, he will preserve his own.

'American Idol' winners: Where are they now?
updated 9:33 AM EDT, Fri May 17, 2013
Clay Aiken is back in the news with his announced run for Congress. Many fans forget that Aiken didn't actually win season 2 of "American Idol." But that begs the question, where are the "Idol" winners now?
Candice Glover won season 12, becoming the first female contestant to do so since 2007. Her debut album, "Music Speaks," is slated to be released in February 2014. Season 11 winner Phillip Phillips, here performing during NBA All-Star Weekend in Houston in February 2013, postponed some tour dates last year because of health issues. His struggle with kidney stones was well documented during his time on the show.
Since he was crowned the winner of "American Idol" season 10 in 2011, Scotty McCreery's debut album "Clear as Day" has been certified platinum, and he was named the Academy of Country Music's best new artist in 2012. His newest single, "See You Tonight," recently hit the airwaves.
Lee DeWyze had a small music career before auditioning for season nine of "American Idol," with two albums. After his win, he went on to release "Live It Up" with RCA Records in 2010. But a year later, the record label dropped DeWyze when the album sold just over 146,000 copies. He married model Jonna Walsh and signed with a new label. He returned to "Idol" to perform his new song "Silver Lining" in 2013. Like DeWyze, Kris Allen had released an album before he got on "American Idol." After a very heated battle with Adam Lambert, Allen won season eight in 2009. After a car accident in which he broke his wrist on New Year's Day 2013, Allen told the Chicago Tribune he was "more driven since Idol." David Cook rocked a win in a close competition with runner-up David Archuleta on season seven of "American Idol" in 2008. The same year, he released "David Cook," which has been certified platinum. Cook parted ways with RCA Records in 2012. In 2013 he performed a new single on "Idol," "Laying Me Low," which USA Today reported debuted on the charts with 14,000 sales.
Jordin Sparks made history by becoming the youngest winner of "American Idol" at age 17 on season six in 2007. Her eponymous debut album that year went platinum and featured the hit single "No Air." Sparks' second album, "Battlefield," in 2009, and its namesake single also peaked on the charts. She starred in "Sparkle," Whitney Houston's last movie, performed "I Will Always Love You" at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards and has made the news because of her dramatic weight loss.
Taylor Hicks' blues-meets-rock style earned him a following that led to his win on season five of "American Idol" in 2006, beating favorite (and "Smash" star) Katharine McPhee. His self-titled debut album was certified platinum, and his single "Do I Make You Proud" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles. Hicks released "The Distance" in 2008 on his independent record label, Modern Whomp. Shown here performing at a charity event in 2012, he is currently performing in Las Vegas.
Carrie Underwood went from college student to winner on season four of "American Idol" in 2005. Her debut album, "Some Hearts," was certified seven times platinum, and she has gone on to win multiple Grammy awards. In 2013, she starred on NBC in a live version of "The Sound of Music." Married to hockey player Mike Fisher, she told Marie Claire, "I don't feel old enough to have kids."
Fantasia Barrino defeated Diana DeGarmo on season three of "American Idol" in 2004. She released her debut album, "Free Yourself," which was certified platinum, the same year. Barrino won her first Grammy award in 2011 for her single "Bittersweet" from her third album, "Back to Me." She has appeared on Broadway in "The Color Purple," been the subject of her own reality show and in April 2013 released an album, "Side Effects of You."
Ruben Studdard was crowned the winner of "American Idol" on season two in 2003, beating Clay Aiken. His first album, "Soulful," debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 that year. Studdard has since released four more studio albums, gotten divorced and shed more than 100 pounds.
The moment Kelly Clarkson became the first winner of "American Idol" in 2002, she became a household name. Since her debut album, "Thankful," she has released five award-winning albums, with singles like "Because of You" topping the Billboard music charts. Clarkson's latest is the upbeat song "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" from her fifth album, "Stronger." In 2012 she served as a judge on ABC's music competition show "Duets." In 2013, she married talent manager Brandon Blackstock, and the couple are expecting their first child.

Lewis Hamilton counts 'blessing' after snatching Spa pole from Sebastian Vettel
updated 2:48 PM EDT, Sat August 24, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lewis Hamilton claims his fourth successive pole position this season
Mercedes driver denies championship leader Sebastian Vettel at Spa
Vettel qualifies second ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber
Title contenders Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso off the pace
(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton couldn't believe his luck after snatching a fourth successive pole position at a rain-affected qualifying session for Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.
The Mercedes driver, who won the last race in Hungary before Formula One's four-week mid-season break, gave himself a great chance of reducing Sebastian Vettel's championship lead after his last-minute heroics at Spa on Saturday.
Force India's Paul Di Resta had been poised for the first pole position of his career after making a bold tire gamble, but as the rain eased and the track dried his best time was beaten by Mark Webber.
Vettel looked to have edged out his Red Bull teammate as he set the quickest time of two minutes 1.2 seconds, only for Hamilton to charge through right at the end with 2:1.012.

"When I started that last lap I thought, 'Oh my God!' as I was seventh or eighth and about three seconds down," the 2008 world champion said after claiming the 31st pole of his career -- putting him seventh on the all-time list.
"I ran slightly wide at the first corner and I dropped to five, six seconds back, so I didn't know what was going on," Hamilton, who won at Spa in 2010, told reporters.

"But I kept pushing. It's a blessing I am up here. Generally I feel comfortable in changing conditions when I can find the limit.
"I pushed through the middle sector and really caned it. I feel so fortunate to get pole."
Vettel, who leads fourth-placed Hamilton by 48 points, expects similar entertainment during the race with mixed weather again forecast.
Read: GP of America 'is off'
"We all went out on slicks -- which was entertaining when it started to rain heavily," the German said.
"Then it stopped raining and the circuit came back quickly, but I saw Lewis catching me up in the last lap, so I could have gone quicker.
"I was quite close to pole, but all in all it was a good day for the team. Let's now see what happens tomorrow when we expect similar conditions."
Di Resta had to settle for fifth -- behind Mercedes' Nico Rosberg but ahead of Hamilton's former McLaren teammate Jenson Button, who won the race last year.
Romain Grosjean qualified seventh ahead of Lotus teammate Kimi Raikkonen, second in the championship and a four-time winner at Spa.
Read: F1's half-term report
Fernando Alonso, a point behind the Finn in the standings, was another place back in qualifying as the Spaniard took ninth ahead of Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa.
Meanwhile, Pirelli's investigation into punctures suffered by Vettel and Alonso during Friday's practice revealed that the cause was a piece of metal that had fallen off a car -- not the tires.
Drivers had been concerned after earlier problems with the rubber compounds at July's British Grand Prix and were worried there may be a repeat at the high-speed Belgian track.
"There are certainly no tire-related issues," Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery said.
"We've seen no signs of fatigue. From our point of view there is no reason to be concerned."
Hembery did express concern at reports Michelin may return to F1 as a tire supplier, despite Pirelli having a deal in place with F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone.
For Michelin to be involved for the first time since 2006, governing body the FIA would have to announce a tender at next month's World Motor Sport Council in Croatia.
"We've contracts in place and we'd hope people would respect them," Hembery told the UK Press Association.
"Quite frankly, a tender in September, when we will be running in January, would be farcical.
"If you wanted to do that then it should have been done in September of last year. Everybody will look ridiculous in that scenario."
Meanwhile, in motorcycling's elite MotoGP competition, Cal Crutchlow set a new lap record at Brno as he claimed a surprise pole position for Sunday's Czech Grand Prix.
The British rider beat the quickest time set last year by world champion Jorge Lorenzo, and will head the grid for the second time this season for Monster Yamaha Tech 3.
Lorenzo qualified fifth for the Yamaha factory team, with seven-time world champion teammate Valentino Rossi seventh.
The Honda factory team's riders Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa were third and fourth, though they too were upstaged by an independent entry as Alvaro Bautista took second on the timesheets for Honda Gresini.

(CNN) -- So, when can we expect our refund checks?
Because two can play this game.
On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House. Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals -- no one forced any of them to take those jobs. They wanted them. Then ran for them. They got them.
On the other side -- at least in a rational world, which this isn't -- is us. The taxpayers.
Congress still gets paid -- it's in the Constitution
Bob Greene
We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run.
Some people may not like how the government operates; some may not care for a particular president or a particular member of Congress or a particular government program.
We accept that, as we pay our taxes. We pay those taxes because we have to. We know that we don't get to withhold those taxes just because we may dislike some of the people or programs the taxes are funding.
But when we are told that the government has been shut down-- that it has been closed for business -- that's different.
We paid for that service. We had no choice.
Americans hurt as DC 'squabbles like kids'
If we had paid for an airline ticket, and in the middle of our trip the airline informed us that one leg of our journey had been canceled, we would justifiably demand a refund.
Carney: GOP out to get 'political scalp'
Vets ignore shutdown, visit war memorial
Political blame game over govt. shutdown
Shutdown drags on, debt ceiling looms
If we ordered an annual subscription to 52 weeks of a magazine, and then, a few months into it, the magazine told us that its new policy was to publish only 26 issues a year, we would, with good reason, ask for half of our money back.
If we paid for a one-year membership in a health club, and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months, we would expect a 25% refund.
So ... exactly when can we expect to see our refund checks from the federal government?
We have paid for it to operate.
And -- with the exception of what, for now, are being deemed certain essential functions -- it is not operating.
Opinion: Shutdown could be shock therapy
The people we have paid to operate it can blame each other all they want for what has happened. They can point fingers and say that it's all the other guys' fault.
But whoever ultimately shoulders the blame, the fact is that the people who hired them -- the American taxpayers -- are not getting what they paid for.
So the refunds, for the portions of government operations that have been shuttered, are owed. Or at least they should be owed, in any other kind of sane business.
The longer the shutdown continues, the larger the refunds should logically become. As if logic has had anything to do with any of these developments.
Congress and the White House might hear this request and say: That's preposterous. The government is hurting for funds -- it needs the money.
Well, many of the people who pay for the government to run are hurting for funds, too. They need the money, too.
The government, no matter what anyone thinks of its various policies, no matter where anyone positions himself or herself along the political and ideological continuum, is expected to do one thing:
Open its doors each morning.
When it doesn't, the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back.
With interest.
