Sharpton, Sheen visit antiwar camp

 Next for Sheehan: Congress
 Bush counsels patience
CRAWFORD, Texas (CNN) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton joined hundreds of war protesters camping near President Bush's ranch for an interfaith service Sunday, saying he felt compelled to meet Cindy Sheehan, the grieving mother who started the rally three weeks earlier.Sheehan arrived in Bush's hometown August 6 and refused to leave until she could question the president about the war that has killed more than 1,870 U.S. service members, including her son Casey."I feel that it is our moral obligation to stand and to be courageous with these families, and particularly Cindy, that have become the conscience of this nation," said Sharpton, an activist and former Democratic presidential candidate.Sharpton and Sheehan laid roses at crosses near "Camp Casey," named for Sheehan's 24-year-old son who was killed in Iraq last year.Actor Martin Sheen, who portrays the Democratic president on NBC's "The West Wing," also met with Sheehan on Sunday."At least you've got the acting president of the United States," Sheen told the crowd of more than 300. "I think you know what I do for a living, but this is what I do to stay alive."Several cars with pro-Bush signs drove slowly down the road by the protest campsite. One man was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly shoving an anti-war demonstrator, McLennan County sheriff's deputies said.After the war protest ends Wednesday, the anti-war group plans to spread its message on a bus tour, with the first stop probably in the southeast Texas district of U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.Bush has said he appreciates Sheehan's right to protest and sympathizes with her, but his aides have said there are no plans to change his schedule to meet with her.Sheehan and other grieving families met with Bush about two months after her son died last year, before she became a vocal opponent of the war.

Life on the lam: Bulger, girlfriend enjoyed ocean breezes, fine dining By Michael Martinez, CNN How the feds caught 'Whitey' BulgerSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNeighbor: I actually was really shaking because I was really saddened to know it was them"Mobster James "Whitey" Bulger, 81, had signs of Alzheimer's, his girlfriend told a neighborHe was also depressed and had trouble sleeping and getting out of bed, the neighbor saysThe mobster and moll hid in plain sight amid the bustle of coastal Santa Monica Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- The alleged East Coast mobster and his girlfriend were known as Charlie and Carol Gasko, a May-December couple living in the heart of sunny Southern California, just two blocks from the beach and an upscale outdoor mall, in a town known for its unapologetic liberalism. But their real names were James "Whitey" Bulger, 81, and Catherine Elizabeth Greig, 60. And recently, Greig had been telling friends that Bulger was showing signs of Alzheimer's and was suffering depression, unable to sleep or to get out of bed, neighbor Catalina Schlank told CNN. One manager of a restaurant just down the street recalled how the alleged gangster and his girlfriend liked the privacy of a far corner table and once worked up a $192 bill, plus tip, for a steak and lobster dinner, accompanied by foie gras, vodka highballs and chardonnay. Until this week, Bulger had been on the lam for 16 years and was on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list, facing charges in 19 mob-related murders. Bulger was arrested Wednesday after he was lured out of his apartment by an FBI ruse: He received a phone call and was told that his lockbox had been broken into in the basement parking lot area of his apartment building. When Bulger went down to check it out, FBI agents arrested him, a source said Friday. His longtime girlfriend was arrested inside the apartment, where the FBI later found 30 firearms, authorities said. Bulger's alleged barbarity as an Irish-American mobster in Boston inspired the Jack Nicholson character in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film "The Departed." For the past several years, the couple hid in plain sight in this palm-tree-lined oceanside city by Los Angeles. They were largely quiet, polite neighbors who occasionally helped Schlank carry her groceries or newspaper, said Schlank, who lives in the same building as Bulger and Greig. Out of generosity, Bulger even gave her a flashlight for her first-floor apartment. They lived in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia, which features pine trees, a brick stoop and a rose bed. It was clear that the couple didn't want to be bothered: They didn't answer their phone, and an answering service would take messages, Schlank said Friday. Neighbor Catalina Schlank says Bulger and Greig were "kind of secretive." "He was a handsome, old man," Schlank said. "She was beautiful." Bulger often wore a hat and pulled down the brim, said Schlank, who at age 88 is the most senior tenant in the building, having lived there since 1974. "She was a very nice person to me -- they both were," she said. But the couple kept boundaries, Schlank said. "They were kind of secretive. Even on the phone, you couldn't call them," Schlank said. "Sometimes, I wanted to give them a tip of stuff on sale." Schlank was put off by the answering service. "After a while, I said forget about it," she said. Another neighbor, Denise Walsh, who lives four doors down from apartment 303, where Bulger and Greig lived for up to 15 years, said the couple often walked hand-in-hand and stopped to pet dogs, telling people they were canine lovers. "He was very avuncular, she was very sweet. They were very kind people from my knowledge of them," Walsh said. But when she learned of the allegations against Bulger this week, she felt frightened, Walsh said. "I actually was really shaking because I was really saddened to know it was them," Walsh said. "It's like finding out your grandparents are murderers." The couple held a status address on Santa Monica's Third Street. Just two blocks down is the city's popular tourist and commercial strip, called the Third Street Promenade, a breezy, open-air corridor of stores, restaurants and street performers. Several blocks up the street is an intersection with Montana Avenue, a boutique and restaurant district catering to Santa Monica's more affluent residents. Celebrities also frequent the blocks-long strip of one-story storefronts. In between those districts was Bulger's and Greig's apartment. Their fake name, Gasko, is still on the doorbell list of tenants. Their stucco building sits in a dense knot of apartments and million-dollar condos -- in which residents largely mind their own business unless someone strikes up a conversation, neighbors said. For an alleged gangster steeped in the baseball-bat brutality of Boston violence, Bulger and his girlfriend chose an unlikely destination to live, neighbors said. 1998: Bulger's FBI contact in court

Santa Monica is known for its its left-leaning politics, with heavy restrictions on public smoking and a citywide emphasis on recycling and going green. Its nickname is "The People's Republic of Santa Monica." It was amid this bustle of pedestrian-friendly and tourist-loving activity that mobster and moll avoided detection -- until the FBI began a publicity campaign focusing on the girlfriend this month. "Was he even hiding?" asked Frank Quinn, 45, a copier salesman who works down the street from the Bulger apartment. Quinn made a visit to the apartment building Friday, because he's from a suburb south of Boston, Dedham. As a youth, he knew well the name of Whitey Bulger in that city's Irish-Catholic community, Quinn said. Bulger's reputation was one of "a guy you didn't mess with," he said. "He was all cash," Quinn said, referring to the FBI's reported discovery of more than $800,000 hidden in the apartment. One resident found Bulger's ability to enjoy life just blocks from her alarming. She was surprised by how the couple enjoyed a rent-controlled unit, in which the city limits annual rent increases by landlords. "It's really mind-boggling," said Madeline Davis Heller, an arbitrator who was walking her mixed-breed dog, Sallie, past the Bulger apartment Friday. "Santa Monica is notorious for rent control and background checks. I don't know how they got past. "But they did have all this forgery stuff," she added, referring to the FBI having found fake IDs for the couple in their apartment. Bulger and Greig sometimes did step out at local institutions and dined at Michael's restaurant two blocks down the street. It's a white-tablecloth establishment of 32 years, known for attracting Hollywood producers, said general manager Andrew Turner, 41. The couple dined there a few times in recent years and made reservations under the name of "Mr. Gasko" on the OpenTable Internet reservation service, Turner said. They kept to themselves and always sat at Table 23 in the corner of the garden patio, at the back of the restaurant, lush with trees and plants, Turner said. He said he shook hands with the couple, as he does with all diners. Owner and cookbook author Michael McCarty has created a cozy space that includes art in oils and pencil for his guests. "They were pleasant, but they kind of kept to themselves and certainly did not have, as far as I can tell, any interaction with any other guests," Turner said. In September 2009, Bulger and Greig had two Grey Goose vodka cocktails, two chardonnays, and an appetizer of foie gras. For an entree, Bulger had a 10-ounce, 28-day aged New York strip steak, and Greig had lobster, Turner said. The tab: $192 plus tip. The couple paid cash, Turner said.

Berlusconi to face trial on abuse of power, sex charges By the CNN Wire Staff Judge orders Berlusconi to face trialSTORY HIGHLIGHTSThe criminal trial will begin April 6, a judge rulesProsecutors say Berlusconi paid for sex with a 17-year-old dancer Authorities accuse him of calling the police to get her out of jail on theft chargesItaly's prime minister denies the charges Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will be tried on charges of sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of power, an Italian judge ruled Tuesday. Judge Cristina di Censo decided the trial would begin April 6, Italian judicial authorities confirmed. Three judges will preside over the criminal trial in Milan. All of them are women. Prosecutors in Milan filed the request for trial last week. Berlusconi denies the charges, and his lawyers have argued that the Milan courts do not have the authority to try a prime minister or jurisdiction over the case because of where the alleged crimes were committed. Milan chief prosecutor Edmundo Bruti Liberati requested the fast-track trial on charges that Berlusconi paid for sex with nightclub dancer Karima El Mahrough, who was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, and later intervened with the police after she was arrested on an unrelated charge. An associate of Berlusconi's denied that the prime minister had wild parties at his house or that she had procured girls for him to have sex with. Italians march against 'sexist' leader

"Absolutely yes, I would deny that. Absolutely yes," regional lawmaker Nicole Minetti told CNN. Prosecutors have tried to link Minetti to the allegations against Berlusconi. She has not been charged with a crime. She said there were "sometimes pretty girls" at Berlusconi's parties, but that the dinners were not the wild bacchanals depicted in media reports about the prime minister. "He sings. He tells stories, any type of stories, I mean even personal stories, of his experience of politics, humorous stories, that is a little bit of how the evenings were," she said. "I mean, nothing lurid. That is how it was." Berlusconi dismissed the accusations as "groundless" when the prosecution request was filed last week, saying the call for a trial was a "farce." There was no abuse of power, he said. And he said he was "sorry because these (allegations) have offended the dignity of the country. They've thrown mud on the government, on the country and on myself at an international level." Berlusconi, a wealthy media magnate turned politician, has faced trials in the past, but this is the first time he has been charged with abuse of power as prime minister or personal misconduct. He has previously had to defend himself against charges of bribery and financial misconduct. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994, but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions; several were overturned on appeal. He has always denied any wrongdoing, and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution, though a 2008 law granting him immunity was overturned the following year. Thousands of Italians took to the streets in some 200 cities across the country Sunday to protest Berlusconi's alleged behavior toward women. The largest gathering was in Rome, where organizers said 100,000 people gathered, under the slogan, "If not now, when?" In Milan, organizers estimated that 60,000 people demonstrated. Protests also took place outside Italy, including marches in Tokyo and Geneva, Switzerland. Sunday's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke. Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex. The investigation began in December, several months after Berlusconi called police to urge them to release El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby, from jail, where she was being held on theft charges. Both El Mahrough, now 18, and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex. El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. The young woman's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier. Berlusconi's party argued that he believed that Ruby was then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt. The lower house of Italy's Parliament voted against allowing Milan prosecutors to search property belonging to Berlusconi as part of the investigation.CNN's Dan Rivers and Hada Messia contributed to this report.

Teach U.S. kids to write computer code
By Douglas Rushkoff, Special to CNN
updated 8:43 AM EST, Mon December 10, 2012
Douglas Rushkoff says computer class must be about teaching kids to make tomorrow's software. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Douglas Rushkoff: It's Computer Science Education Week, aimed at promoting digital literacy
He says we live in digital age but computer science not priority in schools; U.S. is lagging here
He says digital literacy helps us see that kids are not Facebook's customers, but the product
Rushkoff: Critically thinking about digital media environments is a liberal art, teaches about world
Editor's note: Douglas Rushkoff writes a regular column for CNN.com. He is a media theorist and the author of "Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age" and "Life Inc.: How Corporatism Conquered the World, and How We Can Take It Back." He is also a digital literacy advocate for Codecademy.com. His forthcoming book is "Present Shock."
(CNN) -- This week is Computer Science Education Week, which is being observed around the United States with events aimed at highlighting the promise -- and paucity -- of digital education. The climax of the festivities, for me anyway, will be the opportunity to address members of Congress and their staffers on Wednesday in Washington about the value of digital literacy. I've been an advocate of digital culture for the past 20 years, and this feels like the culmination of a lifetime of arguing.
Yes, I was once the one getting laughed out of both cocktail parties and editor's offices for suggesting that someday people would be using word processors to send one another messages over telephone lines. But the vindication I feel for being right about our digital future is tempered by an equally disheartening sense that we are actually missing an opportunity here.
I have never been as enthusiastic about the promise of digital technology itself as about the human potential unleashed by these new tools. Yet I fear this promise is increasingly undermined by our widespread unwillingness to seize the abilities they offer us. Although we live in a highly digital age, digital literacy is not a priority among us. And as a result computer science is not a priority in our schools.
Douglas Rushkoff
My talk to Congress may not change this overnight. There are many structural impediments to bringing any new curriculum into America's public schools. The multi-year process through which school district decisions are made is incompatible with the development cycles of the Internet startups hoping to meet the demand for digital education. Teachers fear their own inexperience with code may disqualify them from becoming competent instructors. And there's not enough money for the education we already have, much less the education we would like to offer.
But I'm hoping we can get motivated enough to catch up with, say, Estonia (where they teach code to kids) and begin developing a society capable of thriving and competing in a digital world. So to that end, here are the 10 things I plan to say in my 10 minutes on Capitol Hill:
Become a fan of CNNOpinion
Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.
1. When we got language, we didn't just learn how to listen, but how to speak. When we got text, we didn't just learn how to read, but how to write. Now that we have computers, we're learning how to use them -- but not how to program them.
2. Programming a computer is not like being the mechanic of an automobile. We're not looking at the difference between a mechanic and a driver, but between a driver and a passenger. If you don't know how to drive the car, you are forever dependent on your driver to take you where you want to go. You're even dependent on that driver to tell you when a place exists.
3. Not knowing how our digital environments are constructed leads us to accept them at face value. For example, kids think the function of Facebook is to help them keep in touch with friends. Even a bit of digital literacy helps us see that Facebook users are not its customers, but its product.
Female programmers few and far between
Where 94% of grads get jobs
4. "Computer class" can't be about teaching kids to use today's software; it must be about teaching kids to make tomorrow's software.
5. The failure to teach computer science isn't just impeding kids' understanding of the digital world, but also crippling our nation's competitiveness in business. We outsource programming not because we can't afford American programmers, but because we can't find American programmers.
6. America's military leaders are scared: They have no problem finding recruits who want to fly drones, but have few who want -- or are ready -- to learn how to program them. One Air Force general told me he believes America's competitive advantage on the cybermilitary frontier is one generation away from being lost.
7. We are putting in place a layer of technology, culture, and economics that we'd darn well better do consciously. The technology we build today is the operating system of the society of tomorrow. Right now, painfully few are participating in this -- and usually the choices are made by the highest bidder.
8. Computer Science is not just a STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- subject, but a liberal art as well. Being able to think critically about digital media environments means being able to think critically about our world.
9. Kids are already doing algorithms, the basic building blocks of computer programming. Once they learn long division, they are ready to start programming.
10. The resources are out there: Codecademy.com is just one of many free tools (including CSUnplugged.org and Scratch.org) that any teacher can pick up and implement -- if he or she can muster the autonomy to do so. It may just happen that computer education, like the Internet itself, will depend on distributed authority and the bottom-up, enterprising nature of human beings working together.

8 things to know before visiting Libya By Nick Redmayne, for CNN
updated 7:45 AM EDT, Fri May 17, 2013
The ruins of Cyrene reflect enduring Greek influences on language and architecture in Libya; its Temple of Zeus is larger than the Parthenon in Athens. The site is about 120 miles (nearly 200 kilometers) east of Benghazi.
Libyan oil production has returned to prerevolution levels. Filling the tank of an average car costs around six dinars ($4.76), while a liter bottle of water from a cafe is one dinar (about 80 cents). Libyans drink coffee and tea during social gatherings. Alcohol is banned in the country, but it's an open secret that cars of young men parked in out of the way places are often de facto drinking dens. Jebel Akhdar -- or Green Mountain -- is a day-trip from Benghazi and a good reminder that Libya's not just desert.
Car rental companies are building a presence in Libya, but finding someone else to do the hard work of fighting traffic, sandstorms and camels will make for a more relaxing trip. During the revolution, rebels forged one dinar notes showing Moammar Gadhafi in a contemplative pose, bottom, replacing his image with that of Omar Mukhtar, top, leader of the Libyan resistance to Italy in the early 20th century. Now new notes have been issued.
Gaddafi imagery has been replaced by that of an elderly man in white robes -- Omar Mukhtar, seen here on a flag. Mukhtar was a nationalist hero whose fighters resisted Italian colonialists in Libya for nearly 20 years.
Italian forces captured and executed Mukhtar in 1931, but he has remained an inspiration to many Libyans. In 2011, his battle cry of "We will win or we will die" was heard once more as the revolution unfolded. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Libya is two and a half times bigger than Texas and 90% desert
Alcohol is banned, but there's smuggled booze and bokha, distilled from dates, figs Gasoline is cheaper than water in this oil rich but extremely dry Sahara nation
Ancient ruins from the Greek and Roman eras are spectacular
World-renowned chef, author and Emmy winning television personality Anthony Bourdain visits Libya in the next episode of "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown," airing Sunday, May 19, at 9 p.m. ET. Follow the show on Twitter and Facebook.
(CNN) -- Following Libya's revolution, oil production has been restored and the country has slipped from the front pages.
Once more, Libya has become North African rather than southern Mediterranean, and news dispatches surface only when Western government's worst fears appear close to being realized.
As most Libyans admit that after four-plus decades of Moammar Gadhafi, it will take time to build a mature democracy. Yet Libyans remain hopeful that progress is being made.
For travelers, this means a renewed opportunity to explore one of Africa's most interesting states.
1. It's vast and empty
At 679,362 square miles, Libya is second in size only to neighboring Algeria among North African countries. It's two and a half times bigger than Texas, almost 85 times the size of Wales and 90% desert.

Bourdain meets Libyan Boy Scouts
What American food is a hit in Libya?
Libya's population is small, just more than 6 million, more than 80% inhabiting the coastal region. More than half of that is concentrated in the just three cities -- Tripoli, Benghazi and Misrata.
For first-time visitors, an itinerary based on Tripoli and Benghazi, with day excursions from each city and a connecting domestic flight, makes most sense.
Simoon Travel (+44 020 978 0508; www.simoontravel.com) or Temehu (www.temehu.com) are two tour agencies worth knowing.
2. Road travel is exciting but hazardous
By car, the 600-mile journey along the coast between Tripoli and Libya's second city, Benghazi, takes around 12 hours.
Heading south from Tripoli to the ancient Berber trading town of Ghadames is an eight or nine hour slog, while the Ubari Lakes in the southern desert region of Fezzan lie some 13 hours from Tripoli.
As well as recalcitrant camels, encroaching dunes, sand storms and wildly unpredictable driving conditions and drivers, the insecurity of postrevolutionary Libya demands travelers' full attention before any overland journey.
The revolution saw the collapse of many commercial bus services, though these were off-limits to foreigners anyway. Car rental companies such as Sixt (www.sixt.com) and Hertz (www.hertz.co.uk) are building a Libyan presence, though locations are limited and unless you're used to what might be called "ebullient" traffic, you may want to take a back seat.
Stifling Gadhafi-era group travel restrictions no longer exist, but for tourists with limited time, complicated land explorations are best made through tour operators utilizing their vehicles and drivers.
3. There's no drinking (except there is)
The "Free Officers" of Gadhafi's 1969 coup d'etat banned alcohol, and there's no chance of change.
Despite public conservatism, however, Libyans close to a suitable land border are no strangers to losing themselves in a foreign bar, and regular cross-border traffic means lots of illicit alcohol enters the country from Egypt and Tunisia.
It's an open secret that cars of young men parked in out-of-the-way places are often de facto drinking dens.
As well as smuggled booze, a drink known as bokha, distilled from dates, figs or grapes, is widely consumed.
Unfortunately, some misguided producers add methanol to increase potency. In March 2013, a batch of bad bokha claimed 52 lives in Tripoli -- one reason to stay on the straight and narrow and stick to sweet tea and strong coffee.
4. The ATMs don't work
Forged notes subbing Moammar Gadhafi's image (bottom) with that of Omar Mukhtar have now been replaced with legitimate new one-dinar notes. Plastic cards cannot be relied upon, either to pay bills or get money from ATMs or banks.
Functioning ATMs can be counted on one hand, and credit card payments for goods and services are almost unknown outside Tripoli.
As a result it's not uncommon to see large, tightly bound bricks of dinars exchanged as a matter of course.
Those accustomed to cashless card-driven lifestyles may feel uncomfortable when carrying large quantities of banknotes.
Despite recent high-profile outrages perpetrated by militias, religious ideologues or both, crimes against individuals such as muggings and thefts are rare. And in commerce, Libyans are straightforward and honest to a fault.
5. Gas is cheaper than water
Filling the tank of an average car costs around six dinars ($4.76), while a liter bottle of water from a cafe costs one dinar ($0.80).
Libyan oil production has returned to prerevolution levels of 1.6 million barrels a day. The country's known reserves are the largest in Africa and fourth-largest in the world -- sufficient for 85 years at the present output.
It's a constant refrain among the postrevolutionary populace, however, that "Libya is a rich country but the people are poor."
Walking around the neglected, crumbling streets of Benghazi, a city that has seen little investment since World War II, one can only wonder where the oil revenues were spent.
Economic prospects for Libya may about to improve. The World Bank estimates 16% to 18% growth in GDP for 2013, the International Monetary Fund suggests nearer 20%.
6. It's not all sand
Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) is an achievable day trip from Benghazi, a good reminder that Libya isn't just desert.
Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) is an achievable day-trip from Benghazi, a good reminder that Libya isn't all desert. Quite literally, the trip provides a breath of fresh air.
Relatively high rainfall means these uplands live up to their name -- fields yield healthy cereal crops and orchards produce succulent fruit, while Libya's luckiest sheep graze rolling green hillside pastures.
Italian colonial farmhouses, under new management, are still visible, as are abandoned railway stations (trains have long since ceased operations).
7. Omar Mukhtar has replaced Gadhafi as a symbol
Before the revolution, Moammar Gadhafi portrait was everywhere in Libya. Without turning your head, it was easy to reach double figures when counting reproductions of his all-seeing image.
Now they're gone, often replaced by images of an elderly man in white robes -- Omar Mukhtar.
Who is he?
Beginning in 1912 and lasting for almost 20 years, Italian imperial designs on Libya were resisted by a determined local insurgency led by Mukhtar. His bands of fighters utilized guerrilla tactics and superior knowledge of the terrain to ambush Italian columns.
Opposition was quelled only when a 73-year-old Mukhtar was captured and executed by Italian armed forces in 1931.
Despite attempting to co-opt Mukhtar's legacy as a nationalist hero, Gadhafi ultimately felt threatened by the sheikh and had his body removed from its tomb in the center of Benghazi to an out-of-the-way rural town about 37 miles away.
Gadhafi was right to be worried. Omar Mukhtar remained an inspiration to modern revolutionaries, and in 2011, his battle cry of "We will win or we will die" was heard once more.
8. It's filled with Greco-Roman heritage
Eighty miles east of Tripoli, Leptis Magna was the hometown of Roman Emperor Septimus Severus. Even those prone to chronic attacks of temple fatigue can't fail to be wowed by the grandeur of its ruins.
The site is vast and well-preserved, though to date only one third has been excavated. The almost complete amphitheater and circus outside the main city are made all the more intriguing by virtue of their relative neglect.
Some 40 miles east of Tripoli, Sabratha's remains have been restored. While only a quarter of the site has been excavated, mosaics thus far uncovered rival those found in Rome.
And 120 miles east of Benghazi, the ruins of Cyrene reflect enduring Greek influences of language and architecture; the city's Temple of Zeus is larger than the Parthenon in Athens.
Anywhere else, all three sites would be honeypot tourist destinations, but these days it's possible you'll have them to yourself.
Leptis Magna and Sabratha are easy day trips from Tripoli; Cyrene is reached from Benghazi and with an early start can also be visited in a day. Because of poor security, travel eastward to Derna isn't recommended.
Though it's easy to visit sites independently, a knowledgeable guide can bring the ruins to life. Temehu (www.temehu.com) can organize excursions in advance.
"North Africa -- The Roman Coast" (www.bradtguides.com) has a useful section on Libya.

Rubio's wild immigration ride
By Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor
updated 7:13 AM EDT, Wed June 5, 2013
Ruben Navarrette says Sen. Marco Rubio is getting a tough lesson in the difficulties of pushing immigration legislation
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ruben Navarrette: Immigration reform is not for the faint of heart or the thin-skinned Navarrette: Marco Rubio has the thankless job of ginning up support among Republicans
He says most lawmakers prefer not to go near it; for those who do, it can be frustrating Navarrette: Why can't the GOP be confident and come up with policies that appeal to them?
Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette.
San Diego (CNN) -- Former Wyoming Sen. Al Simpson knows a thing or two about passing landmark immigration reform. My friend and former graduate school professor did it in 1986 with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which he co-authored with former Rep. Romano Mazzoli.
Simpson knows that the endeavor is not for the faint of heart, or the thin-skinned or the easily disillusioned. It means navigating one of the wackiest and wickedest debates in our public discourse. The immigration debate, he likes to say, is filled with "emotion, fear, guilt and racism."
Ruben Navarrette Jr.
It is no wonder that most lawmakers won't go anywhere near the immigration issue. For those who grab the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground, things can get frustrating.
So began the education of Marco Rubio. The Florida senator is the de-facto leader of the Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group of senators pushing for immigration reform. Rubio has become the face of immigration reform. He is the most articulate advocate and the game's most valuable player in large part because he is charged with rounding up Republican votes.
Meanwhile, if Rubio were to withdraw support for the bill, it wouldn't just be a game changer. It would be game over.
He recently worried allies by characterizing the bill as not strong enough and said that more border security measures have to be added.
While Rubio courts Republicans, the Democratic members of the gang (Charles Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois or Bob Menendez of New Jersey) need to arm-twist Democrats to make sure they're on board. Many of the Senate's Democrats don't seem enthusiastic about a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants.
On my scorecard, I count at least 10 Democrats, from both red states and union-friendly rust belt states, who either outright oppose the legislation or whose support is shaky.
Schumer predicted Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" that a bill could pass by the Fourth of July and that he is shooting for 70 votes, which he thought he could get, including a majority of Republicans.
Don't believe it. I've followed Schumer's approach to the immigration issue for many years, and most of what he says on the subject is a falsehood, a fraud or a fairy tale.
A couple of weeks ago, Menendez went on Univision's Sunday show, "Al Punto," and candidly told host Jorge Ramos that the Gang of Eight didn't have 60 votes. And now suddenly they have 70?
This is Schumer's game: Set expectations high and put the burden of meeting them squarely on Republicans. Leave Democrats off the hook. Talk about how most Republicans will support the bill. So when the vote comes and it turns out -- surprise! -- a majority of Republicans vote against the thing, the GOP will catch all the blame.
How will Congress vote on immigration?
Warren Buffett on stimulus, immigration
Rubio's reform role readies 2016 reach
It's all part of Mr. Rubio's wild ride.
Here you have a rising star in the GOP tasked with the thankless job of ginning up support among Republicans for a bill that many of them think would create millions of new Democratic voters, albeit, 13 years down the road, which is the amount of time that the legislation requires illegal immigrants to wait before becoming citizens and getting the right to vote.
I can't decide which is more pathetic. That Republicans have such a guilty conscience -- for the hamhanded way in which they've handled immigration, and the acrimony they've stirred up against Latinos -- that they think legalized immigrants are going to hold a grudge for 13 years before finally getting even. Or that Republicans have so little confidence in their own party, message and ability to win over these voters in those same 13 years by coming up with policies that appeal to them.
From the sounds of the debate, Rubio isn't making as many converts as he is making enemies in his own party.
There are even some conservatives, in the conspiracy corner of the GOP, who suggest that this was the secret plan of Democrats all along: Rope Rubio into supporting immigration reform. Put him front and center. Ruin his reputation with conservatives. And effectively remove him from the top-tier of 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls.
That is a little far-fetched. Besides, Rubio could emerge from all this with enough new supporters on the left to make up for whatever support he could be losing on the right. Either way, he seems intent on fighting one battle at a time and, assuming he has White House ambitions, letting the next presidential race take care of itself.
As for the senator wavering on the immigration bill, I don't see it. Rubio supports the main principles, and he's simply thinking about the best way to pass it. He said during a television interview on Tuesday that he doesn't think the bill has the 60 votes needed to break a possible filibuster and that "even the Democrats would concede that." And he is worried that "horse trading" could water down the border security provisions. But he still backs the final product.
Credit mom. In an interview with Time a few months ago, Rubio, whose middle name is Antonio, said that his mother, Oriales Garcia Rubio, left him a voice mail in December. She urged him to do right by illegal immigrants, whom she called "los pobrecitos" (the poor ones).
The message went: "Tony, some loving advice from the person who cares for you most in the world. Don't mess with the immigrants, my son. Please, don't mess with them. They're human beings just like us, and they came for the same reasons we came. To work. To improve their lives. So please, don't mess with them."
Rubio has said that his mother's plea reminded him that immigration has a "human element."
Now everything I see and hear, including the senator appearing on a gauntlet of conservative radio shows to defend the bill, tells me that Rubio will keep the faith.
That's not easy to do when, I have it on good authority, your Senate office is getting hate mail comically telling the Cuban-American lawmaker to "Go back to Mexico!"
Normally, that sort of thing might seem strange. But in the immigration debate, it's madness as usual.

8 hotel fees that may surprise you
By Jill Becker, Special to CNN
updated 8:12 AM EDT, Mon June 10, 2013
Hotels brought in nearly $2 billion in fees last year and the line-item charges are not going away, experts say.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The U.S. lodging industry collected $1.95 billion in fees in 2012, NYU study says
Fees started to emerge in the hotel industry in 1997, expert says, and fee revenue keeps increasing
Joining hotel loyalty programs is one way to avoid line-item charges
(CNN) -- We've come to expect fees for hotel WiFi and parking, but as lodging fees pile up, there are some that may come as a surprise to even the seasoned business traveler.
Early check-in? Some hotels charge for it. Restocking that $5 bottle of water you drank out of the minibar? Yes, some properties charge for that, too.
The amount of fees and surcharges being tacked onto hotel bills has reached an all-time high, according to a report from the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, which estimates that the U.S. lodging industry collected $1.95 billion in fees in 2012 -- up a whopping $100 million from the previous year.
Airports where architecture soars
"Fees and surcharges emerged as an industry practice in about 1997," notes Bjorn Hanson, the divisional dean of NYU's Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management, which compiled the NYU-SCPS report. According to the study, the amount of hotel fees collected has risen every year since 1997 except for select periods following 2001 and 2008, when the demand for lodging declined.
The rise in hotel fees can be attributed to two things, explains Bill Carroll, a PhoCusWright hotel analyst and senior lecturer at Cornell University.
"There is a unique opportunity for hotels to produce additional revenue from their asset. Second, the consumer choice to purchase additional services is not encumbered by competition. The consumer has already chosen among competitors to stay at the property. Given that decision, the property can now offer additional services, without direct (price) competition. In addition, the property knows a lot more about the guest (traveling alone or with family, staying over a weekend as a leisure guest versus midweek as a business traveler, etc.). Targeted service offerings can be made."
Check in: World's best airport hotels
Hotel fees for things that add customer value are one thing, says Carroll, but "on the negative side are fees that bet on the guest not paying attention to folio charges."
Here are a few examples of the new batch of fees that have been creeping onto hotel bills.
Early check-in fee. If you want to check in to your room before the preset time, you could incur a charge of as much as $50 for the privilege.
Early check-out fee. You may also be charged anywhere from $50 to the cost of a night's stay if you have to leave a day or more earlier than expected.
Cancellation fees. Need to cancel your stay altogether? Whereas before you might have been able to cancel your reservation without penalty by 6 p.m. on the day before your scheduled arrival, some hotels are now charging you a night's stay if you don't cancel within 48 or even 72 hours prior to arrival.
Minibar restocking fee. At some hotels you'll not only have to pay to enjoy an item from the minibar, you'll also have to pay a restocking fee to have the item replaced. So that $12 can of nuts may end up costing you more like $19.
Automatic gratuities. Before you tip anyone, check to see if an automatic gratuity for their services has already been added. For instance, you may incur a one-time $10 to $30 fee to cover housekeeping and bellman gratuities, while your bill for room service or spa services may already include a 10% to 20% tip.
Gym fee. Some hotels are pumping up their bills by charging anywhere from $5 to $40 a day for the use of the fitness facilities.
Baggage holding fees. Need to stash your luggage at the bellhop stand? You might have to shell out a couple of bucks per bag to have them tucked away.
Tiered WiFi charges. Some hotels are charging for Internet access based on how you use it. For example, basic Internet service for things like checking your e-mail may be free, but if you need high-speed access, then it could cost you upwards of $10 a day.
Airlines collect $27 billion beyond ticket revenue
What irks travelers even more than having to pay the growing number of hotel fees is the fact that they may not even know about them until they've already booked the room, or worse, gotten their bill. So you need to do your due diligence and find out ahead of time what to expect.
In the minds of some hoteliers, the fees are a way to give guests what they want and not charge them for what they don't.
"Many guests don't require the full amenities a hotel offers, so fees are implemented to offer additional services the guests can add to their basic stay without penalizing other guests who don't need them," says Marc Sternagel, general manager of the Novotel New York Times Square. "Guests like the option of choosing additional add-ons, and therefore they are able to customize their experience in accordance with their personal needs for any specific stay."
Others hoteliers worry that bombarding their guests with fees will cost them customers.
"At all of our resorts, valet parking, Internet and minibar refreshments are extended to our guests on a complimentary basis," says Caroline MacDonald, senior vice president of marketing for Auberge Resorts. "Several resorts also provide breakfast as part of the daily rate. We find that our guests really appreciate the small gestures, and have found that they value the overall experience."
World's best airport spas
Benji Homsey, president of Hotel ZaZa, a collection with locations in Dallas and Houston, says his company puts convenience and the guest experience first. "We've never charged for WiFi. We consider technology an investment for the hotel, since 65% of our midweek guests are business travelers."
However you see them, hotel fees aren't likely to be going away anytime soon.
"Such fees will continue," predicts Carroll. "The smart hotels will structure offerings that are both reasonable to the consumer and add value. A few hotels will challenge the very notion of hospitality — 'Mary and Joseph, there will be an additional straw fee for the manger.'"
Hanson forecasts that the number and variety of hotel surcharges will likely taper off, but the number of hotels charging fees will increase, as will the amount of the fees being charged.
Explains Melanie Nayer, a veteran travel journalist and hotels expert: "Like everything, prices fluctuate with the economy and also based on demand. And hotels are just calculating appropriately based on industry standards."
Besides, she says, you were basically already paying these fees, you just didn't know it since they were lumped into a flat rate. "These aren't new fees so much as they are fees that have been separated from your room charge and put into a different line item."
Luckily, there are some ways you can avoid the glut of hotel surcharges.
"Loyalty programs are the best way to avoid extra fees and surcharges, since loyalty programs typically offer fee waivers," says Nayer. "You can also avoid fees in many cases by calling ahead to the hotel and asking about packages, many of which include fee waivers, especially for WiFi and parking."
Avoiding hotel fees may mean a little extra work on your part, but it could make a noticeable difference, especially for business travelers who may have trouble explaining all those extra line items when they turn in their expense reports.
What kinds of hotel fees have you encountered? What's your take on line-item billing?

Reid urges patience, remains optimistic over deal prospects
By Tom Cohen and Matt Smith, CNN
updated 8:24 PM EDT, Mon October 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Under deal being negotiated, the debt ceiling would be increased until February 7, sources say Senate majority leader hopes that Tuesday will be "bright" in Washington
Democratic sources say changes to Obamacare under consideration
President Obama chides House Republicans for partisan brinksmanship
Washington (CNN) -- Two steps forward, one step back.
A surge of optimism on Monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a U.S. default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a White House meeting between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders.
In a brief statement, the White House said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold "to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress" toward a solution.
It was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to finish an agreement that could win approval in the Senate and the House.
7 crazy side effects from the shutdown
Negotiations heated up with the Democratic and Republican leaders signaling progress. Both Reid and McConnell took to the Senate floor to express optimism for a compromise on the twin priorities that they expected to be reasonable and acceptable to both sides.
Reid's tone remained positive as night fell over the Capitol.
"We've made tremendous progress," he said, saying that "everyone just needs to be patient" and that "perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day."
Key negotiators also maintained an upbeat posture and financial markets, which Washington is watching very closely considering their volatility over the political impasse, also ended the day higher with Wall Street heartened by news of a possible deal, especially on the debt limit.
Senate gets closer to a deal
Visitors walk at the National World War II Memorial after a rally at the monument in Washington on Tuesday, October 15. Activists from veterans groups gathered to protest the partial shutdown of the U.S. government and to rally for resolutions to the budget crisis. Signs of the shutdown can be found across the country.
A closure sign is posted on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol. Much of Washington remains closed with hundreds of thousands of government workers furloughed. The impasse even takes center stage on the White House website.
The main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park was closed for more than a week before it reopened Saturday, October 12.
The Smithsonian's National Zoo website states, "All the animals will continue to be fed and cared for. A shutdown does not affect our commitment to the safety of our staff and standard of excellence in animal care."
A sign at the bathroom of the National Visitors Center in Boston announces that the restrooms are closed in Faneuil Hall.
Mark Weekley, superintendent at the National Park Service's Lewis and Clark National Historical Trail, tapes a closed sign to the window October 1 in Omaha, Nebraska.
A handwritten sign at the Mount Rainier National Park administration building tells employees where to pick up their furlough letters October 1.
Despite signs stating that the national parks are closed, people visit the World War II Memorial in Washington on October 2.
A sign on Highway 41, north of Fresno, California, tells motorists about the closure of Yosemite Park on October 1.
According to the FBI's website, information not directly related to the protection of life and property will not be routinely updated on the site.
A closed sign hangs at the entrance to the U.S. Treasury building October 3.
Mirta Maltes, a U.S. park ranger, speaks with Christoph Zuercher, a tourist from Switzerland, outside Everglades National Park on October 7 in Miami.
A couple walks next to a sign October 12 informing them that the Statue of Liberty is closed. It reopened the next day on the state of New York's dime.

Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown
During a visit Monday to a local food pantry, Obama cited progress in the Senate negotiations but also warned of what he called continued partisan brinkmanship by House Republicans who "continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shut down or by threatening default."
"My hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours," Obama said.
Shutdown drags on
The failure of Congress to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on October 1.
Another deadline looms on Thursday, when the Treasury says it will need Congress to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government's bills.
During his visit to Martha's Table in Washington, Obama said the congressional leaders could "solve this problem today."
The crisis with an on/off switch
He warned that a default, in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as Social Security checks, "could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy."
"We've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown," he said. "That damage would be greatly magnified if we don't make sure that government's paying its bills, and that has to be decided this week."
The Treasury Department said it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday.
As reported by CNN's Dana Bash and CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, the main sticking point involves how long an agreement would fund the government to end the shutdown and increase the debt limit.
Democrats want the debt ceiling increase to extend as long as possible to avoid similar showdowns in coming months.
Conservatives defiant in the face of GOP troubles
At the same time, they seek a temporary spending plan to reopen the government while formal budget negotiations work out a longer-term agreement that can negate the impacts of the forced sequestration cuts.
Republicans, however, want a longer spending proposal that would lock in the planned sequestration cuts in coming months, with a shorter debt ceiling extension in order to negotiate further deficit-reduction measures.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have spearheaded the bipartisan talks. Separately, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee also cited progress.
"We'll get this done. We're gonna get this done. I feel real confident," Manchin said.
Manchin said the goal was to get at least 65 Senate votes -- which would mean 10 or more from Republicans -- to help Speaker John Boehner generate GOP backing in the House despite certain opposition from the tea party conservative wing.
Manchin said Reid and McConnell must work out specifics.
The two party leaders met twice in the morning and early afternoon, and they offered their optimistic assessments after their second face-to-face discussion. Boehner also dropped by McConnell's office to get an update on the talks, his aide confirmed.

Details of proposal fluid
Democratic sources told Bash and CNN's Deirdre Walsh that the proposal under consideration by Reid and McConnell would fund the government through January 15, allowing it to reopen for at least three months or so.
At the same time, negotiations on a budget for the full fiscal year would have a deadline of some time in December, the sources said.
Meanwhile, the debt ceiling would be increased through February 7 to put off the threat of default for almost four months, according to sources in both parties.
The budget negotiations were expected to address deficit reduction measures and therefore could impact when the debt limit would need to be increased again.
Paul Ryan steps into budget fight
In addition, provisions involving Obama's signature health care reforms could be included, such as strengthening verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the sources said.
Another possible change to the health care reforms would delay a fee on employers, unions and other plan sponsors that raise money to compensate insurance companies for taking on high-risk customers in the early years of Obamacare.
CNN political analyst John Avlon said Monday that Democrats wanted to press what they perceive as an advantage over Republicans on how the public is perceiving the latest round of Washington budget and deficit brinkmanship.
"What's behind it (are) poll numbers that saw Republicans getting their butt kicked because of this whole gamesmanship," Avlon said.
Mindful that the Thursday debt deadline is days away, House Republican leaders are considering all their options even as Republican and Democratic Senate leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling, said a GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

11 essential tastes of Cyprus
By Robin Gauldie, for CNN
updated 4:57 PM EST, Wed December 18, 2013
Dips, pickles and bean salads are typical meze openers, but you're not meant to fill up on them -- a great meze comprises at least 20 dishes and takes all evening to polish off.
A meze spread without haloumi is rare. When grilled, the cheese loses its squeaky quality and becomes gooey. Loukanika (spicy sausages simmered in red wine) are often served alongside grilled haloumi.
Pork plays a leading role in Greek Cypriot cooking. Lountza is a dried, smoked pork tenderloin.
Lean chunks of pork are marinated in red wine, flavored with cumin, cinnamon and coriander, then simmered in a clay casserole until meltingly tender.
Tiny wild snails called karaoli are gathered by the bucket-load and served simmered in tomato sauce.
Tender young vine leaves are at their best in spring, when they're used to wrap minced lamb or pork and rice to make the typical snack called koupepia.
For something distinctively Cypriot, ohtapodi krasato -- tenderized octopus chunks spiced with coriander and cumin and simmered in red wine -- is a great choice.
Octopus is also a good choice because, although Cyprus is an island, seafood is often mediocre and overpriced.
Ravioles are a culinary legacy left by the Venetians, who ruled Cyprus from 1489 to 1571. The pasta parcels are stuffed with haloumi, then simmered in chicken broth.
The sticky toffee pasteli is made from pressed carob bean juice, locally known as mavros chrysos ("black gold").

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Cypriot cooking blends flavors from Greece, Venice, Turkey and the Middle East But fast food joints far outnumber indigenous eateries in the resorts You can find the real deal in the hill villages -- a meze meal provides up to 20 little dishes to try
Editor's note: CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into the customs and culture of Cyprus. CNN.com explores the places, the people and the passions unique to this eastern Mediterranean island
(CNN) -- Pizza joints, sushi bars, "British" pubs, curry houses and Thai restaurants rule in Cyprus's sprawling resort areas, far outnumbering humble Cypriot places.
But you can find true indigenous dining in urban parts such as Limassol, Larnaca or Nicosia if you follow groups of determined-looking Cypriots around lunch or dinnertime.
The search is easier if you head for the hills, to smaller villages with fewer visitors.
Either way, you'll find menus that blend flavors inherited from Greece, Venice, Turkey and the Middle East.
Spices such as cumin, cinnamon and coriander enrich many dishes.
Cypriot cooks also use lots of wild and foraged ingredients, including greens such as kapari (wild capers), the tiny snails called karaoli and game including rabbit, hare and partridge.
1. Meze time
A meze meal is a great way to sample the best of Cypriot food at one sitting.
Meze isn't unique to Cyprus -- the tradition of serving a generous array of small savory dishes is common all over the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.
Squeaks in .. grilled haloumi comes after the cold starters.
But many of the individual meze dishes you'll find in Cyprus are peculiar to the island.
A typical meze table begins with dips such as tahini, pickles, stuffed vine leaves and cold bean salads.
Grilled halloumi cheese will likely follow, along with spicy sausages such as loukanika, often simmered in red wine.
Then comes more meat -- grilled on the spit, skewered or barbecued over charcoal. Pork gets top billing, but lamb and chicken play supporting roles.
A meze that mixes fish and meat is heresy, so if you have a yen for something maritime, you must seek out a taverna that specializes in seafood.
Here, the platters will be piled with fried or grilled red mullet, whitebait, shrimp, fried baby squid and octopus or cuttlefish simmered in red wine and spices.
Tip: pacing is essential. It's all too easy to eat your fill from the first round, leaving no room for dishes to follow.
A great meze comprises at least 20 dishes -- it should take all evening to polish them off.
Top places to spend a meze evening include 7 St George's Tavern (Yeroskepos, Paphos; +357 2696 3176; reservations essential) in Geroskipou, just a few kilometers from downtown Paphos.
In Nicosia, many residents say the lountza and haloumi at Mezostrati (Evagorou 31; +357 2266 2727) are the best in town.

2. Karaoli yahni
The tiny wild snails called karaoli emerge in vast numbers with the autumn rains.
Karaoli are gathered by the bucket-load and served in tomato sauce.
They're especially common in the Akamas peninsula, the island's wild western tip, where they're gathered by the bucket-load and served simmered in tomato sauce.
A good place to try them is at Kouppas Stone Castle (Neo Chorio, Akamas; +357 2632 2526) in the old fashioned stone village of Neo Chorio, five kilometers south of the fishing harbor at Lakki.
3. Koupepia
Tender young vine leaves are at their best in spring, when they're used to wrap minced lamb or pork and rice to make this typical snack, served hot or cold.
In winter, cabbage leaves are used instead of vine leaves.
4. Poikilia
A glass of Cypriot wine or zivania (grape spirit) should rarely be served alone. It usually comes accompanied by an assortment of savory dishes -- poikilia.
Among the best are cold cuts such as tsamarella (sun-cured goat thigh), hiromeri (pork thigh marinated in wine, then pressed and wood-smoked) or pastourma, Cyprus's take on salt beef.
5. Afelia
Cypriot food isn't all about small plates -- hearty eaters will be more than satisfied.
Pork plays a leading role in traditional cuisine, and afelia can claim to be the country's signature dish.
Lean chunks of pork are marinated in red wine, flavored with cumin, cinnamon and coriander, then simmered in a clay casserole until meltingly tender.
6. Sheftalia
Sheftalia are herb-flavored sausages of minced pork or lamb, which often anchor a meze platter but are also served as a meaty main course.
Esteemed for its sausages is Agrino (Lofos village, 12 kilometers north of Limassol; +357 2581 3777), the gourmet restaurant at Apokryfo, a boutique hotel in a hill village above Limassol.
7. Kolokasi
A dish unique to Cyprus, kolokasi (taro) has been grown here since Roman times.
Chunks of taro root are simmered with chicken or pork in a sauce of caramelized tomatoes, onions and celery, spiked with lemon juice and served with olives and radishes.
It's also often made without meat for the Lenten fast.
8. Oktapodi krasato
Add coriander, cumin, red wine, then eat.
You're never far from the sea in Cyprus and seafood restaurants abound.
Many are mediocre, serving farmed and frozen fish to unwary tourists.
MORE: Is this the world's oldest wine?
For something distinctively Cypriot, there are places offering dishes such as oktapodi krasato -- chunks of tenderized octopus spiced with coriander and cumin and simmered in red wine.
Zephyros (Piyale Pasa 37, Larnaca; +357 2465 7198), where the seafood comes straight from the little harbor right next door, is a good choice.
9. Vegetarian dishes
The Cypriot menu is meat-heavy, but -- because devout Orthodox Christians eschew meat during Lent -- there are plenty of veggie options, including anthous (courgette flowers stuffed with rice and feta cheese) and louvi me lahana (black eyed beans served cold with wild greens, oil and lemon juice) and dips, such as tahini.
Vasiliki (Digeni Akrita 28a, Nicosia; +357 2234 9803; lunch only) has a good array of dips, pulses, salads and other vegetarian dishes.
10. Ravioles
Ravioles are part of the culinary legacy left by the Venetians, who ruled Cyprus from 1489 to 1571.
Similar to Italian ravioli, these pasta parcels are stuffed with haloumi cheese, then simmered in chicken broth.
Delicious, and filling, they're especially good at Erinias restaurant (Archbishop Kyprianos 64A, Nicosia, +357 224 22860).
11. Pasteli
And so to sweet things.
Anogyra is the place to find sticky toffee called pasteli that's still made the old way from the juice pressed from the carob bean. It's known as mavros chrysos ("black gold").
The Pasteli Museum (daily, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; +357 2522 2357) tells the story of carob growing in Cyprus, and you can sample and buy pasteli and other carob items in the nearby Pasteli Factory (+357 2522 1500).

Is this what a feminist looks like? Cherie Blair's life after Downing Street
By Becky Anderson and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN
updated 9:24 AM EST, Tue January 14, 2014
Cherie Blair is probably best known as the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. But since leaving England's most famous political address, she has become a champion for women's rights and education around the globe. Blair hugs her husband outside 10 Downing Street on May 2, 1997 following the Labour Party's victory in the country's general election. But Blair tells CNN that when she met a young Tony Blair while training to be a lawyer, he didn't leave a good impression. "I thought he's just another one of these public school boys but then we worked together and ... he made a different impression on me."
The prominent British barrister says husband Tony has always been a hands-on father sharing parenting duties equally with her while she continued to advance her career as a barrister. As her spouse rose in the political ranks, Blair -- who professionally goes by her maiden name of "Cherie Booth" -- carved out a successful career first as an attorney, then in 1995 (pictured here with her family) she received the senior advocate status of Queen's Counsel. While living at Downing Street, Blair felt her horizons widen as she realized how "privileged" she was. It reinvigorated her passion for women's rights and her continued fight for gender equality.
In 2008, she established the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women aimed at providing education and financial aid to female entrepreneurs internationally. With projects in Ghana, Tanzania and Rwanda, the foundation continues to empower local women with the necessary tools to enhance their businesses. Here Blair visits a women's initiative center in India in March 2013. Cherie Blair poses with president of the NGO 'Fondation Espoir et Vie' Pauline Lambou Ngouanfou during the New York Forum Africa in Libreville on June 15, 2013. The forum, dedicated to the economic development of Africa, brings together nearly 700 economic policymakers.
Blair says she hopes she will be remembered "as someone who tried to do her best, and who fought for the causes she believed in.... I think on my gravestone, I'd like it to say 'Cherie Blair, wife, mother and feminist'."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Cherie Blair is best known as the wife of former British PM Tony Blair
Blair is also a celebrated legal mind specializing in human rights, public law
Has become a strong advocate for women's rights, education since leaving political life
Editor's note: Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time -- remarkable professionals who have made it to the top in all areas of business, the arts, sport, culture, science and more.
London, England (CNN) -- Under constant scrutiny, hosting countless functions and attending numerous public events are just some of the practices expected of you as the wife of a prime minister.
All the while conducting yourself impeccably.
So when Tony Blair was elected British prime minister in 1997, Cherie Blair went from being a fairly obscure but accomplished barrister to the spouse of the country's political leader.
"You go in there and you kind of think you can just carry on as before," she says. "Suddenly I couldn't just speak for myself ... as the wife of the prime minister I'm supposed to be seen and not heard.

Empowering women around the world
But she was never going to be a traditional political trophy wife smiling quietly in the background.
A humble upbringing
Moving the family into England's most famous political address was worlds away from how Cherie herself was brought up in a working class household in 1960s Liverpool.
The eldest of two daughters, Cherie Booth -- her maiden name, which she continues to use in her professional life -- came from a tumultuous family background.
Both parents were actors but she describes her father Tony -- a minor sitcom star -- as "flawed", recalling how he left the family when she was 8 years old.
As it turned out, Booth had an aptitude for academics along with a hardworking nature instilled through her upbringing by a "formidable" mother and grandmother.
She went on to read law at the London School of Economics graduating with first-class honors and emerging as the top law student in her class when she sat the bar exams. She continued to excel during her apprenticeship with prestigious attorney Derry Irvine. And it was there she met another advocate undergoing "pupilage" by the name of Anthony Blair.
"He didn't make a good impression on me at the time," she says. "I thought he's just another one of these public school boys but then we worked together and ... he made a different impression on me."
Ever the astute young lawyer she also noted how her gender was considered an impediment when she went up against her future husband for a position at Lincoln's Inn -- one of the four Inns of Court in London. Tony got the job.
She says it was because they assumed "I am a female, I'm bound to leave when I had children.
"In fact seven years later one of us did leave the bar but it wasn't me. It was my husband because he left to become an MP (Member of Parliament)."
A profound union
As her spouse rose in the political ranks, Booth carved out a successful career first as an attorney then, in 1995, she received the senior advocate status of Queen's Counsel. Six years later she turned her attention to co-founding her own practice, Matrix
Juggling work and home life hasn't always been easy for the high profile pairing. Blair cites her strong alliance with her partner as a key to her success.
"There were plenty of times when he would be the person who was there up with the children in [our] constituency when I was in court somewhere," she says. "He was very supportive and always has been he's been a very hands-on father."
"As I get older, I get more impatient, because we haven't yet succeeded making it possible for women to achieve their dreams.Cherie Blair
This hands on, compromising approach to raising their children is the reason Blair doesn't believe the idea of work-life balance is solely a women's issue.
"The way we do things at the moment doesn't just disadvantage women. I think it disadvantages men and doesn't allow them to explore the caring side of their personalities."
Combining advocacy and humanitarian work
Blair says her 10 years at Downing Street helped provide a renewed purpose when it came to championing the rights of women around the world.
"So much of the oppression of women is based on some sort of fear about the power of females ... We all know actually men and women flourish best when they're both given the opportunities to reach their dreams," says Blair.
In 2008 she established the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women with the purpose of providing education and capital to female entrepreneurs in developing and emerging nations.
Projects have been launched in locations including Ghana, Tanzania and Rwanda where the foundation works with local women providing the necessary tools and technological support to take their businesses to the next level.
"The reason why I wanted to help women is obvious -- because of my own background ... I had the opportunities that my mother and my grandmother would only -- well did -- dream of," explains Blair.
"I think on my gravestone, I'd like it to say 'Cherie Blair, wife, mother and feminist'.Cherie Blair
"As I get older, I get more impatient, because we haven't yet succeeded making it possible for women to achieve their dreams. We still have not got gender equality anywhere.
"In this world I am afraid money talks, and the woman who has her own money, who has financial independence, can make decisions, she can make choices ... They will also change the lives of those around them, and ultimately, shape society for the better."
So what kind of legacy would Blair like to leave behind?
"I think on my gravestone, I'd like it to say 'Cherie Blair, wife, mother and feminist'."
