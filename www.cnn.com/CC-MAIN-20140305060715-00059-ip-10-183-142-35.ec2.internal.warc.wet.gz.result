(CNN) -- Rebels engaged in a nearly two-decade long insurgency are reported to have attacked a refugee camp in northern Uganda, killing more than 190 people.
A Roman Catholic priest on the scene said on Sunday the rebels -- most of them "children, baby soldiers" -- had forced people to remain inside their huts which they had then set on fire.
Father Giulio Albanese, the editor of the Roman Catholic Missionary News Service Agency in Rome, said Father Sebhat Ayele had told him the rebels attacked at about 5 p.m. Saturday and burned 500 huts in their three-hour attack.
"(Father Sebhat) said many of the people who died died in their huts, burned by the rebels," Father Giulio told CNN. "What is shocking ... the people were forced to remain inside their huts."
"He saw with his own eyes six or seven children burnt alive with their mothers," he said.
Joe Wacha, a reporter for Kampala's Sunday Monitor, told CNN on Sunday that the rebels overran a local of militia of 36 guards deployed to protect the camp, home to 5,000 people.
"The security situation, it's not a very good kind of situation here," he said.
An early report from Wacha and Sebhat's report indicated 173 people were killed, but Wacha said the number had risen to 193. More than 70 people were seriously hurt and rushed to a hospital in Lira, 25 km away from the Barloonyo camp where the attack took place, Giulio said.
The Lord's Resistance Army has been fighting President Yoweri Museveni since he came to power in 1986. The group is led by Joseph Kony, who claims spiritual powers.
Museveni's government has often dismissed the rebels as a defeated force, and focuses on recruitment and training of local militias to protect the north of his country.
But the insurgency has forced about a million people to flee their homes, and fills its ranks with abducted children and shows few signs of being truly defeated.
Government forces attacked a rebel camp last week, the army said, killing 36 insurgents and rescuing 22 children who had been abducted.
Father Giulio told CNN he met with some of the rebels last year and was shocked "that these rebels are very young, and they kill in a very cruel way."
"They act under the effect of a collective hypnosis ... acts beyond any human imagination, not even an animal would kill in that way," he said. "An animal kills to survive."

Honda blames global crisis for F1 withdrawalStory Highlights Honda say they are pulling out of F1 unless a buyer for the team can be found Japanese carmaker will quit in December, blaming global financial pressures The decision means only 18 cars and nine teams will line up on the 2009 grid Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello are now without drives for next seasonNext Article in World Sport » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Honda have confirmed they are pulling out of Formula One, unless a buyer for the team can be found by the end of the month, blaming the global financial crisis for their decision. Jenson Button, left, and Rubens Barrichello could be out of a job following Honda's withdrawal from F1. Chief executive Takeo Fukui announced at a news conference in Tokyo that the company would be willing to sell the team and will withdraw from the 2009 competition if no buyer is found by the end of Decemebr -- ending the Japanese car giant's nine-year involvement in the sport. "We, Honda Motor Co Ltd, have come to the conclusion that we will withdraw from all Formula One activities, making 2008 the last season of our participation," said Fukui. "This difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry, brought on by the sub-prime problem in the United States, the deepening credit crisis and the sudden contraction of the world economies. "Honda must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economies around the globe continue to mount. A recovery is expected to take some time," he added. It is understood the 600 members of staff at Brackley, near the Silverstone circuit in England, were told job losses would be likely, even if a buyer was found for the team. The news also leaves drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello facing an uncertain future, with spare places in rival teams few and far between. Honda's demise would also reduce the F1 grid to just 18 cars (nine teams) and would see them become the second team to fold this year following Super Aguri's closure early in the season. Despite a huge operational budget of $300 million, Honda have under-achieved in the sport, finishing ninth out of 10 in the constructors' standings with Barrichello 14th and Button 18th out of the 20 drivers. Honda Motor Corporation are dealing with faltering sales worldwide and the Formula One team is not the only casualty. On Thursday, 490 temporary employees were told they would be laid off at the end of January, while last month 270 temporary employees were informed their contracts were not being renewed. Max Mosley, president of Formula One's governing body, the FIA, said Honda's withdrawal had confirmed his "longstanding concern that the cost of competing in the world championship is unsustainable." Read more about Mosley's past warnings Mosley sent a letter to the remaining teams urging them to accept cost-cutting moves including smaller, more fuel-efficient engines, which he estimated would shave up to $60 million off the expense of running a team beginning in the 2010 season. Don't Miss Honda's history in Formula One
Can F1 survive global downturn?
"In the FIA's view, the global economic downturn has only exacerbated an already critical situation," Mosley said. "What has happened to Honda is very sad because obviously it involves a lot of jobs and they are a key player in Formula One, but I have to say it was not entirely unexpected," he added. "I've been expecting one of the major manufacturers to stop for some time because even before the current situation the costs were completely out of control. Now it's difficult to imagine how any manufacturer could stay in the sport unless we make really substantial reductions in costs." Meanwhile, Honda team principal Ross Brawn remains confident a suitable new owner could still be found. The former Ferrari technical director told BBC Radio Five Live: "It's a fantastic opportunity for someone to step into what will be a very competitive team next year. "The facilities here are one of the best in Formula One, the workforce is definitely one of the best in Formula One and we have got a great car design for next year. "I think it would be unfortunate for Formula One if this had a domino effect on other teams. I hope that doesn't happen but all the teams are having to face up to this economic environment. "Formula One unfortunately has a certain inertia and it is difficult to change things quickly because of the regulations. If a car factory gets into difficulty it can close down for a few months, stop production. We can't do that. We have races to go to and schedules to meet. "It is very difficult to turn the tap off in Formula One overnight but I think the things that are being done now can really make a difference next year and in 2010."

Man pleads not guilty in deadly recruiting center shootingsStory Highlights Police say "political and religious motives" were indicated Convert said he was angry over military's treatment of Muslims, police say One soldier killed, one wounded in Monday's shootings Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- An Arkansas man suspected in a shooting that killed one soldier and wounded another at a Little Rock military recruiting center was angry over the treatment of Muslims, authorities said Tuesday. Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, was killed in Monday's attack. Abdulhakim Bledsoe, 23, of Little Rock, also told police he recently watched a video "pertaining to subversive activities which spurred him to commit this act," according to court documents. Bledsoe pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday and was ordered held without bail. He faces one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act, said Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas. The terrorist counts stem from the shots fired at an occupied building. Watch scenes from Tuesday in court » Before the not guilty plea, authorities said Bledsoe waived his Miranda rights after the shooting Monday and gave a video statement indicating that "political and religious" motives were involved. He "stated that he was a practicing Muslim ... that he was mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past," homicide detective Tommy Hudson said in a police report. Bledsoe told police "he fired several rounds at the soldiers with the intent of killing them," according to Hudson's report. Don't Miss Read an affidavit (PDF)
The suspect is a Muslim convert who has also gone by the names Carlos Bledsoe and Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad. He changed his name from the latter April 23, citing religious reasons, court records show. A leader of the Muslim community in Little Rock said he did not know Bledsoe. The suspect had been under investigation after visiting Yemen, a federal law enforcement official said. The official declined to provide further information. Police believe the shooter acted alone "with the specific purpose of targeting military personnel," Thomas said. Kent Krause, Bledsoe's public defender, said a formal hearing would be held for his client, but no date has been set. Residents left flowers and miniature American flags outside the recruiting center after the shooting. A lone candle burned on the sidewalk next to bouquets of white and red roses. A note that said "Thank you for your service" was attached to the flowers. The shooting Monday killed Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, and wounded Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, who were outside the military recruiting center. Bledsoe told police he was driving around and saw Long and Ezeagwula smoking outside the building, according to Hudson's report. He said he pulled into the parking lot and shot the two soldiers and added that "he would have killed more soldiers if they had been on the parking lot," according to the report. Ezeagwula was in stable condition Tuesday, the police chief said. The soldiers were part of a recruiting program called "hometown recruiting assistance," said Lt. Col. Thomas F. Artis, commander of the Oklahoma recruiting battalion that oversees the Little Rock Army-Navy recruiting center. Under the program, soldiers tell their stories to potential recruits. It's a volunteer position taken while soldiers are visiting or based back in their home region, Artis said. "I'm relieved there's a suspect in custody," said Capt. Matthew Feehan, commander of the recruiting center. He said several people were in the building at the time of the shooting, but nobody else was injured. Bledsoe was arrested after officers on Interstate 630 pulled over his car, which matched witnesses' description of a black Ford sport utility vehicle seen leaving the scene of the shooting. Police recovered three guns from the suspect's vehicle -- an SKS semi-automatic rifle, a .22-caliber rifle and a .380-caliber automatic pistol, Thomas said. The victims were shot with an SKS rifle, according to the police report. Police also seized from Bledsoe's vehicle and apartment several rounds of ammunition, two homemade silencers, handwritten notes in Arabic, CDs with handwritten Arabic labels, a computer and cell phones, according to court documents. Melvin Bledsoe of Memphis, Tennessee, was listed on the police report as Bledsoe's father. He declined to comment, referring questions to Little Rock police.

Sources: Virginia governor tapped for DNC chairStory Highlights Democratic officials: Obama has tapped Gov. Tim Kaine to be DNC chairman Kaine will serve part-time until his term as governor expires, officials say Kaine was among first prominent Democratic leaders to endorse Obama last year Next Article in Politics » (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama has tapped Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine to serve as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, replacing former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, two Democratic officials told CNN Sunday. Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine claps during an August campaign event for Barack Obama in Virginia. Kaine, who was mentioned as a possible running mate for Obama during the presidential race, will serve on a part-time basis until his term as governor expires in a year, the officials said. Kaine was one of the first prominent Democratic leaders to endorse Obama during last year's primaries. There was no immediate comment Sunday from Obama's transition team or Kaine's spokesman. Before being elected governor in 2005, Kaine served as lieutenant governor and mayor of Richmond. He is married and has three children.

Obama Afghanistan strategy: More troops in quickly, drawdown in 2011 Obama: '30,000 U.S. troops'STORY HIGHLIGHTS30,000 troops to be deployed within six months, President Obama saysObama: More troops would quicken transfer of responsibility to AfghanistanObama wants most U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 3 years, officials sayPresident: Goals are to deny al Qaeda a safe haven and reverse Taliban's momentum West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government. "There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum," Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. "Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. "And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population. ... In short, the status quo is not sustainable." Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops "at the fastest pace possible" starting in early 2010 "with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011." The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops "will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces." Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.

It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January. In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives: • Deny al Qaeda a safe haven • Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government • Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan. "We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border," Obama said. The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines. "I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests," Obama said. "Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan." Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s. "Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action," Obama said. "Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border." The president is saying this has to happen, so the military will make it happen.--A White House official, on the accelerated deployment of troops

Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan. "We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens," Obama said. "And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron." Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team. He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future. "As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service," he said. The additional U.S. forces "will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight," Obama said. "And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans." Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is "confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead." "Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan," he said. "Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world." The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. Obama, whom Republicans had accused of "dithering" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said. The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly. A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is "trying to do it faster" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a "failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible." The Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is "very aggressive" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order. Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner. Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement. "The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months," the statement said. Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. His liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan. In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation. U.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.

Too drunk for Facebook? This tool may helpBy Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media "Social Media Sobriety Test" lets users prove they're at least relatively sober before ill-advised, booze-induced Web posts. STORY HIGHLIGHTS "Social Media Sobriety Test" lets users check themselves before posting Firefox plug-in has tests like writing the alphabet backward or following moving objects The plug-in works on sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Myspace
RELATED TOPICS
Facebook Inc.
Alcohol
Internet
(CNN) -- Regretting that drunken tweet from Friday? Did your mom's reply to your 3 a.m. Facebook video post reveal that, in the sober light of morning, it might not have been a good idea? Help is just a download away. "The Social Media Sobriety Test," a free Firefox plug-in from online-security company Webroot, lets users name sites, like Facebook and Twitter, on which they'd like a little oversight. Set the hours you feel most likely to give in to booze-fueled temptation, and the plug-in will ask you to pass a simple test before being able log on. "Nothing good happens online after 1a.m.," reads the Web page for the add-on, promising to help "put an end to the embarrassment that follows regrettable, late-night posts." "Pass a simple test to prove you're sound of mind," it says. "Post away or, if you fail, maybe just go to bed." A test on Monday required this writer [who was stone-cold sober, thank you very much] to keep the computer's cursor inside a moving circle. Brenna Ehrlich over at social-media blog Mashable, however, reports flunking a sign-in test while sober. "You try typing the alphabet backwards," she wrote. "It's not as easy as it looks." The site also lets users set up the test on Myspace, photo site Flickr, blog host Tumblr and YouTube. The user can manually add other social-media sites to the list. As evidence of the need for its service, the app's page features a scroll of what appear to be Twitter posts that could have been avoided. "There may be a video that just popped up of me singing Taylor Swift's 'Mine.' I may or may not be drunk in it," says one. "My boss is drunk in my living room when all I really wanna do is read Harry Potter before bed," says another. The feature is similar to Google's "Mail Goggles." That app requires Gmail users who install it to solve math problems before sending booze-soaked messages late at night on weekends.

Petraeus: U.S. has plan to deal with Iran's nuclear program Gen. David Petraeus said he thinks there is still time to engage in diplomacy with Iran. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gen. David Petraeus: Contingency plans in place to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions Iran says its nuclear development is for peaceful purposes Petraeus: No deadline on enactment of any U.S. contingency plans RELATED TOPICS
Iran
David Petraeus
Nuclear Proliferation
Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- In addition to diplomacy and sanctions, the United States has developed contingency plans in dealing with Iran's nuclear facilities, a top U.S. military commander told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, did not elaborate on the plans in the interview, to be aired Sunday. But he said the military has considered the impacts of any action taken there. "It would be almost literally irresponsible if CENTCOM were not to have been thinking about the various 'what ifs' and to make plans for a whole variety of different contingencies," Petraeus told Amanpour at the command's headquarters in Tampa. Iran's nuclear program has become a thorn for the United States and its allies, and Washington has sharpened its tone on dealings over Tehran's program. The Islamic republic maintains the program is for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations fear Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. Israel has called Iran's nuclear program the major threat facing its nation. When asked about rumors that Israel could attack Iran's facilities, Petraeus declined to comment about Israel's military capabilities. But when asked about the vulnerability of the facilities, Petraeus said Iran has strengthened the facilities and has enhanced underground tunnels. Still, the facilities are not bomb-proof. "Well, they certainly can be bombed," he said. "The level of effect would vary with who it is that carries it out, what ordnance they have, and what capability they can bring to bear." Iran is holding out on a United Nations-backed deal on its nuclear program that includes enriching uranium. The country had until the end of 2009 to accept the deal offered by the "P5 plus one" -- permanent U.N. Security Council members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany. Instead, Iran countered, giving the West until the end of January to accept its own proposal. The general said he thinks there is still time for the nations to engage Iran in diplomacy, noting there is no deadline on the enactment of any U.S. contingency plans. He added, however, that "there's a period of time, certainly, before all this might come to a head, if you will." Christiane Amanpour's interview with Gen. David Petraeus airs Sunday at 2 p.m. ET on CNN. Share this on:

Bin Laden documents to go online Thursday
By Joe Sterling, CNN
updated 10:18 AM EDT, Tue May 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A West Point think tank will put the documents online Thursday
The Arabic originals and English translations will be issued
The Navy SEALs raid on bin Laden's compound occurred a year ago
(CNN) -- For the first time, the general public will be able to see a number of the 6,000-plus documents seized in last year's raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.
The Combating Terrorism Center at West Point said it will release the material online Thursday at 9 a.m. ET.
John Brennan, President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, announced the release in remarks Monday to the Woodrow Wilson Center on Counterterrorism.
The center, an academic institution at the U.S. Military Academy in New York, said it plans to release original versions in Arabic and translations in English.
Does al Qaeda pose a threat to cruises?
The politics of killing Osama bin Laden
Exclusive access to bin Laden's compound
"The CTC will issue a short report contextualizing the documents and providing an overview of their most salient themes," the center said.
U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader in the raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and seized reams of material described by scholars and officials as a "treasure trove."
The dramatic and historic assault took place in the early morning hours of May 2, Pakistan-time; while it was late May 1 in Washington. It ended a nearly 10-year hunt for the elusive militant, who headed the terror network that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001.
The CTC didn't say which and how many documents will be released.
Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst and author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden From 9/11 to Abbottabad," said he reviewed some of the documents for his research. They are declassified memos written by bin Laden and his subordinates.
"The only documents that will be released are the ones that I was able to review," he said Tuesday. "Bottom line is, this will be several hundred pages only."
In a CNN column Tuesday adapted from the book, Bergen called bin Laden "an inveterate micromanage." He said bin Laden was under the "delusion" that his group "could still force a change" in U.S. foreign policy if it was able to pull off another major strike.
"The memos paint a picture of an organization that understood it was in deep danger from the American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions that had been decimating its leadership since summer 2008," Bergen said.
Brennan said one conclusion that can be reached from the documents is that al Qaeda "has had trouble replacing" field commanders "being lost so quickly." He's referring to the killing and capturing of those fighters.
"For example, bin Laden worried about -- and I quote -- "the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced,' and this would lead to the repeat of mistakes," Brennan said.

Cathay Pacific bans shipping of shark products
By Pamela Boykoff, CNN
updated 6:47 AM EDT, Wed September 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Cathay Pacific will stop shipping unsustainably sourced shark products The airline is the world's largest carrier of air cargo, headquartered in Hong Kong
"The majority of shark fishing is incompatible with our position on Sustainable Development"
An estimate 50% of the shark fin trade comes through Hong Kong
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Cathay Pacific, the world's largest carrier of air cargo, will stop shipping unsustainably sourced shark products in a move marine conservation groups characterized as a big step forward in efforts to protect the animals.
"We believe that we now have compelling evidence that the majority of shark fishing is incompatible with our position on Sustainable Development," Cathay Pacific said in a statement.
"Due to the vulnerable nature of sharks, their rapidly declining population, and the impacts of overfishing for their parts and products, our carriage of these is inconsistent with our commitment to sustainable development," the airline said.
The ban will apply to Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary Dragonair, both major players in the transport of air cargo to Hong Kong and China. Shark's fin soup remains a popular delicacy for weddings and banquets within China. In order to obtain these fins, fishermen catch sharks, cut off their fins and throw the sharks back into the water to die.

Environmentalists say this wasteful practice puts several shark species at risk of extinction. An estimate 50% of the shark fin trade comes through Hong Kong.
Stanley Shea, from the marine advocacy group Bloom Association, believes Cathay Pacific's move sends a message to other Hong Kong corporations. They are "showing other corporates they understand the issue and making change happening in Hong Kong."
The airline says it will take three months to implement the new policy, but it will stop accepting any new contracts immediately.

Cathay's decision came after the airline received a July letter from more than 40 international environmental organizations, requesting it set an "aggressive timeline" to stop carrying shark's fin.
In the letter, the group estimated Cathay Pacific carries between 20-50% of all the air cargo trade in shark's fin.
Shea said they are also targeting the shipping lines, which are still responsible for carrying the majority of shark products worldwide.

2022: Cheap flights, more rail and hands-free cars
By Thom Patterson, CNN
updated 8:45 AM EST, Tue November 27, 2012
Bombardier's CS100 is expected to begin service in 2014. It follows aircraft design trends toward lighter materials and more efficient engines which allow significant fuel savings. Click through this gallery to see conceptual designs for fuel-saving planes of the future.
NASA asked aircraft manufacturers for aircraft designs aimed at saving fuel, while limiting noise and pollution. In this concept, Lockheed Martin proposed "box wings" that would wrap around the entire aircraft. It combines lightweight materials and super-efficient turbo-fan engines.
This concept for a civil aircraft capable of flying faster than the speed of sound was designed with a specific shape to reduce the level of sonic booms. Lockheed Martin submitted another box wing design for NASA. This version included a single engine mounted on the tail of the aircraft. Northrup Grumman's previous experience with military "flying wing" designs led to this concept which NASA describes as extremely aerodynamic.
Boeing offered NASA this blended wing concept that includes two turbo-fan engines on top, shielded by vertical tail wings which are meant to block engine noise to the ground.
The wing and body of this design from California Polytechnic State University is meant to allow steep landings and takeoffs. Those kinds of takeoffs and landings are generally quieter for nearby residents.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
In 2022 airlines will charge for just about every possible option, experts fear
Low-cost carriers may create "super-elite" class of fliers
Get ready to share the road with driverless cars, automotive experts say U.S. inter-city railroads are poised to expand, offering more travel options
(CNN) -- Fliers, drivers and rail riders, heads up: the next 10 years will dramatically transform America's traveling landscape.
Get ready to share the road with driverless, computer-controlled cars. Prepare to join millions of travelers who will start riding trains to nearby cities. Expect to be nickel-and-dimed (even more) by the airlines. Don't be surprised to see sleek new airline designs that run cleaner and burn less fuel, thanks to new materials and innovative technology.
In the air, the trend toward low-cost airlines and so-called "a la carte" pricing will likely become the accepted norm, as fliers finally accept a business model that reminds us: nothing is free and everything costs. By 2022, say experts, the consumer war over having to pay for every airline perk and option from pillows to snacks to window seats to legroom will be over.
Number crunchers will win. Grumblers will lose.
"It's the unbundling of services," said airline analyst Mike Miller. "Passengers are choosing the airlines that have the most fees, most often. These carriers are the most profitable and the most full."
More flight time for co-pilots?
787 Dreamliner airplane takes off
Southwest Airlines looks toward future
Driverless car now legal in California
Opponents fear the new hyper-itemized normal will create a group of "super elite" passengers who are treated very differently than the rest of us. More on that later.
On the ground, we'll see amazing technological strides in the development of self-driving cars during the next decade. But America's roads and bridges will continue to suffer from much needed repairs, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. But hey, at least we'll be able to multitask while our cars are dodging potholes.
Across the nation's sprawling rail lines, experts anticipate several states from coast to coast will continue investing in trains that connect regional cities. And the future looks bright, analysts say, for the nation's urban light rail and tramway systems. We'll get to that in a minute.
First, let's use four quick stats to remind ourselves what a big deal the transportation industry is:
Planes: By 2022, the FAA predicts more than a billion U.S. airline passengers.
Cars and trucks: Washington says registered passenger vehicles number above 250 million (for perspective, the entire U.S. population numbers more than 312 million).
Trains: Amtrak ridership set an all-time record this year: more than 31 million passengers.
The 'race to the bottom'
Prospects for the airline industry look good, but still, some experts are worried.
Airline consumer expert Brett Snyder of crankyflier.com fears continued success of low-cost carriers could hurt consumers in the long run. Low-cost airlines are growing fast and raking in big profits by charging ultra-cheap fares while nickel-and-diming passengers to pay for even the most basic extras.
Europe's RyanAir offers an extreme example. The airline's CEO has talked about charging his passengers to use on-board toilets and creating standing-room-only sections on some flights.
Apparently this matters: Airplane seat belts

How efficient is Japanese rail?
California high-speed rail to nowhere? The danger, said Miller, is creating two types of fliers: the "haves" -- "super-elite frequent fliers who get everything" -- and the "have-nots" -- passengers in economy "who get nothing."
That business model sounds familiar, said Miller, of the American Aviation Institute. "CEOs are earning more money than ever and the average wage is not going up. Now we're seeing that mirrored by airline service. That's a little troubling because the coach passenger seems to be always getting less."
By 2022, fliers will likely have accepted the idea that they must pay fees for every perk and service which, a generation earlier, was included in passenger fares.
Snyder is a fan of extreme low-cost carriers like RyanAir, but in general, he doesn't want to see the entire industry using that model. He believes passengers want choices and, to some degree, a la carte provides that. It's a system that allows passengers to choose the services they want. Some fliers may not be able to get their heads around it because they're stuck in the past.
"A lot of people who don't like this trend have in their minds the way it used to be," said Snyder. "They think that's how it should be."
If the low-cost model becomes the standard for success, Snyder warns, other airlines seeking profits will follow, triggering a "race to the bottom," as every airline tries to "slash and burn costs and do everything they can to make more money by cutting back. I think that would be really unfortunate."
Denver-based Frontier Airlines "is the hope for the future," said Snyder. "They're trying to become a low-cost carrier, but they have more amenities on board, although you do have to pay for them, such as live TV and extra legroom. They're trying to offer a bit more to people."
Expect more air passengers to demand Wi-Fi and personalized entertainment choices in the coming years. Airlines may provide access to movies stored on a digital media server aboard the aircraft, or, a third-party website where passengers can watch video now or later after they de-plane. Power outlets for personal devices ought to become standard on all passenger seats, say experts, not just in first class.
But some choices, such as seating, shouldn't be limited to all or nothing. Regular carriers, say analysts, should offer more "in-between choices," like Delta's Economy Comfort or United's Economy Plus, with more legroom and other amenities for a few dollars extra.
The coming 10 years will also affect airports. Some larger markets are developing additional airports which will ease traffic congestion. But smaller cities may be at risk. Many regional airlines may abandon some small towns, as tiny airports get squeezed by rising fuel prices and shrinking profits.
What can pilots expect? Changes in federal rules will require additional and more expensive training for new pilots, many of whom will earn a starting salary of about $20,000 a year, said Miller. Experts fear the result will be a temporary shortage of airline pilots, which might force airlines to take on the cost of pilot training. That expense likely would be passed on to consumers.

New equipment
On the bright side, the coming decade will bring more fuel efficient aircraft. Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner started U.S. routes this month.
Boeing Dreamliner makes domestic debut Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier's much anticipated CSeries boasts a variable speed, multi-gear engine that aims to save 20% more fuel than its competitors. The first CSeries plane is expected to begin service in 2014.
But what about a little further down the road? At NASA, experts asked a handful of top aircraft designers for their ideas on green airplanes of the future.
Firms like Lockheed Martin offered cool box-shaped wing designs while Boeing and Northrop Grumman played with fascinating "flying wings." Although the NASA program was really just an idea-sharing brainstorming project, some of these futuristic design ideas could very well make the jump to reality by 2025 NASA said, if economic conditions allow.
Whether fuel savings from efficient airliners will be passed on to consumers in the next 10 years depends on a lot of factors. It's possible, said experts, as long as passenger traffic is high and fuel prices are stable.
Letting go of the wheel
California and Nevada have passed laws authorizing driverless or self-driving vehicles, signaling the beginning of a new era.
These computer-controlled cars and trucks are coming, whether or not we feel comfortable about it. The idea is to allow computers to coordinate the safest and most efficient speed and route for each car, thereby reducing wrecks and traffic jams. Nevada and California require the cars to have a human behind the wheel who can take control of the vehicle at any time.
In five years or less, non-experimental self-driving cars are expected to hit California's public roads, says driverless car developer Google. Computer-coordinated vehicles could help cut the estimated 4.2 billion hours Americans spend each year stuck in traffic, according to the society of engineers. All that time costs $710 per driver.
Volvo is working with the European Union on what it calls Road Trains, several self-driving cars connected and coordinated by a wireless signal from a lead vehicle, which is driven by a human. The idea aims to cut highway congestion and save fuel. Bottom line: fewer traffic jams, less pollution, cheaper travel. Road Trains could hit Europe's highways as soon as 2022, according to the European Union.
Related: California legalizes self-driving cars
For Volvo scientist Jonas Ekmark, the driverless era began when he was testing the Road Train. He remembers what it felt like the first time he took his hands off the wheel, effectively putting a computer in the driver's seat.
That was really a strange experience.Jonas Ekmark, technical expert active safety, Volvo "That was really a strange experience," Ekmark recalled with a chuckle. "I let go and then after 30 seconds I was like, 'and now what?'"
Eventually he felt comfortable enough to take his eyes off the road to read and answer e-mail on his smartphone. "After a while you adapt to it and you feel like you're on an aircraft or a bus or something."
Reading e-mail while sitting in the driver's seat may be safe enough, said Ekmark, but sleeping is probably not a good option.
If something goes wonky during a Road Train trip, the system triggers a very loud alarm along with a "quite strong vibration" in the driver's seat. The driver then has about 10 seconds to take control of the vehicle and leave the Road Train.
Road Trains could be a safe stepping stone toward the day when all cars are autonomously self-driven and not reliant on a lead vehicle, Ekmark said.
Rail riders
Americans are increasingly embracing train travel. Need proof? More passengers rode Amtrak this year than ever before in its 41-year history, the train company said. And there's no reason to believe the trend won't continue, say experts.
Better rail service and increased funding offers America its best chance in generations to get off the highways and get on the rails, according to analysts.
Regional inter-city rail systems in California, Illinois, North Carolina, Virginia and elsewhere have been invigorated by 2009's federal stimulus legislation, said transportation expert Yonah Freemark, who runs TransportPolitic.com.
"Those investments are going to be built out and people are going to see better service on inter-city rail lines across the country," he said." And you'll see increasing ridership." That's good news for the nation's energy situation. Rail travel uses 20% less energy than traveling by car, according to the ASCE.
Still, U.S. train ridership ranks very low compared with other nations. The number of passengers on Amtrak and commuter rail total about 500 million a year, Freemark said. Compare that to the United Kingdom, a country five times smaller than the United States, which counted 1.35 billion rail riders last year. Other nations where railroads carry more than a billion passengers a year include Germany, India, China, France, Russia and South Korea, according to the International Union of Railways.

'Silk Road' railways link Europe and Asia
By Eoghan Macguire and Becky Anderson, CNN
updated 5:23 AM EDT, Thu June 27, 2013
Bustling freight trains like this 41-carriage vehicle are a common site along the Chongqing to Duisburg rail route -- a modern "Silk Road" carrying goods from Asia to Europe and back again.
The famous trade route once catered for wandering tradesmen carrying the likes of jade, spices and, of course, silk. Electronic components and computer parts are a more familiar cargo these days.
The 11,179-kilometer network stretches across six countries (China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany).
Chinese and European railways use different gauges than their Russian and former Soviet-nation counterparts, meaning cargo has to be transferred to suitable carriages at the borders of Kazakhstan and Germany.
The Chongqing Duisburg rail-link is not the first to connect Asia and Europe. The Trans-Siberian Railway (pictured) has transported goods and people from Moscow to the Pacific-coast city of Vladivostok for just under a century.
A train heads into the vast hinterland of rural Kazakhstan. An array of other routes for trans-continental rail travel have been identified by the likes of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia.

(CNN) -- In the smoggy cradle of China's industrial heartland, a heaving freight train gets set to depart along a modern incarnation of the legendary Silk Road trading route.
This historic passageway was once worn into a dense chain of dusty trails by caravans of horses and camels carrying merchants and their many wares between continental Asia and Europe.
Today it takes the form of a series of transnational rail tracks transporting the latest in electronic products and computer parts.
The new Silk Road?
The new Silk Road?
Starting in the bustling mega city of Chongqing, southwest China, the 11,179-kilometer (6,946-mile) network stretches across six countries and vast unpopulated expanses all the way to Duisburg, Germany.

"The railway (goes) through Xinjiang, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany and builds a new route for transportation," explained Dr Mu Huaping of the Chongqing Commission of Economy and Information Technology.
"If (the city) wants to go global, the railway serves an important role," Mu added.
A freight-train departs Chongqing, China.
Chongqing rising
For many companies with factories in fast-growing Chongqing, transferring items via rail to markets in Europe can be easier and quicker than sea freight from one of China's coastal ports.
Mu points out that train journeys take just 16 days, comparing favorably to the more lengthy shipping routes where the costs and time of transporting cargo to the coast must also be added.
Since the rail network opened in 2011 (as a joint venture between track operator DB Schenker, the Chongqing Holding Group and the state railways of China, Kazakhstan and Russia) an increasing number of multinationals have taken advantage of the facility, Mu said.
An epic journey for Chinese exports
Freight train crosses landlocked country
U.S. computer giant Hewlett Packard claims to have shipped more than 4 million notebook computers to Europe by train during this period.
As more industry heads towards China's vast interior -- and cities like Chongqing expand, creating greater wealth and consumer spending power -- many observers believe rail freight will become an even more appealing cargo-transport option.

"I think it's a very bright future for freight rail transport," said Michael Binyon, a British journalist who has written extensively on the subject of what he tentatively refers to as the "Iron Silk Road."
"It's the only way to avoid the long sea routes. Airplanes are very expensive (and) road is out of the question (because) the volumes are too small."
"Rail transportation," he added can be "a very efficient way, and a fairly fast way, of moving large volumes of freight from China to Europe."

Continental shift
While this contemporary route (which plots a more northern course than its historic Silk Road counterpart) has been in operation for two years now, rail routes between Asia and Europe are far from a new development.
The Trans-Siberian Railway has been shifting goods and passengers between Moscow and Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast for just under a century, linking up with tracks in northern China and Mongolia along the way.
(Trains) are a relatively green and sustainable mode of transport and can take vast loads with just a couple of people driving a trainChristian Wolmar, railway historian
In time, Binyon sees the potential for even more rail integration between the continents.
He points to the Marmaray tunnel project (due to open later this year) that will marry tracks underneath the Bosphorous Strait, connecting Asiatic and European Turkey in the process.

Organizations like the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia (UNESCAP) meanwhile have long sought to facilitate a vast Trans-Asian Railway network that could link the continents.
This intergovernmental project has the backing of 22 Asian nations and proposes lines that would connect Thailand, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey to southern Europe, as well as a Southeast Asian network that could theoretically extend all the way from Singapore to Europe via China.
A north-south corridor stretching from Russia through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan all the way to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas in Iran is also cited by the U.N. group as a possibility.
A train sets off from the Kazakh border
Keeping track
When it comes to actually building these lines, however, the reality is infinitely more complex than simply plotting the routes and laying down tracks -- as the UNESCAP project has discovered since it was agreed in 2006.
According to Christian Wolmar, a rail historian and author of the forthcoming book "To the Edge of the World," all manner of operational challenges must first be overcome.
"Individual countries tend to use different styles, technologies, signaling systems and gauges," Wolmar explained. "That means creating a link across several nations is problematic ... and incredibly expensive."
"Then there is also the politics. Can you go through northern Turkey or Iraq or Iran?
"But that's not to say they (trains) don't have benefits. There is fantastic potential as they are a relatively green and sustainable mode of transport and can take vast loads with just a couple of people driving a train," he added.

Binyon also notes these difficulties but concurs with Wolmar's final point.
He highlights how the Chongqing to Duisburg route has already overcome some of the standardization challenges by having cargo containers transferred to cars with new gauges at relevant border crossings to meet varying national track requirements.
"If you can simplify it, if you can unify customs agreements and if you can have a standard operating system with rules agreed by all those along the route," he said, then railways are "an extremely efficient way of moving large numbers of people and freight from one population center to the other."

$15 million yacht can be controlled by an iPad
By Sheena McKenzie
updated 11:58 AM EDT, Mon July 1, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
It might look like a a mixture between a spaceship and the Concorde, but this futuristic vessel is in fact the award-winning superyacht Adastra.
The luxury boat -- valued at $15 million -- has just picked up three prizes, including Best Naval Architecture, at the prestigious ShowBoats Design Awards in Monaco.
The high-tech boat features three prongs -- a slimline hull and two 'wings,' allowing it to glide over the water with ease. The remarkable design creates less drag -- and less fuel consumption.
"You may think it looks unusual, but it's very logical to us -- the big aim was to create an ocean-going boat with good fuel consumption," said co-designer John Shuttleworth.
"Extensive tank testing and radio controlled model tests in waves were carried out to analyze stability and performance," said co-designer Orion Shuttleworth.
The luxury vessel includes an iPad controller, allowing the owner to control the boat remotely from up to 50 meters away.
The elegant interior was created by Hong Kong-based firm, Jepsen Designs. The team "draws from Scandinavian modern design principles fused with Eastern accents."
"Inevitably, there has to be a trend for reducing fuel consumption -- and I think superyachts will have to look something like this in the future," said John Shuttleworth.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The $15 million yacht features an iPad controller, luxury interior
Features aerodynamic 'wings' to help glide along water, cut fuel consumption
Space-age shaped vessel could spell the future of superyacht design
Editor's note: MainSail is CNN's monthly sailing show, exploring the sport of sailing, luxury travel and the latest in design and technology.
(CNN) -- With her curved 'wings,' long pointed nose, and gleaming underbelly propped high above the waves, this space-age yacht might be better suited to the sky than the sea.
Just a few square meters of the futuristic vessel -- valued at $15 million -- actually touch the surface of the water, allowing it to skim across the waves with ease.
The innovative design, along with high-tech features such as an iPad-controller, helped glossy "Adastra" win three prizes at last week's prestigious ShowBoats Design Awards in Monaco, including Best Naval Architecture.

How female sailors take on men
The yachting world is clearly impressed. The honor follows a prize for the Most Innovative Design at the 2013 World Superyacht Awards earlier this year.
So could this alien shape -- resembling something between a spaceship and the Concorde supersonic plane -- be the future of superyacht design?
"The superyacht industry is pretty traditional," designer John Shuttleworth, told CNN. "But the establishment has given a 'yes' to this idea which is a huge step forward."
"Inevitably, there has to be a trend for reducing fuel consumption -- and I think superyachts will have to look something like this in the future. Initially I don't think economics will drive it -- these are wealthy owners and cost isn't an issue. Instead, it will be from an ethical, environmental point of view."

Billionaire shipping magnate Anton Marden is believed to be the proud owner of the plush 42.5-meter vessel, which took more than five years to design and build.
The Hong Kong-based mogul and wife Elaine will be able to remotely control their luxury yacht from up to 50 meters away, simply by sweeping their hand over an iPad.

Our new designs incorporate lots of space to accommodate jet skis, sailing boats, kayaks, paddle boards and other toysOrion Shuttleworth, co-exterior designer If you want to appeal to the mega rich, such flashy gadgets -- and room to house them -- are now an essential part of superyacht architecture.
"We have recently seen an increase in new and exciting superyacht toys on the market and clients are increasingly looking for more space to house these," said co-exterior designer Orion Shuttleworth.
"Our new designs incorporate lots of space to accommodate jet skis, sailing boats, kayaks, paddle boards and other toys."

With just 20% of the enormous 52-ton boat submerged in water, Adastra is able to glide along the waves without the same drag as traditional superyachts, hitting up to 43 kilometers per hour.
It also means the vessel, made from a super-light glass and carbon material, consumes a lot less fuel -- around 14% of a conventional superyacht the same size.
"Adastra's longer, slender main hull has extremely low drag, which is why she is so fuel efficient," explained Orion.
"The smooth, seamless, unbroken surfaces also help to reduce weight," he said of the boat, which can travel up to 6,400 kilometers -- the same distance from London to New York -- without refueling.
Introducing Asfar, the 30-meter superyacht used by pop princess Beyonce during a holiday in Dubai. For around $100,000 a week, you could sailing the Gulf in the very same boat.
Many wealthy superyacht owners use their luxury vessels just a few times a year. And if you've got cash to splash, you could hire the same elegant boats used by the world's A-list celebrities, such as this one used by Beyonce.
If you've ever wanted to be treated like a princess on holiday, this is the superyacht for you. The iconic M/Y Grace was the vessel of choice for Princess Grace and Prince Rainier of Monaco during their honeymoon in 1956.
Today, the luxurious boat has been refitted with nine staterooms and a top-deck hot tub. Guests can enjoy fine dining as the yacht winds its way around the exotic Galapagos Islands. Musician P. Diddy knows how to holiday in style, chartering opulent superyacht Solemates. The high-tech vessel features an iPad controller, aromatherapy shower and an award-winning on board chef.
The spectacular boat is not for the faint hearted, costing $686,00 per week in July and August. Then there are expenses, estimated at around $137,000. If only the Honey Fitz could talk, the stories this presidential yacht could tell. Built over 80 years ago, the pretty wooden boat has served five U.S. presidents and after a recent makeover is now available for hire by the public.
The Honey Fitz's most famous owner was John F. Kennedy, who would spend Easter and Christmas holidays on the yacht in Palm Springs, Florida.
Business magnate Richard Branson's elegant 32-meter catamaran includes four luxury suites, a roof-top diving board and scuba equipment.
The state-of-the-art vessel also includes three-person mini sub, "Necker Nymph," for underwater exploration. Beyonce's ride

Celebrity superyachts available for hire
It might look like a spaceship, but this remarkable design is in fact a luxury underwater hotel.
The brainchild of Polish designers Deep Ocean Technology (DOT), the futuristic building features saucer-like lounges connected to 21 underwater bedrooms.
The sleek design, which can cost up to $50 million, is now set to be built on the remote tropical island of Kuredhivaru in the Maldives. "The biggest challenge is to sink the hotel," said designer Pawel Podwojewski. "In this case, we'll take care of the construction, which means the underwater hotel will be completed in Poland and shipped to Maldives."
The unique structure may plunge 30-meters below the water, but its luxury facilities are sky-high, including a helicopter landing pad, opulent restaurant and rooftop swimming pool.
Guests can enjoy views of vibrant coral reefs and sea creatures, all from the comfort of their bedroom.
More adventurous guests can dive straight into the water from a special airlock compartment, including its own decompression chamber.
The lounges are connected by a glass tunnel. In an emergency, the doughnut-shaped underwater room can slide to the surface of the ocean. The unique hotel may soon be built in the United Arab Emirates, with Dubai construction company Drydocks now in negotiations with designers. Deep space

Futuristic underwater hotel
Skimming across the water at 95 kilometers per hour, with its giant wings stretched out over the waves, it would be easy to mistake this sleek machine for a plane preparing to take off.
In fact, the record-breaking vessel -- called Hydroptere -- is one of the fastest sailboats in the world, harnessing wind power much the same as an airplane.
The brainchild of French sailor Alain Thebault (pictured), the state-of-the-art yacht features a 28-meter mast -- roughly the same height as the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Named after the Greek words for water (hydros) and wing (ptere), the innovative vessel broke the World Sailing Speed Record in 2009, notching up 95 kilometers per hour over 500 meters. That record was broken by Australian Paul Larsen's Vestas Sailrocket last year, which hit 121 kilometers per hour. But the battle for the fastest sailboat isn't over yet...
Later this month the Hydroptere team hope to break the record for the fastest crossing of the Pacific, between Los Angeles and Honolulu. Compatriot Olivier de Kersauson currently holds the record for the fastest crossing of four days and 19 hours, set in 2005. Thebault aims to beat that time by at least 24 hours.
Hydroptere features six-meter wings called "floats." Once in full flight, just 2.5 square meters of the boat are in contact with the water. "We use hydrofoil wings, which lift up with the wind," Thebault told CNN. "It's exactly the same as an airplane -- we reduce drag and increase acceleration."
Submerged beneath the wings are foils which lift the boat out of the water, giving it its speed. The streamlined seven and a half ton boat can shoot from 37 kilometers per hour to 83 kilometers per hour in just 10 seconds.
While the Hydroptere easily zips across flat water, one of the biggest challenges for the crew in the upcoming transpacific challenge will be negotiating waves around four-meters high. "Twenty years ago everyone said it's not possible to make a boat fly. I did it. Now they're saying it's not possible to make it fly over swell. I will do it again," Thebault said. The ambitious project has been more than 25 years in the making, with 50-year-old Thebault saying it cost "20 years of passion and a few million euros." The father-of-three recently sold his home to help finance the scheme.
The Hydroptere is no stranger to record-breaking performances. In 2005 it crossed the Channel three minutes faster than Louis Blériot did in the first plane in 1909, with a time of 34 minutes. In September last year, it also broke the one mile speed record on San Francisco Bay, notching up 69 kilometers per hour.
As a youngster growing up in a children's home in France, Thebault dreamed of making a sail boat lift off. "I felt like I was living in a jail and I wanted to fly," he said, pictured here with a model boat outside the Palace of Versailles in 1985. "I grew up in a home for children with no parents -- my father was living in Africa and my mother was in a psychiatric house," said Thebault. "I discovered freedom through windsurfing."
Despite Thebault's success, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. In 1994 Hydroptere broke the speed record at a whopping 104 kilometers per hour -- unfortunately capsizing shortly after. World's fastest sailing vessel

They got 'Shorty' -- now what? Next steps after 'El Chapo' Guzman's capture
By Catherine E. Shoichet and Shimon Prokupecz, CNN
updated 2:00 AM EST, Tue February 25, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Official: The United States will seek to extradite Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman
The Sinaloa cartel boss faces charges in several U.S. jurisdictions
Analyst: Mexico will want to prosecute him, keep him in prison
He had served seven years of a 20-year sentence when he escaped
Read this article in Spanish at CNNMexico.com
(CNN) -- Could the captured Sinaloa cartel boss who was one of Mexico's most wanted fugitives be heading to the United States for trial?
He will, if U.S. federal prosecutors have anything to say about it.
Life on the run for notorious 'El Chapo'
Drug lord 'El Chapo' no longer on the run
Bob Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, said Sunday that American authorities plan to seek the extradition of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
Authorities captured the notorious drug lord Saturday in the Mexican Pacific resort city of Mazatlan.
Notorious Mexican drug lord arrested
Cases are pending against him in New York and several other United States jurisdictions, and it's not clear which requests would take priority.
But just because the United States wants to extradite him doesn't mean Guzman will be heading north of the border any time soon.
"Mexico is going to want to prosecute him. They're going to want the first shot at him," CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said Sunday. "The extradition to the U.S. could happen at a later date, but I doubt it. I think that the Mexicans are going to want him, and they're going to want to keep him in prison down there."
Guzman escaped from a high-security Mexican prison in 2001, reportedly hiding in a laundry basket. Throughout the years, he avoided being caught because of his enormous power to bribe corrupt local, state and federal Mexican officials.
His nickname, which means "Shorty," matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame.
From New York to Chicago, Texas to San Diego, Guzman and his lieutenants are named in indictments for marijuana, cocaine and heroin trafficking, as well as racketeering, money laundering, kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder.
In Chicago, the city's crime commission named Guzman its Public Enemy No. 1 last year.
But more than anywhere else, Fuentes said, the "Public Enemy No. 1" designation is true for Guzman in Mexico.
"He's responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. He's considered one of the richest men in the world, and the Sinaloa cartel...is considered the most prolific drug-trafficking organization in the world," said Fuentes, former assistant director of the FBI's Office of International Operations.
When Guzman escaped from prison, he had served seven years of a 20-year, nine-month sentence.
Mexico's attorney general's office said there were eight warrants for Guzman's arrest there -- two tied to his 2001 escape, and six more for alleged crimes committed since then.
Authorities said they were taking him to the Altiplano prison outside Mexico City on Saturday, where he was set to be interrogated.
No attorney had yet come forward representing the cartel boss, officials said, and no extradition request had been made.
Eduardo Medina Mora, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, told The New York Times that authorities from the United States and Mexico had been working together on the case for months, but hadn't worked out whether Guzman would be extradited.
"I think it's important that first he faces the charges against him in Mexico," Medina Mora told the newspaper.
Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Mexican officials should consider extradition now.
"The normal sequence is, Mexico being a sovereign nation, (it) has the first prosecution. However, there's a history here. He escaped from a prison in 2001. There is corruption in that country. And I would ask that the Mexicans consider extraditing him to the United States, where he will be put into a 'supermax' prison under tight security, where he cannot escape, and be brought to justice with a life sentence," McCaul told ABC's "This Week."
"I think that would be the best course of action for not only Mexico, but also the United States, in ensuring that what happened in 2001 does not happen again."
How likely extradition is, the Texas Republican congressman said, depends on how much pressure the State Department puts on Mexico's government. But he said it would be worth the effort.
"The track record's not good with this individual," he said. "This is an exceptional case. This is the largest, biggest drug lord we've ever seen in the world."
Phil Jordan, who spent three decades with the DEA and headed the agency's El Paso Intelligence Center, said extraditing Guzman is the only way to truly cripple his organization.
"It is a significant arrest, provided he gets extradited immediately to the United States," Jordan told CNN Saturday. "If he does not get extradited, then he will be allowed to escape within a period of time. ... If he is, in fact, incarcerated, until he gets extradited to the United States, it will be business as usual."
CNNMexico.com and CNN's Ray Sanchez and Evan Perez contributed to this report.
