Growing up is even harder when mom is in prisonStory Highlights Donnie Belcher's mother was incarcerated when she was 4 Number of incarcerated mothers exploded 131 percent from 1991 to 2007 "I wanted to be everything my mother wasn't," Belcher says More prisons are creating programs that preserve mother-child relationships Next Article in Crime » ReadEXPLAINER By Stephanie Chen CNN	(CNN) -- "Get yourself together." Mary Williams repeated those three words often to her 28-year-old daughter, who served three years in a Kansas prison for a 1988 armed robbery. Donnie Belcher, 7, visits her mother, Wanda Taylor, at Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas in 1991. Williams never judged her daughter, Wanda Taylor, for the crime or the crack cocaine addiction that fueled it. There was no need to pick at the past. Instead, Williams looked to the future. The future was her granddaughter, Donnie Belcher, a shy 4-year-old girl with curly hair who cried inconsolably from behind the glass the first time she visited her mother in jail. The little girl's mother was locked up for three years, leaving her in the care of her grandmother. "It was hard on me," said Belcher, now 25. "I never wanted to leave my mother." Belcher defied the odds, growing up straight as an arrow despite having a mother in prison. Her childhood was part of a national trend. The incarceration rates for U.S. mothers began to surge in the 1980s, fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic and tougher mandatory sentencing laws, experts said. A recent study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found the number of incarcerated mothers rose 131 percent from 1991 to 2007, while the number of fathers in prison increased 77 percent during the same period. According to the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, about 1.7 million children have a parent in prison. Moms behind bars
1.7 million: U.S. children with a parent in prison 1.19 million: Minority children with an incarcerated parent 131: Percent increase of mothers in prison from 1991 to 2007 77: Percent increase of fathers in prison from 1991 to 2007 62: Percent of mothers arrested for drug-related crimes 11: Percent of children with imprisoned moms who go into foster care 42: Percent of incarcerated parents visited by their children (Sources: U.S. Department of Justice, The Sentencing Project) "We should be alarmed," said Georgia Lerner, executive director at the Women's Prison Association, a national nonprofit working with incarcerated women. "Even when children have seen their mothers get arrested, they still want to be with their parents," Lerner said. "They still love their mothers and want to be together." While some critics argue that criminals make poor parents, experts said there is no doubt that separation from a parent, particularly a mother, affects a child's psychological development. When a father is imprisoned, the mother typically cares for the children, said Danielle Dallaire, a psychology professor at the College of William and Mary. But her research shows that when a mother is incarcerated, the father often plays no role in raising the children left behind. Federal statistics show children are five times more likely to end up in foster care when a mother is sent to prison than when a father is imprisoned. Read the Federal Report Belcher's grandmother, Williams, stepped in because she didn't want the child in foster care. The girl's father was not in the picture. For three years, Williams, a single mother herself, drove her granddaughter twice a month to see her mother. They never missed a visit, despite having to travel to several prisons across Kansas. After passing through the metal detectors and being frisked by security officers, the girl showed off the A's she received from school or told her mother about which boy had cooties. Each visit lasted two hours. Belcher often asked, "When will you come home?" "Soon," her mother said. "Soon." Find out what Taylor and her family learned from her time in prison » A growing number of prisons are recognizing the need to preserve mother-child relationships. They have staffed nurseries and day care centers to keep families connected. Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum security women's prison in New York, is host to an annual summer camp run by volunteers. At camp, children can play basketball and participate in other activities with their incarcerated mothers. In May, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reuniting moms and dads with their children. The "Get on the Bus" program provides 700 children with free rides to the prisons.

'Crack was my friend,' ex-addict says
The three years without Taylor were financially difficult for Williams, who was approaching retirement age. In her 50s at the time, she worked as a dental assistant to support her granddaughter. She poured all her time and effort into the quiet little girl. She packed her schedule with Girl Scouts and free summer camps, determined to make sure her granddaughter stayed out of trouble. "Kids would tease me and say to me, 'Why is your mom so old?' " Belcher recalled. Belcher was elated on May 29, 1991, when her mother returned to their home in Kansas City, Missouri, after serving three years of an eight-year sentence. Taylor got sober and attained her GED behind bars. She returned to find her 7-year-old daughter blossoming into her polar opposite. The girl put her head into books and graced the honor roll regularly. She didn't rebel. "I wanted to be everything my mother wasn't," Belcher said. "I loved my mom, but I couldn't do what she did." "I did it all," said Taylor, now 48. By 13, she skipped school frequently to attend "hooky parties" where she used drugs and alcohol. By 16, she dropped out of high school. "When you're out there, you're out there." The years after Taylor's release from prison also were tough on the mother-daughter relationship. As an adolescent, Belcher battled feelings of bitterness toward her mother and feared her mother would relapse. "I felt angry," Belcher said, and the anger only grew during her high school years. "It wasn't fair to me. Why did I have to have a mother like that?" Belcher threw herself into academics and excelled. She knew that many children without parents often end up in trouble and behind bars themselves. She didn't want that for herself. "She had a life where she could have just gave up, but she didn't do that," said Williams, now 71. "She went straight ahead." By 13, she was writing poetry. By 16, she was a track star at her high school and at the top of her class. She entered DePaul University in 2002 with nearly 50 scholarships. Belcher is a high school English teacher at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, a college preparatory school that boasts alums like Michelle Obama. She has a cozy apartment in Chicago, Illinois -- her first home that is all her own. This summer, she will apply for grants to start her own nonprofit to help children of incarcerated parents stay out of trouble. Belcher said she admires her mother's resilience. She watched her search tirelessly for a job, despite her felony record. She is proud of her mother, who worked her way up to become a successful child care operator for the state of Minnesota after years of working in factories and fast food restaurants. Today, her mother resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and her grandmother still lives in Kansas City, Missouri. "You can't always control life's circumstances, but you can control how you react to them," Belcher said. Her mother and grandmother will visit Belcher this weekend to celebrate completion of her master's degree -- and Mother's Day. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Cuban migrants illegal in their own countryBy David Ariosto, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTS Rural Cubans who move to the capital Havana become illegal migrants Tens of thousands have been deported back to their home villages At Havana's famed Malecon's seawall police check identity cards Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- "I was caught because I was an illegal," explained a bicycle taxi driver as he gripped the rusted blue handle-bars of his vehicle in Havana's Central Park. "And because I'd been here several times before, I was deported back." But the driver working his trade in the capital city did not arrive in Cuba from another country. Instead he is among the thousands who have come from rural provinces in search of work and a place to live -- but who have been deported back because of "Decree 217." The 1997 law restricts rural migration and was designed to prevent overcrowding in Havana, a major problem in cities across Latin America. But it has made this taxi driver an illegal resident in his own capital. "If you're illegal you can't be here in Havana," said the driver, originally from Cuba's eastern Holguin province. "You don't have an address here in Havana." The squeaky wheels of bicycle taxis usually make more noise than their drivers when the talk turns controversial in the company of an unfamiliar foreigner. But the 13-year old law has this bicycle taxi driver talking. CNN is not naming the driver due to the sensitive nature of his residency status. Video: Cubans illegal in Cuba

The law's passage through the island's rubber-stamp legislature came just six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the hardship that brought to Cuba during what it called the "special period." Economic conditions were generally worse at the eastern end of the island, according to Cuba analyst Edward Gonzalez, a professor emeritus at the University of California Los Angeles. "[The eastern region] has always been the less affluent, impoverished part of the island," he said, "heavily dependent upon agriculture, less on tourism, and also happens to be more black and mulatto." The effort to keep migrants out and prevent overcrowding in Havana may have resulted in police discrimination against darker-skinned Cubans presumed more likely to be illegal, Gonzalez said. "The government deported tens of thousands of people or forcibly removed them from Havana to other parts of the island," said Daniel Wilkinson, America's deputy director at Human Rights Watch. "It's just one in a series of laws that place severe restrictions on Cubans [and] how they live, where they live, and where they work." The taxi driver said he believes when Havana police check IDs, they "like to pick on black people a little more." The Cuban government, which has long touted racial integration as a crowning achievement of a revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959, declined to comment on internal migration or the activities of transit police. Cuba has repeatedly said its policies promote racial equality. Article 42 of the country's constitution makes discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or place of origin, a violation of the law. In practice, transit police check IDs in popular areas like Havana's Malecon and Central Park, flipping over the ID card to check the address. "The police sometimes come, ask me why I'm sitting here if I don't live close by," said one man, perched on the Malecon's famed seawall that lines Havana's northern rim and practically juts out into the Caribbean. "I just say the Malecon is a place to sit for every Cuban."

Sentences for Taiwan ex-president, wife reduced from life to 20 yearsBy the CNN Wire Staff Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian walks into the high court in Taipei on September 8, 2009. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Former Taiwanese leader and wife fined total of 370 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $11.5 million)Sentences reduced to 20 years from life for former president and first ladyProsecutors said Chen Shui-bian embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollarsChen said the money was political contributions

Chen Shui-bian
(CNN) -- Taiwan's former leader Chen Shui-bian and and his wife Wu Shu-jen have been sentenced to 20 years in jail, the island's High Court reported. Both had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment after their convictions in 2009 on charges of corruption. The court fined Chen 170 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $5.3 million) and fined his wife 200 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $6.2 million). During his trial, prosecutors said Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $18.5 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for. Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony. Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor. Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China. Share this on:

Can a Bersani-Monti coalition work for Italian economy?
By Oliver Joy, CNN
updated 7:20 AM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of Italy's Democratic Party, said he would keep outgoing premier Mario Monti's austerity reforms, but says stimulus is needed to boost the country's flagging economy.
Three-time former prime minister and media billionaire Silvio Berlusconi quit in disgrace in 2011, and is now on trial for allegedly paying for sex with an underage girl. He has pledged to refund an unpopular property tax with his own money.
The surprise of the campaign has been ex-comedian Beppe Grillo, head of the populist anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which has won support among those critical of Mario Monti's austerity policies.
The harsh budget cuts and austerity policies of current Prime Minister Mario Monti (L), shown with the outgoing Pope Benedict XVI, won him plaudits from European leaders, but were unpopular in Italy. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bersani wins he may be forced to form a coalition with incumbent PM Mario Monti
Center-left leader Bersani says he plans to make the property tax "more progressive"
Berlusconi is using his showman charm to mount a comeback for his PDL party
London (CNN) -- Italy's electoral run-off between an ex-communist and a former cruise ship singer threatens to throw the country back into the spotlight of the European debt crisis.
The enigmatic leader of the center-left Democratic Party, Pier Luigi Bersani, goes head-to-head with scandal-laden former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- back from the political grave following his resignation in November 2011.
Incumbent technocrat premier and eurozone darling Mario Monti, meanwhile, is lagging behind in the polls.
The cigar-chomping Bersani is favorite for Italy's top job and proposes to steer the country's battered economy through a debt crisis that is still plaguing the eurozone three years on.
Following six consecutive quarters of recession and with unemployment at 11.2%, Bersani is pursuing the euro area's latest fad to revive Italy's ailing economy; a pro-growth agenda.

Such policies are a stark contrast to Monti's cocktail of cuts and taxes served up to woo policymakers in Brussels and Frankfurt.

Growth will be the "golden rule" to attract foreign investment, according to Democratic Party number two Enrico Letta. A similar sentiment was key in sweeping socialist French President Francois Hollande into the Elysee Palace in 2012.
But Letta stresses that Bersani will not follow Hollande's lead by proposing a 75% income tax for the country's wealthiest residents.
Read more: Beppe Grillo: Clown prince of Italian politics
Speaking to CNN, Letta said: "It will be different, we already have a very high level of taxation...the main point is not to increase taxes."
Bersani -- who promises to stick to the outgoing government's plans for pension and labor market reform -- will also keep Monti's reviled property tax, known as IMU. It's a policy that Berlusconi pledges to scrap if elected.
In an interview with CNN, Bersani says he plans to make the tax "more progressive" and focus on the owners of large properties if his party wins.
But for all Bersani's talk of change, bond strategist Nicholas Spiro dismisses the 71-year-old as no reformer and says he is "not up to the task" of hauling the Italian economy out of a "knee deep" recession.
Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, says "Bersani could very well go for taxes on the rich, but Italy has a massive tax evasion and compliance problem, that could be difficult."
Can a political marriage survive?
Politics in Italy is complicated and outright victory for any party is unlikely. If Bersani wins he may be forced to form a coalition.
An alliance with the flamboyant center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi is unthinkable -- which leaves Monti the most likely candidate to support a Bersani-lead government.
But Monti is viewed with suspicion Bersani's far-left partners, Left Ecology Freedom, who believe the technocrat would pull a left government too far to the economic right.
If the parties can strike a deal Monti would be offered "an important role" to be discussed "Monday afternoon," Letta told CNN. He refused to say if the technocrat would be appointed finance minister.
Monti, a former European Commissioner in financial services, wields the power to reassure European leaders that Italy is on the right track and can act as a counterbalance to a leftist government.
Bersani, by contrast, is a mystery on the international stage, according to Paola Subacchi, an economist at London-based think tank Chatham House.
"He is not known abroad and he doesn't speak English... But his whole agenda is pro-Europe and pro-euro."
A Bersani-Monti marriage is unlikely to be smooth. The two could clash over unpopular austerity measures implemented by Monti as part of a European agreement.
Filippo Cavazzuti, former Italian senator and economist at the University of Bologna, believes Bersani will be forced to maintain Monti's policies under the European fiscal compact.
He said: "Otherwise Monti leaves [the coalition], the spread [on bond yields] rises and the credibility with the eurozone will immediately disappear."
A coalition agreement is crucial to stifling a power-grab by Italy's political bad boy, Berlusconi, is gaining on Bersani's seemingly unassailable lead in the polls.
Berlusconi is using his showman charm to mount a comeback for his People of Freedom party and holds key regions in Veneto and Lombardy that could prove crucial, particularly in the battle for the Senate.
The election will hand down a "damning verdict" to the policymakers of northern Europe that Italians are fed up with austerity, according to Spiro.
The electoral campaign, Spiro added, has been: "Very ugly, devoid of substance and purely based on personalities."

3 new planets could host life
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 8:48 AM EDT, Sun April 21, 2013
This diagram lines up planets recently discovered by Kepler in terms of their sizes, compared to Earth. Kepler-22b was announced in December 2011; the three Super-Earths were announced April 18, 2013. All of them could potentially host life, but we do not yet know anything definitive about their compositions or atmosphere.
This illustration depicts Kepler-62e, a planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun. It is located about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra.
This illustration depicts Kepler 62f, a planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, in the same system as Kepler 62e.
This diagram compares the planets of our own inner solar system to Kepler-62, a five-planet system about 1,200 light-years from Earth. Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f are thought capable of hosting life. The planet Kepler-69c is located about 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. This is an illustration of the planet, which is the smallest yet found to orbit in the habitable zone of a sun-like star.
This diagram compares the planets of our own inner solar system to Kepler-69, which hosts a planet Kepler-69c that appears to be capable of hosting life, in addition to planet Kepler-69b.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Scientists discovered 3 planets in the "habitable zone" of their host stars
Kepler-69c seems less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two planets
They are all more than 1,000 light-years away
The Kepler satellite is looking at more than 150,000 stars for possible planets orbiting them
(CNN) -- In the midst of chaos here on Earth, scientists are finding hope for life on other planets.
Scientists announced Thursday the discovery of three planets that are some of the best candidates so far for habitable worlds outside our own solar system -- and they're very far away.
NASA's Kepler satellite, which is keeping an eye on more than 150,000 stars in hopes of identifying Earth-like planets, found the trio.
Two of the planets -- Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f -- are described in a study released Thursday in the journal Science. They are part of a five-planet system in which the candidates for life are the farthest from the host star.
Their host star -- which corresponds to Earth's sun, but is smaller and cooler -- takes the name Kepler-62. The star's planets are designated by letters after the star's name.
A third planet that's potentially habitable, but not included in the Science study, is called Kepler-69c. A study about it and its system is published in The Astrophysical Journal.
These are the smallest planets ever found in the "habitable zone," the area near a star in which a planet can theoretically hold liquid water. Kepler-69c seems less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two planets, but scientists haven't ruled it out.
"With all of these discoveries we're finding, Earth is looking less and less like a special place and more like there's Earth-like things everywhere," said Thomas Barclay, Kepler scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute in Sonoma, California.
You won't be swimming on the planets anytime soon, though. The Kepler-62 star is 1,200 light-years away; Kepler-69 is 2,700 light-years away. A light-year, the distance that light travels in a vacuum in one year, is nearly 6 trillion miles.
What are these planets like?
The smaller a planet is, the more likely it's rocky and the less likely it's made of gas, said William Borucki, Kepler science principal investigator at NASA Ames Research Center.
That makes Kepler-62f, thought to be 40% larger than Earth, potentially the most like our planet out of the new discoveries. It could be rocky, Borucki said, with polar caps, land mass and water as well. It goes around its star once every 267.3 days (Earth days, that is).
If you were standing on Kepler-62f, the star in the sky would look bigger than our sun does, but "the illumination level would be like walking around on Earth on a cloudy day," Borucki said at a press briefing. "It drops by a factor of five."
Kepler-62e appears to be 60% larger than our planet and a little closer to its host star; this one could be a "water world" of mostly deep oceans, he said. It circles its star in 122.4 days.
"All these planets that we're finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system," Borucki said.
Kepler-69c appears to orbit a star similar to Earth's sun, Barclay said. As it's estimated to be about 70% larger than Earth, it may also be a water world, with oceans thousands of kilometers deep. This planet is also exciting because it is the smallest scientists have found that orbits a sun-like star in the habitable zone.
It's not likely to have a rocky surface, Barclay said. According to what little we know about it, Kepler-69c is probably significantly warmer than Earth and could be more like Venus.
"Probably, if there is life, it would be very unlike what we see on our own world," Barclay said.
If scientists' notions of a "habitable zone" were applied to our own solar system, both Earth and Mars would fit the bill. But Mars doesn't have enough gravity to hold onto an atmosphere that could heat it sufficiently, said Lisa Kaltenegger, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a press conference. Still, the Mars rover Curiosity has uncovered evidence that the Red Planet was, indeed, hospitable to life in the past.
Other worlds that may have life
Borucki said the new planets are "by far" better candidates for life than any others we know about, but a handful of others also have been identified as potentially capable of hosting life.
You may recall planet Kepler-22b, which was announced in December 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life. That planet had a radius 2.4 times that of Earth and is 600 light-years away.
Kepler-22b was thought to have a temperature similar to that of Earth, according to modeling by Borucki and colleagues. The planet's host star is dimmer and cooler than our sun, but the planet is also 15% closer than we are to the sun.
There is also a planet called Gliese-581g, discovered in September 2010, which is thought to be even more like Earth than Kepler-22b in terms of its suitability for plants and animals. It's only 20 light-years from Earth -- a lot closer than the newly discovered planets, though there has been some controversy about its existence.
In its solar system there is another planet, Gliese-581d, that is also of interest in the search for life, according to the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. The group's catalog lists a few other candidates.
However, just like the other planets, we haven't seen or tested the atmospheres of any of these planets, so whether they're habitable remains theoretical.
Often, when you find an example of a kind of planet, you start seeing a lot of them, said Sara Seager, professor of planetary science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She used to be part of the Kepler team but is now independent.
"Planets in the habitable zones of stars must be everywhere," she said.
Seager called the discovery of the three planets "a huge milestone," but her excitement is tempered because potentially habitable planets have been announced in the past and there's currently no way to get more details, given how far away they are.
"We'll possibly never know if these particular ones do have water oceans or signs of life," she said.

Identifying planets, not atmospheres
The goal of the Kepler mission wasn't to find alien lifeforms, however. The satellite is supposed to investigate Earth-sized planets around stars that resemble our sun.
The Kepler telescope, launched in 2009, allows scientists to measure changes in brightness of individual stars over time; these dimming events signal that a planet is nearby. Scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not passing rocks.
The satellite finds planets that are very far away because it's surveying so many stars. Imagine, said Seager, that you are in Times Square and you want to see 150,000 people at once. You wouldn't be able to do it in such a way that you could see any details of the people; you'd have to get far enough away that that many people would fit into your field of view.
In total, Kepler has found 122 confirmed planets and more than 2,700 planet candidates. A total of seven confirmed planets were announced Thursday -- the three in the habitable zone, and four others that are not.
This isn't the only planet-finding technique. The Gliese-581 system was found with the Keck I Telescope in Hawaii, using what is called the radial velocity method. The telescope's spectrometer allows scientists to look for wobbles in the motion of a star, which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets.
It would take a different kind of mission to investigate the atmosphere of one of these distance planets to find out answers to the most-pressing questions. Is there carbon dioxide and water? Is there oxygen?
"Future NASA missions are going to focus on more nearby stars that we can look at in much more detail," Barclay said.

Con man exposed after Justin Bieber ruse
By Scott Zamost, Gary Tuchman, and Elizabeth Nunez, CNN
updated 7:01 AM EDT, Tue June 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Waleed Ahmed gained fame in Norway for inventing an iPhone solar charger
He also claimed to lead Barack Obama's re-election campaign in Norway
Last summer, he approached Todd Weinberg with an investment
Weinberg agreed to invest $1M to promote Justin Bieber's Scandinavian tour
(CNN) -- Waleed Ahmed grins for the camera, a sly smile on his face as he poses in front of a black Porsche parked on the street.
At first glance, he looks like any other young guy hamming it up for an image to share with his buddies on Facebook.
Yet looks can be deceiving.
The Norwegian gained fame and fortune in his 20s -- enough to own that shiny, black Porsche in the photo -- after supposedly inventing an iPhone cover that uses solar energy to charge the phone.
Norway's media dubbed him the "Mark Zuckerberg of Norway," and the government even posted a video on its website of Ahmed and his then-business partner meeting with Norway's minister of trade and industry to show off the solar iPhone case.
Justin Bieber had a rough 2013, and 2014 doesn't appear to be shaping up much better. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers searched an airplane -- thought to be the one pictured -- carrying Bieber and others on January 31, at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Officers said they detected an odor of what seemed like marijuana after the plane landed, law enforcement sources told CNN. It's just the latest development in a series of troubles for the pop star.
Bieber turned himself in at a Toronto police station on January 29, facing an assault charge stemming from an encounter with a limousine driver in December. On January 23, Bieber was arrested on suspicion of DUI and drag racing, according to police in Miami Beach, Florida. Bieber is seen here with model Chantel Jeffries the night before his arrest.
On January 14, authorities swarmed Bieber's mansion in Calabasas, California, in connection with an investigation into a report of an egg-throwing incident at a neighbor's house. A friend of the singer's was arrested on a felony drug charge, and Bieber's phone was seized as part of the investigation.
Right before 2014 kicked off, Bieber threatened to retire after a spate of bad publicity, including being accused of everything from speeding to spitting. The news made Beliebers very sad.
While on tour in early November, Bieber yet again made headlines, this time with some sex-related scandal. The New York Post's Page Six alleged that Bieber had been spotted exiting a brothel while in Brazil. Then, a YouTube video sparked gossip that he'd done something less than innocent with the young woman featured in the clip. Bieber's camp has had no response on the chatter. Was he saving his energy for his fans, or just courting more controversy? In October, the day after a concert in Beijing, Bieber was snapped letting his bodyguards carry him up the stairs at the Great Wall of China.
A leaked video in July seemed to show Bieber relieving himself in a janitor's mop bucket and then spraying a photo of Bill Clinton with what appeared to be a cleaner fluid while saying, "F*** Bill Clinton." Bieber later apologized to the former president, but personalities like Anthony Bourdain and Mario Batali had a field day.
In June, another chapter was added to Bieber's history book of driving drama. The singer was reportedly involved in a Los Angeles accident involving a pedestrian.
As Bieber accepted the Milestone Award at the Billboard Music Awards in May, "very loud boos" competed with "very loud cheers," the magazine reported. Earlier in May, a fan rushed Bieber on stage and attempted to grab him during a concert in the United Arab Emirates. Also that month, a safe in a stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa, was raided after a Bieber performance. In April, Bieber visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam -- and was promptly criticized for saying that he hoped the teen, who died in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, would have been a "Belieber." Visitors to the Anne Frank Facebook page had plenty to say. "Glad he went, but, the last sentence is VERY self serving. he missed the lessons of Anne totally," wrote one observer.
Bieber lost his pet monkey, Mally, when the capuchin was taken by custom officials in Germany at the end of March. Mally is shown here in the quarantine station at the Munich-Riem animal shelter in Munich.
Unfortunately for Bieber, his 19th birthday in March was kind of a downer. After being snubbed by the Grammys, Bieber headed for London to celebrate his big day. But it ended up being what he tweeted was his "worst birthday." Not only was he ragged on by actress Olivia Wilde for going shirtless in the city, he also had a bit of beef with a "weak a** club."
Bieber ticked off his fans in March after he showed up a reported two hours late to a concert at London's O2 Arena. He disputed that in a tweet, however, saying he was only 40 minutes behind schedule.
Bieber later wound up sick in a London hospital. Being a lusted-after star, it's not surprising that he tried to show how "well" he felt by posting a shirtless photo of himself online.
Bieber and photographers, we've learned by now, don't mix. As he exited the hospital at the end of his turbulent week, the singer got into a shouting match with a paparazzo in London, telling the photographer that he'd "f*** him up."
After he was ragged on by Wilde for going topless in London, Bieber strolled through a Polish airport terminal sans shirt on March 25.
At the end of January 2013, a Twitpic appearing to show the singer touching a female fan's chest went viral. Both the "Belieber" and Bieber's rep denied he was touching her breast.
In January 2013, Bieber was photographed holding what TMZ identified as marijuana. He poked fun of the incident when he hosted "Saturday Night Live" in February. "I also heard he got busted for smoking weed and he's really sorry about it and that people make mistakes and that he's never going to do it again," Bieber said while playing a character during a skit with Vanessa Bayer.
On New Year's Day in 2013, a photographer was killed crossing the street after taking pictures of Bieber's Ferrari. Bieber, who wasn't present at the scene, said in a statement: "While I was not present nor directly involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim."

Justin Bieber's troubled timeline
'Bieber Fever' strikes Norway
Tardy Justin Bieber angers fans
Why is Justin Bieber going bad?
Ahmed's fame led to numerous encounters with international royalty and well-known diginitaries, including the crown prince and princess of Norway, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young and CNN founder Ted Turner.
Ahmed apparently wasn't just an innovative genius: He said he had been selected to be the chairman of Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign in Norway.
So, when Ahmed approached California investor Todd Weinberg last summer about his latest business proposition -- managing Justin Bieber's 2013 Scandinavian tour -- it didn't seem like a stretch that the young genius could secure the rights to the pop star's multimillion-dollar tour.
But the business deal between Ahmed and Weinberg would go terribly wrong. In the end, it would uncover a story that reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie.
The Bieber ruse
Last summer, Weinberg got a call from a friend in Los Angeles with connections in the entertainment industry about an amazing business opportunity.
"He said that he had come across an opportunity ... to help find money for an investor who could fill the gap for this tour that Justin Bieber is currently on," said Weinberg, a successful real estate investor and venture capitalist. "And I said, 'Well I don't understand, how does that work?' "
That so-called investor was Ahmed, 22, who claimed he had already paid $4.5 million to Scooter Braun Management -- Bieber's management company -- for rights to the Scandinavian tour after the initial investor failed to come up with the money.
But Ahmed said he needed another $1 million to secure the tour venues.
"Waleed wanted me to take the place of an investor who he had been working with that had fallen out of the deal," said Weinberg, 44.
Ahmed explained in an e-mail to Weinberg that he had gotten involved in the Bieber project because he "had the contacts to get a deal done with (Justin Bieber) because I am also working for President Obama as his election chair in Norway so easy to get things done."
For his $1 million, Weinberg said Ahmed assured him and his contract promised, that the return on his investment could be as high as $10 million.
Weinberg quickly went to work, trying to confirm the details.

"When we started looking and digging into the numbers, and (into) the spreadsheets and looking at actual ticket sales, per ticket sales, how many venues and how many tickets are being sold, it started to make sense," he said.
Even though it seemed like a sound investment, Weinberg admitted he was skeptical.
"When I was presented with my offer, my initial inclination was 'No thank you, not interested,' " Weinberg said. "It doesn't make sense to me, I have never done anything like this before. This is not my background. This is not my wheelhouse."
The contracts and other documents Ahmed provided to Weinberg all looked real. To make it appear legitimate, Ahmed even set up a conference call with a key member of Scooter Braun Management.
But Weinberg wanted to meet with Ahmed in person before moving forward with the deal.
Just four days after hearing about the Bieber opportunity, Weinberg headed to Burbank, California, where the young entrepreneur introduced Weinberg to the team he had assembled to promote Bieber's 2013 Scandinavian tour.
Even Miss Finland 2011, Pia Pikarinen, had been recruited to help promote the concerts.
Ahmed looked the part of a deal maker.
"He was Prada and Gucci from head to toe," Weinberg said. "He was a nice guy, but he also had a bit of an edge and arrogance about him."
It all looked like a good deal for everyone, and later that day, Weinberg and the rest of the team signed a contract at the offices of Karmic Management, one of three Los Angeles-based companies assigned to handle entertainment, public relations and sponsorships for the Bieber project.
But only Weinberg put up money.
Weinberg said he paid $860,000 to Ahmed to secure the concert venues and $140,000 to Karmic Management to get a website created and for other parts of the deal.
Ahmed sent Weinberg a text that the bank had confirmed the wire transfer of funds and said, "I just got a call from President Obama's election campaign since I am the chair for Norway so they need me in Chicago today, so heading over there now."
At that point, Weinberg said he thought the deal was on.
"After I invested the money, there was a lot of friendly collaborations happening," Weinberg said. "A lot of e-mails coming back and forth. Waleed was very involved and we started talking about who our ticketing agency was going to be, which was an organization that everyone has heard of. ... We hired a company to start developing a website for the Scandinavian leg of the tour."
But it wasn't long before, as Weinberg put it, "a couple of things went off track."
Conning the con man First, Weinberg said he started getting nervous when Ahmed "went off the radar" for 10 days.
"Well, you can imagine after 10 days, we are freaking out," Weinberg said. "Something is not right. Well, he surfaces and tells us, 'I'm sorry, you know, I was basically out for a Muslim holiday. I was out for Ramadan, and I'm sorry, but I am back. Let's go.' "
Around the same time, Weinberg said he began to hear about problems with the company handling the ticket sales. Then, Ahmed appeared on a radio interview in Norway, talking about his latest clothing purchases.
"Shoes, jacket, I have more at home," Ahmed told NRK reporter Webjørn Espeland. "I was in the U.S. and shopped Louis Vuitton for approximately 60,000 NOK (Norwegian kroners)."
That's more than $10,000 in clothing.
The next week, Ahmed returned to the United States. Weinberg got on a plane and met him in New York for dinner.
"This whole thing was disturbing and extremely confusing. He was talking in circles, and nothing was adding up," Weinberg said.
Then, the ruse came to an abrupt end when Weinberg learned that tickets for Bieber's Scandinavian concerts went on sale and quickly sold out.
"We couldn't believe it," Weinberg said. "We never had the deal. So this is when all of the alarms started going off, of course. And that's when Waleed got really squirrelly and became very hard to reach."
Weinberg had had enough. He contacted the FBI.
Meanwhile, Ahmed was in Norway in late September. During that trip, he posed for photos to accompany the radio interview he had given to Norway's NRK.
He would then make a fateful decision to return one last time to the United States. Weinberg persuaded him to meet at a restaurant in San Francisco.
They sat in a booth near the front door. Weinberg wore a wire, recording the conversation for the FBI.
"For two hours, Waleed goes into this whole dissertation about how his life is over as he once knew it," Weinberg said. "The Waleed Ahmed of Norway, the Mark Zuckerberg, the celebrity, the guy that everybody was excited about has now become a disappointment."
Ahmed explained to Weinberg how his parents have disowned him, and how he is in such financial straits that he's going to lose his home -- even his new Porsche. He said he planned to start his life over in Pakistan, where he has an uncle in the real estate business.
"Meanwhile, he's dressed again, Prada and Gucci head to toe," Weinberg said. "He just flew in first class telling me that he's broke without realizing that he flew in style. I mean, this guy had again the audacity to just continue this lie with me, and I just wasn't buying it. But I was doing the best I could to bite my lip."
The next day, on September 23, 2012, the FBI arrested Ahmed at San Francisco International Airport before he boarded a flight to Amsterdam.
He admitted to the FBI that it was all a con job.
In addition, according to an FBI affidavit, Ahmed created fake websites and e-mail addresses to pull off the scam. The conference call with the supposed member of Scooter Braun Management was actually one of Ahmed's friends in Norway.
Other scams and close calls
Today, Ahmed no longer wears Prada and Louis Vuitton. He's behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and is awaiting sentencing, scheduled for June 11. He refused a CNN request for an interview. The U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI also would not comment because Ahmed has not yet been sentenced.
But in a three-page letter to U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez, Ahmed wrote, "I have disgusted many, I have been the source of shame and disrespect for my friends, family, community and followers. I accept my crime, while I regret every bit of time, all I have with broken words, is that I really regret every minute spent committing it."
He told the judge that he "could not distinguish between right and wrong in the fire of desire and need for more."
As for the famous people he claimed to know, a spokesman for Scooter Braun said he never heard of Ahmed.
Ted Turner's spokesman said, "While Mr. Turner might have attended a public event in Norway where Mr. Ahmed was in attendance, he does not know Mr. Ahmed personally, and did not meet him in Atlanta."
Andrew Young said he did meet Ahmed and was shocked to learn he had been arrested.
"He used my contacts for things that I didn't know about nor did he ever discuss with me," Young said. "I mean, the first I heard from this was when he was arrested, and his lawyer called me and told me what he's been charged with, and my first reaction was there must be some misunderstanding."
The other companies that Ahmed lined up for the Bieber deal also said they were fooled.
Pikarinen, the Finnish beauty queen, said she knew nothing about any details of the deal.
"My company was scammed as well," said Carmenita Cornish-Helligar, the CEO of Karmic Management, who hosted the contract signing after learning about Ahmed through an entertainment industry contact in London.
"I still have fallouts from it," she said.
After Ahmed's arrest, other details of what led to the Bieber scam started to emerge.
Months before Weinberg was approached, Ahmed was trying to line up other investors, including Atlanta businessman Robert Fowler.
"I almost got suckered into the same thing," said Fowler, who said he turned down the deal after he found out it wasn't legitimate.
As it turns out, the Bieber con wasn't the only trouble for Ahmed.
In 2011, he made a deal with an Atlanta medical supply company to distribute specialty medical gloves called "EKG gloves" to the Middle East. But the deal went sour, and the company was stuck with thousands of the gloves.
"He's a really good con artist," said the company's owner, Billy Williams.
His company, Affirmative Solutions, sued Ahmed and obtained a court judgment against him for money owed in the deal.
Not only that, court documents from Norway reviewed by CNN show that Ahmed received a suspended jail sentence and was fined in 2008 for forging paperwork when he was 17, to get into a school.
In 2011, he was investigated for insurance fraud for claiming his BMW had been stolen in Oslo.
Five months before Ahmed met Weinberg, he bilked another investor out of $600,000 in another investment scam after pretending he was part of a development project, according to the Norwegian court documents.
Even the supposed iPhone solar charger that made him famous in Norway may not be his own invention, according to Norwegian press reports, which also revealed that Ahmed had made up how many devices had been ordered.
In a 37-page document filed with the court on June 3, the government argues for a 100-month prison term, citing Ahmed's history of criminal activity. His attorney is asking for an 18-month sentence.
"In reviewing defendant's communications, I was struck by how much pleasure he got out of betraying victim's trust, and his lack of respect for the victim," wrote FBI Special Agent Alice Tsujihara.
"Defendant texted that he should get the 'Best Scandinavian Thieves' award' and that 'being a thief is a profession.' "
A friend in Norway who went to business school with Ahmed helped him pull off the Bieber scam, she wrote, by creating false documents and posing as business associates.
"To defendant, fraud was 'like poker or blackjack' where you 'call or raise. Never fold!' " Tsujihara wrote.
Weinberg said he didn't know anything about Ahmed's previous troubles. As of now, he hasn't gotten any of his money back.
"I feel sorry for him," Weinberg said. "But I'm also furious. ... It's all that I've got to not get on an airplane and go to visit him in prison, and not sit across from him and just ask, 'Why, why would you do this?' "
NRK reporters Webjorn Espeland and Cathrine Elnan contributed to this report.

Manchester City old guard thrash Newcastle to go top
updated 6:27 PM EDT, Mon August 19, 2013
Sergio Aguero and David Silva celebrate scoring for Manchester City to help set up victory against Newcastle.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Manchester City defeat Newcastle United 4-0 in first match of the new season
David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri all score
The result moves Manchester City to the top of the Premier League table
Newcastle drop to the bottom after first round of matches
(CNN) -- Manchester City's million dollar summer signings were paraded in their first Premier League game of the season but it was City's old guard who earned a priceless first win for new manager Manuel Pellegrini.
David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri all scored as Manchester City sailed past Newcastle United 4-0.
The victory saw City overhaul local rivals, defending champions Manchester United, at the top of the Premier League table after the first round of matches.
The result also compounded a dismal start to the new season for Newcastle -- who were reduced to 10 men -- as the defeat saw them rooted to the bottom of the table.

Manchester City have splashed the case in the summer transfer window and there was close to $100m worth of new talent on display at the Etihad Stadium.
Pellgrini gave full debuts to Spanish winger Jesus Navas and Brazilian Fernandinho in a revamped midfield before bringing on Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo in the second half.
Negredo had a goal disallowed late on but the core of the team created by former manager Roberto Mancini had already given the new Chilean boss value for money against Newcastle.
Read: Pellegrini named as Mancini's successor
"It's a very good start but I was very confident that the team would play well," Pellegrini told the media after the match.
"We worked very hard during preseason, we were trying another style of football and we must continue to improve but for the first match, it was good.
"The most pleasing aspect was the way the team played for 90 minutes, from the beginning the attitude was aggressive and we continued to play that way for the whole match."
City were unleashed at the whistle and Edin Dzeko and Pablo Zabaleta --who signed a new four year contract to stay at City earlier on Monday -- both came close to scoring.
With barely six minutes on the clock, Silva headed in Dzeko's cross to see City's lively start to the match rewarded.
Aguero found the bottom corner to send City into the break 2-0 up and things got worse for Newcastle when Steven Taylor was show a red card for swiping the Argentine striker with his arm.
Toure glided in a free kick to stretch City's advantage and substitute Nasri pounced on a loose ball to complete the rout.
The only downside for City was the exit of captain Vincent Kompany with a suspected groin injury.
The result underlined City's credentials as championship contenders for their third season in a row.
After the first round of Premier League matches, the two Manchester clubs top the standings ahead of Aston Villa and Chelsea.
There were also wins for would be title challengers Liverpool and Tottenham while Arsenal suffered the misery of a home defeat to Villa.

Beef or chicken? How high-end airline meals are made
By Dean Irvine, CNN
updated 10:46 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Much of premium class airline food is hand-prepared
Gate Gourmet one of three airline catering facilities next to Hong Kong airport
Company produces around 15,000 meals each day
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Long gone are the days of ice sculptures and crepe suzette served up as a matter of course in first class cabins on airliners.
But what is presented to premium passengers can still rival some top hotels or restaurants, and can often act as a good barometer for the health of an airline's fortunes.
"When times get tough, food is one of the costs airlines can cut without jeopardizing safety," says Andreas Weber, general manager of airline catering company, Gate Gourmet.
"It has changed back and forth (over time); airlines go through crises," he says. "(Today) more airlines are investing substantially in their first and business class products. Making people comfortable in big seats, everyone is doing that already, but what is left is the catering experience."

Responsible for getting 15,000 meals a day onto planes departing Hong Kong International Airport, Gate Gourmet is well versed in meeting the demands of both airlines and passengers. It is one of three catering companies operating at the airport.

Erich Seifert, head of production at the facility that employs over 300 people, is often faced with demands for a particular meal for a first class customer at short notice.
"The customer is always right, we have to make it," he says, noting that special requests from airlines can come less than a couple of hours before a flight's departure.
Being able to react to last-minute requests for wagyu beef or whatever form the fancy of a passenger takes is down to a strict process -- from taking delivery of fresh ingredients in the morning to rolling out the meals on trolleys, all plated up on trays ready to be served on an evening flight.

"We're not like a lab yet," says Seifert of the kitchens that look much like any large-scale catering facility. "We have lots of standards and procedures; we can trace every product, everything is recorded, what is cooked, when and how."
That is to ensure that should anything go amiss or the food is not satisfactory Seifert can tell where in the process it might have happened.
First class dining: Why chose lobster over beef when you can have both surf and turf.
But if the whims of premium passengers must be indulged as one-offs, general safety and hygiene are constant with the 24-hour operation.
"It's essential for us the food is safe, this is our first priority. The first thing our people learn is the rule to wash hands, change clothes, cover hair, no jewelry and recording of all items," says Seifert.
The customer is always right, we have to make it.Erich Siefert, Gate Gourmet
Gate Gourmet's facility at the edge of the airport could almost be a drive-thru for planes, it's just a few hundred yards from the southern runway.
Read more: Place your bid for an upgrade
With the roar of jet engines in the background, dedicated chefs in the Indian, Middle Eastern and Chinese sections of the kitchens oversee the production of different meals for 17 international airlines.
The "blast chillers" are one exceptional piece of kitchen kit not usually found in regular restaurant kitchens. They are used to quickly bring the temperature down from cooking temperature to around 4 degrees Celsius; the required temperature food must be when delivered to planes.
Much of the first and business class cuisine, from scallop dumplings to macaron desserts, are hand-made and prepared directly to an airline's specifications. Many of these carriers have a celebrity chef behind the creation of the menu.
"Usually the higher-end airlines send their own menus, or others will ask us to for the whole thing to develop it for them," says Siefert.
"Most of them will make proposals; our proposals will combine with theirs, and they give us roughly a vision of their food and they will come to our facility. It can be a very stressful day actually... you have to change this and you have to take all the weights and record it all down to make sure it is exactly like this."
Read more: Economy class goes gourmet
Those plating up the meals have pictorial guides, so when the food is served or the foil lid removed, passengers don't lose their appetite with sloppy presentation. "That's what the customer wants and that's what the customer insists," says Siefert.
For those who don't have the luxury of sitting at the front of the plane, the hardy perennials of airline food -- beef, chicken and fish -- will continue to be the mainstay of dining in the sky.
"Most of the flying public they are not adventurous ; you won't be finding braised rabbit or pigeon on an aircraft," says Weber. "But we work with a lot of international customers so there's a high expectation, especially as Hong Kong is a culinary hub. Even if you go for a dai pai dong, here the food is good."

How to seize back your democracy
By Ben Cohen and Larry Cohen
updated 11:22 AM EST, Tue February 11, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ben Cohen, Larry Cohen: 2014 elections will see huge campaign donations, spending
They say Citizens United ruling helped open gates to flood of outside spending to sway vote
They say citizens now think corporations, super PACs control democracy
Cohens: Public financing of campaigns would restore voice, trust of Americans
Editor's note: Ben Cohen is the co-founder of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream and the founder of the StampStampede.org campaign, whose goal is to help build the movement to amend the Constitution to get money out of politics. Larry Cohen is president of the 700,000-member Communications Workers of America. CWA, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and the NAACP are conveners of the Democracy Initiative, with more than 40 organizations and 25 million members working for a 21st-century democracy.
(CNN) -- The 2014 midterm elections are quickly shaping up to be the most obscenely expensive ever. As more and more outside groups shell out an unlimited amount of campaign cash -- while accepting bottomless contributions from big business and anonymous wealthy donors -- stockpiling huge amounts of campaign cash has become a political arms race.
Even so, this is the year concerned Americans can begin to turn it all around and get big money out of politics. Together, "we the people" can stamp out big money in politics.
If we don't act now, we're in trouble. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision was a key ruling in opening up the gates to a torrent of spending by super PACs. Outside groups spent a whopping $2 billion in the 2012 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission figures, compared with $298,549,659 in 2008. Ben Cohen
Larry Cohen
According to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of super PACs and politically active nonprofits, by November of last year these groups had burned through $20.6 million, more than three times the $6.3 million they'd laid out by the same point in the last election.
"Dark money" organizations -- 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) nonprofits such as Americans for Prosperity or The League of Conservation Voters, which aren't required to disclose the names of their donors -- have nearly quintupled their spending of two years ago.
And right now, the nation is awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in another case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which is challenging caps on the total amount that a wealthy donor can directly give to all PACs, campaigns and parties combined -- what's known as "aggregate contribution limits." If the court strikes down contribution limits, one affluent donor would be able to give more than $3 million in direct contributions. Currently, individual donor contributions are capped at $123,200 -- more than double the median family income in America.
What's one impact of all this money?
Many Americans are becoming convinced that their votes don't count, that our political process is controlled by the biggest bankroll, and that money, not the public interest, sets policies and priorities in government. Big money gives a big voice to the wealthy and corporations, at the expense of the rest of us. It threatens the democratic voice that is the foundation of our country. Freshman representatives in Congress are asked to spend nearly half their time raising money, many providing special interest lobbyists and elites with unprecedented access. These special interests can afford to pay $5,000 a plate for politicians' fund-raising breakfasts, or for such things as ski trips, pheasant hunts and luxury golf tournaments.
A new era in campaign finance
Money stamping campaign
Romney: Rules don't make a lot of sense
This access shapes the issues that members of Congress care about. It inevitably promotes a "pay to play" government that leaves other citizens out in the cold and makes the public increasingly cynical that elections matter.
What are the steps we must take to restore our political process to one determined by "we the people"?
Public financing of campaigns would restore the political voice of small contributors and the belief that the votes and voice of ordinary Americans count. Last week, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, introduced "government by the people" legislation that will empower "we the people" as small donors to fight back against big money in politics.
With a "Freedom from Influence Fund," financed by closing corporate tax loopholes, the bill would give small donors a $25 refundable tax credit, and match contributions of $150 or less at a rate of 6 to 1. This effort is similar to a public finance measure introduced in New York state, and other jurisdictions also are looking at this public financing model. Already 16 states, 500 municipalities and over 140 members of Congress are on record in support.
While local and national advocates are driving key reforms, every citizen -- Democrats, independents and Republicans -- can help build the movement to get money out of politics by legally stamping messages like "Not to be Used for Buying Elections" on their paper currency. On average, a dollar bill stays in circulation for approximately two and a half years and is seen by 875 people. So as more stamped bills enter the marketplace, we can create a massive visual demonstration of support for reforms -- support that our elected representatives will no longer be able to ignore.
If we care about a truly representative government and political process, one that engages and encourages the electorate to participate, then we must take action to get big money out of politics.

Paul BegalaMission accomplished. The Democrats showed strength, they showed unity and they showed that they're more mainstream. Now the Republicans have a very, very tough act to follow. Tucker CarlsonI think tactically, it was a brilliant convention in that it was not scary; they reassured people the Democratic Party is strong enough to run the country in the time of a war. They did that well. They didn't answer the question about Iraq; they didn't even have an argument about Iraq. That's the argument that we needed to have.
Bill SchneiderThe good thing about (Kerry's) speech was it focused on an important message: unity. It was a mish-mash of ideologies. He talked about liberal programs but also about middle class tax cuts. He talked about a strong national defense but also took great exception to the war in Iraq. So it was all over the place, but the idea is it wasn't an ideological speech. The message was "I'm going to unify the country." Part of the symbol was I'm taking ideas from the left, and from the right and from the center. He also specifically accused the Republicans of dividing the country. That was the attack. He said the president is misusing the Constitution for political purposes -- meaning the ban on same-sex marriage. He said that the Attorney General doesn't uphold the Constitution . He accused the Republicans of challenging their opponents' patriotism. And he said President Bush squandered the opportunity for national unity after 9/11, and he invited him to run a unifying campaign. But his basic message was: they're dividing, we're going to unite. Carlos WatsonKerry's speech itself was a B+. But because the expectations were so slow and the need to deliver was so high, plus with all the introductions, the movie, the "Band of Brothers" -- all that came together to make the speech an A-. In a very close election, the convention first and foremost avoided any gaps. At the same time, it introduced the ticket to the country, energized the base and addressed key issues that could affect swing voters. Mo RoccaThe food was lousy. It was too damn hot. But the delegates walked away with a lot of energy.
