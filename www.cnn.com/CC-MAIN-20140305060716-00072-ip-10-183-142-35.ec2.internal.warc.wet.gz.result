BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Across the Tigris River from his opulent palaces, Saddam Hussein shuttered himself at the bottom of a narrow, dark hole beneath a two-room mud shack on a sheep farm, a U.S. military official said Sunday.
Having opted not to travel with security forces or an entourage that might bring attention to him, only a Styrofoam square, dirt and a rug separated the deposed Iraqi leader from the U.S. soldiers who routed him from his hiding place Saturday night.
"He was in the bottom of a hole with no way to fight back," said Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno. "He was caught like a rat."
Saddam's capture was based not on a direct tip, but a collection of intelligence gathered from the hostile questioning of Saddam's former bodyguards and family members, U.S. officials said.
That intelligence prompted U.S. soldiers to go to Adwar, about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Tikrit, Saddam's ancestral home.
'We realized early on in the summer... the people we had to get to were the midlevel individuals, his bodyguards... We tried to work through family and tribal ties that might have been close to Saddam Hussein," Odierno said.
"Over the last 10 days or so, we brought in about five to ten members of these families, ... and finally we got the ultimate information from one of these individuals."
After they received the "actionable intelligence" earlier Saturday, the 1st Brigade Combat team of the 4th Infantry Division, the Raider Brigade, was given the assignment to kill or capture Saddam in a mission dubbed Operation Red Dawn.
Hideaway uncovered
Six hundred soldiers from the Raider Brigade prepared to move on two locations. They included cavalry engineers, artillery, aviation and special operations forces.
Even with reliable information, U.S. forces initially failed to grab Saddam in raids on two targets near Adwar.
But a subsequent cordon and search operation in the same area unearthed the ragged, bearded fugitive.
Troops converged on a two-room mud hut squatting between two farmhouses with sheep penned nearby.
One room, which appeared to serve as a bedroom, was in disarray with clothes strewn about the area.
The other room was a crude kitchen, Odierno said.
Inside that shack, a Styrofoam plug closed Saddam's subterranean hideaway. Dirt and a rug covered the entryway to the hole, he said.
U.S. forces encountered no resistance during Red Dawn.
"I think the pressure had become so tight on him, (Saddam) knew he couldn't travel in large entourages so he didn't have any men with him, didn't have much of a security force," Odierno said.
Saddam was armed with a pistol, but showed no resistance during his capture.
"He was a tired man and also a man resigned to his fate," Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of U.S. forces, told a news conference in Baghdad Sunday.
Soldiers also recovered two AK 47 rifles, $750,000 in $100 denominations and a white and orange taxi in the raid.
Troops took two other unidentified Iraqis affiliated with Saddam into custody.
By 9:15 p.m., Saddam was moved to an undisclosed location and soldiers continued to search the area.
"If you could see where we found him, he could have been hiding in a hundred different places, a thousand different places, like this all around Iraq," Odierno said.
"And it just takes finding the right person who will give you a good idea where he might be, and that's what happened."

Translating body languageStory Highlights Body language can almost always be interpreted in more than one way Lip biting could mean she's flirting, but it might mean she's shy or feels pressured Wringing your hands could mean you're cold, but it might mean you're worried Eye rolling is one of the nonverbal signs that is pretty much always aggressive Next Article in Living » (Real Simple) -- Body language can almost always be interpreted in more than one way. Standing too close could mean she's angry or needy, or she may be from a culture where it's acceptable. Here are 18 gestures, with advice for reading them from a team of experts in nonverbal communication. It's written on your face... Furrowing brow It could mean: She's thinking. But it might mean: She disapproves of or disagrees with what you're saying. Or else she can't hear you. What the experts say: "This almost always means something negative," says trial lawyer Maria Katrina Karos. It is often a cue people use to tell you something is wrong, says author Lydia Ramsey: They want you to ask them what they're thinking. Frowning It could mean: She's unhappy or uncomfortable. But it might mean: She's concentrating. What the experts say: Some people frown without realizing it, so don't comment on the frowning directly, says anthropologist David Givens. If it happens during a job interview, you might ask, "Did that answer the question?" With a friend, just ask if she's OK. Real Simple: Manage your anger Grimacing It could mean: Nothing. It's just a tic or a bad habit. But it might mean: She doesn't like what you're saying. What the experts say: This is typically a sign of discomfort or displeasure, says Ramsey. But she warns against reading too much into it: "Some people just always have unpleasant expressions on their faces." Lip biting It could mean: She's flirting. But it might mean: She's shy or feels pressured. What the experts say: Suspects sometimes do this when they're trying to remember an event or concoct a story, says private investigator Steven Tavlin. It's a sign of discomfort. To put the person at ease, avoid direct staring and lower your voice. You might even back up or turn away slightly. "The idea is to take the pressure off," says Givens.

And in your eyes... Rolling eyes It could mean: She's trying to be funny. But it might mean: She is frustrated, doesn't like you, or doesn't respect you. What the experts say: "Eye rolling is one of the nonverbal signs that is pretty much always aggressive," says executive coach Steve Watts. He recommends politely confronting the eye-roller, asking, "Do you disagree?" to get negative feelings out in the open. Staring It could mean: She's concentrating on what you're saying, or she's smitten with you. But it might mean: She's being rude and aggressive. What the experts say: Eye contact rarely lasts longer than three seconds before one or both people experience a powerful urge to glance away, says Givens. If the starer is making you feel uncomfortable, look away briefly to give her the hint. Avoiding eye contact It could mean: She's shy. But it might mean: She's lying or trying to provoke you. What the experts say: Don't assume the worst based on this clue alone. And be aware of varying cultural interpretations of eye contact, says corporate-communications consultant Audrey Nelson. "We associate eye contact with honesty, but in Japan avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect." Real Simple: Guide to Etiquette Basics And in your hands... Fidgeting (tugging ears, pulling sleeves, rubbing head) It could mean: She's just a natural fidgeter. But it might mean: She's anxious or impatient. What the experts say: "This is a classic sign of anxiety or stress," says Givens. "It's a way people take their attention away from what's bothering them." If you're in a meeting and you notice people are getting fidgety, take a break, says Ramsey. Resting hands on hips It could mean: "I'm in charge." But it might mean: She's angry and trying to intimidate you. What the experts say: "This is a powerful position," says Givens. (Police officers are taught to use it to assert control.) If this is an angry boss, appease her by asking, "Did I do something wrong?" If it's an equal trying to bully you, stand tall and place your feet shoulder-width apart, or put your own hands on your hips. Both gestures say, "I'm not intimidated!" Fiddling with an object (hair, pencil, car keys, cell phone) It could mean: Nothing some people just like to fiddle. But it might mean: "I'm nervous" or "I'm bored." What the experts say: To figure out what's going on, look for other clues, says Tavlin. Yawning suggests boredom; blinking, nervousness. If the fiddling is distracting you, draw attention to the object, says Watts. Say, "Is that a new cell phone?" Then get back to your discussion. Pointing It could mean: "I'm really passionate about this topic." But it might mean: She's trying to intimidate you. What the experts say: "Pointing is generally an aggressive sign," says life coach and social worker Carol Moss. It can signal that someone is blaming or attacking you. If you can't let it go, "It's OK to ask someone not to point," says Moss. Make a joke about it: "Hey, nice manicure." Wringing hands It could mean: She's cold. But it might mean: She's worried. What the experts say: "People who are very uncomfortable with a question, topic, or situation sometimes do this," says Karos. The best thing is to ignore it. If the person is truly nervous, commenting on her nerves will only make her more so. Excessive touching It could mean: She's overly friendly. But it might mean: "I'm more powerful than you." What the experts say: "People of higher status often feel freer to touch people of lower status," says Tannenbaum. (Of course, it can also be sexual.) "If you're uncomfortable, you don't need to say anything. Just remove the hand." If the touching continues, back up slowly to get out of range, says Givens. Real Simple: Protecting Your Personal Space Tapping fingers on a table It could mean: She's got energy to burn. But it might mean: She's nervous or impatient. What the experts say: If this is really annoying you, look at the person's fingers, then back at her face, says Tannenbaum. "The goal is not to embarrass her but to bring her attention back to where you want it to be." And in your body Standing too close It could mean: She's needy or angry. But it might mean: She's from a culture where people tend to stand closer. What the experts say: "This is typically an aggressive gesture," says Professor Whitey Brewer. But different cultures have different rules about space. "North Americans like a distance of two to three feet, while some Europeans want to be closer," says Ramsey. If you're uncomfortable, subtly take a step or two back. Standing too far away It could mean: She's afraid. But it might mean: She's simply more comfortable at this distance. What the experts say: "This is typically a passive gesture indicating fear," says Brewer. But for cultural and other reasons, people generally choose a distance they're comfortable with. If you need to get closer, do so, says actress Susan Stewart. Just be careful not to crowd your listener. Slouching It could mean: She has bad posture. But it might mean: She's skeptical or disrespectful. What the experts say: "This is often a way of showing, 'I'm above it all, and I don't care,'" says Tavlin. It can also be a tip off that someone is lying, especially if accompanied by another sign, such as crossed arms or an averted gaze. Crossing arms It could mean: She is cold or simply finds this position comfortable. But it might mean: She's angry or defiant, or feels vulnerable. What the experts say: With arms and elbows pulled tightly into the body, the gesture may reveal acute nervousness or chronic anxiety, says Givens. Held less tightly against the chest, with elbows elevated and projecting outward, the crossed arms suggest arrogance, dislike, or disagreement.

Italian police seek Kercher murder chargesStory Highlights Italian prosecutors request charges against 3 suspects in killing of UK student Meredith Kercher was found dead on November 2 in a Perugia villa Judges will decide if there is evidence to take case against the three to trial Prosecutors say she was killed resisting sexual assaultNext Article in World » Read VIDEO ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italian prosecutors are requesting indictments against three suspects in connection with the November killing of a 20-year-old British student, one of the suspect's lawyers told CNN. Briton Meredith Kercher was found dead in her Perugia, Italy, flat last November. Luca Maori, the defense lawyer for Raffaele Sollecito, said prosecutors are requesting that his client, an Italian -- as well as American Amanda Knox and Ivory Coast native Rudy Guede -- be tried for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Judges will decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case against the three to trial after the summer recess, which ends in mid-September. Knox and Sollecito have been jailed since November in connection with the young woman's death on November 2 in the villa apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia. Guede was arrested in November in Germany and has been jailed in Italy since he was extradited there in December. Kercher, an exchange student at Perugia's university, was found dead with a stab wound to her neck. Prosecutors allege that Guede committed sexual violence on her, with the help of Knox and Sollecito. Watch prosecutors' requesting indictments against the suspects » The prosecutors say the three then strangled and stabbed Kercher, and took 300 euros, two credit cards and two cell phones in an attempt to make the scene appear as a robbery. Don't Miss Kercher death suspect cleared -- lawyer
DNA on bra links suspect to Kercher
All deny the charges. Guede admits he was in the apartment on the day Kercher was killed, but said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room. Police, however, have said evidence ties the two suspects to the crime scene. They say a bloody footprint left by a Nike shoe next to Kercher's body came from Sollecito -- who at the time was Knox's boyfriend. Authorities have also said they found traces of blood belonging to both Knox and Kercher mixed together in a bathroom adjacent to the room where Kercher died. Sollecito's attorney told CNN that his client was not in the apartment. "'We will prove that my client was not in the house at the time of the crime, but in his flat watching a movie on a computer, together with Amanda Knox," Maori said. Knox's lawyers had no comment.

Obama approval hits new low By Alan Silverleib, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSOnly 42 percent of Americans approve of Obama's job performance in a new CNN/ORC pollLikely voters now favor Republicans over Democrats by nine points56 percent of Americans say Obama has fallen short of their expectationsAlmost half of all voters backing the GOP say they are doing so simply to oppose the Democrats Washington (CNN) -- With little more than a month to go before the midterm elections, President Barack Obama's approval rating has hit an all-time low. Only 42 percent of Americans now approve of how Obama's handling his job as president, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. Fifty-four percent disapprove of his performance. The figures represent a new low-water mark in the CNN/ORC poll for the president, who, almost two years into his term, continues to wrestle with public worries over a sluggish economy and exhaustion with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congressional Democrats aren't faring much better. They now face a nine-point deficit when likely voters are asked which party they'll back in November, according to the poll. Top non-partisan political analysts have given the Republicans a serious shot at picking up the 39 seats necessary to recapture the House of Representatives. A solid majority of all Americans -- 56 percent -- say that Obama has fallen short of their expectations. As a result, the president is not in a position to help struggling Democratic candidates; only 37 percent of likely voters say they are more likely to vote for a congressional candidate backed by Obama. In contrast, half of all likely voters now say they are likely to choose a candidate supported by the conservative Tea Party -- contributing to the GOP's 53 to 44 percent lead when such voters are asked which party's candidate they will choose in November. Also damaging the Democrats: the enthusiasm gap. Republicans in general are much more engaged and excited about voting than Democrats, according to the new poll. One cautionary note for Republican candidates: voters aren't wild about the GOP, either. Nearly half of likely voters who say they will vote Republican in the fall say they are doing so to oppose the Democrats, not to support the Republicans. Also potentially cutting against GOP momentum: while nearly eight in 10 voters favor extending the Bush tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year, a majority oppose extending the cuts for families that make more than that amount. Republicans have vehemently argued in favor of extending the cuts for the wealthiest Americans as well, arguing that a failure to do so would damage the recovery. Top Democrats, led by Obama, claim that the roughly $700 billion price tag associated with an extension of the cuts for the richest Americans would be fiscally irresponsible. While the president's approval ratings may seem grim, he has plenty of company among his most recent predecessors. Obama's approval rating exactly matches that of Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter in September of their second years in office. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted September 21-23, with 1,010 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points. There is a 4.5 percent margin of error for the 506 likely voters questioned in the poll.CNN's Polling Director Keating Holland contributed to this report.

Judge delays releasing names of Casey Anthony jurors until October By the CNN Wire Staff Who were the jurors filling these seats in the Casey Anthony murder trial? You'll have to wait until at least late October to learn. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe judge rules state law requires him to release juror namesBut he says he will do so only after an appropriate "cooling-off" periodRight to privacy, security may outweigh media needs, judge saysCasey Anthony was acquitted of the most serious charges (CNN) -- Although the law requires him to release the names of the Casey Anthony trial jurors, a Florida judge ruled Tuesday he will wait until a "cooling-off" period is completed before doing so. Citing contemptuous remarks about the jurors and concerns for their well-being, Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. said Tuesday he won't release their names until October 25 or later. Seventeen jurors sat in on the case, five of them as alternates. Only three have since identified themselves. Perry's order will release the identities of the other 14. Defense attorney speaks on book deal rumor Casey Anthony was released earlier this month, nearly two weeks after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges. That verdict brought an abrupt end to a six-week trial that drew intense media hype for its elements of family drama and mystery over what happened to Caylee Anthony, 2. Anthony juror names sealed until October

Perry made his ruling after media entities asked him to release the names immediately after the verdict. In his ruling, Perry cited public anger about the verdict and several signs, including "Juror 1-12 Guilty of Murder!" He also cited a restaurant in the jury's home county saying members were not welcome. "More importantly," Perry wrote, "it was publicly reported that one juror had been forced to quit work and leave the state because of the threats she had received." The judge said jury service can be unpleasant and that privacy is necessary. "Simply put, potential jurors will not be candid in their responses during jury selection if they think their statements might be reported." He went on to say court proceedings are no longer news, but entertainment. Perry said in some cases the right to privacy and security may outweigh the media's desire to have the names. He called on the Florida Legislature to examine whether "an exemption barring release of jurors' names, albeit limited to specific, rare cases, is in order to protect the safety and well-being of those citizens willing to serve." The jury was chosen in May following an 11-day selection process at the Pinellas County Courthouse in Clearwater, Florida. The jurors came from that county -- and not Orange County, about 110 miles to the northwest, where the alleged crimes occurred -- because authorities hoped to find a jury pool less likely to have been swayed by the intense media coverage surrounding the case.

Review: 'Breaking Dawn - Part 2' is freaky fun
By Tom Charity, special to CNN
updated 7:09 PM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Breaking Dawn --- Part 2" is the fifth and final Twilight film
Critic says movie is "easily the freakiest film in the saga, and the most fun"
Bill Condon returns to direct as he did the last movie
(CNN) -- The story so far: Northwest teen Bella Swan falls in love with Edward Cullen, a mysteriously aloof, fair-skinned but exceedingly well-educated young man who confesses to being a "vegetarian" vampire.
This bums out Bella's best friend, Jacob, who has always carried a torch for her, and who has a natural aversion to vampires, being a werewolf himself. Despite his better (and worse) instincts, Edward is smitten, and eventually he agrees to marry her.
At the end of "Breaking Dawn - Part 1" she gives birth to their half-human child, but nearly dies during labor. In order to save Bella's life, Edward has to "turn" his bride into an immortal -- which is what she wanted all along.
Still with us? "Breaking Dawn - Part 2," the fifth and final film in "The Twilight Saga" begins with Bella waking up to enjoy her freshly sharpened senses, her attractive red eyes and vampiric super-strength. And the first, most pressing question on everybody's mind is this: Will she eat the baby?
Movie Pass: "Twilight Breaking Dawn 2"
Celebrities who love 'Twilight'
Edward whisks her off into the woods to quench her thirst, where the question becomes: will Bella eat Bambi? And then a third time: will she eat the anonymous climber scaling a sheer rock face oblivious to the real danger he is in?
Teen movies have sure come a long way since "The Breakfast Club." Back then, all we wanted was to find common ground and fit in. Mind you, once her sanguinary and carnal appetites have been satisfied, assimilation is also Bella's main concern.
Life after 'Twilight': Readers pick new teams
It exhibits along the lines of: what to tell dad? And what to do about the wolfboy who has marked out her newborn -- but fast-growing -- daughter as his intended? ("You nicknamed my baby after the Loch Ness monster?!")
It has taken this series a long time to line up its dominoes, but "Breaking Dawn -- Part 2" is easily the freakiest film in the saga, and the most fun.
Before we're done there will be a virtual United Nations of vampire delegates -- associates from the North, from Amazonia, the Middle East, from Ireland and, yes, Transylvania, converging on Forks and getting a chance to bond with baby Cullen before the ultimate showdown with their eminences, the Volturi.
These cloaked archvillains have been waiting in the wings so long it's a wonder they haven't taken off, but at last Michael Sheen's got the chance to act -- show these young pretenders how it's done -- and he doesn't waste a single voluptuous syllable. In one extraordinary moment he lets rip with what can only be described as a squeal. It's a performance Christopher Walken would love, and Nic Cage could only envy -- there can be no higher praise.
Share your review of 'Breaking Dawn Part 2'
The battle, when it comes, is exciting and almost ludicrously grisly. Heads duly roll. Even Twi-haters (maybe especially Twi-haters) will enjoy the kind of carnage normally associated with the worst excesses of the French Revolution.
Directed, like the last film, by Bill Condon, and not at all ashamed of wearing its big pulpy heart on its sleeve, "BDP2" is enjoyably demented, a rousing curtain call and quite enough to tide us over until Stephenie Meyer's "The Host" reaches our screens next March.

Mideast peace starts with talking to Iran
By Gary Sick, Special to CNN
updated 3:36 AM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
British EU official Catherine Ashton, front left, walks with Iraq's Hoshyar Zebari to talks between the P5+1 and Iran.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gary Sick: Mideast issues are all bound up together, impossible to disentangle
Syria, Iran, Israel, the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia: All are intertwined politically
Obama's first step must be to deal with Iran, he says, accepting compromise essential
Sick: Iran deal would cut threat of war, help in Syria, lesson risk of nuclear proliferation in region
Editor's note: Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and he was the principal White House aide for Iran during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis. Sick is a senior research scholar and adjunct professor of international affairs at Columbia University, a member of the board of Human Rights Watch in New York and founding chair of its advisory committee on the Middle East and North Africa.
(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is getting a lot of free advice. Here's a question, not an answer: With every issue in the Middle East intertwined with every other, like a giant bowl of spaghetti, where do you begin?
In reality, no matter where you begin in the Middle East, each strand connects to almost every other:
Syria? Immediately you must think of the Turks who are harboring refugees and fighters just across the border, and Syrian Kurds, who are beginning to harbor thoughts of autonomy and are increasing contacts with their ethnic brothers in Iraq and Turkey.
Gary Sick
Iran, of course, is aiding the beleaguered Bashar al-Assad but also trying to organize an exit strategy; Saudi Arabia and Qatar are pouring money and arms into the country with the sole purpose of cracking the Syria-Iran entente; Iraq fears that a Sunni takeover in Syria will revitalize its own restless Sunnis.

The Palestinian issue? No need to elaborate. That is tangled up with everything in the Middle East.
The Arab awakening? The policies you adopt with the emerging Islamist governments will affect every strand you touch in the region, from relations with Israel to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf that are terrified of sweeping change.

The president will not have the luxury of choosing a single issue and ignoring or postponing all the others. The whole Middle East has a habit of intruding, and policy choices will have to be made about each of the major issues, even if it is not convenient.
Still, in plotting a second term, the president must establish some priorities. Trying to do everything at once is not only bad strategy, it is a certain recipe for failure across the board.
A point of entry: Possibly the most promising strand to pull when trying to unravel the Mideast problem is the Iranian dilemma. When Obama came into office four years ago, he courageously promised to engage Iranian leaders. He made a genuine attempt, but he quickly pulled back in the face of Iran's brutal suppression of a civil uprising, Israeli demands for an early deadline on the nuclear issue and the fact that he had a lot on his domestic plate. Trita Parsi evocatively describes that episode in the book "A Single Roll of the Dice."
There was no staying power. Instead, the United States reverted to its default position of sanctions while maintaining the framework for serious negotiations with Iran as part of the so-called P5+1 -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia) plus one (Germany).
The sanctions did their job. Iran has gladly accepted the invitation of the P5+1 to return to the negotiating table. However, in the run-up to the presidential election, the United States was unwilling to put a meaningful offer on the table, and the negotiating track languished in a kind of limbo.
The value of sanctions: Sanctions have two useful purposes. One is to persuade Iran to return to the negotiating table. That has happened. The other is to give the sanctioning party something to bargain away in return for concessions.
Up to this point, the United States has been unwilling to offer significant sanctions relief in return for significant concessions from Iran. Sanctions have assumed a life of their own and are gradually becoming politically untouchable. If that remains true, then there is no prospect of serious negotiations.
There is another use of sanctions -- to punish a party you don't like and potentially coerce them into submission or collapse. The current sanctions regime is taking on that coloration, even if it is seldom discussed as such.
The record of sanctions in producing abject surrender or regime change is not promising. Instead, the sanctions typically hurt the average citizen, while leaders escape most of the effects and adopt a defiant posture, blaming their own failings on outside interference. This is beginning to happen in Iran today.
Vicious assaults on the well-being of a country's population can produce popular bitterness and hostility against the "enemy" that can last for generations.
The shape of an agenda: As with many long-standing disputes, the broad outlines of a settlement are well-known to the parties. What is lacking is the political judgment by both sides that now is the moment to proceed with a deal that will require mutual compromise.
The United States and its allies will have to accept a measure of Iranian domestic enrichment of uranium. Iran will have to accept limits on its entire nuclear infrastructure, subject to intrusive inspections and monitoring. Iran will need to document the history of its nuclear program, and the West will need to remove sanctions. All of this must happen in a step-by-step process with safeguards and verifications at each stage.
There is nothing easy about it. The Iranians are known as obstinate and often infuriating negotiators. The United States is not known for its patience, and it can be clumsy and ponderous as it attempts to please multiple constituencies at the same time. Iran is certain to face strong objections from its hardliners, and the same will apply in the United States.
The hardliners on both sides, who regard another Middle East war as an acceptable option, reinforce each other and impede efforts to find mutually acceptable compromises. Israel and the U.S. Congress will try to impose impractically tight deadlines. And events in the region, such as the recent case of Iranian aircraft firing on a U.S. surveillance drone, can sabotage negotiations.
The Arab states of the Gulf will be intensely suspicious of any hint of a secret deal between the United States and Iran. They remember America's strategic reliance on the shah, the Reagan administration's covert sale of weapons to Iran in the mid-1980s and America's installation of a Shia government in Iraq. They (and Israel) will have to be persuaded that any accommodation with Iran is not at their expense.
Private and public negotiations: The starting point must be private U.S.-Iran discussions, leading to an agreed agenda. Both sides have recently hinted that such talks are under consideration, and reactions from the European Union, Russia and even the American people have been undismayed, even openly supportive.
The choice of representatives and venues is less important than confidence that delegates credibly reflect the view of their leaders. Experience suggests that an agreed agenda is more likely to emerge from bilateral discussions outside the glare of publicity. If that is accomplished, then the actual negotiations could be carried out within the existing P5+1 framework.
Even a preliminary agreement -- establishing a mutually acceptable process with a defined end point -- would help to unravel some of the tangles of Middle East issues.
The threat of a new war in the Middle East would be reduced. The possibility of getting Iranian cooperation on Syria would be improved. The threat of nuclear proliferation in the region would be tamped down at least temporarily. And the multiple flash points in the Gulf could potentially cool down, leaving opportunities for more constructive initiatives.
The history of U.S.-Iran relations is a story of relentless hostility and serial missed opportunities. Chances for genuine progress come along scarcely once in a decade.
So, Mr. President, here is one more piece of free advice: The present constellation of circumstances with Iran is probably the best you're going to get. Don't let it pass.

Supreme Court upholds Georgia convict's stay of execution
By Matt Smith, CNN
updated 12:45 PM EST, Thu February 21, 2013
Condemned Georgia murderer Warren Lee Hill attorneys say he's mentally disabled.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to overturn Warren Hill's last-minute stay
Hill had been scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday night
His lawyers say he is mentally disabled and should be spared
Prosecutors say his claim hasn't survived court scrutiny
(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a 30-day stay of execution for condemned Georgia murderer Warren Lee Hill, whose attorneys say he's mentally disabled.
Georgia had asked the justices to lift the stay, which was granted minutes before Hill had been scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday night. A federal appeals court in Atlanta halted the execution to give lawyers a month for written arguments on whether Hill should be spared under the federal ban on executions of the mentally disabled.
Georgia law requires inmates to prove mental retardation "beyond a reasonable doubt" to avoid the death penalty -- the highest standard of any state. State prosecutors say Hill has repeatedly failed to meet that standard in years of appeals.
But three doctors who examined Hill for the state have reversed their conclusions and now say he should be spared, giving fresh ammunition to Hill's attorneys. That reversal "establishes consensus among every doctor who has evaluated Mr. Hill that he is mentally retarded," his lawyer, Brian Kammer, said Thursday.
Hill's defenders say he has an IQ of 70. He was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison.
Hill was already serving a life sentence in the 1985 killing of his girlfriend, Myra Wright, when he beat Handspike to death with a nail-studded board. Tuesday's reprieve was his second in less than a year.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The autopsy on Kelly was completed Saturday
"Addiction problems" plagued Kelly "these past few years," agent says
Kelly died late Wednesday in a Los Angeles area treatment facility
Kelly played Laurie Forman on "That '70s Show" Los Angeles (CNN) -- Why actress Lisa Robin Kelly died in an addiction rehab center last week will not be known for another two months, a coroner's office spokeswoman said Sunday.
The autopsy on Kelly, one of the stars of TV's "That '70s Show," was completed Saturday, but it will be another eight to 10 weeks before toxicology results are back from the lab, according to Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Cheryl MacWillie.
"Lisa had voluntarily checked herself into a treatment facility early this week where she was battling the addiction problems that have plagued her these past few years," agent Craig Wyckoff told CNN on Thursday. "I spoke to her on Monday and she was hopeful and confident, looking forward to putting this part of her life behind her."
She died late Wednesday in a Los Angeles area treatment facility, he said.
Kelly, 43, played Laurie Forman -- older sister of Eric Forman, played by actor Topher Grace -- on "That '70s Show," which ran from 1998 to 2006.

Market Q&A
Each business evening with analysts around the region
Everybody had only one question as they watched John Howard's motorcade slide up the long driveway to the Auckland Museum - what will the Australian prime minister be wearing? The answer: a merino wool long-sleeved polo shirt with a lined padded yachting jacket. The whole ensemble was in New Zealand's team color, black. On the jacket, an embroidered fern leaf (another national symbol) in white. When the Australian prime minister stepped into the museum lobby to meet New Zealand counterpart Jenny Shipley, he may have looked a little embarrassed to be photographed wearing the All-Black attire, lest he be branded a traitor to his home sports teams. Bill Clinton arrived holding his jacket over his shoulder, looking relaxed and unperturbed by the rain and wind.
The 21 leaders gathered in the museum for their "retreat," an informal closed-door meeting just among themselves, though advisers are not far away. They have two sessions - one in the morning, another after lunch. This is the culmination of the APEC week and, indeed, of the organization's calendar. The leaders discuss various issues put to them by their officials and ministers, particularly any matters that remain to be resolved. And they put the final touches on the declaration or communiqué that is issued at the end of the day. Finally, the group poses with arms linked for the usual official photograph.
At 4 p.m., they emerged from their conclave. Shipley, as host, read a summary of the declaration, dubbed "The Auckland Challenge." The PM, the only woman among the pack, sported a black turtle neck and a silver fern brooch, instead of the embroidered patch. "Our meeting marks ten years of unprecedented cooperation throughout APEC," she said. "This year we have sought to create a strong platform for our second decade."
Key Points of the Declaration
 Leaders are committed to continuing economic reforms and are aware of the risks to the region's recovery.  APEC renews its commitment to the Bogor goals of free and open trade and investment by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing ones. Members will make their "individual action plans," or blueprints for meeting the Bogor target, "more specific, transparent, and comprehensive." Ministers will give priority to improving trade facilitation and eliminating non-tariff impediments to trade.
 The group will work to strengthen its markets and its financial and banking sectors. It is launching an initiative to develop a set of banking standards which may be adopted APEC-wide.
 APEC is committed to the launch of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The declaration does not specify exactly when a new round should begin, though it is expected to be launched at the World Trade Organization's ministerial conference in Seattle in late November. This new round should be comprehensive and be wound up within three years "as a single package." APEC leaders support the abolition of agricultural export subsidies and the accession to the WTO of those APEC economies that are not yet members of the global trade body (Russia, Vietnam, China and Taiwan).
 The leaders agreed to recommendations from the APEC Business Advisory Council to further liberalize air services in the Pacific Rim.
 APEC must do more to win the trust of citizens. "We challenge our economies to strengthen our markets," said Shipley. "We challenge the world to move to freer trade. And we challenge ourselves as leaders to bring our people with us to broaden support for the work of APEC." Concluded the PM: "That is the Auckland challenge. We accept that challenge today."
East Timor Update
With the Indonesian decision late Sept. 12 to allow a U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor, leaders concentrated on APEC's official economic agenda and did not discuss the troubled province. With the diplomatic focus shifting to New York - Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is due at the U.N. headquarters - the issue now is the composition of the force. Indonesia would prefer an Asian-led contingent, but that wish may not be feasible. Before leaving his hotel for the leaders' retreat, Clinton stressed that Jakarta could not dictate any conditions to the U.N. The 5,000-7,000-strong multinational force is likely to be led by Australia, with the U.S. offering only a few hundred troops to provide only logistical support.
