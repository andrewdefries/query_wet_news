Sony goes hunting for big gameStory Highlights Sony releases PlayStation 3 game Afrika, simulating a photographer on safari Contemplative nature games are nothing new to successful competitor Nintendo Sony lags behind Nintendo in console sales, hopes game will revive PlayStation 3Next Article in Technology » By Cherise Fong For CNN	(CNN) -- When the name of the game is escape, one gamer's boredom is another gamer's boon. Sony PlayStation 3 game Afrika's stunning graphics are virtually photo-realistic. On August 28, Sony released for PlayStation 3 in Japan its long-announced, shrouded-in-secret game "Afrika," in which a single player assumes the role of a National Geographic photographer on an African safari to shoot wild animals in the grassland. Each of the player's photos is then judged on angle, target, distance and technique, and the photographer is rewarded in "cash," which can be used to upgrade his or her camera to models based on Sony's latest Alpha-branded single-lens-reflex cameras and lenses. The game's graphics are effectively stunning, while sound effects include hooves treading lightly on the savanna, as giraffes and antelope walk slowly away once you've snapped that Sony moment. "Sony is pushing the game's art style in a much more photo-realistic direction, which is a departure from most video games," says Ricardo Torres, editor in chief of GameSpot. "Rather than create a stylized, fanciful world, Sony's Japanese development studio has pushed to create graphics that match the real world." If this exotic, close-up-wildlife simulation is fascinating to some, others find it lacking in that little something. "The game looks excellent, the animals look smart, throw in some guns and let's have some fun," comments CanadianCow on the Gaming Today Web site. Although players may encounter the occasional charging hippo, Afrika's human characters never die, and the emphasis is always on getting the best shot of the animals. But what may be new to Sony is hardly new to the rest of the gaming world, let alone to current industry leader Nintendo. Just over the past few years, the Japanese gamemaker has conquered a new generation of fans both young and old with innovative applications and its trademark Wii wand. Nintendo's own simulation games may offer comparatively lesser graphics, but they boast arguably better play. Don't Miss The future of gaming is all in the mind
Special: Digital Biz
Released in April 2008, Wild Earth: African Safari allows up to three players to not only pursue photo-reporting missions but to "play from the animal's perspective" by flapping and thrusting their Wii remote. Just a few featured creatures include cheetah, crocodile, ostrich, frog, vulture, meerkat, tortoise, bat, warthog, wildebeest and hyrax. And for the Jacques Cousteau in everyone, Nintendo's Endless Ocean lets Wii divers leisurely explore the pristine waters of a fictional tropical island. With no time limit, point system or possibility of failure, the game even doubles as a screensaver if the remote is left untouched. Both Sony and Nintendo offer their own interactive fish tanks for more domesticated aquatic contemplation. Sony's Aquatopia, released in November 2007, was the first in a series of "interactive art" titles for the PlayStation Eye, which captures players' body movements. Nintendo's Wii-controlled My Aquarium, released less than a year later, not only lets you share or trade fish with friends via Wi-Fi, it also comes in a Fantasy edition that lets you "unlock" new fish -- as well as sharks, whales, dolphins and seals -- just as long as you don't mix predator and prey. "Games that feature observation as a core component of their game play can be seen as more accessible to individuals who don't play games all the time," remarks Torres. "Whereas seasoned game players will have no problem adjusting to more passive game play, you don't see that crossover the other way around." Nintendo niche James Whittle, video-games columnist for Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, agrees: "It seems Sony is going after the green nature-loving crowd and gamers who like slower-paced games and animal-simulation games like Nintendo's dog and cat pet-caring sims, which pretty much created this whole new niche market." The extremes of the gaming genres recall the classic contrast between Myst and Doom some 15 years ago. On one side of the spectrum, the misty island hiding secrets to be unlocked and alcoves to be explored; on the other end, the subjective view of the single-handed gun shooting to kill everything in sight for instant, unapologetic gratification. While mainstream media traditionally milks the latter's action-thrilling appeal, the former have always had their own loyal following. Even Pokemon Snap, released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, was based on offering players a maximum of photo opportunities of Pikachu and friends. "Video games started off as non-violent, and then later on the violent aspects came along," observes Whittle. "Nobody reads news reports about the wonderful and pleasant gaming aspects of Hello Kitty Island Adventure or Barbie's Beach Vacation," said Whittle. And while Sony may think it's onto something new and trendy in the name of very good graphics -- it hopes to sell at least 100,000 copies of Afrika -- Whittle is more prone to call it game over for the PlayStation 3. "The PS3 currently lacks the potential to draw in new buyers," he says. "They are not putting out enough games for the console. Over the last summer they had a couple of months where only one or no games were released. With so many kids off for the summer they should have been like their competitors, coming out with a few games a week." For many PlayStation 3 owners, at least in Hong Kong, the console is little more than a Blu-ray DVD player -- nonetheless, one clear advantage it has over its gaming competitors. View gallery of game consoles » But that's far from enough to help Sony's console sales catch up to Nintendo, who has sold 29.6 million Wiis worldwide in the past two years -- twice the number of PS3s -- while Microsoft has sold over 20 million Xbox 360s to date. Torres, however, is more optimistic about PS3 software: "Sony's upcoming 2008 titles span a wide range of genres that have a broader appeal. Casual titles like Buzz and Singstar skew towards a broad audience, Resistance 2 is more for seasoned players, and unique new titles like Littlebigplanet have the potential to appeal to both seasoned and casual players." Meanwhile, in terms of inspiring independent publishers to develop more challenging games that take full advantage of PlayStation 3's technological capabilities, only time will tell whether or not Afrika was the game that made the difference.

J.K. Rowling almost killed off Ron Weasley By Darren Franich, EW.com
updated 10:51 AM EDT, Tue November 1, 2011
J.K. Rowling doesn't specify in what context she was picturing Ron's death.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"I did seriously consider killing Ron," Rowling said
It's easy to imagine that he might have bit the dust relatively early
How much freakier the latter Potters would have felt without good ol' Ron around
(EW.com) -- "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" features one of the more soul-destroying death orgies in Fantasy-lit history, with a whole cavalcade of Potter supporting players winding up as casualties in the climactic wizard battle.
The series never shrank from death -- Books 4 through 6 each end with a major character dying, and the whole saga begins with Harry as a newly orphaned baby. But in a new special feature on the "Deathly Hallows 2" DVD, author J. K. Rowling notes that she'd planned one fatality that would have probably scarred a generation of young readers.
As reported by the Guardian, Rowling says, "I did seriously consider killing Ron." Apparently, she briefly thought about killing off Harry's red-headed sidekick around the middle of the series, when she "wasn't in a very happy place."
It's an interesting piece of what-might-have-been trivia. In some ways, it reminds me a little bit of the mythic notion that Han Solo was supposed to die in Return of the Jedi -- an idea which was supported by original Star Wars producer Gary Kurtz and Harrison Ford. Kurtz told the Hollywood Reporter that Solo lived because George Lucas didn't want to kill off any of his main characters. It's hard to accuse Rowling of any such anxiety, given the "Deathly Hallows" bloodbath.
Still, it's fun to speculate on how such a major change would have altered the book series. Rowling doesn't specify in what context she was picturing Ron's death, but it's easy to imagine that he might have bit the dust relatively early. Lots of people were shocked when Rowling killed off Cedric Diggory in "Goblet of Fire," but Diggory was a minor character who, in hindsight, was always kind of a handsome readymade corpse -- think of how much freakier the latter Potters would have felt without good ol' Ron around to relieve the tension.
Conversely, imagine if Ron had sacrificed himself in Deathly Hallows' climax. It certainly would have changed the tone of the ending, which was a pretty upbeat Happily Ever After, all considering.

Our favorite 'Firefly' moments, 10 years later
By Henry Hanks, CNN
updated 9:02 AM EST, Mon November 12, 2012
A decade after its debut, fans of the short-lived sci-fi series "Firefly" continue to talk about it online and quote the show. Memorable moments from the series have gone viral, years later. Seizing on that excitement, the Science Channel is airing a marathon and 10th anniversary special, "Browncoats Unite" on Sunday. Here are some of our favorite quotes.
Kaylee's (Jewel Staite) exclamation of "Everything's shiny, Captain. Not to fret," followed by Jayne's (Adam Baldwin) "Shiny. Let's be bad guys," in the feature film "Serenity," led to this one word being possibly one of the most-quoted lines by sci-fi fans.
This "Serenity" quote, along with the series' "I swear by my pretty floral bonnet I will end you," sum up Mal in a nutshell.
Mal (Nathan Fillion) declared in the pilot episode, "We have done the impossible, and that makes us mighty." Fans took it on as a great motivational quote and "Done the Impossible" was the name of a documentary about "Firefly" fandom. "Firefly" fans are often heard referring to members of the cast, crew and fellow fans who do good as "big damn heroes." This came from an episode in which Mal and Zoe (Gina Torres) rescue Simon (Sean Maher) and River (Summer Glau) by saying, "Appears we got here just in the nick of time. What does that make us?" "Big damn heroes, sir." "Ain't we just?"
Jayne said this several times an episode, in response to the fact that the "companion," Inara (Morena Baccarin), took on a female client. Married crew members Wash (Alan Tudyk) and Zoe later adapted the phrase for themselves. It was a particularly good day for Kaylee (she got to wear a nice dress, after all) so her response to Mal in one episode has definitely made "Captain Tight Pants" an oft-quoted line.

U.S. Supreme Court looks at whether to take up same-sex marriage By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer
updated 1:45 PM EST, Thu November 29, 2012
Utah state Sen. Jim Dabakis, left, and Stephen Justesen acknowledge the crowd after being married in Salt Lake City on Friday, December 20. A federal judge struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, saying it conflicted with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Many Utah counties began issuing marriage licenses before the state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court temporarily blocked enforcement of the lower court ruling until the constitutional questions are fully resolved.
Plaintiffs Laurie Wood, left, and Kody Partridge, center, and their attorney Peggy Tomsic leave a federal courthouse in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, December 4, where a judge heard arguments challenging Utah's same-sex marriage ban.
Hawaiian Gov. Neil Abercrombie, left, and former Sen. Avery Chumley hold up a copy of the Star Advertiser after Abercrombie signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in Hawaii on Wednesday, November 13, in Honolulu. Hawaii's same-sex marriage debate began in 1990 when two women applied for a marriage license, leading to a court battle and a 1993 state Supreme Court decision that said their rights to equal protection were violated by not letting them marry. Now the state is positioning itself for an increase in tourism as visitors arrive to take advantage of the new law, which took effect December 2. Cory Booker, then-Newark mayor, officiates a wedding ceremony for Joseph Panessidi and Orville Bell at City Hall early Monday, October 21, 2013. The New Jersey Supreme Court denied the state's request to prevent same-sex marriages temporarily, clearing the way for same-sex couples to marry in the state on October 21.
A couple celebrate at San Francisco City Hall upon hearing about the U.S. Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage on June 26, 2013. The high court cleared the way for same-sex couples in California to resume marrying after dismissing an appeal on Proposition 8 on jurisdictional grounds. In another ruling June 26, the justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to married same-sex couples.
In the other June 26 ruling, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Jamous Lizotte, right, and Steven Jones pose for photos while waiting for a marriage license in Portland, Maine, in December 2012.
Rhode Island state Sen. Donna Nesselbush, right, embraces a supporter after the Marriage Equality Act gets signed into law at the statehouse in Providence on May 2, 2013.
At the state Capitol in St. Paul on May 14, 2013, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton signs a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
Delaware Gov. Jack Markell holds up legislation on May 7, 2013, allowing same-sex couples to wed.
Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire celebrates after signing marriage equality legislation into law earlier in 2013. Voters there approved same-sex marriage on Election Day 2012.
Olin Burkhart, left, and Carl Burkhart kiss on the steps of the New Hampshire Capitol in Concord in January 2010 as the state's law allowing same-sex marriage goes into effect.
In 2010, television reporter Roby Chavez, right, shares a moment with gay rights activist Frank Kameny during Chavez and Chris Roe's wedding ceremony in the nation's capital.
Phyllis Siegel, 76, kisses her wife, Connie Kopelov, 84, after exchanging vows at the Manhattan City Clerk's office in 2011.
Michael Miller, left, and Ross Zachs marry on the West Hartford Town Hall steps after same-sex marriages became legal in Connecticut in 2008.
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, center, shakes hands with Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller after signing a same-sex marriage bill. The law was challenged, but voters approved marriage equality in a November 2012 referendum.
Lara Ramsey, left, and her partner of eight years, Jane Lohmann, play with their 7-month-old son, Wyatt Ramsey-Lohmann. The two wed in 2004 after Massachusetts approved same-sex marriage.
Beth Robinson of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force was among those who fought for marriage equality in Vermont in 2009.
Amy Klein-Matheny, left, and her wife, Jennifer, were married in 2009 in Iowa after same-sex couples were allowed to marry there after a court ruling.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Edith "Edie" Windsor lost her spouse in 2009 and got a tax bill that triggered legal fight
Justices meet Friday to decide if they will accept any of 10 pending marriage-related appeals
Some states have approved same-sex marriage; while others have banned it
The 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly
(CNN) -- Edith "Edie" Windsor lost her spouse in 2009, her grief compounded by an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay.
Because her decades-long partner was also a woman, the federal government in legal terms did not recognize the same-sex marriage, even though their home state of New York did.
"I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes," Windsor, 83, told CNN. "And it was deeply upsetting."
That fundamental unfairness as Windsor and her supporters see it, is at the center of legal fight now awaiting action at the U.S. Supreme Court.
iReporter Alex Rhinehart, center, and Tony O'Brian held their wedding ceremony in a San Francisco park in May 2011, though same-sex marriage was not legal in California at the time. The pair led their guests to the summit of a cliff for the ceremony in lieu of a traditional wedding march -- using the spot to represent their union: "a place so old and solid with such a promising view of the horizon beyond."
Alex and Tony wanted to keep their wedding simple and inexpensive: They made picnic lunches for guests and painted wooden dolls in their likeness for cake toppers.
The son of iReporter Angela Cloninger (right) walked her down the aisle to meet her partner, Barbara, in a wedding ceremony almost three years ago in Asheboro, North Carolina. A few days later, they legally married on courthouse grounds in Washington, D.C. North Carolina voters recently amended the state constitution to make same-sex marriage illegal.
iReporter Valezka Taylor decided to adopt a sailor theme so her mate, Sami, could wear her Coast Guard uniform. They were inspired to get married after "don't ask, don't tell" was repealed, but it took an extra nudge from her teenage daughter to set the wheels in motion. Valezka's daughter and her aunt were bridesmaids; they wore red and blue to match the sailor theme.
Sami, a boat mechanic in the U.S. Coast Guard, wore her dress blues for their April ceremony in front of the Constitutional Garden in Washington.
Ra'Shawn (right) and Kelvin Barlow-Flournoy combined their last names after marrying last year at Howard University School of Divinity in Washington. They married during a Sunday service that was streamed online and viewed by more than 400 people. Both are pastors, and Ra'Shawn is an HIV prevention coordinator for a church in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Ra'Shawn and Kelvin have worked with Human Rights Campaign to spread the word that people of faith can be advocates for gay and lesbian rights. They married during a trip to the Capitol as part of HRC's Clergy Call.
Kevin Haubrick, left, met his husband Mike online in 2009. It quickly became clear to Mike that Kevin was "the one" when he saw Kevin interact with his daughter, Elizabeth. The pair wed at a bed and breakfast in Arlington, Vermont, the following year in the presence of friends who helped Kevin create his online profile.
After the ceremony, they had dinner and cake complete with a customized wedding topper. The following month, Mike and Kevin held a wedding reception in their home city of San Antonio for friends and family.
Craig Woodward (left) proposed to Scott Norton by the ocean at Laguna Beach, California, and surprised him by having all his family and friends there to share it.
Scott and Craig were married in California in front of 100 friends and family. The minister did a reading of Dr. Seuss and the wedding party members boogied down the aisle, each to a personalized song. Here, their friend Chris Williams catwalks down the aisle to "I'm Every Woman" by Whitney Houston.

DOMA would deny soldier's wife benefits Victory for lesbian, years after her longtime partner's death
The justices will meet privately Friday for a closed-door conference to decide if they will accept any of 10 pending appeals, essentially over whether a fundamental constitutional right for gays and lesbians to marry exists.
If they agree to hear the issue, oral arguments would be likely be held in March with a ruling by late June.
The political, social, and legal stakes of this long-simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention, a contentious encore to their summer ruling upholding the massive health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama.
Earlier this month, voters in Maryland, Washington, and Maine approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment.
Is there a national consensus?
As more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an "equal protection" right of marriage to homosexuals.
Three separate issues confront the justices, who are likely to only accept only one for review in coming months. These include federal benefits, state benefits and state referendums.
The Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, is a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples, such as Windsor and her late partner Thea Spyer.
Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act
This appeal from Arizona asks whether a state that prohibits same-sex marriage may also deny same-sex couples marital benefits if one of the partners is a state employee, when other state workers in opposite-sex marriages enjoy government benefits.
On referendums, the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex marriage was legal, but the 2008 voter-approved Proposition 8 abolished it. If the high court accepts this appeal, it would likely not decide whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, but only whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized.
"The justices are almost certainly going to take up the question of the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act," said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a top Washington attorney. "The real question is whether they'll step into California's Prop 8 and the ruling there that California discriminated unconstitutionally when it granted a right to same sex-marriage and then took it away. It's a tossup on whether they'll hear that case."
Who will represent U.S. in any court case
Complicating matters is just who will defend the DOMA law before the justices. Traditionally that role would fall to the Justice Department's Solicitor General office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said in May he supports same-sex marriages. The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend the federal law in court.
That left House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to step in after the Justice Department refused to participate. They have hired top Washington attorney Paul Clement-- himself a former solicitor general-- to make the arguments to keep the law in place, at least until lawmakers decide otherwise.
Clement said a congressionally mandated, uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical, since different states have different laws defining the limits of marriage.
"DOMA does not bar or invalidate any marriages but leaves states free to decide whether they will recognize same-sex marriage," Clement told the court in a legal brief. "Rather, DOMA merely reaffirmed and codified the traditional definition of marriage: what Congress itself has always meant and what courts and the executive branch have always understood it to mean -- in using those words: A traditional male-female couple."
The law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits.
Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law.
But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California's Prop 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it.
In February, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the measure unconstitutional.
Timeline: Same-sex marriage
Court could offer final word
By patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same-sex marriage over the past decade, the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on the tricky constitutional questions.
The split 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly-- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years, building political momentum and public confidence in the process.
Edie Windsor is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs involved in the current DOMA appeals before the high court. She and Spyer, a psychologist, had been a devoted couple in New York's Greenwich Village for more than 40 years, before marrying in Canada in 2007.
New York did not allow same-sex marriages to be performed in the state when Windsor and Spyer wed, but did recognize the out-of-state license. New York's legislature last year approved same-sex marriage.
Windsor, a retired computer systems programmer, wants the $363,053 in added estate taxes she was forced to pay the IRS. She said the federal government considers her relationship with Spyer as little more than "girlfriends," something she called an "incredible indignation."
"I would like to receive my money back. New York State accepted my marriage as a marriage," she told CNN. "And I believe, and the Justice Department and the president agree with me, that the DOMA law is unconstitutional. DOMA is cruel. It discriminates against us for absolutely no value to the country. And we'd like to see that defeated altogether. I'd like other people not to go through what I went through."

Wiki wars: The 10 most controversial Wikipedia pages
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 11:18 AM EDT, Wed July 24, 2013 | Filed under: Web
Oxford University researchers took a look at Wikipedia's most controversial pages, studying which ones saw the most instances where an editor changed something, then someone changed it back to its previous form. Here are their top 10.
The polarizing 43rd U.S. president topped the list. The busiest period of editing was in the days before Bush's 2004 re-election. It got so bad that Wikipedia froze Bush's page, as well as that of Democratic rival John Kerry.
Chaos on a page about anarchism? Who would have thought? Many changes on the page about the political philosophy -- which opposes the control of official government states -- add or clean up loaded language.
The prophet of Islam (CNN's style is "Mohammed") is no doubt targeted in some cases because of anti-Islamic sentiments. But a big number of the changes on the page come because of disputes about the dates of significant events in his life.
No, we didn't see a pro wrestling page making the list either. But with an ever-changing roster and the titles, descriptions and even names of its performers constantly changing, it makes sense that it would be among the site's most frequently tweaked pages.
Mainstream science is pretty much in lockstep over the reality of climate change. But a handful of vocal dissenters, and the political nature of the global-warming debate, keep its page in flux.
Circumcision has become a controversial medical procedure in some circles. Some Wiki editors have been removing positive information about it, while others delete negative reports.
Hey, it's a big country. On its expansive page -- which includes sections on history, population, government, demographics and more -- there are a lot of moving parts, as well as lots of things to disagree over.
There's the obvious controversy that comes from most religious discussions here, as well as frequent tweaking of terminology, abbreviations and other details.
It's pretty well documented that there are systemic differences on IQ tests among various racial and ethnic groups. And yes, there are opposing views among Wikipedia editors about the role genetic factors play in those differences.
Again, almost any religion produces strong differing views. On this page, it's usually references to the fine points of Christian doctrine that are tweaked, and retweaked, and tweaked again.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
George W. Bush tops list of most controversial English-language Wiki pages
Analysis looked at Wikipedia pages with most frequent changes
Politics and religions dominate the top 10
A pro wrestling page also made the list
(CNN) -- They've long been considered topics that aren't polite to discuss at the dinner table. As it turns out, politics and religion can get touchy on Wikipedia as well.
The two topics dominated a list of the most controversial pages on the crowdsourced Web encyclopedia.
Topping the English-language version of the list? Former President George W. Bush.
To determine the most controversial pages, researchers from Oxford University looked at their number of "reverts" -- instances in which an editor changes something on a page, only to have someone else come along and change it back to the previous wording.
Wikipedia asks for your cash
Alongside Bush, the political philosophy of anarchism made the list. So did global warming and the United States -- two topics that, while not exclusively political, certainly have political elements.
As for religion, Mohammed, Jesus and Christianity were all among the top 10.
Circumcision and "race and intelligence," both with obvious controversy attached, made the list, alongside a possibly more surprising page: a list of professional wrestlers on the roster of World Wrestling Entertainment.
The authors of the study, which will be part of an upcoming book, said that on a site as expansive and ambitious as Wikipedia, disagreements are bound to happen.
"While the common aim in the collaboration is clear, unavoidably differences in opinions and views occur, leading to controversies," they wrote. "Clearly, there is a positive role of the conflicts: if they can be resolved in a consensus, the resulting product will better reflect the state of the art than without fighting them out.
"However, there are examples, where no hope for a consensus seems in sight -- then the struggle strongly limits efficiency."
The guiding principle behind Wikipedia, which launched in 2001, is cooperation. The thinking is that with a team of volunteer editors spanning the globe, rough edges will eventually be smoothed out and good information will triumph over falsehoods and misinterpretations.
With more than 470 million unique visitors monthly, Wikipedia is one of the most-visited sites on the Web. It's written and edited collaboratively by Internet volunteers, most of them anonymous. According to its own pages, the site has more than 77,000 active contributors working on more than 22 million articles in 285 languages.
By default, any change that an editor makes on the site is published immediately, subject to cleaning up by editors who come afterward.
But disagreements, even among well-meaning editors, are bound to happen and, over the years, Wikipedia has adopted rules to deal with them.
On the English-language version, only registered users may create new articles. And certain controversial pages get "protection" -- either full protection, which means they can only be edited by administrators, or semi-protection, under which they can only be edited by logged-in users whose accounts have been verified.
When pages become home to "edit wars," as the entries for Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry did during the 2004 election, they may be given temporary protection by administrators.
On the English-language version of the site, sweeping issues such as religion dominated the most-disputed list. But the study's authors noted that with most other languages, more local or regional topics prevailed.
"The English Wikipedia, in particular, occupies a unique role," they wrote. "The language's status as a 'lingua franca' (a widely used working language) means that English Wikipedia ends up being edited by a broad community beyond simply (those) that have the language as a mother tongue."
In German, the page on Croatia was the most controversial, with Adolf Hitler, Scientology and Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner making the top 10. Socialist politician Segolene Royal topped the French list (followed, curiously, by UFOs) and "Gypsy crime" topped the Hungarian list.
In an interesting look at cultural interests, five of the 10 most disputed pages in Spanish were those of soccer teams -- Club America, Athletic Bilbao, Newell's Old Boys, FC Barcelona and Alianza Lima.
