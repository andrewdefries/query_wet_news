Rapes in Congo increase, aid group saysStory Highlights Aid group says rape reports increase as fighting intensified Group surveys girls under 17 at various refugee camps Violence in eastern Congo has displaced an estimated 250,000 people Next Article in World » (CNN) -- The number of girls being raped has increased sharply since fighting intensified in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a humanitarian group said Tuesday. A survey of children at refugee camps finds rapes of girls under age 17 are increasing. Also, the recent fighting between rebels and the Congo government has heightened the threat of children being recruited as soldiers, said World Vision. "A silent war has been waged against women and children," said Sue Mbaya, the humanitarian group's Africa advocacy director. "Women and girls in the hundreds have been targets of opportunistic and brutal rape, while children are also being targeted for recruitment or re-recruitment as child soldiers." World Vision said they surveyed children at six refugee camps in the country, finding that 120 girls under the age of 17 reported being raped in October. That's compared to five reported cases in April and June. Mbaya was scheduled to address the issue Tuesday during a report to the United Nations Security Council. The fighting, which began in August, prompted the U.N. Security Council to approve sending more than 3,000 troops in coming weeks to bolster the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force already there. A U.N. envoy has also been sent to Congo to conduct peace talks between the government and rebel leader Laurent Nkunda. Don't Miss Rebel leader wants to merge his troops with army

U.N. condemns atrocities
The spiraling violence in eastern Congo has displaced an estimated 250,000 people -- many of whom have fled to refugee camps. The fighting is spurred by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda. Nkunda has said his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.

Sky, BBC condemned for Gaza aid appeal rejectionStory Highlights Sky News said airing the appeal would compromise its reputation for fairness BBC refused to broadcast ad, saying it would compromise appearance of impartiality 112 MPs signed motion criticizing broadcasters, UK lawmaker said Demonstrations against BBC decision took place in England and Scotland Next Article in World » Read VIDEO LONDON, England (CNN) -- More than 100 British lawmakers have signed a motion criticizing the BBC and Sky News for refusing to show an emergency appeal for Gaza. Protesters hold a banner outside the entrance of BBC Broadcasting House in central London. British terrestrial broadcasters ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 televised the appeal, made by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) on Monday night. The BBC and Sky News defended their position by saying that airing the appeal would compromise their reputation for fairness and impartiality. However, Richard Burden, the Labour MP who tabled the early day motion, said 112 MPs had signed it by Monday evening, The British Press Association reported. The motion rejects the "unconvincing and incoherent" justifications given by the BBC and Sky. In quotes carried by PA, Burden said: "The fact that well over 100 MPs from different parties have signed this Commons motion shows the breadth of concern about the position which the BBC and Sky are taking. "The arguments that BBC managers have been putting forward in defense of their refusal to screen this appeal have shown themselves to be even more unconvincing and contradictory as time has gone on.

Aid worker: Let us take supplies into Gaza
"Viewers and listeners can see the difference between a humanitarian appeal and politics -- even if the BBC and Sky management cannot." That view was echoed by thousands of protesters at the weekend who demonstrated at BBC buildings across the UK. On Saturday, about 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London, while 50 people protested at its Scottish headquarters in Glasgow the following day. On Monday night, PA reported that about 15 students -- members of the School of Oriental and African Studies' branch of Stop the War Coalition -- occupied the reception area of a BBC building in central London and demanded to speak to a senior member of the corporation. Protesters outside the building waved a banner reading "Hands off Gaza" and decorated with blood-red handprints. They chanted: "BBC -- shame on you," PA said. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities. A spokesman for the umbrella group told CNN at the weekend that the DEC is "disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal. It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public." The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality. "That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject," he said. CNN has not been asked to screen the appeal.

Newark flight makes emergency landing in Poland
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 4:05 PM EDT, Wed November 2, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Warsaw's main airport will remain closed overnight
The passengers "stayed calm" during the emergency landing, the airline says
The plane was carrying 231 people from Newark to Warsaw
It landed on its belly after problems with its landing gear
(CNN) -- A Boeing 767 on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, made a dramatic emergency landing at Warsaw, Poland's Frederic Chopin International airport Tuesday after problems with its landing gear, an airport spokeswoman said.
All the passengers on the flight, from Newark Liberty International Airport to Warsaw, are safe and uninjured, she told CNN. Newark Liberty serves the greater New York area.
The LOT Polish Airlines flight, which had been due to land at 1:35 p.m. local time, circled above the airport for an hour before coming down in a belly landing at 2:40, she said.
"After noticing a central hydraulic system failure the standard procedure for emergency landings at Warsaw airport were implemented," LOT said in a statement, saying emergency crews were in place on the ground to assist.

Video footage from the scene showed the plane coming in to land without its wheels down and skidding along the tarmac to a halt. Emergency vehicles raced toward the aircraft and appeared to hose it down as passengers disembarked.
There were 231 people aboard the flight, 220 of them passengers and 11 crew, the airline said.
The passengers "stayed calm" during the emergency landing, and after reaching the terminal were cared for by support staff and psychologists, the airline said.
They are being allowed to go home after a medical examination and a brief police interview, it added.
Other travelers face significant disruption.
The airport will remain closed until at least 8 a.m. local time Wednesday because the damaged aircraft is blocking the runways, an airport spokesman told reporters.
LOT said all its flights scheduled to leave later Tuesday have been canceled. Incoming flights have been redirected to other airports in Poland, it said, and passengers will be brought from there to Warsaw.
The airport is Poland's busiest, handling almost half its air passenger traffic with about 100 scheduled flights a day, the airport's website says.
LOT, the Polish flag carrier and one of the world's oldest airlines, is currently offering special deals on flights from the New York area to Warsaw.
In 2010, it carried more than 4.5 million passengers, nearly three-quarters of whom were on international flights, its website says. The airline said it aims to offer quality of service and value for money.
CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.

Behind the scenes of Australia's political 'soap opera'
By Hilary Whiteman, CNN
updated 8:06 PM EST, Thu February 23, 2012
On Monday, members of Australia's Labor Party will be asked to choose between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Gillard seeking to end internal wrangling with vote on Monday
Foreign minister Rudd quit post unexpectedly on Wednesday
Rudd was PM before being ousted by Gillard in June 2010
Polls show Labor would lose an election if it was held right now
(CNN) -- In announcing his resignation as Foreign Minister Wednesday, Kevin Rudd referred to the "soap opera" underway in Australian politics.
He said he wanted no part of it, but continues to be a leading player in the drama unfolding in the corridors of Canberra, the home of Australia's Parliament House.
In an attempt to quash leadership speculation, Prime Minister Julia Gillard has scheduled a showdown for Monday morning to determine who has enough support to lead the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the country.
The Players
Julia Gillard was deputy Prime Minister before she ousted Rudd from the top job to become Prime Minister in June 2010.
Originally from Wales, the trained lawyer said she made the move because "I came to the view that the government was losing its way."

Gillard on becoming prime minister
Within months of becoming Prime Minister, Gillard fought a fierce election battle with the opposition Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott. The August 2010 vote produced Australia's first hung parliament since 1940.
After days of intense jockeying for the support of independent candidates and the Australian Greens, Gillard announced she had enough backing to form a minority government. She appointed Rudd to the role of Foreign Minister, the position from which he resigned while on a work trip to Washington in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
Kevin Rudd unseated Australia's second longest-serving Prime Minister, John Howard, in 2007 in a federal election that put the Labor Party in power for the first time since 1996.
Before the vote, he was Australia's most popular opposition leader ever, according to Nielsen opinion polls.
His popularity remained high after his election but dropped to a personal low of 41% in June 2010 after he delayed the introduction of an emissions trading scheme and announced a new tax on mining profits.
Gillard seized her chance and announced that she'd secured enough internal support to take over the Labor leadership.
"It's not normal in Australia that just because a politician's approval numbers drop they suddenly get dropped," said John Stirton, research director at market research company Nielsen Australia.
"There's got to be something more going on, and it's quite clear there was something more going on. He (Rudd) really alienated most of his colleagues."
Who was the more popular leader?
While Rudd was -- and arguably still is -- unpopular with his Labor colleagues, he remains much more popular with the Australian public than his rival Gillard, according to Nielsen opinion polls.
Stirton says voters consider him "credible, calm and on top of his brief, as someone with a sense of humor."
Earlier this month, most voters indicated that they preferred Rudd as Labor leader. "I guess that has been the tragedy of Kevin Rudd in a way, because he could have been prime minister for a very long time on those popularity numbers," Stirton said.

Gillard has never matched Rudd's popularity ratings, and her leadership has been undermined, Stirton said, by "unknown people in the Labor Party."
The ALP itself has seen its popularity tumble. In December, The Australian newspaper reported that "the period of the Rudd-Gillard Labor leaderships covers Labor's longest, deepest slump in popular support."
The latest battle
If early indications are anything to go by, it's going to be a brutal few days in Australian politics before Monday's vote.
Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan came out swinging in a statement that accused the former leader of undermining the government "at every turn."
Swan referred to Rudd's "dysfunctional decision making" and "deeply demeaning attitude" towards other people. In response, Rudd said he had been "shocked and disappointed by the tone and content of the intensely personal attacks."
Rudd's supporters have also gone on the attack. Federal Manufacturing Minister, Kim Carr, on Thursday accused the Gillard camp of mounting a "campaign of vilification" against Rudd, according to the ABC.
Who is likely to win Monday's ballot?
Under a banner simply titled "The numbers," The Australian is tracking which way Labor party members are leaning on its website.
At the time of writing, 65 were deemed to be in favor of Gillard, while 31 were supporting Rudd. Seven were thought to be undecided.
At issue is who party members believe has enough support to win a federal election next year. Both Gillard and Rudd say they are best placed to take on a strengthened opposition.
Stirton said it probably doesn't matter who wins Monday's leadership vote. If Australians cast their votes right now, polls indicate that opposition leader Abbott would become Australia's next prime minister.
"He would win an election but he's an unpopular leader leading a popular party," Stirton said."The government is losing rather than the opposition are winning, if you know what I mean."

Get serious about mental health care
By Aaron E. Carroll, Special to CNN
updated 11:37 AM EST, Tue December 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aaron Carrroll: We might be able to prevent tragedies if we did better job treating mental illness
Carroll says more than 10% of kids should have mental health care, but few get it
He says emergency rooms treat acute instances, but system ill-equipped for long-term treatment
At checkups, he asks parents if guns are in house, but recent laws have tried to stop even this
Editor's note: Aaron E. Carroll is an associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the director of the university's Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research. He blogs about health policy at The Incidental Economist and tweets at @aaronecarroll.
(CNN) -- In the wake of last week's tragedy in Newtown, I have been asked a million questions about gun control. I've seen pictures of the weapon the killer used. I've heard stories about the number of bullets in the clip and the number of guns in his mother's home. I've even heard politicians argue that school officials should be armed with semiautomatic weapons.
I've also heard about mental health.
Aaron E. Carroll
We should be careful not to blame the mentally ill for all crimes. But we should also be prepared to accept that we might be able to prevent some tragedies if we did a better job of caring for them.
I've seen mental health illness in children, and our system is ill-equipped to handle it. I've seen families struggle with it. One of my greatest frustrations with clinical practice is that there are far too many times when I lack the tools necessary to care for children who need help. It's relatively easy to cure an infection or an acute physical ailment. It's so much harder to take a mental health issue. There are rarely pills that will do the job. Even when they are, they almost never work perfectly to eradicate the problem.
Opinion: On gun control, two places to start

Studies show that more than 10% of children in the United States might benefit from some sort of mental health treatment. Most don't get it. We often don't have the research to tell us how best to care for these problems. Even when we do, we often lack the capacity. There is a shortage of resources and services available to serve children. Furthermore, even when those resources exist, a lack of coordination often prevents they're being used effectively.
It doesn't help that the upcoming fiscal cliff will likely cut National Institutes of Health research funding by $2.4 billion. That would mean 2,300 fewer grants in the coming year, which represents about 25% of grants that might otherwise be offered. It doesn't help that we keep talking about cuts to services such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which cover the health care for about one in every three children in the United States.
Gupta: Mental illness for 1 in 5 kids
Community coping with shooting tragedy
How do we stop the violence?
If a child is actively suicidal or homicidal, an emergency room can spring into action and admit him or her for inpatient care. But that's often all inpatient care will do. Once a child is no longer actively threatening harm to himself or others, he or she will be released. That's what the hospital system does. It cares for the acute problem, leaving the long term, and often much harder, work to a system ill-equipped to handle it.
Opinion: Mourn ... and take action on guns
It's natural to try and blame poor parenting when kids don't turn out as well as we'd hope. And, certainly, in many instances such parenting can lead to a misbehaving child, or even a child we don't necessarily like. But mental illness really does exist, and a lot of it can't be cured by good parenting and isn't caused by bad parenting. We don't have a good system for dealing with it.
I want to stress that I don't think that all violence is associated with mental illness. In fact, it's quite the opposite. But the problems with guns and injuries go so far beyond school shootings, and a lot of that is amenable to a more focused health care system.
Opinion: Predicting mass killings impossible
One of the things I do as a pediatrician is "anticipatory guidance." We ask questions about issues that have not yet occurred but might occur in the future. A lot of anticipatory guidance focuses on injury prevention. We might ask about bike helmets, or swimming, or fire alarms in the house. I even ask about guns in the home.
I don't ask this question because I'm eager to lecture patients or parents on the morality of owning guns, or the rights of individuals under the Second Amendment. I'm asking because I'm trying to prevent injury or death. The No. 3 killer of children age 10-14 is suicide; the fourth is homicide. The No. 2 killer of children age 15-19 is homicide; No. 3 is suicide.
Opinion: In school shootings, patterns and warning signs
I have been trained to ask parents if they have a gun in the home. If they do, I ask how it's stored. I strongly recommend that they keep it unloaded, locked up, and that they store the bullets separately. I do this because guns are part of almost 85% of homicides and more than 45% of suicides in kids 5 to 19 years old. This doesn't even account for injuries not resulting in death.
Yet recent laws have attempted to stop pediatricians from doing even this.
I don't know what the best outcome is from a tragedy like this. I imagine much of the focus will be on banning the weapon used or on limiting the number of bullets that could be fired without reloading. I think that's somewhat missing the point. The vast majority of injuries or deaths due to guns are carried out on a small scale.
While what happened in Newtown is a horrific occurrence, it represents the exception, not the norm, with respect to gun violence in the United States. While I welcome the opportunity for us to address the problem, I hope we focus on how we might best help all our children, not just those who make the national news.

Some immigration detainees back in custody weeks after surprise release
From Gustavo Valdes, CNN
updated 4:12 PM EDT, Fri March 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
More than two dozen detainees who were released are back behind bars, ICE says
ICE: They were detained again after new violations or the discovery of additional info
Authorities have said the controversial release of more than 2,000 detainees will cut costs
Critics have said criminals are being let loose, putting Americans at risk
Ridgeland, South Carolina (CNN) -- After months in an immigration detention facility, Hector Adame was so surprised when guards said he could go that he didn't believe them.
"They had to shout (the news) at him so he would leave," his wife, Victorina, said this week.

Feds release hundreds of detainees
The family soon learned that Adame -- who had first been arrested on a drunk driving charge -- was one of more than 2,000 immigration detainees federal authorities released last month in a controversial move that officials said would cut costs as forced budget cuts loomed.
But the construction worker's joy at being released was short-lived. Now, the undocumented immigrant is back behind bars. So are more than two dozen others, according to federal officials.
"The 28 individuals were brought back into ICE custody after either violating the terms of their supervision or after the agency discovered information not available during an initial review of their case," U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said in a written statement. "ICE will continue to review the terms of the release for the individuals as part of its routine practice and will reconsider conditions as necessary."
Adame was detained again after an arrest for driving without a license, his wife says, adding that she thinks authorities targeted him because they wanted to send him back to the detention facility.
"They were waiting for him," Victorina Adame says.
Debate over the decision to release detainees resurged this week at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, where some lawmakers accused the country's top immigration official of releasing detainees for political reasons.
"This release is a recipe for disaster that is irresponsible and unjustified," said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who chairs the committee. "Ultimately, these nonsensical actions demonstrate the inability and lack of desire on behalf of the administration to enforce the law even against illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes."
ICE officials have said the move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take the $85 billion in forced government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration, into account.
And they stressed that detainees released were non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories.
This week, ICE Director John Morton maintained that the measure was necessary to cut costs.
"The agency is asked to do far more than Congress could appropriate or could rationally appropriate to the agency. We are in a situation where there are 11 million people on average who are here unlawfully. The agency has resources to remove about 400,000 a year, which is less than 4% and it is why at the end of the day, I think, bipartisan efforts to come to some level of comprehensive immigration reform is the thoughtful way out," he said this week. "The agency is never going to be able to detain and remove everybody as a matter of budget nor does it make sense as a matter of policy."
Morton said the detainees that were released were not dangerous, and that he had to find some way to make ends meet.
"I did not want to rob Peter to pay Paul," he said. "My view is that we need to maintain the operations of the agency."
Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, criticized that explanation.
"Now, I've counted six times you have said you didn't want to rob Peter to pay Paul," Gowdy said. "I don't want Peter or Paul to rob one of our fellow citizens because you guessed wrong on who to release."
Meanwhile, Victorina Adame says she and her five children are left looking at pictures of her husband in their South Carolina home, wondering when they'll see him again and whether he'll be deported to Mexico.

Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader is arrested in Egypt
By Reza Sayah. Hamdi Alkhshali and Joe Sterling, CNN updated 7:08 AM EDT, Tue August 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mohamed Badie is arrested at an apartment in the Nasr City section of Cairo
25 soldiers die in an attack in the Sinai Peninsula; 3-day mourning period declared
At least 37 Muslim Brotherhood prisoners reportedly killed in jailbreak attempt Former President Hosni Mubarak is acquitted in one of many cases against him
Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian security forces arrested Mohamed Badie, the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader, at a residential apartment in Cairo on Tuesday, state-run Nile TV reported.
He was arrested in the Nasr City section of the capital without any resistance, Nile TV said, citing Gen. Abdel Fattah Othman, an Interior Ministry spokesman.
Badie, whose title is supreme guide, is accused of inciting violence, according to Nile TV. The Brotherhood picked a Badie deputy to temporarily replace him, its political wing said Tuesday. He is Mahmoud Ezzat.
Badie's detention came one day after 25 soldiers were killed in a Sinai ambush and onetime ruler Hosni Mubarak won acquittal on a corruption charge.
Protesters and Egyptian riot police clash in Cairo on January 17, as the country awaits the results of a constitutional referendum. On January 18, the electoral commission announced the constitution had overwhelmingly been approved.

On December 25, 2013, The Egyptian interim government declared the Mohammed Morsy-led Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The action was taken in response to a police station bombing in Mansoura, which the government has stated was the responsibility of the Brotherhood, despite denials from the group itself. Cairo University's students backing ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsy flash the four-finger sign during a demonstration against July's military "coup " in Tahrir square on December 1, 2013.

Wreckage and debris litter the area around the Al-Fateh mosque in Cairo, where hundreds of Islamist protesters had barricaded themselves on Saturday, August 17, 2013.

Egypt: The final days of an activist
Egyptian FM: There are bumps on the road
Suspected militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades struck two buses carrying security forces and killed the soldiers in the city of Rafah, on the border between Egypt and Gaza, Nile TV reported.
Interim President Adly Mansour declared three days of national mourning following the attack, Nile TV said.
The Sinai Peninsula is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before Egypt's latest round of turmoil. In May, for example, seven Egyptian solders were kidnapped and held for six days there, a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said.
Activist: U.S. aid used against Egyptians
But the attack adds to the persistent tension across the country since the military ousted democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy in a coup.
Over the past week, about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed.
Deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo on Wednesday and violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations Friday.
Billions in aid on the line: What will the U.S. do about Egypt?
On Sunday, at least 37 jailed members of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement, were reportedly killed in what the Interior Ministry called an attempted jailbreak.
Egypt's state-run EGYNews agency reported that the prisoners died from tear-gas suffocation and from trampling over each other, and Egypt's Prosecutor General Office ordered the arrest Monday of two police officers for their involvement in the incident. The prosecutor general also ordered that three police officers hospitalized for injuries sustained in the incident be held while the investigation continues.
As for the Sinai ambush, the Brotherhood condemned the attack on Egyptian soldiers.
"Our peaceful protests (are) stronger than any weapon, and we don't accept any violence," said Murad Mohamad Ali, media adviser to the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
Morsy supporters, many of whom are members of the Muslim Brotherhood, and those aligned with the military-backed interim government blame each other for stoking the violence.
Morsy has been in detention since his overthrow. Egyptian prosecutors have extended the detention for 15 days, pending investigations.
Prosecutors have charged him with participating in the detention, torture, murder and attempted murder of Egyptian citizens; broadcasting false news to influence judicial authorities in their inquiries; and inciting thugs to use force and terrorize citizens.
Questions about aid
The crackdown also spurred a call from a leading U.S. senator, John McCain, to cut off its $1.3 billion in aid to Egypt. He said the United States has failed to follow its own rule requiring suspending aid to states overtaken by a military coup -- though the United States has not officially described the recent regime change in Egypt as a coup.
"We have no credibility. We do have influence, but when you don't use that influence, then you do not have that influence," McCain said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."
U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said President Obama noted that "every aspect" of the U.S.-Egypt relationship is under review.
U.S.-Egypt relations: 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't'
He said the U.S. message to Egyptian officials has been consistent: The interim government should "get back to an inclusive approach to reconciliation in Egypt.
Will the regime get the message? The U.S. ability to influence events in Egypt is "limited," Hagel said, but it's not "without influence."
Speaking at a Pentagon briefing with his counterpart from China, Hagel said the United States has a longstanding relationship with Egypt.
"We have interests clearly in the Middle East -- interests that include hopefully a development of some progress toward an Israeli -Palestinian settlement. So we continue to work with the Egyptian interim government as well as the Egyptian military," he said.
Hagel also said protection of Americans in Egypt is of the "highest priority."
But Saudi Arabia's foreign minister assured Egyptians that Arab nations will support Egypt if any international aid to the country is cut, the Saudi Press Agency reported Monday.
"The Arab and Islamic nation is rich when it comes to the support of its sons and its potentials and will not shy away from providing a helping hand to Egypt," Saud Al-Faisal said.
International response called weak, ineffective
The carnage has spurred a call from leading human rights group Amnesty International for a "full, impartial and effective investigation in the shocking loss of life."
"The interim government has already stained its human rights record -- first by breaking its promises to use nonlethal weapons to disperse pro-Morsi sit-ins and allow for the safe exit of wounded, and then by justifying their actions despite the tragic loss of lives," said Salil Shetty, secretary-general of Amnesty International, in a news release.
"The response of the international community has been weak and ineffective, even as everyone leaps to condemn the horrific loss of life. The international community must act decisively to send a message that no government can behave this way and retain any credibility."
Egyptian demonstrator: Why we are willing to die
The group documented a rise in civil strife since the July 3 coup and cited "a string of serious human rights abuses, culminating in the wholesale attack by the security forces" on pro-Morsy sit-ins last week.
"These abuses have included an alarming and unprecedented rise in sectarian violence against Coptic Christians across the country, "seemingly in retaliation for their support" for Morsy's ouster.
It cited abuses by pro-Morsy protesters "including beatings, torture and killings.
"In recent days, the scale of violence by some Morsy supporters have manifestly increased, as some attacked government buildings and police stations and personnel. Some protesters have also fired live ammunition on local residents," Amnesty said.
Mubarak in court
As the upheaval persists in Egypt, Mubarak's court cases grind on. In Cairo, a criminal court acquitted the former president in a corruption case, Egyptian state TV reported Monday.
The case stemmed from accusations of squandering public money allocated for renovating presidential palaces. He also faces at least one other outstanding corruption claim.
Separately, Mubarak is also facing a more serious accusation: that he was involved in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising.
A Cairo court on Saturday adjourned a retrial in that case to this coming Sunday.
Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011. He was convicted in 2012 in the deaths of numerous protesters, but was later granted a retrial.
After a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings. After appealing their convictions, they were granted a new trial early this year.
Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year. After months spent in a military hospital, a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in April.
The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial.

'Frozen' rises to No. 1 with $31.6 million
By Grady Smith, EW.com
updated 9:47 AM EST, Mon December 9, 2013
Disney's "Frozen" topped the box office on the weekend of December 7. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Frozen" managed to score a No. 1 spot at the box office
The Disney release has brought in $134.4 million after 12 days
Over the weekend, it earned $31.6 million
"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" was in second place
(EW.com) -- The first weekend in December is a notoriously weak one at the box office, and, true to form, most movies faced harsh declines this weekend after the record-breaking Thanksgiving frame.
But Disney's animated musical "Frozen" managed to score a not-so-severe 53 percent fall to $31.6 million this weekend, which sent it past "Catching Fire" and straight into the No. 1 spot on the chart.
"Frozen" has earned $134.3 million after 12 days in wide release, 39 percent more than 2010′s "Tangled," which had earned $96.6 million at the same point in its run. The film will match its $150 million budget by this time next week, and if it maintains its current pace (which seems likely given its "A+" CinemaScore), "Frozen" could be headed for a finish of about $280 million.
Movie review: 'Frozen'
The film's box office success is sending its soundtrack into the upper echelons of the music charts. The soundtrack debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard 200 last week, and it's risen all the way to No. 4 on the iTunes chart as well.
In second place, "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" fell 64 percent to $27 million, giving the blockbuster a $336.7 million domestic total after just 17 days. "Catching Fire" is still playing about $34 million ahead of "The Hunger Games" at the equivalent point in its run, but as evidenced by this weekend's drop, it's falling faster than that film, too. "Catching Fire" appears likely to finish with just about $400-410 million, matching "The Hunger Games'" $408 million total.
Worldwide, though, "Catching Fire" will be much, much bigger. It's already earned $673 million, and it will take just a few days for the film to blitz past "The Hunger Games'" $691 million global haul.
Movie review: 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'
Christian Bale's latest drama, "Out of the Furnace," didn't connect with moviegoers on its opening weekend. The bleak revenge movie, which also stars Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, and Zoë Saldana, pulled in a terrible $5.3 million from 2,021 theaters, yielding an anemic $2,523 location average. Even worse, audiences gave the film a rough "C+" CinemaScore, which will limit appeal in the weeks to come — especially given the upcoming release of Bale's other, more anticipated release, "American Hustle."
Two Disney films rounded out the Top five: "Thor: The Dark World" and "Delivery Man." "Thor" grossed $4.7 million, enough for a $193.6 million total (and $610 million worldwide). "Delivery Man" earned $3.8 million, and the Vince Vaughn comedy has now grossed $24.8 million against a $26 million budget.
Movie review: 'Out of the Furnace'
1. "Frozen" -- $31.6 million
2. "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" -- $27.0 million
3. "Out of the Furnace" -- $5.3 million
4. "Thor: The Dark World" -- $4.7 million
5. "Delivery Man" -- $3.8 million
In milestone news, Paramount's "Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa" passed the $100 million mark after pulling in $855,000 in its seventh weekend. Johnny Knoxville's prank film has now out-earned big budget spectacles like "Elysium," "White House Down," "The Lone Ranger" and "Jack the Giant Slayer," and, unlike those films, "Bad Grandpa" cost only $15 million to produce.
Further down the chart, the Coen Bros.' folky Oscar contender, "Inside Llewyn Davis," made a huge splash in limited release. The rootsy tale strummed up $402,000 from just four theaters, which resulted in a $100,500 per theater average — the second best of the entire year after "Blue Jasmine," which managed a $102,011 average from six theaters in July. CBS Films will begin expanding "Inside Llewyn Davis" in two weeks.
Also notable: In the wake of Nelson Mandela's death, the Idris Elba-starring biopic "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom" fell only 8 percent in its second weekend to $77,000 from four theaters. For reference, the films in the Top 20 fell by an average of 52.4 percent this weekend.
