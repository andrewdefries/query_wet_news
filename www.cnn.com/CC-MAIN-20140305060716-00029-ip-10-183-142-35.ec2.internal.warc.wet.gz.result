Doubts raised over 1999 murder convictionStory Highlights Hearings may lead to new trial for Tim Masters 12-year probe led to Masters' 1999 conviction Attorneys for Masters allege misconduct, including withholding evidence Questionable and coercive police tactics also alleged Next Article in U.S. » Read PHOTOS By Eliott C. McLaughlin CNN FORT COLLINS, Colorado (CNN) -- Tim Masters is no longer the slim, shaggy-haired 15-year-old he was when Peggy Hettrick was murdered, mutilated and dumped in a field near his home. Tim Masters is serving a life sentence for a murder conviction that is now being questioned.more photos » Goateed and bespectacled with a slightly receding hairline, Masters, now 36, sat quietly in court this week, occasionally flashing a boyish smile as his defense team worked to poke holes in his 1999 murder conviction. The conviction followed a 12-year investigation that Masters' defense attorneys say is flawed because it focused on building a case against a suspect instead of solving a murder. Attorneys David Wymore and Maria Liu want a judge to toss out Masters' murder conviction. In hearings that began in September, the attorneys are drawing out evidence they hope will persuade Judge Joseph Weatherby to give their client another chance at justice. They allege that police used deceptive investigative tactics and that prosecutors withheld key evidence that would have cast a kinder light on Masters, who is serving a life sentence. Wymore said he's been met with only "obfuscation, obstruction, stonewalling, stiff-arming" from police and prosecutors in his attempts to vindicate Masters. Fort Collins police Lt. James Broderick, who once led the investigation, would not discuss the specific allegations now at issue but he stands staunchly by his work in the case. However, he said, if a judge rules the evidence warrants another trial and a new jury frees Masters, he will accept it. "The last thing in the world I want is someone convicted of a crime they didn't do," he said. The Masters case is the talk of this college town of 137,000 nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Fort Collins, home to Colorado State University, prides itself on its quality of life. Money magazine last year called it the nation's best place to live. A prosecutor has been appointed from a nearby court district to look into the case. Two of the prosecutors in the original Masters trial are now local judges. In a four-page letter to the specially appointed prosecutors, Masters' lawyers said there is no justifiable reason to deny him a fresh trial. Wymore said his message is clear: "Give up."

Not so fast, said District Attorney Don Quick of the 17th Judicial District, whose office assigned the special prosecutors who are still collecting documents and providing them to the defense as they get them. The prosecutors are trying to determine what was and wasn't given to Masters' defense team, and what material, if any, should have been disclosed, Quick said. "I'm not throwing my hands up," he said, but if key evidence favoring the defense was withheld, "I think the original prosecutors need to take the stand and say why." Nathan Chambers, one of Masters' lawyers at the original trial, testified Wednesday that the prosecution gave him some information on other potential suspects in the slaying, but it "was weaker than circus lemonade." He testified that he never knew of an eye surgeon who also lived near the field where Hettrick's body was found. Dr. Richard Hammond, according to court testimony, killed himself in 1995 while awaiting trial on charges that he surreptitiously filmed the genital areas of women while they used his downstairs bathroom. At least one investigator, according to court documents, questioned whether Hammond might be involved in the Hettrick slaying, but the hunch apparently was never followed up, according to testimony. Not much is known about Peggy Hettrick or how she met her killer. What is known is that she died February 11, 1987, at the point of a blade at least 5 inches long. It was delivered with such force that it fractured a rib, according to court documents. The 37-year-old redhead's body was taken more than 100 feet into a field near the trailer Masters shared with his father, Clyde. Her arms were outstretched. Her underwear was pulled down and her shirt was lifted to reveal a neatly excised nipple, court documents show. Part of her genital area also had been sliced away. A passerby found Hettrick's body and called authorities. Police quickly learned that Masters -- taking his normal path through the field to meet the school bus -- paused a few feet from Hettrick's body and continued on without calling police, court documents show. That put Masters atop the Fort Collins Police Department's list of suspects. Police searched his home the next day. There, they found six survival knives displayed on a bureau in Masters' bedroom, each with a blade longer than 5 inches, according to court documents. Police also found numerous narratives and drawings that prosecutors later called "cruel and grotesque." Many of the sketches depicted murders. Police found more such material in Masters' locker at school and in his backpack. See the 15-year-old Masters and some of his sketches » On the kitchen counter at his father's house was the death certificate for his mother, also a redhead, who had died from health complications almost to the day four years earlier. Lacking physical evidence from the crime scene, police used the circumstantial evidence to paint a picture of an anti-social youngster so wracked by abandonment from the untimely death of his mother that he took sadistic revenge on a passing woman who resembled her. Internal police memos presented as evidence in the current hearing show the Fort Collins Police Department worked with the FBI to apply psychological pressure and incite a reaction from Masters on the anniversary of the Hettrick murder. The FBI, according to the memos, promised to disavow any knowledge of the sting if it was uncovered. According to the memos, authorities: Fed a local reporter phony information that police were closing in on a suspect Delivered newspapers carrying the fake story to Masters' trailer Had one of Masters' friends deliver him a copy of his mother's obituary "They're chumming the waters, your honor. They're trying to get a bite," an incensed Chambers told the judge this week. "I like cops. I represent cops," he said. "For police officers to be so utterly devious is heartbreaking." Jack Taylor, one of the lead investigators on the Hettrick murder case, confirmed the police tactics described in the memos in his testimony Thursday. Masters didn't have the violent response that police suspected he would. Had Chambers known about the sting, he said, he could have used it to show that his client did not fit a purported profile that prosecutors used to portray Masters as a psychopath. "None of this is given to me. None of it," Chambers told the judge. Wymore, Liu and Chambers say the volume of exculpatory evidence that the prosecution had but never presented to the defense during Masters' 1999 trial is astounding. Discovery rules dictate that prosecutors must turn over police files, lab reports and other evidence -- both incriminating and favorable to the defendant -- before the trial. Failure to do so can result in severe sanctions. A recent high-profile example is former Durham County, North Carolina, District Attorney Mike Nifong. He was disbarred over his failure to turn over lab reports and for his overzealous handling of the sexual assault case involving members of the Duke University lacrosse team who were cleared of all the charges against them. In the Masters case, prosecutors and police -- save a few members of the investigative squad who have become skeptical -- have long stood by their work. They say Masters was arrested after an exhaustive, 12-year probe that followed him from high school to the U.S. Navy and back to the civilian arena after an honorable discharge. Broderick, the former lead investigator, agrees that the case is based largely on circumstantial evidence and that some of those pieces of evidence don't raise suspicions by themselves. But when you put it all together -- the knives, the drawings, the anniversary of his mother's death, Masters' failure to report the body -- it creates a "mosaic" that points to Masters as the killer, he said. "Twelve people looked at that stuff and came to the conclusion that this guy is guilty," Broderick said. "My job is to present the information. My job's not to ensure the jury follows my logic." Broderick, who has been sitting at the prosecutors' table during this week's hearings, said that until he sees new evidence, he will continue to believe Masters is Hettrick's killer. "I can't go to bed at night knowing all the incriminating details," he said. "If I don't present that to a jury, I haven't done my job."

South Carolina student wants stimulus money to rebuild schoolStory Highlights Ty'Sheoma Bethea wrote letter to lawmakers asking for help in rebuilding her school The letter made its way to the Oval Office and brought an extraordinary invitation Ty'Sheoma sat next to the first lady at the president's "state of the nation" speech But S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford says state stimulus money won't go to school projects Next Article in Politics » By Jessica Yellin CNN National Political Correspondent DILLON, South Carolina (CNN) -- Ty'Sheoma Bethea felt she had to speak up. Ty'Sheoma Bethea sent a letter to lawmakers with her plea for money to help rebuild her crumbling school. Her school was crumbling, and Congress was not going to approve money that could be used to rebuild it. So she wrote a letter to lawmakers begging for help. "I said we're not quitters and we can make a change," Ty'Sheoma said. "And we're just students who want to be lawyers, doctors, congressmen and also presidents." The letter made its way to the Oval Office and brought an extraordinary invitation. The White House sat the 14-year-old eighth-grader next to first lady Michelle Obama at the president's "state of the nation" address to Congress last month. It seemed help was on the way. New stimulus money was coming from Washington, and Ty'Sheoma thought her school, JV Martin Junior High in Dillon, South Carolina, would finally be rebuilt. But her governor, Mark Sanford, announced he wouldn't use his share of the stimulus money on projects like rebuilding her school. "It's easy to fall into the trap of we need to fix this one school," said Sanford, a Republican. "The hat that I wear is to look as best as I can -- and it will be imperfect -- at the state in its entirety." Taking a stand against government spending, Sanford said he would be willing to use the $700 million in the stimulus bill only if he believes he has discretion to control paying down the state's debt. That means Ty'Sheoma's community is left with its school, whose condition is astonishing. Don't Miss Sanford: We're moving close to 'a savior-based economy'

Tighter rules expected for stimulus money
"The auditorium is condemned," she said on the tour through the crumbling structure. "They use the stage for storage." She looked around and said the walls are peeling off and debris has fallen from the ceiling. The gymnasium is in such bad shape, the basketball coach has to cancel games when it rains. "The roof leaks water through the small cracks at the top of the roof," Ty'Sheoma said. Many classes are taught in trailers on the school grounds. But the walls are so thin, teachers have to pause when trains roll by, which happens about five times a day. The school lies in what's been called the Corridor of Shame, a stretch of highway with enormously poor neighborhoods that are mostly African-American. Some critics say the state doesn't want to spend money on black kids. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat, is outraged that the governor won't spend stimulus money in this community. "It's a slap in the face of the people who live in those counties," Clyburn said. "If the majority of those people happen to be African-American, it's a slap in their faces as well." Sanford flatly rejects the charge, and his office says state lawmakers could rebuild JV Martin with their own funds. "Spending money that you don't have, I think, is a horrible idea," Sanford said. Ty'Sheoma said she just wants the squabbling to end. "I think the politicians should be giving advice to me as a student instead of me giving advice to politicians just as a little girl from Dillon," she said.

E-mails show GOP circling Palin in late 2008 By Matt Smith, CNN Alaska releases Palin e-mailsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Palin documents show GOP overtures in August 2008NEW: E-mails reveal frustration with early ethics questionsPalin, aides express frustration with questions about children's travelPalin wanted to know about "past administration's dealing" with scandal figureEditor's note: CNN is in Juneau, Alaska, to examine the more than 24,000 pages of Sarah Palin's emails being released by the Alaska governor's office. They will be available over the weekend on CNNPolitics.com and we invite our readers to examine them and contribute to the discussion. Share your thoughts on Palin's emails with iReport. Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign and other Republicans began circling Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in the weeks before McCain picked her as his 2008 running mate, according to e-mails from her old office. Prominent Republicans had touted Palin as a possible running mate for a few months before. But the courtship appears to have accelerated in early August of 2008, just as the biggest controversy of her administration was gathering steam, according to some of the 24,000 pages of e-mails released by Alaska's state government Friday. "Governor -- I received a call from Charles Adams, Communications Advisor Department for Senator McCain. Mr. Adams was inquiring as to whether or not you would be interested in participating in a National Press Call on Wednesday, 08.06.08," Palin's scheduler, Janice Mason, wrote the then-governor on August 4. "This would be with their National Pool of Reporters. It has very good attendance on calls. It would help the elected official. It would be a total of 15 minutes of your time and would be in regards to Energy." It was not immediately clear whether Palin accepted the invitation. In her response to Mason, she questioned whether she could take part in the call, given a planned trip to southwestern Alaska. Around the same time, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley requested a brief courtesy visit during an August 11 trip to Alaska's capital Juneau. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also e-mailed Palin to ask her advice on how Alaska distributed its oil taxes. Gingrich suggested Alaska's model, which guarantees every resident a cut of the proceeds, could be adopted in other states. Palin doubles down on history flap

Freedom of Information Act
And the Republican National Committee had Palin lined up for a 9 p.m. speaking slot at the party's convention in Minneapolis on September 2, the day she eventually delivered her acceptance speech, as early as August 20. "RNC feels that this is a much better slot for you and they want you on Primetime," Mason wrote. Nothing in the documents indicates whether Palin knew she was being considered for a slot on the national ticket, and further documents indicate she planned to stay at a Hilton Garden Inn and return from Minneapolis the day after her speech. Neither her husband, Todd, nor infant son, Trig, would be able to accompany her, she wrote -- "All the more reason to keep the trip short." McCain eventually named Palin his choice for vice president on August 29, catapulting the once-obscure governor into the national spotlight and making her a potential contender for the GOP's No. 1 position in 2012. State officials released the trove of e-mail -- six 11-by-17-inch boxes worth -- on Friday, the result of Freedom of Information Act requests dating to her vice presidential nomination. About three dozen reporters and photographers crammed into the crowded hallway of a state office building in Juneau and hauled them away for review Friday morning. Around the same time that she was being considered for the vice presidential nomination, Palin was coming under increasing scrutiny over her firing of the state's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan. Monegan's backers asserted that Palin had fired him because he refused to sack her ex-brother-in-law, a state police officer who had been involved in a bitter custody dispute with Palin's sister. The flap became known as "Troopergate," and it dogged Palin throughout the remainder of the campaign. Two investigations came to differing conclusions about her actions: One found she violated state ethics law by using state employees to put pressure on her former in-law, another found she had stayed within the law and little evidence she knew of the actions of her subordinates. The first investigation was commissioned by the state Legislature, the second requested by Palin herself. On August 6, 2008, Palin was told that the Legislature's investigator, Steven Branchflower, had requested "a laundry list" of records from the governor's office: "Emails, files correspondence, names and addresses of any and all staff that would have any knowledge of Walt's firing," wrote her then-chief of staff, Mike Nizich. In the e-mail, one of those released Friday, Nizich adds, "You got to be kidding me." And Palin replies, "Geez. This is crazy." Earlier records in the stash show Palin's frustration with complaints about her family's state-paid travel even before she entered the national spotlight, instructing an aide to remind a reporter "of the family travels w (with) me that I have personally pd (paid) for." "Hopefully our records very clearly show that," Palin wrote on July 10, 2008. "Also, my return of every per diem offer for everything related to the kids ... and we need to be proactive in this issue with reminding him of all the steps taken to save state monies like no Anchorage apartment ... no chef ... security down from 7 to 2, whatever." Palin eventually paid back about $7,000 for travel expenses for her children after an ethics investigator determined nine trips were questionable. The settlement stated that Palin did not violate Alaska's ethics law or commit any wrongdoing, and that she followed the advice of experienced staff. A spokesman for her political action committee said Friday that the documents show "a governor hard at work." "The thousands upon thousands of e-mails released today show a very engaged Governor Sarah Palin being the CEO of her state," said Tim Crawford, treasurer of Sarah PAC, Palin's political action committee. Meanwhile, in a scandal that rocked Alaska's political establishment, Palin moved quickly to link a key figure to her defeated predecessor, Frank Murkowski, the documents show. "FYI -- I've asked Frank Bailey to help me track down soem [sic] evidence of past administration's dealing with Bill Allen," Palin wrote on May 8, 2007, a day after Allen pleaded guilty to bribery, extortion and conspiracy. Palin had beaten Murkowski in 2006 in a primary battle in which she campaigned as a reformer, and backed an unsuccessful 2010 challenge to Murkowski's daughter, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Allen had been the CEO of the Alaska oilfield services company VECO, and federal prosecutors accused him of leading a scheme to bribe top lawmakers in exchange for favorable state action. The scandal disgraced several lawmakers and led to prison time for Allen. Aides soon replied that VECO had paid $15,000 to fly Frank Murkowski and Allen to a Council of State Governments meeting in Thailand in 2004. Palin aides also asked Allen to resign from a seat on a state board that cultivated ties with the Canadian province of Alberta, a request to which Allen -- who was later sentenced to three years in prison -- quickly agreed. The documents include messages from Palin's official account as well as private accounts, according to Linda Perez, the administrative director for current Gov. Sean Parnell. A search was done "in an effort to capture everything in the state e-mail system" that would comply with the request, Perez said. Perez said 2,275 pages are not being released due to legal privileges, while some documents were redacted to remove names. E-mails for the remaining 10 months of Palin's tenure, leading up to her 2009 resignation, have yet to be released. Before the release, Palin told "Fox News Sunday" that the messages "obviously weren't meant for public consumption," saying she was sure the material would be taken out of context. "I think every rock in the Palin household that could ever be kicked over and uncovered anything, it's already been kicked over," she said. CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Katie Glaeser and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.

Your take: What's behind street harassment?
By Emily Smith, CNN
updated 1:10 PM EDT, Wed October 10, 2012
CNN commenters weigh in on why men catcall, what women can do about it and whether it's worth discussing at all.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN commenters had strong opinions on why catcallers target women Some readers said men should address this problem among themselves
Others said women play into harassment by responding favorably to "bad boys"
Many agreed that greater respect for others in all spheres of public life is necessary
(CNN) -- CNN asked readers to share their experiences with sexual harassment on the street in the comments section of a recent article titled 'Hey baby! Women speak out against street harassment.'
There was passionate debate about the causes and effects of catcalls, vulgar rants and even physical assault aimed at women. A few themes stood out: Who's to blame? Are women complicit in street harassment? Is it even worth talking about?
Commenter Frank Montgomery saw the issue of street harassment as cultural: "Instead of blaming men, I would suggest that our larger culture might be more responsible for this. Many people rely on instilling fear for advantage. Popular gangster culture is widely accepted by American youth, and fear is a powerful intoxicant for predators. Ladies, consider yourself fortunate that many such comments are camouflaged in sexual context. These same men are often abusive to everyone, their family members and even other men. Violence, manipulation, deceit and controlling behaviors are often their modus operandi. Also, remember women are not exempt from these trait, they are just manifest different."
Lovehope agreed: "Much of rap music encourages this behavior. The songs are incredibly degrading to women. They are full of profanity and explicit sexual lyrics. There needs to be a public outcry against singers who promote this type of behavior and attitude. I urge people to read the lyrics of the music they listen to and not buy or support music with irresponsible messages.
Those of you with daughters, remember that every woman used to be somebody's little girl. How would you feel if your little girl was treated this way."
Yet some commenters said women condone street harassment with their response to it.
BourneBlogger: "I never catcall a girl, honk a horn, or whistle at a woman. ... The rejection is too overwhelming to take that risk. ... But what's ironic about all of this is that the type of men who do catcall are the EXACT type of men that women flock to when they're at the club. ... I can't tell you how many times I've seen a woman hypnotized by the biggest d0uch3bag on the dance floor. ..."
Guest98989: "It's also interesting to see that some guy can literally be a stalker but it's cool if the girl is into him but then you can have some poor, somewhat less attractive guy simply say hello to a girl, get viciously rejected and then hear the girls talking trash about the creepy freak stalker who dared to say hello to one of them (despite the fact that the poor dude never bothered them before or again). Give me a break. ... You are NOT helping your cause for the very, very few guys who are actually dangerous (which is very few, even 99.9% of jerks are not). ..."
Truthofdare7 wrote in response to Guest98999: "He nailed it 100%. Don't lie to us. Girls talk a good game and then they go out with the worst of the catcallers and call it 'manly', brutish', 'alpha male' 'he is not that bad really'. I don't mind it if that is how things are and adjust accordingly but lets not lie about it. ..."
Then there were the men who were shocked that so many other men condoned catcalling in the comment thread.
SurfingSumo: "As a Man, I never realized there were so many other men that actually think it is ok to catcall and harass women. Didn't the rest of you men have mothers that taught you this was wrong?
What is wrong with you guys. I thought this was only a small segment of men out there but it looks like from the comments it is at least half.
This is wrong and you men that do this are COWARDS. Get it? COWARDS!
Wake up and start treating women the way you would want men to treat your daughter if she was walking on the street or in a subway."
Globaldecay seemed to agree: "This isn't a women's problem. This is a men's problem. We as men must be willing to stand up and speak up for our daughters, sisters and mothers."
As did Bill93848: "If a woman dresses in provocative clothes and literally wears a sign reading 'Please harass me,' it is still the man's responsibility to exercise self-restraint. A man is just that -- a man, not an impulsive child."
There were also some readers who thought the issue was being exaggerated:
Gregkells: "Many of us aren't condoning the behavior, we just find the response to it overblown. I don't condone bullying either, but I'm sick to death of the media latching on to it and creating an atmosphere of hypersensitivity. Kids will ALWAYS pick on each other, it isn't a national crisis. There will always be men who say crude things, it isn't terrorism or rape. Some of us are just getting sick of extreme cases being presented as if they are indicative of the norm. Kids aren't lining up like lemmings to commit suicide because some other kid gave them a wedgie, and people aren't getting raped and groped en masse on public transit because we let construction workers get away with whistling at pretty women. This type of sensationalism will produce a backlash, hence the crude jokes people are making here. Most of us aren't defending the behavior, we're ridiculing the response."
Badger85 didn't agree: "Greg, I agree the media over sensationalizes things, but cases like this -- unwanted touching on the bus, graphic threats to rape, following someone home etc? It's happened to every girl. I'm glad we ARE discussing it, because it seems like guys have no idea that this is so frequent and don't realize *why* we're responding to them with distrust and fear."
Mrsczs had some advice for women: "You mean men are still carrying on like that? I thought they'd stopped years ago. When did I grow old enough to fly beneath the radar? Take it from me, ladies, 'This, too, shall pass.' Enjoy every minute of being young and beautiful and don't waste your precious moments getting hung up on the small stuff. Wolf whistles are small stuff. Life is short."
Guylpanema also said women should just suck it up: "This behavior is genetic, and all of you people who are arguing against it simply lack a grasp of human nature. Men will forever be trying to get some, and women will forever be the object of that desire. It is inherent in our nature. While I agree that sometimes it goes too far, trying to regulate human chemistry is a short trip down the road to fascism.
I'm sorry if it bothers you when men recognize that you look great in ways that you don't approve of. Get over it. Stop trying to control things you have no right to control. Woman up. If you want to be equals, then start growing a pair instead of whining about what you don't like."
Others didn't take so kindly to that response.
Stubby: "We have control over our own bodies. You have control over YOUR actions. Making lame excuses and saying that men are just animals who can't control themselves is pathetic and insulting to men. You can recognize a pretty girl without grabbing or harassing them, millions of men are capable of this."
Commenter Cathi Cari Shudde summed up her history with street harassment: "I've had multiple experiences during the years of this and similar experiences. Whether walking down the street, riding public transit, walking in a park with my dog, being in a public space (i.e. store, library, etc) - and here's my take on it at 56 years old.
Why do people think its ok to say something to another person that you wouldn't want said to your mother, your sister, your daughter or your friend?
Why must we accommodate your inability to keep your thoughts from flowing freely and without consideration, from your mouths? ...
Sadly its all too common that other women and men will not intervene or step up to assist others. They don't want to get involved.
I'm frankly tired of accommodating other's poor behavior and inability to control themselves in public."

'Well folks, I'm about to get shot,' says suspect in Facebook goodbye
By Brittany Brady, CNN
updated 12:10 PM EST, Sun January 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"It's been real, bro, wish I could have hung with you once last time," Eric Ramsey allegedly writes
Ramsey led police on a chase after abducting and assaulting a university student, officials say
Suspect was shot dead
(CNN) -- A man suspected of abducting and sexually assaulting a Central Michigan University student posted a final goodbye a few hours later on his Facebook page shortly before an officer fatally shot him, authorities said Friday.
"Well folks, I'm about to get shot. Peace," was 30-year-old Eric Ramsey's last post to his Facebook wall around 3:15 a.m. Thursday, Isabella County Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told CNN in a telephone interview.
Ramsey had abducted the student from CMU's campus about 2.5 hours northwest of Detroit on Wednesday evening, then drove her to a home where he bound and sexually assaulted her, the sheriff's department said in a news release.
After the attack, Ramsey put the woman back in the car, grabbed two cans of gasoline and began driving again, it said. When he told the woman he was going to kill her, she jumped from the car and ran to a nearby residence, where she knocked on the door and yelled for help, the release said.
A 14-year-old boy let her in and, after hearing her story, locked the woman, his younger sister and himself in the bathroom, Mioduszewski said.
As the woman was calling police, Ramsey poured gasoline on the house and set it afire before fleeing, the sheriff said.
Shortly thereafter, the children's father returned home and doused the fire, which caused no serious damage, Mioduszewski said.
Police soon caught up with Ramsey, who led them on a chase through two counties, during which he rammed a state police trooper's car, stole a sanitation truck and rammed two more vehicles, police said.
"It's been real, bro, wish I could have hung with you once last time. Love you, brother," Ramsey allegedly posted to a friend's Facebook page around 1 a.m. Thursday, as the chase was continuing.
A couple of hours later, after hitting a deputy's car head-on, Ramsey posted his final words, the sheriff said. Soon after, he was fatally shot by a deputy.
"We owe it to the public to find out what was the cause of this," Mioduszewski said Friday. Police are meeting with friends and family to determine what was going on in Ramsey's life, he said.

Sky's no limit: 5 epic helicopter prison escapes
By Holly Yan, CNN
updated 5:52 AM EDT, Mon March 18, 2013
(CNN) -- The spectacular, airborne escape of two Canadian inmates Sunday stunned witnesses and showcased the illicit ingenuity behind one of the more creative styles of prison breaks.
But while astonishing, helicopter escapes are not unheard of. For decades, crafty inmates have fled into the sky -- some with more success than others.
Here are five epic helicopter escapes:
1. The French lovebirds
Nadine Vaujour was so determined to get her husband out of prison she took helicopter flight lessons just for the escape.
Her husband, Michel Vaujour, was serving a lengthy sentence for attempted murder and armed robbery. In May 1986, he forced his way to the roof of a Parisian prison by wielding nectarines painted as grenades.
His wife then picked him up in the helicopter and fled to a football field, where they drove away.
But their luck soon ran out.
Nadine Vaujour was discovered and arrested in southwestern France, and Michel was shot in the head during a failed bank robbery.
2. The American in Mexico In 1971, Joel David Kaplan hopped on a chopper in a Mexican prison yard, never to return again.
Kaplan, who was convicted for the death of his business partner in Mexico City, always insisted he was innocent.
The New Yorker's daring escape inspired the book "The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan" and the 1975 movie "Breakout."
3. The frequent flier
Pascal Payet holds the record for planning the most number of escapes by helicopter, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
The Frenchman first used a helicopter to flee from a Luynes prison in 2001.
Two years later, while still a fugitive, he helped inmates from the same prison escape by chopper.
He was eventually caught, but then escaped for the third time from another prison using a helicopter hijacked by four men.
Payet and his accomplices fled, and the pilot was not harmed.
4. The Belgian flock
When Nordin Ben Allal dreamed up his escape, he didn't mean for others to join him.
In 2007, when Ben Allal's accomplices landed at a Belgian prison, other inmates tried to jump on board.
The chopper spun out of control, injuring the pilot and several of the prisoners, The Telegraph reported.
Ben Allal managed to escape -- only to get recaptured.
5. The Greek foil In February, accomplices swooped over a prison in Greece and tried to whisk away convicted murderer Panagiotis Vlastos with a rope.
The accomplices reportedly unleashed a hailstorm of bullets from AK-47 assault rifles toward prison guards, who fired back.
Vlastos was shot, and the chopper eventually landed on the prison parking lot.

Israeli planes strike Syrian military base, U.S. official says
By Barbara Starr, CNN Pentagon Correspondent
updated 10:43 PM EDT, Thu October 31, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The Syrian military regains control of the town of al Safira
Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman: "We don't refer to foreign reports"
U.S. official: Targeted were missiles, equipment the Israelis felt might be given to Hezbollah
Israel has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah
(CNN) -- Israeli warplanes struck a military base near the Syrian port city of Latakia this week, an Obama administration official told CNN on Thursday.
An explosion at a missile storage site in the area was reported in the Middle Eastern press, but an attack has not been confirmed by the Israeli government.
The target, according to the Obama administration official, was missiles and related equipment the Israelis felt might be transferred to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information.
There was some confusion about the timing of the attack, with some reports saying it happened Wednesday, and others saying Thursday.
When asked for comment, an Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman told CNN: "We don't refer to foreign reports."
Israel has been accused several other times this year of launching airstrikes inside Syria, including once in January. In the January incident, a U.S. official said Israeli fighter jets bombed a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah.
Israel's military did not comment on any of the allegations at the time, but has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists, as well as any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel.
Thursday's reports of a blast come amid a Syrian civil war in which Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, has been helping Syrian government forces. Syria's government is led by President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shiite offshoot Alawite sect; the rebels and other militants fighting al-Assad's forces and Hezbollah are largely made up of Sunni Muslims.
The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.
On Thursday, the Syrian military took back control of al Safira, a town that is believed to house a chemical weapons production facility. Rebels withdrew from the strategic town, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
International inspectors are trying to ensure that Syria eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year. Syria agreed to the program under international pressure earlier this year.
One of the monitoring groups, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said Thursday that Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities, and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal.
The watchdog body's announcement of the facilities' destruction meant that Syria met a key deadline in the elimination program.
The joint United Nations-OPCW mission visited 21 out of 23 sites, an OPCW statement said, and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites. The remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to, it said, but Syria had declared those sites abandoned. The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected.
CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.

Tips for getting started with your new mobile gadget
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 11:04 AM EST, Wed December 25, 2013 | Filed under: Mobile
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New mobile device? There are some tips any new owner should know
Simple tablet and smartphone security measures can prevent heartache later
Save money with data warnings and limits, as well as Wi-Fi messaging and phone apps
(CNN) -- If you are one of the lucky many to have received a new tablet or smartphone over the holidays, congratulations! You'll want to rip open the box and start playing right away. But before you do something potentially distracting like downloading Dots, here are some starter tips to make the most of your new device, whether it's an iPad Mini, Nexus 5 smartphone or Kindle Fire HDX.
Prevent heartbreak with security measures
Your new gadget is shiny and amazing and already precious to you. So it might be hard to imagine a dark day in the future when you are careless enough to leave it in the airplane seat pocket in front of you or unlucky enough to have it stolen. Bad things will happen, but there are a few steps you can take now to make it hurt a little less down the line.
First, turn on the screen-lock setting which will require a passcode or password (or fingerprint or face recognition) every time you turn on the phone or tablet. This is your number one defense against someone accessing sensitive financial and personal information if they find or steal your device. It will also make it more difficult for them to wipe it and erase any information you didn't back up. Logging in every time will seem like a slight inconvenience at first, but after a few days you'll hardly notice you're doing it and the few seconds will become a forgotten routine.
Next, download or activate any lost-device location features so that you can track the physical location of your tablet or phone if it is lost or stolen. Apple products have Find my iPhone installed by default, but you must connect your device to an iCloud account. Android devices can use the Android Device Manager.
Make a backup plan
Whether you end up using your tablet or smartphones primarily for communication, enjoying content like movies and books, or creating original content like drawings and work documents, you'll want to back up your device.
You can go through the default backup tools, such as iCloud or iTunes on iOS 7 or the Backup & Reset settings on Android. Third-party apps can also come in handy, like Dropbox, Titanium Backup or Carbon. When possible, use individual apps that automatically sync anything you create to the cloud.
Get a case
A new gadget's pristine screen and body are so pretty to look at, so gloriously unscuffed and unsullied. You may think it would be a shame to hide its glory under some cheap plastic case.
You know what's worse? Living with a broken and scratched device that cost hundreds of dollars. It happens far too often. Just look around your local coffee shop and count the number of people working around a cracked screen, dragging their bleeding or calloused fingers over fractured glass held together with clear packaging tape.
If you're clumsy or have children or are prone to the forces of gravity, consider buying a case.
Save money
The first bill on a new mobile device can be a shocker when you easily breeze past your data limit or rack up roaming charges. If your device is on a cellular plan, take precautions and set a mobile data warning or limit to prevent you from going over. The option is under Settings ->Wireless & Networks -> Data Usage on Android devices.
If you're using an Apple device, you can monitor how much data your device is eating up under Settings -> Cellular -> System Services (at the very bottom of the page). It groups data usage by the type of service like Mapping Services and Exchange Accounts. If you deduce a specific app is sucking down the most data, you can revoke its ability to use cellular data here too.
You can also install third-party apps to monitor data usage, some of which break it down by individual apps. Video and music streaming apps are big data hogs, so make sure you're on a wireless network before binge watching House of Cards.
If texting or calling charges are a concern, download calling and messaging apps that work over WiFi like Skype, What's App and Viber.
Delete the junk
Fresh out of the box, many devices are set up to favor their creators' or carriers' preferred apps. The problem is especially bad with Android and Windows phones sold through third-party carriers, which like to preinstall all sorts of bloatware.
Go through and delete any promotional or unwanted apps right away. If you can't delete the app on Android, you can probably disable it in settings so that it is out of sight. Apple devices are more conservative with preinstalled apps, but there is a core group of iOS apps you can't uninstall. If you really don't want to use them, stash them away in a folder.
This is also the time to make some cosmetic adjustments, like picking a new wallpaper and organizing your apps, so that you don't have to readjust to a new layout later. Prone to motion-sickness? Switch off the parallax setting on iOS 7.
Download starter apps
While not junk, some of the default apps might not be the best option for you. For example, Apple's Maps app, while vastly improved over its original buggy version, still isn't as good as Google Maps, which can be downloaded from the App Store (Google makes a number of must-have apps for iOS 7). There are a host of weather, calendar, note-taking, and camera alternatives to test out before setting down with the defaults.
Hunting for and downloading new apps is the most exciting part of a new gadget. Start with the basics, like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. If you're a news junkie, get the apps for your favorite outlets, any local channels or publications, and your favorite news aggregation app. Keep yourself organized with Evernote, and if you're part of a couple, download Avocado (if not for the sweet private messaging stuff, than because it's a handy way to coordinate to-do lists).
If you are a subscriber to any video or music streaming services, download the mobile apps (Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Instant, Hulu, Spotify). If you've already started anthropomorphizing your iPhone or iPad, just go all the way and download Hatch.
Here are suggestions of apps for travelers, apps for weathering storms and apps for staying healthy.
If you have kids
You may start out telling yourself you won't let the children play with your tablet or smartphone, but it only takes one twitchy toddler in a nice restaurant to kill that dream. If your device has parental controls, set them up early to prevent any unwanted app purchases, work emails or cryptic Facebook postings.
If you are going to record a video
Make sure your device is horizontal. Vertically shot movies are a plague that must be stopped.
If you're replacing an old tablet or phone
Don't forget to wipe your old device completely before handing it down, selling it on Craigslist, or donating it to a local charity.

Cosmic wow, a rare exploding star!
By Meg Urry updated 12:51 PM EST, Fri January 24, 2014
NASA's NuSTAR telescope array generated the first map of radioactivity in the remnants of an exploding star, or supernova. Blue in this image of Cassiopeia A represents radioactive material. Click through to see other wonders of the universe.
A supernova was spotted on January 21 in Messier 82, one of the nearest big galaxies. This wide view image was taken on January 22.
The M82 supernova, seen here, has been designated SN2014J because it is the 10th supernova detected in 2014. At 11.4 million light years from Earth, it is the closest Type Ia supernova recorded since systematic studies with telescopes began in the 1930s.
The Hubble Space Telescope is letting us see farther than ever into the universe. This long-exposure image is the deepest-ever picture taken of a cluster of galaxies called Abell 2744. Is that a giant hand waving at us? Actually, it's what's left of a star that died and exploded a long time ago. Astronomers nicknamed it the "Hand of God." NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, took this image in high-energy X-rays, shown in blue. The image was combined with images from another space telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, one of the largest and closest galaxies of its kind. The center of the galaxy is mysterious, researchers say, because it has a double nucleus -- a supermassive black hole that may be ringed by a lopsided disc of stars, giving it the appearance of a dual core.
Hubble scientists say this is the best-ever view of the Tarantula Nebula, which is located in one of our closest galactic neighbors, the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Those spots on our sun appear small, but even a moderate-sized spot is about as big as Earth. They occur when strong magnetic fields poke through the sun's surface and let the area cool in comparison to the surrounding area.
This Hubble image looks a floating marble or a maybe a giant, disembodied eye. But it's actually a nebula with a giant star at its center. Scientists think the star used to be 20 times more massive than our sun, but it's dying and is destined to go supernova.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
In one of the nearest big galaxies, M82, a rare type of supernova exploded Meg Urry: Its uniform luminosity makes it valuable in measuring cosmic distance She says finding supernovae has led directly to the discovery of dark energy Urry: We are seeing this light 11.4 million years after the real explosion Editor's note: Meg Urry is the Israel Munson professor of physics and astronomy at Yale University and director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
(CNN) -- The other night, as I sat in the telescope operation room at the Keck Observatory in Waimea, Hawaii, preparing with colleagues to measure light from some of the most distant galaxies known, the phone rang with startling news.
An exploding star had been sighted in M82, one of the nearest big galaxies. The "supernova" (as such stellar explosions are called) was a special, rare "Type Ia" -- the kind that led to the Nobel-worthy discovery of dark energy.
Type Ia supernovae have happened in our galactic neighborhood only three times in the last 80 years. Like astronomers around the world, we were excited to be at a world-leading telescope, where we could collect new information about this rare event.
Meg Urry
The new supernova, SN2014J, is 11.4 million light-years from Earth, a mere stone's throw in cosmic terms. The previous record-holders were found in 1937 (14 million light-years away) and 1972 (16 million light-years away).
Supernovae occur at the end of a star's life when its furnace runs out of fuel. Because gravity then overcomes the star's ability to remain puffed up, there is a violent collapse, followed by an explosion that produces radioactive elements such as nickel and cobalt. Most of the light we see from a supernova is emitted as those radioactive elements decay, so the brightness falls sharply over a period of weeks.
Incidentally, all the iron in your blood came from the decay of radioactive nickel manufactured in a stellar explosion. So most of the atoms in your body were once in the interiors of stars.
Because supernovae change brightness very quickly compared with galaxies (months compared with billions of years for galaxies), we quickly diverted the Keck telescope from our intended targets to SN2014J. Our galaxies will look the same another night, but the supernova won't.
Amazingly, a professor and his students at the University of London Observatory had discovered SN2014J well before it reached its peak brightness.
"The weather was closing in, with increasing cloud," said professor Steve Fossey. "So instead of the planned practical astronomy class, I gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the CCD camera on one of the observatory's automated 0.35-meter telescopes."
Deciding to look at M82 was almost pure luck -- there were fewer clouds in that direction, and the galaxy was pretty and bright. But Fossey quickly noticed M82 didn't look right: It seemed to contain a bright new star. He realized this might be a supernova and, together with his students, worked feverishly to rule out other explanations (such as a flaw in the camera or an asteroid in our galaxy appearing to pass by M82). In short order, the discovery of the new supernova was confirmed, and the e-mail alerts and notifications began.
Tom Wright, one of the students, said, "One minute we're eating pizza, then five minutes later we've helped to discover a supernova. I couldn't believe it."
The only supernova that's more extraordinary is SN1987A, which was discovered in 1987. It is in a tiny satellite galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, about 160,000 light-years away and 70 times closer than SN2014J.
Here's an analogy for the vast distances across which we see supernovae: Imagine if 1987A were on the back porch. Then SN2014J would be just down the street; a garden-variety nearby supernovae would be in the next town, and the most distant supernovae would be over in the next state.
Space is very empty -- there are only a few big galaxies near us. On average, the distance to the nearest big galaxy is about 100 times its size. But space is also huge, and there are billions of galaxies.
In an ordinary big galaxy such as the Milky Way, one supernova -- of any type -- happens only every hundred years or so. But since there are so many galaxies in the universe, millions of supernovae go off every year. From Earth, we can see hundreds of these.
One recipe we can use to find a supernova is to take pictures of a few hundred galaxies, repeat a few weeks later and look for the difference. The supernova will look like an overly bright star compared with the galaxy in which it lies.
Finding one supernova in several hundred galaxies is equivalent to staring at one galaxy for several hundred years.
M82 is an unusual galaxy because it has a high rate of star formation. That's why two other supernovae were found in M82 as recently as 2008 and 2004. But they were not the special Type Ia supernovae. Because we have a good idea of how much light is emitted by Type Ia supernovae, the brightness we observe is a direct indicator of the distance to the host galaxy. This makes Type Ia supernovae incredibly valuable for measuring cosmic distances.
Careful observations of Type Ia supernovae across the universe were essential to measuring the expansion history of the universe over billions of years. This led directly to the discovery of dark energy, a sort of fifth fundamental force that is now one of the most important unknowns in physics or astronomy.
The reason Type Ia supernovae are special is their uniformity. Basically, they all explode at about the same mass, so they are all roughly equally luminous. Better understanding the physics of that explosion and the effect of local galactic environment will make Type Ia supernovae even better "standard candles" and improve our understanding of the properties of dark energy and the cosmological evolution of the universe. The more data we can get, and the closer the supernova, the better the calibration.
We are lucky that SN2014J was discovered about two weeks before it will reach its maximum brightness, rather than after. For the next week or so, the data will get better as the supernova gets brighter.
On Tuesday night, it was reported to be 11th magnitude (astronomer units), which is about 100 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye. But it should get at least 10 times brighter, with a maximum around 8th magnitude -- not visible to the naked eye but certainly discernible with a good pair of binoculars.
M82 lies far north in the sky, in the constellation Ursa Major, near the Big Dipper, above the Dipper's bowl and about a third of the way over toward Polaris, the North Star. So if you can see the Big Dipper and the North Star, take a shot at seeing one of the most unusual supernovae in your lifetime.
Of course, you can't get too excited about the timing. We see this light 11.4 million years after the explosion happened, because of the time light takes to reach our galaxy. So it was a really special time in M82 11.4 million years ago.
