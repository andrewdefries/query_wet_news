Three detained U.S. hikers share love of travel, learningStory Highlights One of missing U.S. hikers is freelance journalist Shane Bauer intended to cover elections in Iraqi Kurdistan, news outlet says Three American hikers arrested after crossing into Iran All three are graduates of University of California-Berkeley Next Article in World » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- One is a freelance journalist who intended to cover elections in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Another also has been trying her hand at reporting, and the third is a friend who shared their love of travel. Shane Bauer is one of three American hikers believed to have been taken into custody in Iran. Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Joshua Fattal -- three University of California-Berkeley graduates arrested Friday after crossing from Iraq into Iran during a hike -- are seasoned travelers with an appetite for interaction with other cultures, friends and associates said. Bauer, 27, and his girlfriend Shourd, 30, left the San Francisco Bay area last fall for a yearlong visit to the Middle East, where Bauer planned to spend time "absorbing on the ground whatever he could in the Arab world and offered to contribute stories to us," said Sandy Close, executive director of California-based New America Media. "I think this is a very experienced traveler, a backpack kind of traveler, not somebody who would go to the Ritz Carlton," Close said of Bauer. "[He's] somebody who would go to the hostel, who would operate on a shoestring, as many freelancers do." Watch friends and colleagues describe the missing hikers » The pair had been staying in Damascus, Syria, but they and Fattal last week were in Iraqi Kurdistan, where Bauer was planning to report for NAM on presidential and parliamentary elections in the autonomous region, Close said. "I think he went to [Iraqi] Kurdistan to cover the elections ... and [during a hike] unfortunately didn't know the ground he was walking on well enough to avoid crossing over whatever boundary was there," Close told CNN on Monday. Iran confirmed Tuesday that its security forces arrested the three Americans on Friday on charges of illegally entering the country illegally from Iraq.

The three were arrested in the western Iranian city of Marivan, the deputy governor of Kurdistan province, Iraj Hassanzadeh, told the Fars News Agency. Earlier, Swiss diplomats in Iran and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington had urged Iran to provide information on the hikers. "Obviously, we are concerned," Clinton said. "We want this matter brought to a resolution as soon as possible and we call on the Iranian government to help us determine the whereabouts of the three missing Americans and return them as quickly as possible." Bauer, a 2007 honors graduate in peace and conflict studies at Berkeley, is fluent in Arabic, Close said. He has written several stories on Iraq and Syria and taken pictures for NAM since the fall, and he's also had stories published by other outlets, including the Christian Science Monitor and the Nation. Though he knows Arabic and is comfortable with Arab culture, he doesn't understand Farsi and therefore "would not have been able or, I think, interested in going [into Iran]," Close said. "I think he has a great passion to explore the region where his facility with Arabic and his knowledge of the history and the culture of the Arab Middle East would have led him to go beyond where many professional journalists might have dared to go. [But] ... I don't think he would have wanted to go beyond Iraqi Kurdistan," Close said. Shourd, a 2003 Berkeley graduate with an English degree, described herself as a "teacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East" on a profile listed on a travel Web site. In a statement released Monday, the school called her an "aspiring journalist" who reported a story for NAM this year on the Golan Heights. Fattal, 27, graduated from Berkeley in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in environmental economics and policy, the university said. "My husband and I are eager for the best welfare and conditions for our son, Josh, and for the other two companions he's with," Laura Fattal, of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, told CNN Radio on Saturday. "And that is our only concern, his welfare and the best conditions for him." Joshua Fattal shares his friends' love of travel and learning, and was described as "fiercely intellectual" by his friend, Chris Foraker, who spoke to CNN affiliate KVAL in Eugene, Oregon. Foraker said he met Fattal during a study abroad program in 2003, and the two worked together at the nonprofit Aprovecho sustainable living research center in Cottage Grove, Oregon. "[Fattal] is a really great guy. We had a really good working relationship with him, and we love him a lot and hope to see him home safe soon," said Aprovecho's Jeremy Roth, who spoke to CNN affiliate KEZI in Eugene. The three and a fourth friend, Shon Meckfessel, spent Thursday night at a hotel in Sulaimaniya, Iraq, before the hike, according to the hotel owner. On Friday, Meckfessel stayed behind while the others went for the hike near a border town, and Meckfessel was in contact with the three until that afternoon, when they reported being "surrounded by Iranian soldiers," said Peshrow Ahmed, spokesman for Sulaimaniya's security manager. Meckfessel is a graduate student at the University of Washington. His grandmother told CNN Saturday that he stayed behind because he felt sick. Meckfessel met with a U.S. consular official, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said. "My grandson has asked me not to talk to the media," said the grandmother, Irene Meckfessel of Carmichael, California, before hanging up. Meckfessel is in the final year of a two-year program called MATESOL, or Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, according to the university. Friends and colleagues of the missing three said they are anxiously awaiting word of what will happen next. "My hopes are that Josh and Shane and Sarah arrive home safely and that we can welcome them with open arms and have them return to the life that they want," Foraker told KEZI.

Family films frantic escape from Colorado wildfire
By Ashley Hayes, CNN
updated 5:41 PM EDT, Thu March 29, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Some residents are being allowed to return to their homes
A Colorado family captures harrowing escape from a wildfire on video
The flames kill a husband and wife
The governor suspends "controlled" fires until an investigation is completed
(CNN) -- The cell-phone video shows a scene straight out of hell: a darkness lit only by billowing smoke, tinted orange and red from nearby flames, as a vehicle hurtles toward safety.
"Daddy?" says a small, tearful voice, tinged with panic.
"We're going to make it," Doug Gulick tells his child. "We're going to be fine."
"Where's Mom?" the child says, then, urgently, "Why is she stopping?"
Kaleb Gulick, 13, shot the video in the car with his father as his family, in two cars, fled a deadly Colorado wildfire that crept too close to their home earlier this week.
Firefighters were hoping to make more progress Thursday on containing the fire, which has burned more than 4,000 acres in a mountainous area near Denver.
With improving conditions, some evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes Thursday morning, the Jefferson County sheriff's office said.
The Colorado Forest Service apologized for the wildfire after it was revealed that it was caused by a "controlled" burn that got out of control, killing at least two people.
Colorado wildfires out of control
"This is heartbreaking and we're sorry," State Forester Joe Duda told reporters Wednesday about the Lower North Fork Fire, which has scorched 4,140 acres in Jefferson County, destroying or damaging 27 houses and leaving a woman missing in addition to the two fatalities.
The revelation pushed Gov. John Hickenlooper to suspend such burns. A team is being formed to investigate how last Thursday's controlled burn re-erupted on Monday as a wildfire.
"The loss of life and property this week is devastating and this fire is far from being contained," he said in a news release. "That's why our top priority remains working to control the blaze," Hickenlooper said.
He suspended the use of prescribed burns by state agencies on state lands -- including state parks, refuges, State Land Board lands and any agency that manages lands -- or under contract on nonstate lands, such as by the Colorado State Forest Service. The suspension will be effective until the review of protocols and procedures of prescribed burning is complete.
Doug Gulick told CNN on Thursday as the family loaded the cars, "the last thing I saw was this large flame shot up, and we realized we had to go right then."
"We turned that corner and went from daylight into pure darkness," he said.
Gulick's wife, Kim Olson, was in the vehicle in front of her husband. She explained Thursday she put the brakes on -- prompting her child's panic -- because she was fumbling for the headlights in the darkness, and because she hesitated, wondering if the family was going to make it out or whether she and Gulick should turn around.
But then, she said, their neighbor went "flying" past them, and she decided to keep going.
"There it is, right there," Doug Gulick tells the children on the video as they pass flames.
"Oh, my gosh!" a child exclaims, and Gulick soothes them as the sky brightens, "We're out. We're out."
Kaleb Gulick said his father handed him the phone and "I just did my best to capture the whole experience."
Olson said their home was still standing as of Tuesday, when they saw an aerial shot of its roof line and that of their neighbor. She said she has received word that firefighters are camping out on her driveway and her neighbor's, putting out spot fires.
Their home is not out of danger yet, she said, but the family is "still hoping for the best."
And as firefighters work to extinguish the blaze, the search continues for a woman missing since the fast-moving wildfire swept through her home. A search and rescue team of 32 people and six dogs searched 60 acres Wednesday around her house and found no sign of the woman, said Jacki Kelley, a public information officer with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
Firefighters have dropped 4,100 gallons of fire retardant on the blaze, which was fueled by high winds and dry conditions, officials said.
Jefferson County Coroner John Graham identified the two victims as a married couple, Samuel Lucas, 77, and Linda Lucas, 76. "They were found very close together," Kelley said. "One was found outside; one was found inside."
Officials were trying to determine why the couple did not leave the fire zone by Monday night.
CNN's Michael Martinez, Tina Burnside, Phil Gast, Darrell Calhoun, Josh Levs, Shawn Nottingham, Dave Hennen, and Sarah Dillingham contributed to this report.

New details emerge in hearing for Colorado theater shooting suspect
By Casey Wian, Jim Spellman and Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 7:18 AM EST, Tue January 8, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Youngest victim was shot four times, according to coroner
Prosecutors say video shows Holmes in theater complex, using a ticket kiosk
Suspect James Holmes kept theater door unlocked with piece of plastic, officer says
Holmes's attorneys are expected to present a "diminished capacity" defense
Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- So much blood the theater floor had become slippery. Bodies with horrific injuries. The eerie sound of cell phones ringing, over and over again.
This is the scene Aurora police Officer Justin Grizzle said he encountered moments after entering the theater where, according to authorities, 25-year-old James Holmes killed 12 people in a July 20 shooting rampage.
Grizzle testified Monday on the opening day of the preliminary hearing for Holmes, who is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons charges.
The 13-year veteran wiped away tears while describing his efforts to rush badly wounded victims to the hospital in his police cruiser, including shooting victim Ashley Moser and her husband, who wanted Grizzle to turn around and head back to the theater.

Breaking down the insanity defense Theater shooting as it happened
"He was shot in the head somewhere. He kept asking where his ... daughter was," Grizzle said. "He opened the door and tried to jump out."
Grizzle said he had to drive and hold the man by his shoulder to keep him in the car.
The girl the man was seeking, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, was shot four times and was among those killed in the shooting at a midnight showing of "Batman: The Dark Knight Rises." Veronica's mother, Ashley, faces a long recovery after being paralyzed in her lower half and miscarrying after the shooting.
The scene was still gruesome when Detective Matthew Ingui arrived 12 hours later with other investigators.
"We saw the first victim laying on the ground," he said "There's shoes, blood, body tissue and popcorn on the floor."
Blood was everywhere, he said.
Ingui described how he outlined each of the victims and marked where the bodies were found. Holmes had no visible reaction during the testimony.
The detective said investigators found 209 live rounds of .223 ammunition and 15 cartridges of .40-caliber rounds inside the auditorium.
The preliminary hearing that began Monday is designed to show a judge that the state has enough evidence to proceed to trial. Prosecutors are calling scores of witnesses and outlining their evidence in the case. The hearing could go on for days.
A gag order imposed by the judge in the case has limited the flow of information about the attack. However, a source said Holmes allegedly went out a rear exit door, propped it open and gathered his weapons. He then returned to the theater and tossed a canister inside before opening fire, the source said.

Colorado massacre: Mourning the victims
The public gets its first glimpse of James Holmes, 24, the suspect in the Colorado theater shooting during his initial court appearance Monday, July 23. With his hair dyed reddish-orange, Holmes, here with public defender Tamara Brady, showed little emotion. He is accused of opening fire in a movie theater Friday, July 20, in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others. More photos: Mourning the victims of the Colorado theater massacre
Police release the official photo from Holmes' booking after the shooting.
Holmes often had a blank stare during his court appearance Monday, appearing to be in a daze. Victims and their relatives and journalists watch the proceedings Monday.
Flags fly at half-staff Monday at the Arapahoe County Courthouse in Centennial, Colorado, where the movie theater shooting suspect had his first court appearance. The prosecutor held a press conference outside the courthouse.
Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers talks to reporters Monday before heading into the courthouse. Chambers said the decision on whether to pursue the death penalty is a long process that involves input from victims and their families.
Family members of the victims arrive at the courthouse Monday for the suspect's first court appearance.
The Century Aurora 16 multiplex in Aurora becomes a place of horror after a gunman opened fire Friday in a crowded theater. At least 17 people remained hospitalized late Sunday, July 22, in the shooting rampage that shocked the nation. Holmes is accused of opening fire during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises." Holmes purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months, police say.
Police investigate outside the Century 16 multiplex Saturday, July 21, a day after the mass shooting. Authorities have been tight-lipped about a possible motive in the case.
Agents search the suspect's car outside the theater.
Aurora police escort a sand-filled dump truck containing improvised explosive devices removed from Holmes' booby-trapped apartment Saturday. Authorities have said they believe the suspect rigged his place before leaving for the movie theater. Police break a window at the suspect's apartment Friday in Aurora.
Law enforcement officers speak with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, center, outside the suspect's apartment Saturday. Law enforcement officers prepare to disarm the booby-trapped apartment Saturday.
Officials tow cars outside Holmes' apartment Saturday. Police disassembled devices and trip wires set up in the apartment.

Colorado movie theater massacre
Screaming moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, according to witnesses.
It was a scene "straight out of a horror film," said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater.
While none of the four law enforcement witnesses who testified Monday offered insight into a possible motive for the shooting, some new details emerged.
Prosecutors showed surveillance camera video taken inside the theater complex that they said shows Holmes -- dressed in dark trousers, a light-colored shirt with a T-shirt underneath and a ski cap covering his hair -- using a cell phone at a ticket kiosk. Holmes printed out a ticket that had been purchased July 8, they said.
The cameras also captured the aftermath of the shooting as waves of people ran out of doors with theater staff behind counters. One employee even leaped over a counter.
There was no video from inside the auditorium where the shootings occurred.
Police Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard said Holmes stopped the theater door from locking by using a small piece of plastic commonly used to hold tablecloths onto a picnic table. Jonsgaard also said he spotted a shotgun and a large drum magazine that appeared to be jammed on the floor of the theater.
Holmes' attorneys are expected to argue that their client has "diminished capacity," a term that, according to the Colorado Bar Association, relates to a person's ability or inability "to make adequately considered decisions" regarding his or her legal representation because of "mental impairment or for some other reason."
Several times, on cross-examination, they have asked witnesses about Holmes' demeanor and what he looked like when police found him.
The day's testimony concluded with a detective who interviewed people wounded in the attack and the two coroners who conducted the 12 autopsies.
After the hearing, Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester will determine whether there is enough evidence for Holmes to stand trial.
Security was tight at the hearing. Spectators had to pass through a metal detector and then were searched again before entering the courtroom. At least nine armed officers stood guard inside, some of them scanning the audience packed with reporters and victims' family members.
Holmes did not speak during the hearing. His bushy hair and long beard contrasted with the bright red hair and close-cropped looks he sported during previous appearances.
During portions of the hearing, family members of victims held one another, sobbing.
Earlier in Monday's hearing, police Officer Jason Oviatt -- the first officer to encounter Holmes after the rampage ended -- testified that Holmes seemed "very, very relaxed."
Holmes, his pupils dilated, sweating and smelly, didn't struggle or even tense his muscles as he was dragged away to be searched.
"He seemed very detached from it all," Oviatt testified, describing Holmes as unnaturally calm amid the chaos and carnage.
Oviatt testified Monday that within minutes of the first calls, he responded to the theater and found Holmes standing outside in a helmet and gas mask, his hands atop a white coupe that turned out to belong to him.
At first, Oviatt said, he thought Holmes was a police officer, but as he drew within 20 feet, he realized something was terribly wrong.
"He was just standing there. All the other officers were running around, trying to get into the theater," Oviatt said.
A trail of blood led from the theater. The rifle that authorities believe Holmes used in the attack lay on the ground near the building.
Holmes calmly complied with all Oviatt's orders, the officer testified.
Another officer, Aaron Blue, testified later that Holmes matter-of-factly told him, without prompting, about the complex web of explosives that authorities would later find in his Aurora apartment.
He told Blue that the devices "wouldn't go off unless we set them off."
Holmes was a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, in Aurora, until he withdrew a month before being arrested outside the bullet-riddled movie theater. He had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers.
His only brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police.
If Holmes is ruled incompetent to stand trial, the hearing could provide the best opportunity for victims and the public to understand what happened and why.
To at least one victim, it doesn't matter if Holmes stands trial.
"I obviously don't want him to walk, but as long as he doesn't see the light of day again, it doesn't really much concern me beyond that," said Stephen Barton, who suffered wounds on his face, neck and upper torso in the shooting that night. "To me, I see the trial as being an opportunity to learn more about what happened that night beyond just my own personal recollection."

Reviled for living apart from my kids
By Rahna Reiko Rizzuto, Special to CNN
updated 10:17 AM EDT, Fri May 10, 2013
Rahna Reiko Rizzuto, above, says the case of Brenda Heist has parallels to her own motherhood decisions.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
When Rahna Reiko Rizzuto divorced, her ex-husband got physical custody of kids She lived down the street, seeing boys often, going to PTA, games, helping with homework But she received death threats and was called "garbage" and "worse than Hitler" Rizzuto: Moms leave home for many reasons; we need new models for moms and dads
Editor's note: Rahna Reiko Rizzuto's memoir "Hiroshima in the Morning" is a National Book Critics Circle Finalist. She is also the recipient of an American Book Award and a U.S./Japan Creative Artist Fellowship, and author of "Why She Left Us." She teaches creative writing at Goddard College. Follow her on Twitter @r3reiko
(CNN) -- Eleven years ago, Brenda Heist's marriage fell apart. She was trying to find housing and had been refused financial aid; she was depressed, in despair, crying on a park bench. And then she vanished. What a heartbreaking, terrifying time for her family, who suspected the worst, even declared her legally dead. When she reappeared to great media fanfare last week in Florida, reaction ranged from confusion to scorn.
Eleven years ago, my marriage also ended and I moved down the street, leaving the physical custody of my two sons with my husband.
The public outrage directed at Heist has been eerily similar to the hostility and anger I encountered when I wrote a memoir about it.
Rahna Reiko Rizzuto
In my case, I stayed, co-parenting with my husband, setting rules and attending basketball games and dance shows and parent teacher conferences, and keeping a close, loving relationship with my children. We do homework together; we talk about girls, I teach them to cook (and to clean up!).
But I am a part-time parent, a noncustodial mother. For this decision, I have been threatened with death and sexual violence by strangers. I have been called human "garbage" and "worse than Hitler." And I am still the woman everyone refers to when they are talking about mothers who leave.
The hostility and abuse that is directed at the "mother who leaves" clearly does not depend on her actual leaving. We want our mothers to be long-suffering, to put their children's needs first and their own well-being last if there is time left.
We need her to get dinner on the table and the laundry done and the kids to school and the homework finished and the house clean and the cookies for the bake sale made and the school clothes purchased. Our society is hurting, schools are bankrupt, family finances are squeezed, drugs and guns and sex in the media and international terror are all bombarding our children and the person we designate to help kids negotiate all of this is their mother. It's a big job, too big for one person. Especially when she also has to work, and when she also has a life of her own to care for. But to say that, to act on it, is too much of a threat.
The hostility and abuse that is directed at the 'mother who leaves' clearly does not depend on her actual leaving.Rahna Reiko Rizzuto
I have said it. In my memoir, I took a hard, honest look at my ambivalence about motherhood, at my fears of not being good enough, and the loss of my identity as anything but a mother. My life was changing; my marriage was crumbling; I felt like I was being swallowed up. I loved my children deeply but I could no longer be a full-time mom and I had no other models. How could I remain part of their lives joyfully and not as a stifled, resentful failure? Would we all make it through OK?
Our family evolved. It was not quick and easy, in fact, we groped some and stumbled, but I had the support of their father and my boys are now thriving. When we look at it I realize that our family is not abhorrent or unnatural. It looks very much like many other families that have been through divorce, except Mom is the one who lives down the street.
Even so, once my book was published, I wrote about the backlash: the neighbors who crossed the street to avoid me, the friends who could not forgive me, the outbursts from strangers who asked, "How could you leave your children?" a most nonsensical question in my mind, since I was standing right there.
In the hateful response that followed, I noticed something. Many people very proudly proclaimed that they refused to read what I wrote. The headline of one article -- which I did not write -- was enough for them to form an opinion about what a poor excuse for a human I was.
Son to mom: We did well after you left
Daughter hopes mom 'rots in hell'
They were not interested in learning that there might be any middle ground between "good mother" and "human garbage" or a positive outcome. They would rather claim that I didn't love my children, that I was a narcissist or that I had simply decided parenting was no longer fun.
Their attacks on me were designed to shut me up, but shutting up is the worst thing we can do to motherhood. I know because I have heard from hundreds of women who also left. They write "with tears in my eyes" and "a pain in my heart" "thrilled and flabbergasted to find out there is a woman like you, (like me!) out there."
I have heard from women who were escaping bad relationships, women who had to move for work, women who had been swallowed up in caregiving and enabling. I heard from women who were unfulfilled, unhappy and confused, and others who were paralyzed, frozen, and convinced they were failing their children. They were terrified and guilty about their situation and choices. One woman, who spoke for so many, wrote:
"There is such a horrible stigma to not being a full-time mother, and I tend to shy away from letting the mommies in my online parenting community (which I've been with since they were infants) know that I'm choosing not to have the kids live with me. It's looked at as such a selfish decision, but I chose it because it was truly best for them, even though it does cause me intense pain.
"So again, thank you for speaking up, and giving me reassurance that my kids will not be permanently damaged by not living with me, but that doing the best I can for them and myself will make them more successful in the long run."
Again and again, these women write, "I love my children with all my heart." In many cases, they have realized they are not the better parent -- at least not right now. If we listen when they speak, we might notice that most women live in the unacknowledged space between "stellar mom and wife extraordinaire" and "human garbage." Instead of condemning us and trying to bludgeon us into silence, we need to explore a variety of models for motherhood -- and fatherhood -- that can allow for care and love and support for both the mother and the child.
Brenda Heist sat, in her despair and isolation, crying on a park bench. She says she "snapped." Would she have made a different choice if she knew she was not alone?

Dolphins' Incognito-Martin mess: Is coach Philbin to blame?
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 5:05 PM EST, Thu November 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Allegations surrounding NFL star Richie Incognito are raising questions about coaches
Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin takes responsibility for "workplace atmosphere"
Critics say he should have known and acted sooner
"Inmates run the asylum," a former player says in a report
(CNN) -- Facing mounting criticism over the alleged behavior of one of his players, Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin says the buck stops with him.
"I am in charge of the workplace atmosphere," he said at a news conference.
Philbin said he was unaware of alleged misconduct by Richie Incognito against fellow offensive lineman Jonathan Martin until Martin's representatives informed the team Sunday evening.
"We immediately took those concerns very, very seriously," and informed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to request a review, Philbin said.
Incognito 'crossed the line'
Reporter: Incognito bullied as a child
ESPN also reported that Martin never brought his concerns to Philbin.
But many who know the ins and outs of pro football say Philbin should have known what was going on in his ranks and taken action much sooner.
"The recent developments in the Jonathan Martin-Richie Incognito situation (have)shown us one thing: Joe Philbin is to blame for the turmoil in the Miami Dolphins' locker room," writes Gil Alcaraz of rantsports.com.
"First and foremost, an NFL head coach needs to know what's going on within his own locker room. If there's a player bullying another player, sending him threatening voice mails and text messages while making him feel uncomfortable on a daily basis, the head coach has to be aware of it."
The central allegation against Incognito involves messages to Martin, including a voice mail in which Incognito allegedly used racial slurs, threatened physical violence, and used the words, "I'll kill you." Martin's representatives have turned materials over to the NFL for an investigation.
Incognito allegedly also got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins even though Martin preferred not to travel with them. Martin gave Incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, ESPN reported.
Incognito, on Twitter, accused a news organization of "attaching my name to false speculation," but that tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. Incognito has been suspended; Martin left the team. It's unclear what lies in store for either of them.
Incognito said Tuesday he is "weathering the storm right now."
Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future
Philbin "is ultimately to blame here," Dan Shanoff writes at USAToday. "... Philbin either actively neglected his team culture (his claim) or he knew and did nothing (which would be worse). Let's give him the benefit of the doubt -- at best, he is an appallingly ineffective leader."
The Sun Sentinel reports that Dolphins coaches had asked Incognito to toughen up Martin -- orders he may have taken too far. The report does not say whether Philbin himself made the request.
Philbin did tell players each year to "cut out" rookie hazing, the paper reports.
But how much are NFL coaches really expected to police their teams?
By and large, they "let their players, and especially their seasoned veterans, maintain harmony in the locker room," Ken Belson writes in the New York Times. "In the crudest sense, they are hired to build a winning team, and as long as players do their jobs well, what happens elsewhere is largely immaterial."
"To some extent, the inmates run the asylum," Trevor Pryce, a defensive end who spent 14 years in the NFL, told the Times. "The coaches have a lot of other things to deal with."
No organization speaks for all NFL coaches. The NFL Coaches Association "represents the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches," according to the website of its executive director, David Cornwell. He was not immediately available Wednesday to discuss this issue.
Ricky Williams, who played with Incognito in Miami, said he believes a coach should only step in if behind-the-scenes behavior affects play on the field. "The locker room, we keep coaches out for a reason. It's our space," Williams told KGMZ-FM in San Francisco, according to NFL.com. There is "a lack of leadership in that locker room," he said of the Dolphins.
Some coaches have been credited with taking disturbing behavior seriously.
"Hall of Famer Bill Walsh's coaching tree never tolerated any form of hazing or harassing. Pete Carroll doesn't allow it in Seattle. Jimmy Johnson and Mike Shanahan have said they've never witnessed bullying to the extent that is alleged in this circumstance," NFL.com reports.
As the conflict between Incognito and Martin spirals into a time of reckoning for the entire NFL, league officials face the task of laying out in clear terms just what coaches are responsible for -- and how to punish coaches when their players cross the line.
Philbin has compared running a team to running a school. When his two children go to school each day, "I have certain expectations that the administration, the teachers and the staff are going to create a safe atmosphere where my children can learn and develop as people," he said at his news conference Monday.
"This is no different," he added. "I take this responsibility very seriously."
But even if Philbin shoulders blame for what allegedly transpired in his team, he's not alone, says columnist Jen Floyd Engel of foxsports.com. She points to others in the team's leadership and the players themselves. "(I)t is every person who saw what was happening to Martin and did nothing who deserve our condemnation."
