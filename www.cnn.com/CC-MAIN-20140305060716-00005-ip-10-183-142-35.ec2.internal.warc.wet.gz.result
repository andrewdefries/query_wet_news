WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The latest jobs report, showing far less growth for July than expected, emerged as a flash point on the campaign trail Friday with President Bush's stewardship of the economy long a target of criticism by Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry."We can do better," Kerry declared at a rally in Smithfield, Missouri. "We can put people to work."Bush had a different view. "I say we have a strong economy, and it's getting stronger," he told supporters in Stratham, New Hampshire.Even before the report from the Labor Department was released, Kerry was blasting Bush for his economic policies, saying U.S. jobs have been lost under the GOP administration -- with many going overseas, wage growth was sluggish and millions of employed Americans lack health insurance.After the report was released, Kerry fired again."The president keeps saying we've turned the corner," Kerry said in a written statement. "But unfortunately, today's job numbers further demonstrate that our economy may be taking a U-turn instead. Saying we've turned the corner doesn't make it so. America will not turn the corner to better days until we have a new president who can see our problems and take action to fix them."The Labor Department reported businesses added 32,000 jobs in July, a fraction of the more than 200,000 that many economists expected, and the weakest showing so far this year. (CNN/Money: A hiring shock) The unemployment rate -- based on a separate survey -- dipped slightly to 5.5 percent in July from 5.6 percent in June.The Bush administration said the July jobs report must be viewed in the broader context of an economy on the mend. And they pointed to a gain of 10,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector in July."We've seen nine months of growth," Labor Secretary Elaine Chao told CNNfn on Friday. "Not consecutive, but nine months in employment growth in the manufacturing sector in the last 12 months."Still, Greg Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the administration wants to see stronger jobs growth."We are not satisfied with the level of job creation we saw today," he said."The economy is creating jobs. It is moving forward but not at a rapid enough pace."In New Hampshire, Bush declared: "I'm not going to be satisfied until everybody who wants to work can find a job."In an earlier appearance before a conference of minority journalists that Kerry had addressed the day before, Bush didn't deviate much from his campaign stump speech, citing his efforts to strengthen an economy that he described as ailing when he took office and later battered by terrorist attacks.The tax cuts he pushed and Congress passed, Bush insisted, have jump-started the economy.Chao also emphasized that a separate survey of households -- which unemployment figures are based on -- showed 629,000 more people at work than in June. The jobs report is based on a separate survey of employers."I think there has been a debate which survey should be focused on more," she said. "Both surveys are trending positive and show jobs growth."But Kerry economic advisers pointed out that the administration had emphasized the employer survey in March when it showed strong job growth while the household survey indicated a decline in employment. They said that even with the jobs growth now being reported, the administration will see a net decline in employment during its tenure."This year may be President Bush's best year; it would have been President Clinton's worst year," Kerry economic adviser Aida Alvarez told CNNfn.The Democratic National Committee released details Friday about a new television ad it was launching, tying U.S. plant closures and "outsourcing" of jobs to Bush's tax policies.

Commentary: Selecting a Supreme Court justice is an artStory Highlights Emma Coleman Jordan is professor of law at Georgetown University Coleman Jordan worked on nomination process of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Sonia Sotomayor faces tough Senate hearings, Coleman Jordan writes "We can only count on her diligent preparation to face partisan interest," she saysNext Article in Politics » By Emma Coleman Jordan Emma Coleman Jordan is a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. She was a White House fellow in 1980-81, serving as special assistant to the attorney general and working on the nomination process of Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Supreme Court justice. She was also counsel to Professor Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in 1992. Emma Coleman Jordan says Sonia Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial. (ESSENCE) -- As Judge Sonia Sotomayor prepares to become the next U.S. Supreme Court justice, her lifetime of diligence and speed reading will now be crucial to help her navigate the next phase of her nomination. From here on out, she will be silent. We will not hear her voice again until she sits before the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the spring of 1981, I was this African-American progressive Democrat, a female law professor chosen to work as a White House fellow assigned to Republican Attorney General William French Smith. I was one of three special assistants working directly on the search for the replacement to Justice Potter Stewart, which led to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination. I was responsible for preparing briefing books for Attorney General Smith's chief of staff, Kenneth Starr, before the O'Connor nomination was announced, so I know precisely what Judge Sotomayor will experience in the next 60 days. ESSENCE: Obama's Sotomayor decision The judge will be working feverishly with a team of lawyers from the Office of the White House Counsel, Gregory Craig, the Office of the Vice President, and the Justice Department. After her press conference with the president last week, more than likely she went straight to a briefing session in which she was given several thick briefing books, filled with memos that identify the most difficult questions of constitutional law that the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. ESSENCE: Obama's mentor weighs in on nomination The list of issues she will address will certainly include, but will not be limited to, questions about presidential power. The intense recent debate on the limits of presidential authorization for "enhanced interrogation techniques," closing Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and domestic wiretapping will surely produce a slew of questions. Don't Miss More from What Matters ESSENCE: What Matters
In Depth: Obama's Supreme Court nominee
The lines of attack by outside interest groups are already beginning to take shape, but Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial. So those who oppose her nomination will likely be forced to create a fusion between her personal story of educational mobility through affirmative action and her judicial views. They will try to take the president's selection criterion of "empathy" and turn it against Sotomayor as a sword to accuse her of being a race- and identity-sensitive ideologue. It helps considerably that her nomination comes at the beginning of the first term of a popular, media-savvy president. In this way, she is in the same position as Sandra Day O'Connor was when her nomination was announced in July 1981, at the beginning of President Reagan's first term. When I first saw O'Connor's résumé, before the nomination became public, I thought, there are too many gaps here. What did she do right after law school? Why had she never practiced law with a major law firm? Why had she chosen to be an elected politician? The missing elements I was looking for were things that cannot be captured in a résumé, like the fact that this brilliant woman was once prohibited from entering the practice of law, even though she graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School. Watch more What Matters content Her résumé did not include information on her own experience of exclusion and discrimination -- life experiences she would later call upon when it was time for her to cast the deciding vote against ending affirmative action in higher education in 2003. Selecting a Supreme Court justice is an art, not a science. This isn't just about checking a box. It's a judgment call the president has made based on many things, including those personal experiences and a sense of chemistry between the president and the nominee. ESSENCE: Blacks in the White House The Sotomayor hearings may give us a peek into her personal background. But the likelihood is that we won't really learn how her own experiences will have an impact on her legal reasoning as a justice. For now, we can only count on her diligent preparation to face partisan interest groups who will try to distort her identity and her record. Prepare to see the future justice-in-the-making. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Emma Coleman Jordan.

Travel affected as winter storm rolls across the South By the CNN Wire Staff About 2 inches of snow had fallen in Atlanta's Grant Park area a couple of hours after it started Sunday night, iReporter Cody Wellons said. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: States of emergencies are declared in Louisiana, Alabama and GeorgiaAirlines are beginning to cancel flightsSnow, ice and freezing temperatures are expected across the southeastern U.S.Weather conditions in Atlanta could impact air travel across the countryCheck weather and airport delays with our travel tracker. (CNN) -- A major winter storm system was rolling across the southeastern United States early Monday, sending out shocks of snow, freezing rain and sleet, and forcing some airlines to cancel flights. AirTran Airways canceled 14 flights Sunday, most of them heading into Atlanta, in order to have fewer aircraft on the ground there at the time the storm hits, spokesman Christopher White said. Another 270 flights were canceled for Monday, which represents a majority of the Atlanta-bound flights for the airline. There will be a handful of arrivals and departures only, White said. The latest computer models show wintry weather extending from northeast Texas through the Carolinas, bringing freezing temperatures, snow and ice to areas that normally don't see heavy winter precipitation, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. The northern regions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas should expect heavy snow, while ice storms are expected to affect the southern regions of those states, he said. Forecasters expect freezing rain to move north in those states, possibly by Monday morning. Meanwhile, American Airlines reported that 100 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth were canceled. That's about 20% of American's flights. Its American Eagle carrier has canceled 180 flights. South braces for wintery storm

"That sounds ominous, but in the big picture it could be far worse," spokesman Tim Smith said. He added later that the snow was not as bad as was forecast and that Dallas "really dodged a bullet." Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said the airline expects to operate normally in Atlanta until Sunday night, after which some 330 mainline and Delta Connection flights will be canceled. Nationwide, "we have planned approximately 1,400 Delta and Delta Connection flight cancellations systemwide Monday as the storm is at its peak, approximately 25% of all planned flights for the day," Black said. Southwest Airlines reported it is running at normal capacity with no major cancellations. Track weather and travel delays Atlantic Southeast Airlines spokesman Jarek Beem said the storm had forced a number of cancellations, Sunday through Tuesday. He declined to provide a specific number. Below freezing temperatures through Tuesday could leave trees and power lines across the south with a heavy coating of ice, said Hennen, which could cause numerous long-duration power outages. Winter storm warnings covered much of the Southeast as the storm system developed Sunday morning in Texas and tracked along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. The agency warns that significant snow amounts could make travel difficult and dangerous. Three to eight inches of snow could fall by Monday evening and roads are expected to be hazardous through Monday night, especially secondary roads. Various winter storm watches have also been put in place by the weather agency, stretching from northeast Texas to the far western corner of Virginia. In preparation for wintry conditions, governors in Louisiana and Alabama declared states of emergencies, according to the governor's office in Alabama and CNN affiliate KSLA in Baton Rouge. "We face a serious storm that will have an impact all across Alabama," Gov. Bob Riley said in a statement. He advised motorists to stay the roads. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue similarly issued a state of emergency. Snow began falling in Atlanta during the evening hours Sunday, and is forecast to accumulate through Monday afternoon. Temperatures at or below freezing are expected to remain in place through Tuesday, keeping roads dangerous and travel difficult, Hennen said. Parts of Louisiana could get up to an inch of ice, while other states in the region could get between a quarter and a half-inch of ice coating power lines, trees, bridges and roadways, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. In Alabama, Auburn University canceled classes and viewing events for the BCS championship game on Monday night. Meanwhile, snow moved into the Northeast but the region was spared a repeat of the Christmas blizzard that virtually shut down large cities such as New York and Philadelphia. Emergency management officials were able to quickly recover from the comparably light dusting of snow that began blanketing the region Friday.CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Airliner was originally sold in 1985, a Boeing spokeswoman says
Number of people on flight raised to 127, officials said
The flight data recorder is recovered at the crash site in Islamabad
Crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in Islamabad and Karachi
Are you there? Send your stories, video Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A commercial airplane carrying 127 people crashed Friday in Islamabad just before it was to land at a nearby airport, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, which cited poor weather as a possible factor.
No survivors have been found, officials said.
The Bhoja Air Boeing 737-200 had been making its first evening flight from Karachi to Islamabad, where the weather was cloudy, officials said.
Authorities twice changed the number people reported to be on board, but by Friday afternoon appeared to agree on the figure.
The crash occurred near the Chaklala airbase, a military site used by the country's air force, which is adjacent to the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad.
Debris and body parts were scattered across the crash site as workers sifted through the wreckage in the heavily populated residential area. Four villages were affected by the crash and debris from the plane has been recovered within a kilometer of the site, Interior Minister A Rehman Malik said in a interview with Pakistani media.
At least 110 bodies have been recovered from the scene, while more than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad.
World's deadliest plane crashes
The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said.

Darkness, rain hampers recovery efforts
The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3½-hour flight.
Local authorities say the crash site is located about five aeronautical miles from the airport in Islamabad.
Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos.
Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage.
Investigators are "going to be looking at technology," aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. "What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident."
Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed "deep shock and grief over the tragedy," ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority "to gear up all its resources for rescue operation," state media reported.
A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families.
A Boeing spokeswoman, meanwhile, said the American manufacturer "stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan."
The airliner was originally sold in 1985, said Julie O'Donnell.
"The Boeing Company wishes to extend its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost today in the Bhoja Air accident in Pakistan, as well as wishes for the recovery of those injured," said O'Donnell.
Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated "an immediate investigation."
"Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy is something that we can't confirm yet," Sethi said.
But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the "aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy."
The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010,when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. That plane was also was coming from Karachi when it crashed into a hillside while trying to land, officials said at the time.
Four years earlier, another airliner crashed in central Pakistan, leaving 45 dead.
The first known commercial passenger airplane crash occurred in Pakistan in 1953 when a Canadian Pacific DH-106 Comet crashed shortly after takeoff from Karachi. That crash killed 11 people on board.

How MIT could help you pour ketchup
By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 12:07 PM EDT, Wed May 30, 2012 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
MIT professor and his students invent nonstick coating that makes ketchup slide out of the bottle
LiquiGlide is made from edible, nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into food containers
A YouTube video of the ketchup bottle in action has been viewed more than 125,000 times
(CNN) -- The video is as short as it is surprising. A hand tilts a glass bottle containing a red glob of ketchup, which -- instead of oozing out in slow motion or getting stuck -- slides out easily, leaving the bottle nearly spotless.
Posted last week, the 20-second clip has been viewed more than 125,000 times on YouTube, prompting dozens of news stories and brightening the spirits of impatient ketchup lovers everywhere.
But it's not exactly what Kripa Varanasi had in mind when he and his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set out to develop a new kind of slippery coating that would help de-ice planes, or keep water droplets from sticking to steam turbines in power plants.
"I never thought a ketchup bottle would make us this famous," said Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. "We were all focused on [solving] the big problems, like water and energy."
But one of the goals of Varanasi's MIT lab is to develop potential commercial products, not just publish research in academic journals. The coating, which he and his graduate students call LiquiGlide, seemed more immediately viable as a food-packaging product, he said.
LiquiGlide is made from a secret cocktail of edible, nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into bottles or other food containers. Videos on the LiquiGlide site show it working its slippery magic on plastic bottles of jelly and mustard, too.
"You could literally scratch it off and eat it," Varanasi told CNN in an interview. "It's that safe."
LiquiGlide first gained attention earlier this month at MIT's $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, an annual forum for launching academic projects into the commercial marketplace, where it won an Audience Award. Now Varanasi and his students are fielding interview requests, talking to bottling companies, filing for patents and planning to launch a startup this summer. An MIT grad student, Dave Smith, will serve as CEO, Varanasi said.
As Varanasi sees it, LiquiGlide offers several benefits: It's more convenient for consumers, and it makes recycling easier because the bottles are clean. It also wastes less food, because people won't be tossing out bottles coated with mustard that they can't squeeze out.
He also believes LiquiGlide has practical applications beyond condiments, such as high-end cosmetics. Who wants to waste precious drops of $50 hand lotion because they can't get the stuff out of the bottle?
"It works on everything we've tried so far," Smith told CNN.
Varanasi and his students hope to have their product on supermarket shelves within two years. Right now they have momentum on their side, thanks to a deceptively simple idea, a niche nobody realized needed filling -- and a little video.
"It just went viral," Varanasi said. "The video sold it."

Apple design chief: We nearly scrapped iPhone
By Rory Anderson, Special to CNN
updated 5:26 AM EDT, Fri August 3, 2012 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
Apple design chief Jonathan Ive chats with Kate Middleton at a business event in London on July 30.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Designer Sir Jonathan Ive said Apple almost gave up on iPhone "multiple times"
Over 200 million iPhones have been sold since 2007 There are an estimated 170 million iPhone users across the world
Ive said scrapping products during production stage is not uncommon
London (CNN) -- It is the device, arguably, that led the smartphone revolution.
But according to Apple's head of design, the iPhone was very nearly scrapped before it ever made it to the shelves.
In a speech this week at a business-themed event here, British-born designer Sir Jonathan Ive caused a stir when he said that Apple almost gave up on the iPhone "multiple times" before its launch in 2007.
Ive said problems with early models of the phone seemed so fundamental that even Apple's brightest minds struggled to solve them.

iPad's Smart Cover might get its own flexible display
"With the early prototypes, I held the phone to my ear and my ear would dial the number," he said. "You have to detect all sorts of ear-shapes and chin shapes, skin color and hairdo. That was one of just many examples where we really thought, 'Perhaps this isn't going to work.'"
The designer, who once claimed the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was his "best friend," spoke at an Olympics-themed business event. Among the guests in attendance was Kate Middleton, the glamorous Duchess of Cambridge.
It seems almost inconceivable now that Apple might have given up on its massively popular iPhone before it was born. More than 200 million iPhones have been sold since Apple first launched the device five years ago, and there are an estimated 170 million iPhone users across the world.
But Ive said it was not uncommon for Apple to scrap "incredibly compelling" devices at the production stage if they were not considered game changing, or the design problems were considered deep-seated.
"We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production and in a room and realized we are talking a little too loud about the virtues of something," he said. "That to me is always the danger, if I'm trying to talk a little too loud about something and realizing I'm trying to convince myself that something's good."
Far along in the development process, Steve Jobs famously ordered Ive's designers to change the look of the iPhone, scrapping its aluminum case for a stainless steel bezel that made the touchscreen display more prominent, according to Walter Isaacson's recent biography of the mercurial Apple CEO.
"You have that horrible, horrible feeling deep down in your tummy and you know that it's OK but it's not great," Ive said Monday. "And I think some of the bravest things we've ever done are really at that point when you say, 'That's good and it's competent, but it's not great.'"
Turn any surface into a touchscreen Meanwhile, photos have emerged on the Web purporting to show parts of the next iPhone, informally dubbed iPhone 5, which is expected to launch in September. The new device is expected to have a bigger screen, a smaller charging dock and a case made from an alloy called LiquidMetal.
As usual, Apple has refused to confirm the rumored September 12 launch date or any details about the look or features of the new device.

Dandelion tires? It's not a Beatles lyric, it's biotech
By Nick Glass and Tim Hume, CNN
updated 11:17 AM EST, Fri February 15, 2013 | STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A Dutch biotech company is developing dandelions for commercial rubber production
The flowers roots contain latex, a potential source of natural rubber
The company uses DNA profiling to identify beneficial mutations and "improve" the crop
It says its methods are different from GM as it does not introduce genes from other species
Wageningen, The Netherlands (CNN) -- The dandelion's bright yellow bloom and fuzzy, parachute-like seeds are a familiar sight across the continents.
But scientists at Dutch biotech firm KeyGene believe the flower's true beauty could lie beneath the soil.
The dandelion's roots contain latex, the milky liquid that is a source for natural rubber and the origin for the plant's name in a number of languages (the Danish for "dandelion" translates as "milk pot").
Global demand for natural rubber is expected to outstrip supply by 20% by 2020. But KeyGene believes that the dandelion can be developed into an important natural source of the commodity, worth more than $100 billion a year.
The dandelion's roots are smaller than ideal for commercial rubber production. So KeyGene is putting the plant through a process of plant phenotyping in order to develop a variety of dandelion with a fatter root and higher yield, that would be better suited for industrial processing.
We're making and developing a better rubber dandelion, which produces more rubber because of an increased sizeKeyGene CEO Arjen Van Tunen
"We are making ... crosses between the Russian dandelion and the common dandelion using those modern DNA profiling technologies," says KeyGene CEO Arjen Van Tunen. "We're making and developing a better rubber dandelion, which produces more rubber because of an increased size."

The company's process, he said, involved analyzing different specimens of a given crop in its greenhouses, scanning them for mutations that delivered beneficial characteristics in terms of yield, quality, sustainability or tolerance to drought and disease.
The genetic material of strains with desirable characteristics was then isolated and sequenced to create improved crops -- fungus-resistant wheat, high-yield rye, or heat-resistant cabbage -- that were "better suited for the conditions" of the future, he said.
Scientists hope that in as little as five to 10 years, rubber tires like the ones on these bicycles will be able to be produced from latex harvested from dandelions.
The latex contained in the roots of the dandelion can be used to produce natural rubber.
The roots of the dandelion are rich in latex, but are too small to be harvested effectively. By crossing genetic material from Russian dandelion and the common dandelion using DNA technology, scientists at Dutch biotech firm KeyGene hope to create a more commercially viable crop with larger roots.

With the global population tipped to hit nine billion by 2050, he said, and a growing proportion switching to animal protein, agricultural production would need to be doubled to feed the planet. Creating improved crops -- such as those that could return higher yields on more marginal land -- was essential to achieving this, he said.
Multinational tire manufacturer Apollo Vredestein also thinks dandelion rubber has potential, and is collaborating on the project with KeyGene. Peter Snel, Apollo Vredestein's research and development director, said prototype tires had already been produced.
Commercial dandelion tires were likely to be ready for production in as little as five to ten years, "as soon as material is ready in volume to be put in to tires," he said.
Snel was confident that harvesting rubber from the tiny flowers would be economically viable.
"Raw materials are a big part in the cost price of tires," he said. "Investment in this will pay back."
We are taking advantage of the natural evolution process and speeding it upKeyGene CEO Arjen Van Tunen

Van Tunen said the KeyGene's methods were a quicker and cheaper way of improving crops than genetic modification -- and differed from that process in one crucial aspect.
"We don't introduce a gene from a different species into our crops. We always take advantage of DNA that is already in that species itself," said Van Tunen.
"You might say we speed up the natural breeding system that is all ready there for hundreds of years ... We are taking advantage of the natural evolution process and speeding it up."
That was an important distinction for some of the company's customers, as there remained "a lot of resistance in Europe" to genetic modification, he said.
"Many of the growers in Europe want genetically improved crops, but not GM crops. So for them we can provide an alternative," he said. "We have developed a number of technologies which enable us to very quickly genetically improve crops in a very natural way without crossing the species barriers, but still achieving the yield improvements or the resistance improvements."

Heleno: The man who could have been Pele?
By Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 11:07 AM EDT, Wed July 24, 2013
Actor Rodrigo Santoro signs a poster for the film "Heleno", in which he plays the mercurial striker. A destructive personality, together with illness and drug problems prevented Heleno from becoming one of Brazil's greatest ever players. But he helped pave the way for some of the world's greatest soccer icons...
Ask many Brazilians who is the greatest footballer of all time and their answer will be simple: "Pele." The striker won three World Cups with Brazil between 1958 and 1970 and is his country's leading goalscorer with 77 goals from 92 caps.
Most football fans would say Argentina's Diego Maradona is the only player who can rival Pele for the title of greatest ever. In Brazil, however, Garrincha is regarded as the only player who comes close to the great man. The tricky winger was a key part of Brazil's World Cup triumphs in 1958 and 1962. Sadly, Garrincha struggled with alcohol problems and died of liver cirrhosis aged 49.
After a Pele-inspired triumph in 1970, Brazil would wait 24 years before lifting the World Cup again. Although the 1980s was a barren decade in terms of trophies for Brazil, the team which the South Americans sent to the 1982 World Cup is heralded as one of the most entertaining in history. Central to its free-flowing, attacking style was Zico, a midfielder of considerable craft and guile who collected 72 caps between 1976 and 1988.
When Brazil finally won the World Cup for a fourth time in 1994 in the U.S., the team was derided by some for being too functional. In a team short of star quality, striker Romario was the shining light, scoring five goals as Brazil lifted the trophy thanks to a penalty-shootout victory over Italy.
Ronaldo watched on as Romario fired Brazil to victory in 1994, four years later he was the star man at France 1998. Brazil lost the final 3-0 to the hosts, with mystery surrounding their starting 11 as Ronaldo was left out of, then reinstated to, the team for the deciding match at the Stade de France. Ronaldo's redemption arrived in 2002, when he scored both goals as Brazil beat Germany 2-0 to lift the World Cup for a fifth time.
While Ronaldo was the star man in Japan and South Korea, he was ably supported by flamboyant playmaker Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho's performance in the World Cup earned him a move to Barcelona in 2003, where he went on to win the European Champions League in 2006. He was twice named FIFA World Player of the Year.
The latest Brazilian tipped for stardom is Neymar, who recently followed in Ronaldinho's footsteps by joining Barcelona. All eyes will be on the forward when Brazil host the World Cup in 2014. Neymar has made a good start to Brazil's Confederations Cup campaign, scoring two goals in two matches.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Heleno de Freitas was one of Brazil's first soccer stars
Striker starred for Botafogo in Rio de Janeiro in the 1940s, scoring over 200 goals
Heleno missed out on the 1950 World Cup after pointing a gun at Brazil's coach
He died aged just 39 after struggling with syphilis and drug problems
Editor's note: (CNN) -- Women wanted him. Men wanted to be him.
Seven decades before Neymar, a world away from Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, a predecessor to Zico and Socrates and a formidable striker who could have rivaled Pele.
That man was Heleno de Freitas, a soccer superstar in the days before Brazil ruled the "beautiful game."
He was a larger than life playboy who abandoned a legal career to become his country's finest footballer. And before the Maracana -- Brazil's iconic stadium in Rio de Janeiro -- was built, Heleno was the city's star attraction with a "Jekyll and Hyde" personality which saw him flit from outrageous charmer to disruptive egoist.

"Sometimes he was a gentleman, other times you couldn't stand him," explains Marcos Eduardo Neves, author of "There was never a man like Heleno."
"Like the book by R.L. Stevenson, he was a doctor and a monster," Neves told CNN.
Heleno is best remembered for his nine-year spell with Rio club Botafogo, scoring over 200 goals for the team between 1939 and 1948 to become one of South America's most feared strikers.

But his career, much like his life, was tinged with tragedy, as circumstance and his ability to press the self-destruct button prevented him from capturing any significant silverware as a player.
"He grew up knowing he wanted to be a football player," says Neves. "When he moved from Minas Gerais to Rio he marveled at beach football and Botafogo ... His will became an obsession."
An affluent background had afforded Heleno the opportunity to train as a lawyer, but the courtroom could not contain his football talent or his vibrant personality.

Pele: Mourinho is 'good for Chelsea'
"He had a big ego and his soul craved the screams of thousands of football supporters," Neves says.
"He loved his star status, being an international idol, playing for his national team and being desired by women and admired by men.
"He thought his fame would be eternal. He believed he would be Heleno de Freitas forever."
Arguably Heleno's crowning moment -- Brazil's crowning moment -- should have come at the 1950 World Cup.
It was the first time Brazil had hosted the tournament -- next year the World Cup returns to the South American nation for a second time-- and it was an opportunity for the country to announce itself as a global power, both on and off the pitch.
With the grandest of stages -- the Maracana -- constructed, Heleno's public awaited.
But when 200,000 Brazilians packed into the stadium for an agonizing defeat to Uruguay in the tournament's final match, Heleno was nowhere to be seen.
Read: The football-mad nation that had it all
"Because of World War II, Heleno missed out on the World Cups of 1942 and 1946," explained Neves. "The 1950 World Cup was his last chance, given his physical and technical peak. But he wasted it."
Moacyr Barbosa Nascimento's life was forever changed after the 1950 World Cup. With Brazil needing just a draw against Uruguay in its final game to lift the trophy for the first time, the team lost 2-1 and he was blamed for the second goal. The goalkeeper's perceived mistake haunted him. Twenty years later he overheard a woman in a supermarket say to her son, "There is the man who made Brazil cry."
The Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro was the venue for the 1950 final, with 200,000 spectators packed into the purpose-built arena. The stadium has been redeveloped and a crowd of 78,000 people will watch the final of 2014 World Cup at the iconic ground.
All eyes will be on Neymar during both June's Confederations Cup and next year's World Cup. The attacker, who recently signed for Barcelona in a deal reportedly worth in excess of $80 million, is Brazil's star player and must perform to his best if "La Selecao" are to satisfy an expectant public.
The Brazil team of 1970, which beat Italy 4-1 in the World Cup final in Mexico, is widely regarded as the greatest of all time. Pele, a three-time World Cup winner seen here leaping on his teammates, says Brazil must recover from the failure of 63 years ago.
Carlos Alberto, captain of the 1970 team, lifts the Jules Rimet trophy which Brazil was allowed to keep after becoming the first nation to win the World Cup three times. The former fullback thinks next year's World Cup will come too soon for Brazil's inexperienced team.
Luiz Felipe Scolari was the coach of the last Brazil team to lift the World Cup, in Japan and South Korea in 2002. The veteran has been reappointed in a bid to inject life into an ailing Brazil team. His results have so far left much to be desired: two wins, one defeat and four draws since November 2012.
England was Brazil's first opponent at a refurbished Maracana earlier this month. A half-volley from midfielder Paulinho, pictured, rescued a 2-2 draw for the 2014 World Cup host.
Brazil's most recent match, the last before the Confederations Cup starts, ended in a comfortable 3-0 defeat of France. A penalty from Lucas Moura, right, completed the scoring.

Brazil's most painful moment
Hours after declaring himself saddened by the need for protests against Brazil's social conditions, Neymar brought joy to his compatriots with the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Mexico. A family of four negotiate their way to the game as riot police prevent protesters from gaining access to Fortaleza's Castelao Stadium. Protesters confront riot police officers on the distant outskirts of the Castelao Stadium, which has been newly built for next year's World Cup at a cost of $240 million.

Confederations Cup: Brazil beats Mexico as Fortaleza protests
In 1949 Heleno was playing for Vasco Da Gama, having spent the previous year living the high life in Argentina with Boca Juniors -- with his spell in Buenos Aires rumored to have even included a fling with Argentina's then First Lady, Eva "Evita" Peron.
Heleno's coach at Vasco was Flavio Costa, who was also in charge of the Brazil national team.
But Costa criticized the attitude of his combustible star and Heleno's response was typically trigger happy.
He pointed a gun to Costa's head and pulled the trigger. The gun wasn't loaded, but that action was enough to kill Heleno's dreams of playing in the World Cup.
Vasco won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship, but by now Heleno was an outcast.
When Brazil was left heartbroken by a 2-1 defeat to Uruguay which destroyed its World Cup dreams, Heleno was playing in Colombia's lucrative illegal leagues.
"For the fans, Brazil lost the World Cup because they didn't have Heleno," says Neves. "Brazil feared a valiant Uruguay. With Heleno, it wouldn't be like this. He didn't fear anyone or anything.
"They say that, in 1951, Heleno used to say he could have saved Brazil," says Jose Henrique Fonseca, director of the biographical film "Heleno," which was released in 2011.
By the time Brazil, led by the precocious talents of Pele and Garrincha, finally won the World Cup for the first time in Sweden in 1958, Heleno was hurtling towards an early grave.
Tahiti form a huddle before their showdown with World and European champions Spain. The minnows are ranked 137 places below their opponents and eventually lost their Confederations Cup match 10-0 in Brazil.

Tahiti had huge support among the 71,000 crowd at the famous Maracana stadium in Rio, from a clutch of their own supporters, as well as the neutral fans who threw their weight firmly behind the underdogs.
Fernando Torres grabbed four goals in Spain's victory, but the biggest cheer of the night came when he missed a second half penalty.

Tahiti's mission impossible
Luiz Felipe Scolari first took over Brazil in 2001, turning around their 2002 World Cup qualification campaign and leading them to a record fifth tournament win in Japan and South Korea.
"Big Phil" also enjoyed a degree of success in charge of Portugal. When the Iberians hosted Euro 2004 all appeared to be going to plan as Portugal reached the final. But Scolari and his team were beaten 1-0 by underdogs Greece in the Lisbon final.
Portugal bounced back and reached the last four of the 2006 World Cup in Germany. But Scolari's team ran into a Zinedine Zidane-inspired France in the semifinals, with "Zizou" scoring the winning penalty.
Chelsea's oligarch owner Roman Abramovich hired Scolari in 2008. Despite Scolari's Chelsea starting the season in fine attacking form, he was fired in February 2009 after a run of poor results.
Scolari joined Sao Paulo-based Palmeiras in 2010. With his team struggling, Scolari departed the club in September. Palmeiras were consequently relegated to Brazil's second tier.

The career of Luiz Felipe Scolari
"Heleno became a walking bomb ready to explode. Syphilis and drugs just amplified his self-destruction," Neves says.
"He had a good upbringing, he was elegant, educated and from a good family. He could have enjoyed a career as a lawyer or diplomat -- instead he suffered a pathetic death in a mental institution."
Heleno died on November 8, 1959, aged just 39.
"He was a victim of his refusal to be treated for syphilis and if untreated it affects the brain," Fonseca told CNN.
"He suffered a lot. To see a photo of him when he died is amazing, he looked 70 years old."
Could Heleno, free from disease and drug addiction, have carved out a legacy as formidable as Pele, who is widely regarded as the greatest player who has ever lived?
"Pele is one of a kind, like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and surfer Kelly Slater are," says Neves. "But Heleno would be more recognized worldwide. Maybe at the level of a Zico, Romario and Ronaldo."
For Brazil, much like the tale of the 1950 World Cup final, Heleno's story is one of what might have been.

Scientists confirm new element 115 after atoms collide
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 8:20 AM EDT, Thu August 29, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Researchers created it by slamming atoms into each other
The new element vanished quickly, giving off a flash of radiation
With 115 protons, atoms of the new element are much heavier than gold or lead
Uranium is the heaviest naturally existing atom; heavier ones are made in labs
(CNN) -- As though it wasn't hard enough to memorize the names and atomic weights of 117 elements in the periodic table, scientists have now confirmed a new one.
Researchers from Lund University in Sweden created it by slamming atoms of one element, calcium, into atoms of another called americium.
The newly formed element vanished quickly in a flash of radiation that scientists could measure.
That flash, or "fingerprint," confirmed the existence of an element with 115 protons at its center. That would give it the atomic number of 115 on the periodic table, the list of all elements known to humanity.
The Swedes were the second group of scientists to create the element. A group of Russian scientists put together the same type of atom in 2004.
But the new experiment corroborated their work and confirmed 115's existence.
Still, this doesn't mean that you'll see element 115 on the next periodic table poster that gets published. The discovery still has to be approved by a committee composed of members of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. This working group will determine whether the existing evidence is enough to justify adding the element to the table, or if more proof is required.
Super-heavy element
The more protons an atom has, the higher its number on the periodic table. And with 115 protons, this new element earns the moniker "super-heavy element."
For the sake of comparison, an atom of lead only has 82 protons. Gold has just 79.
But you won't find a chunk of element 115 lying around anywhere.
The highest-numbered element on the periodic chart that exists in nature is uranium, which has 92 protons at its core. However, trace amounts of plutonium and neptunium have been found naturally as well.

"All elements with larger proton numbers have been created artificially in nuclear reactions," says the Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, where the Swedish scientists made element 115.
That means more than two dozen of all the known elements were artificially created.
Why create elements that disappear in a flash? Scientists hope one day to make one that doesn't, thus creating a brand new lasting element, Popular Science magazine reports.
But for this particular element, the researchers assert on their website, "any practical implications are seemingly far fetched."
The Swedish scientists have not given element 115 a name yet.
Until they do, it has a temporary name: "Ununpentium." That may be harder to memorize than "element 115," but it is a scientific term made from Latin and Greek that basically means 1-1-5.

Income inequality and Google Maps
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 12:50 PM EST, Thu November 7, 2013
The poorer side of Lake Providence, Louisiana, south of the lake, does not appear in Google Street View.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Readers notice the poor side of a town isn't mapped with Google Street View
John Sutter asks whether there is a trend with mapping and income
Google: "We try to cover as many streets as possible"
Sutter asks readers to send in examples from their communities Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion and head of CNN's Change the List project. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+. E-mail him at ctl@cnn.com.
(CNN) -- America's rich generally have better schools, tidier parks and (surprisingly enough) more trees. But are their neighborhoods also more likely to be mapped by Google?
That's the question two readers asked after I published a series of stories on East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, which I called "the most unequal place in America," based on its extraordinary level of income inequality.
The readers noticed something I hadn't: The rich side of Lake Providence, which is the largest town in the parish, is mapped in detail by Google Street View; the poor side isn't.
"After reading I your article, I wanted to see where this Lake Providence in Louisiana is. So I went to Google map and found it," wrote Sam Patadia, a 63-year-old in Houston. "Then I decided to look at the town through Google street view to see the houses there but I was surprised to find that even Google discriminates against poor. They have the street view of most of the northern part of the town but very little on the south side though the south side has more streets."
John D. Sutter
"I found it interesting that Google did not drive thru the streets on the south side like they did on the north side," another person wrote. "Maybe I am viewing in wrong but it appears that even Google divided the area."
So why map the rich side and not the poor?
I have all sorts of guesses, but Google is the only one with answers.
Unfortunately, the company wasn't much help.
"We try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two -- for example there may have been road work that day, a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street," a Google spokeswoman said in an e-mail to me. "It's also possible that we did drive a certain street, but discovered that when processing the imagery, the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows, poor visibility conditions, etc.
"Hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date."
Hopefully so. Because I don't particularly buy those arguments. The odds that an entire side of the town -- a small town, sure, but still a town -- would be under construction or would be photographed during an extreme weather event strikes me as implausible.
The streets on the poor side of Lake Providence are generally narrower and harder to navigate than those on the north, so maybe that had something to do with it. Maybe fear is a factor. Perhaps the driver taking these images didn't want to drive through the poor side of town with cameras tacked to his roof. Maybe it was racism, since the poor side is largely black. Or maybe Google prioritizes areas based on the number of businesses there or the number of times Internet users search for addresses in that zone.
Those are just theories, of course, and Susan Cadrecha, a Google spokeswoman, said none of them are accurate. Lake Providence was last mapped in 2008, she said, and it is unclear why the driver mapped one side of town and not the other. The region, and Louisiana as a whole, are less mapped than the company would like, she said.
"It wasn't for any reason about the demographics or anything like that -- or it being a poor area," she told me. "That does not factor into our decisions in any way to map areas. We're constantly updating this imagery and we're constantly trying to make it as accurate as possible ... We want the whole world to be mapped, that's our eventual goal. We want people to be able to explore different areas."
And maybe I'm being unfair by raising this line of questioning. Google is a private company, even though its services, including maps, have started to feel so important that they're almost like public goods. It would make sense in a profit-minded way that they would provide Street View in places where it's most needed or most likely to be used. That's probably the reason only select parts of Africa are mapped with Street View, while much of North America and Europe are. (I asked Google what percentage of the United States is mapped with Street View and have not received a response; the company would say Street View is available in more than 3,000 cities and 54 countries, plus the Arctic and Antarctica. Google Street View cars have driven more than 6 million "unique miles" since the project kicked off in 2007, the company said). Technology costs money, and people with money tend to drive the development and deployment of tech.
Plus, Lake Providence is just one little place, one example floating in an ocean of data. There are numerous counterpoints. You can search street view in the Bronx and the south side of Chicago. In 2011, I wrote about a fascinating photography project called "A New American Picture" that used Street View to highlight poverty. That project includes Google-sourced images of poor neighborhoods in New Jersey, California, Illinois, Texas, Arkansas, Maryland, New Mexico, Florida and elsewhere.
Cadrecha told me Google added Street View functionality to Skid Row in Los Angeles earlier this year.
So, there are poor neighborhoods on Street View. Plenty. But it is somewhat amazing to me that in this one little town -- the one that happens to be the most economically divided in the country -- the divisions extend into the very way the place is mapped.
Maybe that has real implications for life there, and maybe it doesn't. It's certainly easier to find a new place if you can take a digital look at where you're headed. It may matter more for how outsiders, like those who e-mailed me, see the town.
But the symbolism is what gets me.
Part of Lake Providence -- a substantial part, which includes the public high school and some businesses -- is missing on Google Street View. The digital version of Lake Providence, in that sense, is like the real world: Its poverty is hidden.
Is that true in your community? Take a look and let me know.

Man dies after firefighters won't cross street to help, daughter says
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 8:47 AM EST, Fri January 31, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Two employees have been suspended with pay, a spokesman says
Three people tried to summon firefighters to help the collapsed man
Mills' daughter said she saw a firefighter at the station
That firefighter, a new employee, apparently said he had to be dispatched to help
(CNN) -- Marie Mills held her 77-year-old father, who had collapsed outside in a Washington street. She screamed for help.
A passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station, knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help.
But they wouldn't leave the station.
The same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance, Mills says.
Daughter: Firemen didn't help dying dad
"We looked across the street at the fire station. There was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus," she told CNN affiliate WJLA. "Everybody started trying to wave him over." But the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first.
"I even ran to the curb and said, 'Are you going to help me or let my dad die?'" said Mills.
Later, after an ambulance finally arrived, Cecil Mills died at a hospital. He had suffered an apparent heart attack.
An investigation is under way and, so far, no officials are publicly challenging Mills' version of events.
"It's an outrage," Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference. "I was absolutely furious."
He said he apologized to Marie Mills for "what appeared to be dereliction," DC news station WTTG reported.
"Those who failed to respond as they should -- they will be held accountable, period," Gray vowed.
In comments Thursday to CNN, Gray said he has "taken a lot of time with it."
The investigation is "being done as rapidly as we possibly can," he added.
The D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department told CNN it is investigating the incident, which took place along the 1300 block of Rhode Island Avenue on Saturday.
"Our duty is to respond to all requests for emergency assistance. If it is determined that proper protocols were not followed at the conclusion of our investigation, then appropriate action will be taken," spokesman Tim Wilson said.
The protocol is in question because, according to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911.
Calls to 911 were placed, but a mix-up with the address delayed an ambulance, said Washington Council member Tommy Wells.
"Two things happened," he said. "One was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman. The other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place. This was a number of fiascos."
Paul Quander, deputy mayor for public safety, said a "very new, probationary employee" was at the facility. The employee's first response should be "to ask a senior person, and we believe that was done," he said, according to WTTG. "The question now is what did that senior person say? What did that person do? Did they follow protocols and procedures?"
There are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need, Quander told CNN Thursday. "These are people who run into burning buildings. They work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable.
"They cross the streets, they cross highways to get to people. It is understood. It is common. This is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case. It's right across the street."
"It's hard to get your arms around" the idea that this took place, he added.
Lt. Kellene Davis was the officer in charge of the station at the time of the incident, WTTG reports.
Davis did not respond immediately to an e-mail Thursday from CNN, and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered.
Also Thursday, a spokesman said that two employees of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident.
"I cannot say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation, but I can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident," said Keith St. Clair, with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety.
The employees were working at the station, he said.
Cecil Mills, a lifelong Washington resident, worked for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
His daughter, in mourning, had kind words for the mayor's handling of the matter. "I appreciate how seriously he is taking this because it never should have happened," she told WTTG.
Marie Mills wasn't immediately available Thursday when contacted by CNN.
The firefighters' union said the incident simply should never have happened.
"We need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again," said Ed Smith, president of the DC Fire Fighters Association, in a statement reported by WTTG.
He added that on the union's behalf, "I offer Mr. Mills' family a sincere apology."
CNN's Aaron Cooper and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report from Washington.
