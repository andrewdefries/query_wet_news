Senate seat for Caroline Kennedy would extend legacyStory Highlights Late president's daughter has expressed interest in Hillary Clinton's office Move would put Kennedy in seat once filled by her uncle Robert Kennedy has a history of avoiding partisanship and spotlight She said this year she was inspired by Barack Obama Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO EXPLAINER (CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy, who spent most of her life looking to steer clear of the spotlight, is capping off a year of unusually public -- and political -- activity with interest in the Senate seat that would be vacated by Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton. Caroline Kennedy could join her uncle Edward in the United States Senate. And her interest in that seat could mean the continuation of a Kennedy legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father, John F. Kennedy, as the junior senator from Massachusetts. Her uncle Edward has represented Massachusetts in the Senate for more than four decades. Her uncle Robert served as junior senator from New York from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968. "Remember, [Clinton's] seat in the Senate was once held by Robert Kennedy," CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said Saturday. "Her other uncle, Ted Kennedy, is ill right now. If [New York Gov. David] Paterson appoints Caroline Kennedy to the Senate, it means there could be a Kennedy staying in the Senate for quite a long time." And a Senate appointment for Caroline Kennedy would mark a change for the woman who has rarely run into the glare of political attention. "Apparently, she has acquired a taste for politics, having endorsed Barack Obama early this year," Schneider said. "She wants to be part of this new regime in America, clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment."

Widely described as extraordinarily shy, self-deprecating and down-to-earth, Kennedy has tended to limit her forays into the public sphere to nonpartisan activity, penning books on civil liberties and serving as the de facto guardian of her father's legacy. But in January, she backed a political candidate for the first time, announcing her endorsement of Obama during the Democratic primary season with an opinion piece in the New York Times that drew days of the kind of media attention she has spent her life avoiding. "I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them," she wrote. "But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans." Kennedy willingly lingered in the spotlight, serving on Obama's vice presidential search team, speaking at the Democratic National Convention and stumping for him through the primary and general election seasons. In a campaign ad that featured video images of her father followed by images of Obama, Kennedy said, "People always tell me how my father inspired them. I feel that same excitement now." There are a slew of high-profile candidates for Clinton's Senate seat -- including Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose last name carries some star power of its own in the Empire State -- but their odds grew just a bit steeper when stacked against the wattage of a storied Democratic dynasty. Robert Kennedy was elected to the Senate with few ties to his adopted home state, but his niece's New York roots run deep. Jacqueline Kennedy relocated to New York City after her husband's assassination in 1963, with children Caroline and John F. Kennedy Jr. Caroline Kennedy has spent most of her life in the city, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attending Columbia Law School there. Her most prominent public roles to date involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award. She's also edited several books, from a volume of children's poetry and an updated edition of her father's book "Profiles in Courage" to a collection of patriotic verse ("A Patriot's Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love.") Most of her leadership positions have been based in the arts: hosting the annual nationally televised Kennedy Center Honors in Washington and serving as the honorary chairwoman of the American Ballet Theatre, as her mother had. Still, in late spring and early summer, she was whispered as a possible vice presidential candidate -- and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an Obama Cabinet -- but elected office would mark a major shift for Kennedy. Her history of avoiding partisan efforts, her limited policy track record and the lingering legacy of her father's presidency translated into a far less brutal Republican criticism than that experienced by the other members of Obama's vice presidential search committee, and there was a widespread continuing sense that she would not want to put herself in line for the tough criticism aimed at elected officials. "I don't think she'd go that far," Kennedy White House speechwriter Theodore Sorenson told USA Today this summer after being asked whether he thought Kennedy wanted to hold office herself. In his memoir, "Counselor," he quoted Jacqueline Kennedy saying her daughter had "gotten her horror of the press from me" and said the younger Caroline Kennedy used to hide her face when she spotted a cameraman. But in a 2002 Time magazine interview promoting the updated "Profiles in Courage," Kennedy would not rule out the possibility of a run for public office. "I don't have any plans to do that right now," she said. "I don't plan ahead. My kids are young, and I'm really happy to be able to be around. But I do care about issues, and I'm interested in them. So I don't see that now, but you know, I have a long life ahead of me." The 51-year-old mother of three has still not spoken publicly about her interest in the job -- or whether, after months of campaign-trail conditioning, she might be comfortable with the idea of seeking election in her own right when Clinton's term ends.

Let men decide on prostate screening, cancer society saysBy Miriam Falco, CNN The American Cancer Society recommends that men weigh the risks of treatment before agreeing to prostate screening. STORY HIGHLIGHTSPatients should weigh risks of treatment before undergoing screening, group saysPSA tests sometimes give false positive results, leading to unnecessary therapiesRevised guidelines place greater emphasis on individual counseling by doctorsAmerican Urological Association says all men should have baseline PSA test at 40

Medical Treatments and Procedures
(CNN) -- Most men 50 and older should seriously consider the potential risks of treatment before deciding whether to be screened for prostate cancer, the American Cancer Society said Wednesday in revised guidelines. "What we are trying to say to men is the harms (of prostate screening) are better proven than the benefits," said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Prostate cancer screening consists of the prostate specific antigen, or PSA, blood test or a digital rectal examination. While these tests can detect cancer, they also can produce false positive results that lead to unnecessary and uncomfortable biopsies and treatments that carry undesirable side effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence. On the other hand, tests that appear normal can overlook existing cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates 192,000 men were diagnosed with cancer last year. Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer in men, killing about 27,000 in 2009. The cancer society now recommends that beginning at age 50, men with no special risk of prostate cancer discuss the pros and cons of screening with their doctors and decide together whether it's worth doing. The new guidelines are pretty much like the old guidelines issued in 1997 and 2001, but put more emphasis on individual counseling. Cancer society official on what's behind the guideline change Stephen, 63, a testicular cancer survivor from Hamilton, New Jersey, has undergone routine screening since he was in his late 40s. In 2007, his test results showed the PSA levels were climbing. Even though his PSA levels were still below the 4.0 nanograms per milliliter threshold considered to be a positive PSA score, Stephen, who asked that we only use his first name, said he just wanted to eliminate the cancer risk. "I did tons of research and was offered a lot of options," he said. "I decided to get a radical prostatectomy. I had no really long-term side effects, thankfully." Cancer specialists know that because prostate cancer is usually a slow growing disease, many men are likely to die from other causes before they would die from prostate cancer. The cancer society's Brawley says better cancer screening tools are needed. "In prostate cancer we desperately need to tell the difference between cancers that kill and cancers we need to watch," he said. Until new screening tools are available, the updated guidelines are meant to help men decide what to do. Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine almost a year ago failed to clearly answer whether men should be screened using a PSA test. One study conducted in the United States found no significant difference in the incidence of death among men who were screened for prostate cancer and those who weren't. In the other study, conducted at multiple sites in Europe, researchers found PSA testing lowered prostate cancer-related deaths by 20 percent. According to data from the National Cancer Institute, three out of 100 men will die of prostate cancer. A 20 percent reduction in deaths as seen in the European study translates to only 2.4 men out of 100 dying. Consequently the guidelines have essentially stayed the same. The American Cancer Society believes before a man gets screened for prostate cancer, he should be educated about the pros and cons. "We want men who want to get screened to get screened, and men who don't want to get screened don't have to," Brawley said. "It should be left up to the man." "I think the ACS folks got it right," said Dr. Michael Barry, who reviewed the two major studies for the New England Journal of Medicine last March. Barry is the chief of the general medicine unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and president of the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making. He said men really need to learn about the risks and benefits of prostate screening and make a decision for themselves. "Before we had the trials, we had to say we don't know if there's a benefit to screening. Now we can begin to quantify those benefits," he said. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer specialists, including those treating prostate cancer patients, supports the Cancer Society guidelines. "All men considering testing for prostate cancer should be fully informed by their clinicians about their risk factors and other uncertainties before being screened," a statement from ASCO President Dr. Douglas Blaney said. But not everyone agrees with the new/old cancer society recommendations. The American Urological Association, which revised its guidelines last April based on the same two studies, agrees that making an informed decision for screening is important. But it says all men with a life expectancy of 10 years or more should have a baseline PSA test at the age of 40. Dr. Herbert Lepor, chairman of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, takes care of prostate cancer patients, including Stephen. Lepor believes every man should be screened once for prostate cancer at 40, and annually after 50. He says then, when you find the 10 percent to 15 percent of men whose screenings suggest a risk of cancer, you talk to them about the risks and benefits of treatment. Lepor thinks it is impractical to suggest that a primary care physician who has 15 to 20 minutes to spend with a patient fully explain all the pros and cons of screening in the course of an annual physical. "How do you present this to a patient? You can't possibly spend an hour discussing this," Lepor said. During the same 15- or 20-minute physical, the physician also has to discuss issues like blood pressure, diabetes, exercise and diet. The new guidelines say that men can "be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources," so the information doesn't have to come from a doctor, Brawley noted. For Stephen, getting screened is important. "I would do it again," he said. "I have a son in his early 40s, and i'm telling him, 'Please get screened.' "

The power of perceptions: Imagining the reality you want
By Amanda Enayati, Special to CNN
updated 9:15 AM EDT, Sat April 14, 2012
Can you guess which colored dots are the same on both panels? For the answer, watch the TED talk video linked below.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
We have the power to choose our responses, Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl said
The power of our perceptions can be seen with the placebo effect during clinical trials
The way we perceive even the most basic of our senses is dependent on interpretation (CNN) -- Viktor Frankl was a Jewish psychiatrist who spent three years during World War II living under unspeakable circumstances in several of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps.
While imprisoned, Frankl realized he had one single freedom left: He had the power to determine his response to the horror unfolding around him.
And so he chose to imagine.
He imagined his wife and the prospect of seeing her again. He imagined himself teaching students after the war about the lessons he had learned.
Frankl survived and went on to chronicle his experiences and the wisdom he had drawn from them.
"A human being is a deciding being," he wrote in his 1946 book, "Man's Search for Meaning," which sold more than 10 million copies. "Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."
The idea of becoming conscious of the subjectivity of our perceptions is an admittedly abstract one -- the stuff of philosophy and science fiction.
But human perceptions, and their ramifications, are very real and potentially life-changing.
For example, research shows that people may hold an unconscious bias against creativity because it represents uncertainty unless they are able to perceive that uncertainty in a positive light.
And consider the role perception plays in helping patients improve in ailments ranging from pain and depression to Parkinson's disease through a phenomenon known as the placebo effect. Though the placebo effect remains largely shrouded in mystery, researchers attribute some aspects of the placebo response to active mechanisms in the brain that can influence bodily processes such as the immune response and release of hormones.
Studies also show that perceived risk can drive behavior change. The perception of the harmful effects of smoking, for example, can influence habit and addiction.
So how might we harness the power of perception to live more conscious lives and, perhaps, to even recast the most dire situations in which we find ourselves?
The fiction of reality
Perception begins when the human brain receives data from the body's five senses. The mind then processes and applies meaning to the sensory information.
The brain did not evolve to see the world the way it really is -- we can't.Beau Lotto, neuroscientist and artist
"I want to start with a game," says neuroscientist and artist Beau Lotto at the outset of his TED talk on perception. "To win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is."
As it turns out, seeing that reality isn't as easy as it sounds, even when it comes to basic shapes and colors. Lotto uses a series of optical illusions involving light, color and space to show that even the most fundamental of our senses -- the way we perceive light and color -- can be subject to interpretation.
The variable, says Lotto, is context.
The exact same image can have an infinite number of sources in the real world. When it comes to perception -- seeing, feeling, hearing, sensing things -- there is no such thing as objectivity.
Humans evolved to make sense of things. Every time a stimulus comes to us, our brain does the efficient thing: It responds based on past experience. In so doing, the brain continually redefines normality. It is being shaped, literally, as a consequence of trial and error.
"The brain did not evolve to see the world the way it really is -- we can't," Lotto says. "We can't help but to see things according to history -- our own history and that of our ancestors -- because we are defined by ecology. Not by our biology, not by our DNA, but by our history of interactions."
Sensory information can mean just about anything, Lotto observes. It's what we do with that information that matters.
When context distorts Society gets inside of our heads and habits, says Ruha Benjamin, professor of sociology and African-American studies at Boston University.
"It forms everything from our taste in food, our sensibilities, what we think is good, bad or evil. None of these beliefs occur in isolation."
This profound social influence, known as "habitus," is acquired through activities and experiences of everyday life, and is often taken for granted. The concept hails as far back as Aristotle.
Quite often relying unconsciously on habitus for context serves us well.
Until it doesn't.
Take an infamous example of mistaken perception plucked from the news: So much of the encounter between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had to do with context and perceptions, Benjamin says.
"Think about the different ways in which a majority of Americans see the agency of black men," she says. "In certain contexts, like on a court during March Madness, we are perfectly comfortable celebrating these bodies. But take those same bodies and place them in a different context -- walking down the street in a predominantly white neighborhood -- and quickly that perception of black masculinity at the core of our culture changes context. And in this new context, being a black male may suddenly become a life and death issue."
And so we sometimes find ourselves at a crossroads, in a place of uncertainty, faced with perceptions borne of falsehood, misunderstanding, bias or disunity -- perceptions that do not serve us.
Echoing Frankl, Lotto says of those types of perceptions: "We are responding and not choosing."
The beginning of awareness According to Lotto, the creation of all new perceptions begins in the same way, with a single question: "Why?"
"Why" is, in that sense, the most dangerous word in history, Lotto observes. Because as soon as you ask that question, you open up the possibility of change. So asking "why" may be the hardest thing for people to do.
Education must be about creating new perceptions, Lotto says. Traditionally education has been about efficiency -- it wants to know what happens at the end. There is a right answer. But people really need to learn to move between the "why" and the "how."
Innovation and change are, at their very essence, a "why" proposition, says Jennifer Mueller, a psychologist and Wharton management professor who studies creativity. The "how" comes later.
We have to fight for our ability to imagine the world we want.Ruha Benjamin, sociology professor
It is in this way that perception often becomes the gateway to innovation and change.
"People are so averse to uncertainty that they can't see creativity. They are blind to it," Mueller notes. But by becoming aware of our mind-sets and perceptions, we can step in the direction of breakthroughs.
The power to choose a response
There are practical ways to start on the path to growth and innovation.
You must at the outset be certain that you want change, Mueller says. "Be clear strategically whether you really are looking for something groundbreaking. Define what that means. Sometimes people call something innovation, but it really isn't."
Lotto says that the underlying aim of his research is to help people transform by enabling them to understand and become part of learning about their own perceptions.
"I hope people will walk away from my experiments, not with an understanding of color, but an understanding of themselves, or at least a question of themselves."
The first step, he says, is through awareness.
"You must see yourself see. It's about observation and curiosity, having a sense of wonder, becoming aware of the connection between the past and the present. Becoming an observer of yourself enables you to do amazing things."
Benjamin agrees. "Become aware of how your habitat forms your habits," she says.
What we are fighting for, Benjamin says, is our imagination -- the right to imagine a life and relationships and a social world that are happier, less anxious, more harmonious and more just.
"We are not being diligent enough or deliberate enough about cultivating our imagination. We have to fight for our ability to imagine the world we want. Because one form of oppression is telling people that they're not allowed to imagine something better and happier."
"Either there are no illusions or everything is an illusion," said Lotto at the conclusion of his remarks at the recent Being Human 2012 conference. "And given that we are pretty much all delusional, you might as well choose your delusion."

Tom Cruise sues tabs for 'abandoned' headlines
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 7:15 AM EDT, Thu October 25, 2012
Cruise and Holmes visited Schenley Plaza's carousel with daughter Suri in 2011 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Life & Style and In Touch covers said Cruise "abandoned" daughter after divorce, suit says
"Tom is a caring father who dearly loves Suri," Cruise's lawyer says
"These sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies," lawyer Bert Fields says
The publisher told CNN "no comment"
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tabloid headlines that "falsely trumpeted" in bold letters that Tom Cruise "abandoned" his young daughter should cost the publisher $50 million, the actor's lawyer said Wednesday.
The magazine covers appeared on Life & Style and InTouch in the weeks after Cruise divorced actress Katie Holmes, with whom he shares 6-year-old daughter Suri, according to a defamation lawsuit Cruise filed against the publisher in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
"Tom is a caring father who dearly loves Suri," Cruise lawyer Bert Fields said. "She's a vital part of his life and always will be. To say he has 'abandoned' her is a vicious lie. To say it in lurid headlines with a tearful picture of Suri is reprehensible."
Fields said he sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions, but he was refused in each case.
Tom Cruise's shattered world
"These serial defamers are foreign-owned companies with their global headquarters in Hamburg," Fields said. "They take money from unsuspecting Americans by selling their malicious garbage. Having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down."
Bauer Publishing Group, which publishes both magazines, responded to CNN's request for a reponse with "no comment."
The July 30 Life & Style cover read "SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD," under a photograph of Suri appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother's arms, the suit said.
The story inside explained she was crying "as a result of Suri being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store," the suit said.
The complaint also includes a September In Touch cover that read "44 DAYS WITHOUT TOM ... ABANDONED BY DADDY ... Suri is left heartbroken as Tom suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school... HAS HE CHOSEN SCIENTOLOGY OVER SURI FOR GOOD?"
Since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines, "millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge, brightly colored letters that are typically of a false, lurid and titillating nature, and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines' interiors," the suit said.
"Tom doesn't go around suing people," Fields said. "He's not a litigious guy. But when these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue."
Cruise will "undoubtedly" donate any judgment proceeds to charity, Fields said. "He always has."
CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.

Fiscal cliff deal: 5 things to know
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 12:22 PM EST, Wed January 2, 2013
(CNN) -- Now that the House has passed a Senate deal to avert the fiscal cliff, it will become law when President Obama signs it. He has returned to Hawaii to join his family on vacation.
Here are five things to know about the complex bill, and what it does and doesn't do:
1. No side won
Republicans accepted higher taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Democrats accepted a higher threshold for how much income will face a higher tax rate. President Obama broke a vow to raise tax rates on annual household income over $250,000 and individual income over $200,000. And that's just for starters.
2. We may have a new definition of 'wealthiest Americans'
President Obama made raising tax rates on the top 2% of earners in America a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. The 2% figure includes those with income over $250,000. The compromise bill changes that figure. Tax rates will go up only for individuals with income over $400,000 and families earning more than $450,000.
By comparison, the median U.S. household income in 2011 was $50,054, according to Census Bureau figures.
The deal does, however, cap some deductions for individuals making $250,000 and for married couples making $300,000. That allows the president bragging rights to say the deal raises taxes on people at those income levels. But he said just weeks ago that capping deductions at the $250,000 level would not be enough and that tax rates would rise.
3. The deal kicks the can, and three more fiscal cliffs are looming
The deal delays the sequester, a series of automatic cuts in federal spending, for two months. In the meantime, the Senate plan calls for $12 billion in new revenue and another $12 billion in spending cuts. The spending cuts are to be split between defense and nondefense spending.
So the deal adds another battle to this year's docket of apparently inevitable congressional squabbles over money. The other two: the debt ceiling and a continuing budget resolution.
4. The majority of House Republicans opposed it
Although House Speaker John Boehner supported the bill, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, opposed it, as did most Republicans in the House. So while the Senate vote was an overwhelming 89 to 8, the House vote was 257 to 167. The vast majority of House Democrats supported the bill.
5. Your paycheck is still likely to shrink
The deal does not address an increase in payroll taxes. No legislation to address the fiscal cliff is expected to. Now, the cut on those taxes has expired. Americans earning $30,000 a year will take home $50 less per month. Those earning $113,700 will lose $189.50 a month.

Chinese police seize tons of bogus meat
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 9:29 AM EDT, Sat May 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fake mutton and beef were made of fox, mink, rat, state news agency says
Other meat was injected with water or was diseased, Xinhua says
Chemicals were used illegally to augment meat, it reports
Public safety officials are planning raids related to dairy products, too, agency says
(CNN) -- Police in China have spent three months seizing bogus meat, some of it fake beef or mutton made out of fox, mink and rat.
They snatched up around 20,000 tons of illegal products, according to state news agency Xinhua.
In 382 cases, officials arrested 904 suspects for passing off counterfeit meat, meat injected with water or diseased flesh to consumers, the news agency said.
Other offenders allegedly added chemicals illegally to their products, the agency said.
Two "meat processing and selling dens" in southwest China allegedly used hydrogen peroxide to process chicken claws, Xinhua said.
The raids were the first part of a food safety enforcement campaign from the Ministry of Public Security, Xinhua reported.
Next phase: dairy product crimes.
A ministry official told the news agency it expects to find deep-rooted safety problems.

True change takes a leader with vision
By Wallis Annenberg
updated 8:34 AM EST, Thu December 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Wallis Annenberg: Many donate to charities, but for extraordinary leaders, giving means more
She says CNN Heroes have vision and provide vital help instead of wringing their hands
Annenberg Foundation is focusing on supporting leaders in its philanthropy
Watch "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" on Saturday, December 7 at 9 p.m. ET/PT
Editor's note: Wallis Annenberg is chairman of the board of the Annenberg Foundation. The Annenberg Foundation is providing training to this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes. (CNN) -- For many of us, the holiday season is a time to count our blessings -- and then open our hearts and our checkbooks to those who have far less than we do. But for a handful of extraordinary leaders, giving means something more.
It means committing their entire beings to bettering the lives of others. It means looking at the most wrenching problems all around them and saying it doesn't have to be this way. And it means innovating -- truly leading -- to find new solutions to our oldest and most vexing challenges.
Modifying the homes of disabled veterans so they can live fuller, more productive lives. Creating vital support and transportation networks for children undergoing chemotherapy. Providing free medical care in the jungles of Cameroon, where it's not just unattainable, it's often unheard of. Launching a mobile computer lab to help low-income students in Palm Beach County keep up with essential, job-sustaining technologies.
Wallis Annenberg
These are just some of the ways in which the CNN Heroes are embodying the very best of giving and philanthropy. At a time of government dysfunction and global economic turmoil, these women and men aren't wringing their hands. They're rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done -- quietly, courageously, all around the world.
How can we support and encourage even more of these efforts? In my time as a philanthropist, I've thought a great deal about this issue. And I've found that while money is, of course, essential, in the end it has surprisingly little to do with effective philanthropy. Leadership is the key ingredient. That's why we've stopped focusing our giving on needs and started focusing it much more on leadership. I believe the future of philanthropy depends on this shift -- on a leadership-based approach to solving our public problems.

The truth is, virtually all of the more than 1.5 million nonprofits in America are trying to meet important needs. At the Annenberg Foundation, I've rarely questioned the need of a nonprofit that came to us for help. But need isn't enough. Need doesn't get the job done. Need doesn't inspire others to follow your example. Need doesn't break out of the often-stale approaches of the past. Vision does. True dynamism in an organization does.
What do I mean when I use the word "vision?" I mean people like the CNN Heroes, who look at an old problem and immediately see it in a brand new way. People who think far beyond our day-to-day crises, as important as they are, and think about how their work will shape and sustain a community for the long haul. People who understand their work as a cause, even a calling -- and can rally others to embrace it.
To me, vision is nothing less than a road map to the future. And if you have a real vision, you can outlast and outperform those with far greater resources and support. Which is why visionaries tend to be good philanthropic investments.
Of course, vision means little if you can't run an effective nonprofit. That's why we also look for dynamic organizations -- ones that aren't weighted down by bureaucracy and turf wars, and in particular, ones in which the board and the executive director are working hand in hand. Without the red tape and the interoffice battles, they deliver better and more meaningful results. It sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how elusive this can be.
At the Annenberg Foundation, we don't just go looking for these kinds of strong, leadership-driven nonprofits. We try to nurture and grow them as well. That's why we created the Annenberg Alchemy program, which we are offering free to all current and past CNN Heroes.
Alchemy has already trained over 1,400 nonprofit leaders in this country, helping them approach their work with a greater sense of vision and helping them build closer bonds between their boards and their executive management, so their effectiveness can match their level of need.
So if you want your own charitable dollars to have the greatest impact, don't just write checks to a worthy cause. Support the people and organizations that are actually leading us forward. I believe that's the best way to create a stronger, fairer, more just world. And that's something we can all embrace, this and every holiday season.
