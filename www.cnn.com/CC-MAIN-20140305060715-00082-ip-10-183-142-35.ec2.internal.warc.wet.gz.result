Group: Human rights lawyer detained as Iran unrest spiralsStory Highlights International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran cites witnesses of kidnapping Human rights lawyer Shadi Sadr was pushed into a car and driven off, witnesses say "This was an illegal, arbitrary and violent arrest," Amnesty International director saysNext Article in World » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- Government agents used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, and beat and kidnapped a human rights lawyer, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said Saturday, citing witnesses. Protesters in Tehran linger after powerful cleric Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ended his Friday prayers. The advocacy group said human rights lawyer Shadi Sadr, who was walking with friends to Friday prayers, was confronted by people dressed in civilian clothes. They pushed her into a car and drove off, the group said, citing witnesses. In a subsequent telephone call to her husband, Sadr said she had been arrested and detained in ward 209 of Tehran's Evin prison, the group said. "Her husband reported that intelligence officers had searched his house and requested the keys to her legal office," the group said. Sadr suffers from gland and bone problems, needs medication, and was scheduled to undergo an operation next week, the group said. It said several other human rights lawyers, including Abdolfattah Soltani, Kambiz Nourouzi and Mohammed Ali Dadkhah, have been detained in recent days. Friday's crackdown came as leading cleric and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called for Iranian intelligence and security forces to obey the law and to release detained protesters. Police used tear gas on demonstrators and beat and arrested at least 40 of them, taking them away in the trunks of unmarked cars, a witness told the campaign.

It also called on the United Nations and the Human Rights Council to travel to Iran to investigate. Don't Miss Clashes as key Iranian cleric warns leaders

Because of government restrictions on international journalists, CNN is not able to confirm the report. In a separate statement, Amnesty International said arrests in Iran of civil society activists like Shadi Sadr appear to be intensifying. "This was an illegal, arbitrary and violent arrest in which no attempt was made by the authorities to show identification or provide any explanation for their action," said Malcolm Smart, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme.

Online game seeks to empower AfricaBy John D. Sutter, CNN Jane McGonigal is trying to use an online game to help people in Africa solve real-world problems. STORY HIGHLIGHTS "Urgent Evoke" is an online game that seeks to cure real-world problems Players earn points by responding to weekly challenges The game begins on Wednesday; it focuses on Africa, but anyone can play The World Bank Institute spends $500K on the game as an educational tool
RELATED TOPICS
Online Gaming
Africa
The World Bank Group
(CNN) -- Some people think of online gamers and see gaunt loners huddled in dark rooms, the sad blue glow of the computer screen on their faces as their lives pass them by. Game designer Jane McGonigal sees "superheroes" with untapped potential that can be used to fix vexing real-world problems. "Gamers are willing to work hard all the time if they're given the right work," she said. She calls them "super-empowered, hopeful individuals," and includes herself among the bunch. McGonigal's latest online game, called "Urgent Evoke," launches on Wednesday. With it, she hopes to channel the obsessive focus online games create into something more productive than conquering monsters and earning virtual weapons. She wants to push people in Africa -- a long-troubled continent where people might feel less empowered than elsewhere -- to solve problems like environmental degradation, lack of food, water scarcity, poverty and violence. To do this, the Urgent Evoke game -- classified in the emerging "alternate reality" genre -- straddles the online and physical worlds. Players, a few hundred of whom are in Africa, earn points and power-ups by completing real-world tasks like volunteering, making business contacts or researching an issue, then submitting evidence of their work online. At the end of the game, McGonigal expects some players to have business plans about how they will improve the world. Play a game, get a job Depending on how well the game goes, Urgent Evoke could influence the future of alternate reality gaming and spur innovation in Africa. Bob Hawkins, senior education specialist with the World Bank Institute, said one big reason people in African countries aren't as entrepreneurial and innovative as those in the West is that they don't feel as empowered to create change. That's largely why his international development group is funding McGonigal's project to the tune of $500,000. "There have been studies, for instance, in South Africa that the public investment in universities isn't producing the types of new ideas and innovation that industry wants," he said. "What happens is that industry is importing ideas from outside the continent and outside of South Africa." He hopes Urgent Evoke will empower people in Africa to change their own futures. This game will act as a kind of hyper-engaged online social network, he said, setting people in the developing world up with contacts in Europe, the United States and elsewhere who may offer insight or even cash. An unannounced number of game "winners" will be given mentorships, internships, start-up money and scholarships for playing the game. Responding to an 'Evoke' At first, none of that may sound especially game-like. But McGonigal, the game designer, said the power of Urgent Evoke is that it doesn't feel like work when you're immersed in the story and working with other gamers around the world to chase bite-sized goals. Video: Watch McGonigal explain her game Urgent Evoke gamers follow a story that's presented each week like a comic book online. The central figure of the Evoke narrative is a mysterious character who spots the world's big problems and sends out "Urgent Evoke" messages to a team of game players on Wednesdays, asking for help. A new challenge, such as a famine or water shortage, is presented to players at midnight for 10 weeks. Players earn points by accepting the challenges and then responding with evidence that they've used their real-life "superhero" powers to help. A person might, for example, contact a community organization that specializes in environmental issues, or try to provide meals for someone in their neighborhood. Players catalogue their activities and submit the evidence in the form of a blog post, a video or a photo, which players post on the Urgent Evoke Web site. Other people in the game network read these posts and, if they feel the player has done a good job, can award them further power-ups in a number of categories like creativity, collaboration, sustainability and courage. Players with the most points at the end of the game win, but McGonigal and Hawkins said the experience of playing is what's most valuable. The game will "open their eyes to the range of challenges that they could roll up their sleeves and take on," Hawkins said. Potential for addiction McGonigal makes the controversial argument that if people played more online games like Urgent Evoke or World of Warcraft, our society would be better equipped to battle big problems. That's because gamers are trained to believe they can win, and because they're matched with tasks that are fit to their skill levels, based on what level they've achieved in the game, she said. McGonigal wants to see people exhibit the same level of enthusiasm and optimism they display in games in their real lives. People spend a collective 3 billion hours per week playing online games today, she said. That number must be 21 billion -- seven times the current amount -- for our society to realize its innovative and creative potential, she said. Not everyone thinks that's a good thing. Kimberly Young, a PhD psychologist and founder of the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery, argued that online games, educational or not, are an addictive force in our society. People can learn and develop skills in online worlds, she said, but "they do that to the exclusion of developing those skills in the real world." Internet access Even those who support the Urgent Evoke game admit it faces a number of challenges. Chief among them is that the online game is designed particularly for people in Africa, a continent where people have less Internet access than anywhere. About 400 of the 3,500 people who have signed up for the game so far come from Africa, said Hawkins. He said the World Bank is launching an ad campaign in South Africa to encourage people to play. Many university students have access to computer labs with the Internet, he said, and the game is designed so it can also be played over SMS text messaging or on mobile phones that use the Opera Mini operating system, which is popular on the continent. "Even if you never get to a computer, you could do everything that you would need to do in the game on your cell phone," McGonigal said. "Pretty much everyone that we would be trying to reach through this game has cell phone access." People outside Africa are also encouraged to play, and the game has a "mentorship" program so people all over the world can give guidance. Lasting impact The other nagging question is to what extent the online game actually can inspire lasting change in the real world. McGonigal's previous work shows some degree of lasting change may be possible. In 2007, she created an online game called "World Without Oil," which challenged people to re-imagine their lives without their dependence on fossil fuels. McGonigal did not conduct scientific focus groups with the game's 1,700 players, but she said she has gotten feedback from many of the players. They reported their energy consumption habits changed during the game and that they've kept those changes up in the years that have followed, she said. For Urgent Evoke, McGonigal said she plans to conduct surveys of participants to see if the game actually led to real-world change. She said she will measure success by how involved people are in the game, whether they stick with the story until the end and if they've joined organizations or taken real steps to create change in their communities. If all goes well, the World Bank may sponsor an Arabic version of the game next year. There are also tentative plans to hold sequels in Africa.

'Fiscal cliff' talks stall in final hours
By Matt Smith, CNN
updated 9:48 PM EST, Sun December 30, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: McConnell and Biden are main negotiators now, sources on both sides say
"There's still significant distance between the two sides," Reid says
Obama calls on GOP to cut a deal on taxes; Republicans argue Obama is overspending
As the fiscal cliff looms, what's your New Year's message to Washington? Go to CNNiReport to share your video.
(CNN) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats remain far apart in their effort to avert a year-end combination of spending cuts and tax increases that could trigger a new recession, Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday.
"There's still significant distance between the two sides, but negotiations continue," Reid said as Congress held a rare Sunday session in a bid to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. "There's still time left to reach an agreement, and we intend to continue negotiations."
No votes will be held Sunday, but Reid said there may be further announcements when the Senate reconvenes Monday morning: "I certainly hope so."
With barely a day left to avert what economists predict will be a one-two punch to the U.S. economy, talks hit what a Democratic source called a "major setback" when Republicans insisted that changes to how Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation be included. Republicans have dropped that demand, but "they never should have been on the table to begin with," said Reid, D-Nevada.
Using what's known as "chained CPI" would change the way Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, meaning that future Social Security recipients would receive less money over time. Democrats consider this prospect a "poison pill," the source said, and GOP senators said later it wouldn't be included.
"If that is a show-stopper for the majority leader, we will take that off the table," New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte told reporters after coming out of a Republican caucus meeting Sunday afternoon.
With the clock running down, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appealed to Vice President Joe Biden to help "jump-start" negotiations after complaining that he had received no response to an offer he put on the table Saturday night.
Five days until fiscal cliff "I want everyone to know I'm willing to get this done, but I need a dance partner," said McConnell, R-Kentucky. McConnell and Biden, who served together in the Senate for more than two decades, were having a "pretty fruitful" conversation Sunday afternoon, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee.
Reid said earlier that McConnell has shown "absolutely good faith" in the talks, but "it's just that we are apart on some pretty big issues."
As he headed home Sunday evening, Reid was asked about progress, and he responded: "Talk to Biden and McConnell."
Top-level sources on both sides of the negotiations said talks are primarily now in the hands of McConnell and Biden, and they are keeping Reid and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, informed.
If nothing gets done before Monday night at midnight, the expiration of the Bush administration's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will increase tax rates, while $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending -- the result of the 2011 standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling -- will start to kick in. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts the combined effect could dampen economic growth by 0.5%, possibly tipping the U.S. economy back into a recession and driving unemployment back over 9%.
In an interview aired Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," President Barack Obama blamed Republicans for the stalemate that brought lawmakers back to Capitol Hill on a weekend. Obama urged the GOP to drop its opposition to tax increases on top earners and cut a last-minute deal.
"They say that the biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way. But the way they're behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans are protected," he said. "That seems to be their only overriding, unifying theme."
Obama told NBC that could cost the average middle-class family about $2,000. He said the Senate should go ahead and vote on legislation to make sure middle-class taxes are not raised and that 2 million people don't lose unemployment benefits.
"If we can get that done, that takes a big bite out of the fiscal cliff," he said. "It avoids the worst outcomes."
During the interview, Obama said he was willing to consider using chained CPI to adjust Social Security -- even though it was "highly unpopular among Democrats" and opposed by the AARP, the powerful lobby for seniors.
"In pursuit of strengthening Social Security for the long term, I'm willing to make those decisions," Obama said. "What I'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors, making students pay higher student loan rates, ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow. Those are the things that I'm not willing to do."
But the Democratic source, who did not want to be identified because of the closed nature of the talks, said members understand Obama proposed using chained CPI as an element of a larger deal that also would change how the federal debt ceiling is adjusted -- an element no longer included in the plans.
Most Democrats oppose chained CPI, but many were wiling to go along with it as part of a larger deal, the source said.
On taxes, meanwhile, Democrats are arguing that taxes should go up for those making $250,000 or more, though some discussions have involved the possibility of raising that figure to a $400,000 threshold.
Many Republicans have opposed any increase in tax rates. Boehner suffered a political setback by offering a compromise -- a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his GOP House colleagues refused to support.
After Obama's NBC interview, Boehner said the president needs to stand up to his own party and insisted it was the president "who has never been able to get to 'yes.'"
"I am pleased Senators from both parties are currently working to find a bipartisan solution that can finally pass that chamber," Boehner said in a statement issued by his office. "That is the type of leadership America needs, not what they saw from the president this morning."
Sunday night, Boehner met with House GOP leaders and told them to sit tight and stick together as he awaits news on whether the Senate can strike a deal.
After the meeting, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole told reporters that Boehner said: "I've stayed out of those negotiations."
"Every time we get involved in them, we sort of get burned, so we're going to let the Senate work its will, see what they do and what they send us, and we'll act accordingly," he said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, told ABC's "This Week" he thought the chances of a short-term, last-minute deal brokered by Senate leaders were better than 50-50.
"I've been a legislator for 37 years, and I've watched how these things work on these big, big agreements," Schumer said. "They almost always happen at the last minute."
And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the chances are "exceedingly good" that some type of deal will be reached by Monday night.
"I think, whatever we accomplish, political victory to the president, hats off to the president. He stood his ground. He's going to get tax rate increases, maybe not $250,000, but upper-income Americans," Graham said on "Fox News Sunday."
"And the sad news for the country is that we have accomplished little in terms of not becoming Greece or getting out of debt."
Other Republicans argued Sunday that Obama's plan hasn't done enough to limit spending.
"The president is doing nothing about the addiction that his administration has to spending. He's the spender in chief," Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said on CNN's "State of the Union."
Obama told NBC that he has cut more than $1 trillion in spending and offered another $1 trillion-plus in additional cuts "so that we would have $2 of spending cuts for every $1 of increased revenue." He said the majority of Americans have made clear they support his calls for "a balanced approach" that would increase taxes on the wealthy.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, warned that now is "exactly the wrong time to go over this cliff."
"We are in the midst of an economic recovery. We are seeing new job creation, businesses are seeing new growth, we are seeing the kind of economic indicators we've been waiting for for years. This going over the cliff is going to bring uncertainty to our markets, and with that uncertainty, a pullback in consumer confidence and a reduction, I'm afraid, of business activity and the creation of new jobs," he said.
But former Democratic Party chairman and 2004 presidential contender Howard Dean told ABC that heading over the cliff would not be so bad, calling it a "fiscal curb" instead.
"You go back to the Clinton tax rates, and you make some significant cuts. And you cut the Defense Department, which hasn't been cut in 30 years," said Dean, a former Vermont governor. Meanwhile, going over the cliff gives Obama more leverage, "because then all of sudden, middle-class people's taxes are going to rise, and that's going to be bad for every politician in Washington."
"Maybe they'll actually get something done," he said. "But I think, at this point, at this late hour, I think almost any deal they come up with is worse than going over the cliff."
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, told CNN's "State of the Union" that she expects Congress will vote to extend tax cuts for incomes below $250,000 -- perhaps below $400,000 -- before midnight Monday. A Senate agreement "would build momentum" for the move in the House, she said.
"I think it would be horrific for the country if at this time, the final days of this legislative session that already has reached historic proportions of failure, that we would now culminate in failure to extend these tax cuts," said Snowe, who is on her way out of office.
CNN's Jessica Yellin, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins, Ted Barrett and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.

(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal extinguished any doubts over his long-term fitness after being forced to play two matches in less than 24 hours at the Barcelona Open.
The 26-year-old recorded a 37th consecutive victory at Barcelona with a 6-3 6-0 quarterfinal win over fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos just hours after finishing off his rain-delayed third round match.
After returning from a seven-month injury enforced absence with a knee problem in February, Nadal has reached six finals in six tournaments this year.
Bad weather in Barcelona Thursday forced the World No.5 to complete his match against Frenchman Benoit Paire on Friday morning.

"I'm enjoying the week playing here. I love the tournament. I know everybody well. It feels like home, always."

Nadal, who lost out in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters to Novak Djokovic last week, is hoping to secure an eighth French Open title next month.
The Spaniard had hoped to win a ninth consecutive title at Monte Carlo before suffering his first defeat at the clay court tournament since 2003.
He will now hope to bounce back with Canada's Milos Raonic standing in between him and a place in Sunday's final.
Raonic, who has lost both of his previous encounters with Nadal, overcame Tommy Robredo 6-7 6-3 7-6.

In the other semifinal, Spain's Nicolas Almagro will face Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber.
Almagro, ranked 12th in the world, defeated compatriot Juan Monaco 6-3 7-5 in a contest where he saved 10 break points.
The All England Club, which organizes the Wimbledon Championship, has revealed that it will build a new roof on No.1 Court.
The iconic Centre Court has had a retracting roof in place since 2009, which has allowed players to continue their matches during rain showers.
The $152 million project will see a roof put on No.1 Court, which will take the number of covered seats at the venue to 26,500.
This is an artist's impression of the completed project, which is expected to be ready in time for the 2019 tournament.

Wimbledon to put a lid on it
Maria Sharapova won the French Open last year to become the 10th woman to claim all four grand slams. But she plans on playing for several years before pursuing her business interests. At Roland Garros, Sharapova won her first major after undergoing shoulder surgery in 2008. Some thought she would never triumph at a grand slam following the injury. After a win in Montreal in July 2008, an MRI revealed that Sharapova had two tears in the tendon of her serving shoulder. Sharapova attempted a comeback in 2009 when she played doubles in Indian Wells. But she still wasn't ready to return. Once self described as a "cow on ice" on clay, Sharapova began her clay-court campaign last year by beating Victoria Azarenka in the Stuttgart final. Sharapova defeated Li Na in last year's final of the Italian Open, the perfect buildup to the French Open. Sharapova and Li are the two highest-paid female athletes in the world and share the same agent. Sharapova launched her own premium candy line, Sugarpova, with individual bags selling for $5.99. She has plans to expand to more markets, including Asia. Max Eisenbud, Sharapova's agent, first met the player when she was 12 at the renowned IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Sharapova still lives nearby.

Tennis still Sharapova's top priority Rafael Nadal stayed on course for a record-extending ninth consecutive title at the Monte Carlo Masters after beating Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany in the third round. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, beaten by Nadal in last year's final, was again forced to test his injured ankle as he came from behind to beat Argentina's clay specialist Juan Monaco in three sets.
Andy Murray, left, crashed out with a straight-sets defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka which means the British star will lose the world No. 2 ranking to the Swiss 13th seed's compatriot Roger Federer next week. Jarkko Nieminen reached the last eight of a Masters event for the first time since 2006 as the 31-year-old Finn upset Argentine fifth seed Juan Martin Del Potro.
Italy's world No. 32 Fabio Fognini will make his debut in a Masters quarterfinal after his upset win over Czech fourth seed Tomas Berdych.

Nadal into Monte Carlo quarterfinals
"He had many break points and played really good, but I can rest now for a little bit and we'll see what comes tomorrow in the semi-finals," Almagro told the official ATP website.
"I played really good today and that's the most important thing. I've felt great during this week and I'm going to fight to reach my first final here in Barcelona."
Kohlschreiber, seeded eighth, saw off Slovakia's Martin Klizan in three sets before his quarterfinal opponent, Thomaz Bellucci, withdrew injured.
Meanwhile, Juan Martin del Potro has withdrawn from next week's Lisbon Open.
According to the tournament's organizers, the Argentine, ranked seventh in the world, has been suffering with a stomach virus.
Read: Struggles made me stronger
In Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova overcame Serbia's Ana Ivanovic in 7-5 4-6 6-4 to ensure her place in the last four.
"It's good to face different styles of playing from different opponents," Sharapova told reporters.
"Ana is a bit more aggressive, while Lucie Safarova had a bit more variety in her game yesterday.
"I am happy to get through, but I had to push myself.

"It was a tough battle, it was hard to get my body going again after the last game, but it was good to get another three sets under the belt."
The World No.2 will face Germany's Angelique Kerber on Saturday after the home favorite saw off Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova 6-3 7-6.
"We both played well," Kerber told the WTA website.
"I was fully concentrated right from the first point and tried to make her move around and not let her get into the match -- luckily enough my tactics worked well today.
"It was extremely important for me to play as well as possible at my home tournament.
"Reaching the semifinals is a big achievement for me. But I'm not going to put myself under any pressure.
"I'm naturally going to have the crowd behind me - they've been supporting me so fantastically all week."
In the other semifinal, U.S qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands will take on China's Li Na.
Mattek-Sands, ranked 104th in the world, overcame Germany's Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-2, while Li defeated fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-3 7-5.
The World No.5 was beaten in three sets by Mattek-Sands in their previous meeting at the quarterfinal stage of the 2011 Madrid Open and is expecting another tough test.
"I saw Bethanie play earlier on and she looks like a good, aggressive, player," Li told reporters.
"We'll see how tomorrow's match goes."

Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- The Philippines struggled to bury the dead and get food, water and medicine to the living Tuesday, four days after Super Typhoon Haiyan claimed untold lives and flattened countless buildings.
"Right now, we don't have enough water," typhoon survivor Roselda Sumapit told CNN in Tacloban, a city of more than 200,000 that was flattened by the storm. What they can get may not be clean, she said -- but she added, "We still drink it, because we need to survive."
The government's confirmed death toll was 1,774 early Tuesday, said Jose Lampe Cuisa Jr., the Philippine ambassador to the United States. The storm has injured 2,487 more, and displaced 660,000 people from their homes.
Government officials have said they fear the final toll may be as many as 10,000. Corpses -- some crudely covered, others left exposed to the burning sun -- added another hellish element to survival in Tacloban, the capital of the southern island province of Leyte.

The road to Tacloban
Water levels reached the second story
Survivor: Conditions 'worse than hell'
"We have bodies in the water, bodies on the bridges, bodies on the side of the road," said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross.
Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said authorities there have confirmed 250 deaths and expect that toll to climb.
"A lot of bodies were mixed up with all the rubble and debris, and we're getting reports also of some houses that were buried. And we see some bodies floating," Romualdez said.
Another 14 people were reported to have died in Vietnam, where the storm made landfall after hitting the Philippines, the country's National Search and Rescue Committee reported early Tuesday. Another four were missing and 81 hurt, it said.
And there were at least five storm-related deaths in southern China, where heavy rains caused flooding, destroyed houses and damaged farmland, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
In the Phillipines, troops and aid organizations battled blocked roads to deliver help and search for survivors in the splintered wreckage of homes. Tomoo Hozumi, the Philippines representative of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, said food, shelter, clean water and basic sanitation were "in a severe shortage" early Tuesday.
"The situation on the ground is very hideous," he told CNN's The Situation Room.
The Philippine government reported early Tuesday that 2.5 million people needed food aid, including nearly 300,000 pregnant women or new mothers.
"Our house got demolished. My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris," one woman told the Philippine television network ANC. "We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat."
International aid was beginning to work its way to the stricken islands. But Martin Romualdez, the area's congressman, said authorities need help clearing roads where power lines, trees and whole houses are "literally strewn across the pavement of the highway."
Romualdez, the cousin of Tacloban's mayor, said airdrops may be needed to reach towns beyond Tacloban.
"We can't wait. People have gone three days without any clean water, food and medication," he told CNN's Piers Morgan Live.
"People are getting desperate. There's an exodus out of the storm-ravaged areas. People are just trying to make their way out, and it's causing a big, big jam on the main arteries that are used to get to these people."
Gordon said the threat of landslides and flash flooding further complicated the problem, and said police were needed to guard aid shipments: "Any truck, any helicopter that lands is going to be surrounded by people in need," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360.
Compounding the misery, a new tropical depression dumped heavy rain on the area Tuesday morning. The system, dubbed Zoraida by the Philippine meteorological agency, was centered southeast of the southern island of Mindanao, moving northwest with top winds of 55 kilometers per hour (35 mph).
Dramatic vignettes show desperation, hope
'Worse than hell'
Haiyan struck Friday, sending a wall of water crashing into neighborhoods of wooden houses along the Gulf of Leyte and flinging large ships ashore like toys. Its top winds were estimated at 315 kph (195 mph) -- a figure that could set a new record for tropical cyclones if confirmed.

Magina Fernandez, who was trying to get out of Tacloban at the city's crippled airport, described the situation there as "worse than hell."
"Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now," she said, directing some of her anger at Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, who toured some of the hardest-hit areas Sunday.
Aid pledges began to pour in on Monday -- $25 million from the United Nations, 3 million euros ($4 million) from the European Union, 10 million pounds ($16 million) from Britain and $10 million from the United Arab Emirates, home to a large population of expatriate Filipino workers.
U.N. and U.S. civilian disaster assessment teams were on the scene. U.S. Marines based in Japan worked to outfit Tacloban's shattered airport with lights, radar and other gear to allow it to operate 24 hours a day.
The United States also announced that the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and three escort ships have been dispatched to the Philippines to assist in recovery efforts. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the carrier to head for the islands at "best speed" from Hong Kong, where it was on a port visit, the Pentagon said. Two other American vessels, including a supply ship, are already headed for the Phillippines, the Pentagon said.
The U.S. Agency for International Development is sending emergency shelter materials and basic hygiene supplies to aid 10,000 families as well as 55 metric tons of emergency rations sufficient to feed 20,000 children and 15,000 adults for up to five days. Both shipments were expected to arrive this week, the agency said.
And British Prime Minister David Cameron announced Monday night that his government was also sending a cargo plane and the destroyer HMS Daring to assist, he said.
Typhoon Haiyan: Reports from the field
Difficult to assess death toll
But Tacloban is far from the only devastated area. Authorities are trying to establish the level of destruction elsewhere along Haiyan's path, and other settlements along the coast are likely to have suffered a similar fate to Tacloban's.
Interactive map of the storm
Aid workers said the recovery from Haiyan will take many months.
"This disaster on such a scale will probably have us working for the next year," said Sandra Bulling, international communications officer for the aid agency CARE. "Fishermen have lost their boats. Crops are devastated. This is really the basic income of many people."
Across the Gulf of Leyte lies Samar, where Haiyan made its first of six deadly landfalls on the Philippines on Friday. Government and aid officials say they are still trying to reach many affected communities on that island.
A similar challenge exists farther west, on the islands of Cebu and Panay, which also suffered direct hits from the typhoon.

Aquino declared a "state of national calamity," which allows more latitude in rescue and recovery operations and gives the government power to set the prices of basic goods. Authorities are funneling aid on military planes to Tacloban's airport, which resumed limited commercial flights Monday. As aid workers, government officials and journalists came in, hundreds of residents waited in long lines hoping to get out.

'They've lost everything'
The problems are the same in other stricken regions.
"The main challenges right now are related to logistics," said Praveen Agrawal of the U.N.'s World Food Programme, who returned to Manila from the affected areas Sunday. "Roads are blocked, airports are destroyed."
The need for food and water has led to increasingly desperate efforts. People have broken into grocery and department stores in Tacloban, and local businessman Richard Young said he and others had formed a group to protect their businesses.
"We have our firearms. We will shoot within our property," he said.
Authorities have sent police and military reinforcements to try to bring the situation under control.
Another dire scene played out in the city's only functioning hospital over the weekend. Doctors couldn't admit any more wounded victims because there wasn't enough room. Some injured lay in the hospital's cramped hallways seeking treatment.
"We haven't anything left to help people with," one doctor said. "We have to get supplies in immediately."
Complicating the search efforts is the lack of electricity in many parts of the storm's path.
The northern part of Bogo, in the central Philippines, suffered a blackout Sunday, and authorities said it will take months to restore power.
Storm moves onto Vietnam
Meteorologists said it will take further analysis to confirm whether Haiyan -- with gusts reported at first landfall to be up to 235 mph (375 kph) -- set a record.
After leaving the Philippines, the storm lost power as it moved across the South China Sea over the weekend. It hit the coast of northern Vietnam early Monday and weakened as it moved inland. Vietnamese authorities had evacuated 800,000 people ahead of the typhoon, according to the United Nations.
Aid workers said Vietnam was likely to avoid damage on the scale suffered by the Philippines but warned that heavy rain brought could cause flooding and landslides in northern Vietnam and southern China.

CNN - Clinton pledges thorough effort to find Olympic park bomber - July 27, 1996 Clinton pledges thorough effort to find Olympic park bomber
July 27, 1996Web posted at: 11 a.m. EDT
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bill Clinton pledged Saturday morning that authorities will "spare no effort" to find and punish those responsible for the deadly bombing at Centennial Olympic Park.
"The bombing ... was an evil act of terror," the president said, eschewing his scheduled weekly radio address to respond to the explosion. "It was aimed at the innocent people who were participating in the Olympic Games, an act of cowardice that stands in sharp contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes."
Clinton offered condolences and prayers to victims of the bombing and their families, and thanked security and medical personnel for their quick and "brave" response. (238K AIFF or WAV sound)
"There was more concern about the Olympic park than any other place because it was thought that there had to be some place where the general public could congregate," he said. "Even there ... someone spotted that suspicious package last night and alerted the bomb squad and helped to clear the area." He said the quick actions of security personnel prevented a larger loss of life.
Clinton said it was impossible to completely eliminate the possibility of such an attack, but that the security efforts for the Atlanta games were thought to be the best coordinated in recent memory.
"An act of vicious terror like this is clearly directed at the spirit of our democracy," the president said. " ... We must not let these attacks stop us from going forward. We must not let terror win."
Clinton said he supported the death penalty for terrorists who cause deaths.
