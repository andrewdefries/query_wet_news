JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's defense minister says his country has no intention of expelling foreign troops helping the country recover from the tsunami disaster but merely hopes to take over most of the relief effort by the end of March."I would like to emphasize that March 26 is not a deadline for involvement for military personnel in the relief effort," Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said at a joint press conference with U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz."It is a benchmark for the Indonesian government to improve and accelerate its relief efforts so that by March the 26th, the large part of the burden of the relief effort will be carried by the Indonesian government and the Indonesian authorities on the ground."The magnitude 9 earthquake, which struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island on December 26, triggered tsunamis across the Indian Ocean. Nearly 160,000 people were killed, including more than 113,000 in Indonesia.Several countries have sent military forces to distribute emergency aid in Indonesia and other affected nations.Indonesia's vice president recently said that "foreign military and aid groups can leave" by March 26. That statement was quickly downplayed by the U.S. government.U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the comment "was intended as an estimate about how long the military part of the operation might be necessary."Wolfowitz said the United States wants to turn over the military mission to Indonesia as soon as possible, but he emphasized that the focus remains on bringing relief to Indonesia."We all need to keep an eye on what we're trying to accomplish here together which is to bring relief to the survivors, to help keep them alive and healthy, help them to recover from what is an unimaginable psychological blow and help the reconstruction of a province that has been just devastated physically and the reconstruction," Wolfowitz said Sunday."It's clear it's an even a bigger task than even I imagined before I saw it."Wolfowitz met with Indonesian officials in Jakarta on Sunday after inspecting the devastation in Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra a day earlier. He arrived in Indonesia after visiting Thailand and heads to Sri Lanka on Monday before returning to Washington next week.Other developments:The USS Bonhomme Richard amphibious strike group will end its tsunami relief operation this week, and steam for Iraq, where its 2,200 Marines will serve as an offshore contingency force for Iraq's January 30 elections, U.S. military officials tell CNN. In its place, the USS Essex group, with Marines from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit will move from the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean to take over relief efforts near Sri Lanka, officials say. A U.S. military medical team has been dispatched to the northernmost tip of Sri Lanka to ferry in supplies and provide medical aid in an effort to prevent the outbreak of disease. Six doctors and 26 U.S. Navy medical professionals departed Colombo Sunday for Point Pedro, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Jaffna. About 6,000 people near Point Pedro were displaced by the tsunamis, blamed for 29,000 deaths in Sri Lanka.

Surviving the red-eye flightStory Highlights Window seats at the front are best, the last row is the worst for a good night's rest Travel pillows may be awkward to carry, but they can aid sleep Resist the urge to nap. Acclimatize to the new time zone as quickly as possibleNext Article in Travel » The overnight long-haul doesn't have to be a killer. Follow some simple steps to survive the red-eye flight. The right seat Window seats are best for catching some sleep, as there is something to lean against. You also don't risk being woken by a neighbor clambering past to get to the toilet. Seats at the front of the plane are the quietest. The worst seats are on the back row, as often they don't recline. Some seats on exit rows also do not recline and here bags must be stowed in lockers which means you'll have to keep getting up to get at belongings. To find the best seats, visit SeatGuru that weighs up the pros and cons of each seat on every commercial plane. Don't Miss This month's show: Open Skies
Flying tips for cranky passengers
SeatGuru
Bag it Sleep-inducing goodies to pack in the carry-on bag include ear plugs, comfy socks, and noise-canceling ear phones. Travel pillows may be awkward to carry, but they are proven at improving sleep by supporting the head. An eye mask can also minimize interference from a neighbor's light and video screen. Perfect timing Try to resist the urge to nap. The idea is to acclimatize to the new time zone as quickly as possible. So if you arrive in the morning, try to push through to bed time. But don't over-do it the day after. A big night out is not the best idea, but early morning meetings could help you hit the ground running. Skip coffee in the airport and especially when the trolley comes round during the flight. If you're on a transatlantic red-eye, wait an hour or two before having breakfast on arrival in London. After all, it may be 7 am in London but it's still the middle of the night in New York. Set your alarm to wake up half an hour before the plane touches down. This will provide enough time to use the bathroom, gather possessions and acclimatize to the new day. E-mail to a friend From the Blogs: Controversy, commentary, and debate

Hurricane Igor, Tropical Storm Julia churn in the Atlantic By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Igor holds strength, stays away from landNEW: Julia strengthens, could become hurricane in next day or soNEW: Julia, too, is steering clear of land Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Igor maintained its Category 4 status Monday afternoon, still huffing and puffing top sustained winds of 150 mp (240 kph) although tracking maps show the storm remaining in the open Atlantic, far from land. Behind it, Tropical Storm Julia strengthened and could become a hurricane with in the next day or so, the National Hurricane Center said. Julia, too, was moving away from land, although a tropical storm warning was in effect for the southern Cape Verde islands as the storm moved past. Igor, which started as a tropical storm on Saturday, rapidly intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 storm Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters described it as "large and powerful" but said it would likely drop to a Category 3 storm by the end of the week. As of 5 p.m. ET Monday, Igor's center was about 830 miles (1,335 kilometers) east of the northern Leeward Islands. It was moving west at about 10 mph (17 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 50 miles (85 kilometers) from Igor's center, and tropical storm-force winds can be felt up to 195 miles (315 kilometers) outward, according to the Hurricane Center. As of Sunday evening, no coastal watches or warnings were in effect, and the storm is expected to turn to the west-northwest by Tuesday. While the storm is expected to stay north of the Caribbean islands, the islands could experience some wind and rain because of Igor's size, forecasters said. Video: Tracking Igor from space

Meanwhile, in the far eastern Atlantic, Tropical Storm Julia formed Sunday night. As of 5 p.m. ET Monday, its center was about 210 miles (335 kilometers) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, but the storm was pulling away from the islands. The storm's maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph (85 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). Additional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches are possible over the northwest portion of the Cape Verde Islands, with isolated maximum amounts of 4 inches possible in some locations, forecasters said. These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Tracking maps show Julia becoming a Category 1 hurricane over the open Atlantic later in the week before dropping back to tropical storm intensity without nearing land.

Video: Taliban shoot woman 9 times in public execution as men cheer
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 6:21 AM EDT, Mon July 9, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The NATO-led ISAF and the United States condemn the execution
The provincial governor says Taliban officials faked a charge of adultery as an excuse
Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi weeps as she sees the video
The execution is the latest in a long line of violence against women in Afghanistan
Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A shot rings out, but the burqa-clad woman sitting on the rocky ground does not respond.
The man pointing a rifle at her from a few feet away lets loose another round, but still there is no reaction.
He fires a third shot, and finally the woman slumps backwards.
But the man fires another shot.
And another. And another.
Afghan woman executed in public
Nine shots in all.
Around him, dozens of men on a hillside cheer: "God is great!"
Officials in Afghanistan, where the amateur video was filmed, believe the woman was executed because two Taliban commanders had a dispute over her, according to the governor of the province where the killing took place.
Both apparently had some kind of relationship with the woman, said Parwan province governor Abdul Basir Salangi.
"In order to save face," they accused her of adultery, Salangi said.
Then they "faked a court to decide about the fate of this woman and in one hour, they executed the woman," he added.
Both Taliban commanders were subsequently killed by a third Taliban commander, Salangi said.
"We went there to investigate and we are still looking for people who were involved in this brutal act," he said.
It is not clear from the video when it was filmed.
The killing took place in the village of Qimchok, not far north of the capital Kabul.
Lawmaker Fawzia Koofi called it a huge backward step for women's issues in Afghanistan.
"I think we will have to do something serious about this, we will have to do something as women, but also as human beings," she said. "She didn't even say one word to defend herself."
Koofi wept on Saturday as she watched the video of the execution.
The United States condemned the killing "in the strongest possible terms," calling it a "cold-blooded murder."
"The protection of women's rights is critical around the world, but especially in Afghanistan, where such rights were ignored, attacked and eroded under Taliban rule," the American embassy said in a statement on Sunday.
The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan also condemned the execution.
"Let's be clear, this wasn't justice, this was murder, and an atrocity of unspeakable cruelty," ISAF commander Gen. John Allen said in a statement Sunday. "The Taliban's continued brutality toward innocent civilians, particularly women, must be condemned in the strongest terms. There has been too much progress made by too many brave Afghans, especially on the part of women, for this kind of criminal behavior to be tolerated."
The public execution is the latest and among the most shocking examples of violence against women in Afghanistan, but it is far from an isolated case.
The Taliban also does not have a monopoly on the violence, cautioned Christine Fair, with the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University.
"It's really important to not see this exclusively in terms of the Taliban, but this is a set of practices that actually have existed and continue to exist throughout Afghanistan," she said.
Nearly nine out of 10 women suffer physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage at least once in their lifetimes, Human Rights Watch said in its 2012 annual report.
The country has 14 shelters for abused women, a number which the campaign group says "does not meet even a small fraction of the need."
Hundreds of students and teachers at girls' schools in the country have been hospitalized with suspected poisoning this year alone. Girls were forbidden to go to school when the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001.
Salangi, the provincial governor, spoke to CNN about the killing on Sunday, the same day that representatives of more than 80 nations and organizations met to consider pouring billions more aid dollars into the country.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged delegates including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to demand complex reforms in exchange for the money.
"Afghan institutions are still in their nascent stages," he said. "The very programs which offer the best hope of sustainability of Afghan institutions should not be held hostage to complex preconditions."
Clinton said donors at the conference pledged about $16 billion for Afghanistan over four years. That amount did not include money from the United States because any foreign aid must be approved by Congress.
Under a security pact with Afghanistan, nearly all U.S.-led NATO troops will withdraw from the country by the end of 2014.
"We can ask the question what will happen when we leave, but let's remember that this is actually happening while we're still there," said Fair, with Georgetown.
CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Chelsea J. Carter and Sara Sidner, and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this story.

Nikon's latest camera runs Android
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 9:27 PM EDT, Wed August 22, 2012 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
Nikon's newest point-and-shoot camera, the Coolpix S800c, is powered by the Android 2.3 operating system.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Nikon's new point-and-shoot camera is powered by the Android operating system
The touchscreen camera can access the Google Play store and run apps
For instant sharing, photographers can use the camera's Wi-Fi or tether it to a smartphone or tablet
(CNN) -- The gulf between smartphones and cameras is getting smaller, thanks to a new point-and-shoot camera from Nikon that's powered by the Android operating system.
The 16-megapixel Coolpix S800c camera, announced Wednesday, will be the first camera running Android on the market when it hits shelves in September.
The addition of Android brings a few much-needed features to the point-and-shoot. Users can download mobile apps from the Google Play store and share images over cellular networks by tethering to a nearby smartphone or tablet.
Pinterest releases new iPad and Android apps
When phone makers first started adding tiny, low-resolution cameras to their devices, the camera industry was not terribly threatened. They had glorious digital SLR cameras with interchangeable lenses, sleek pocket cameras with large sensors and manual controls, and features like high-ISO for low-light shooting, megazoom, and rugged bodies for the outdoors.
Anyone who loved photos would certainly prefer the high-quality shots captured on "real" cameras, right?
But the camera companies underestimated just how important convenience was to consumers, and the public's appetite for sharing photos of moments right when they happened. The resulting cellphone images were low-quality, but nothing a little sepia-filter couldn't fix.
The iPhone was not the first phone to have a camera, but it made sharing images online, over its cellular connection, a snap. In 2011, more than a quarter of photos and videos were captured using a smartphone, according to a study from research company NPD Group. That number is only getting larger.
The $350 Coolpix S800c is bringing some of what has made those smartphones so popular to a camera. It doesn't have a cellular connection, but it does have Wi-Fi. Wireless connections have been around for a while on cameras, but the addition of Android means the camera can tether to a smartphone or tablet running Android when there's no Wi-Fi network handy.
The 3.5-inch touchscreen display gives users access to the Google Play store, where photogs can go to download more apps for their camera, including editing tools and social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook and, of course, Instagram. The camera can also run all the regular smartphone apps, allowing users to send e-mail, browse the Internet, listen to music and play games.
Like Apple's iPod Touch, it draws the line at making phone calls, however.
The camera has 10X zoom, can shoot 1080p video, and includes GPS and maps for tagging images with locations. There are no manual controls. The S800c is running Android 2.3, known as Gingerbread, which is not the most recent version of the operating system.
That Nikon is the first to bring an Android camera to market is a surprise, since competitors Sony and Samsung already make Android devices and were in a better position to combine the two products. Polaroid showed off a demo camera running Android at the Consumer Electronics show in January, the SC1630, but it isn't yet available.
Nikon's Android camera may be a first in the camera industry, but it's still playing catch-up to the real competitors: smartphones with increasingly higher-quality cameras.

Review: Neil Young and Crazy Horse's Psychedelic Pill
By David Fricke, Rolling Stone
updated 1:17 PM EDT, Wed October 31, 2012
Neil Young performs with Crazy Horse at the Hard Rock Presents Pavilion on August 3, 2012 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Psychedelic Pill is Young's second album of 2012 with the Horse
For most of its near-90 minutes, Psychedelic Pill is an infuriated trip
A big closing chunk of one song is Young's idea of a giant marching through ruin
(Rolling Stone) -- For Neil Young, the Sixties never ended. The music, memories and changes haunt his best songs and records like bittersweet perfume: vital, endlessly renewing inspirations that are also constant, enraging reminders of promises broken and ideals betrayed. In "Twisted Road," one of eight new songs sprawled across this turbulent two-CD set, Young recalls, in a brilliantly mixed metaphor, the first time he heard Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone": "Poetry rolling off his tongue/Like Hank Williams chewing bubble gum." And Young tells you what he did with the impact. "I felt that magic and took it home/Gave it a twist and made it mine," he sings over Crazy Horse's rough-country swagger, as if the marvel of that time and his dreams are still close enough to touch.
So are the mess and his dismay.
Psychedelic Pill is Young's second album of 2012 with the Horse, his perfectly unpolished garage band of 43 years, and it has the roiling honesty and brutal exuberance of their best records together. This one opens with a special perversity: the thumping 27-minute fuzz-box trance of "Driftin' Back." Young, on lead guitar, spits feedback and throttles his whammy bar for long, mad stretches over rhythm guitarist Frank Sampedro's trusty two-chord support and the rock-infantry march of bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina. Every six or so minutes, Young's cracked yelp cuts through the tumult, spiking the flashback in the dreamy chorus with a contemporary disgust for tech-giant greed and the lousy sound of MP3s, whose sh***y fidelity is "blockin' out my anger/Blockin' out my thoughts."
There is, in fact, no mistaking Young's mood. For most of its near-90 minutes, Psychedelic Pill is an infuriated trip: long tracks of barbed-guitar jamming and often surrealistic ire ("Gonna get me a hip-hop haircut," he sneers, to no apparent sense, in "Driftin' Back") interrupted by short bursts of warming bliss. It is a weirdly compelling seesaw. "Psychedelic Pill" is a Day-Glo-angel twist on "Cinnamon Girl" coated, in the first of two versions here, with jet-engine-like phasing. But then comes "Ramada Inn," 17 minutes of broiling guitars and stressed a ection in which Young examines a love that has somehow stayed alive long after the high times turned into routine and basic daily needs.
Even the sweet stuff is spiked. In the cheerful country funk of "Born in Ontario," Young admits he writes songs "to make sense of my inner rage." Yet he keeps finding hope in there. "Me and some of my friends/We were going to save the world. . . . But then the weather changed . . . and it breaks my heart," Young confesses through black clouds of distortion in "Walk Like a Giant," dogged by the mocking whistle of the Horse.
A big closing chunk of the song's 16 minutes is Young's idea of a giant marching through ruin: thunderclap drums and hacking-cough chords. But the real end hints at rebirth: a cleansing coda of wordless acid-choir sunshine. Young may feel like the last hippie standing, but he still sounds like a guy who believes the dreaming is not done.

ABC evicts 'Apt. 23'
By James Hibberd, EW
updated 5:41 PM EST, Tue January 22, 2013
Dreama Walker and Krysten Ritter's in "Don't Trust The B----- in Apartment 23."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Don't Trust the B—- in Apt. 23" is being pulled from the schedule
ABC rep says the comedy is not canceled
Co-star tweeted "We've basically been canceled"
(EW.com) -- ABC is pulling comedy series "Don't Trust the B—- in Apt. 23."
The low-rated Tuesday night series is being removed from the network's primetime schedule. There's eight episodes left in the can (13 were ordered and shot this season; plus six were leftover from last season). The network hasn't decided when/if they're going to see daylight. The network will air two episodes of the similarly struggling Happy Endings instead.
'All My Children' update: Who is in for online return
Now, it should be noted here that an ABC rep says the comedy is not canceled.
But as "Apt. 23" co-star James Van Der Beek points out on Twitter, when a struggling show gets unexpectedly yanked from the schedule and its remaining episodes don't have a return date ... "Translation: We've basically been canceled." And when has The Beek ever lied to you? While ABC has been in c-word denial lately. Pan-Am, Last Resort, 666 ... all were canceled. Yet none were "canceled."
'Arrow' casts 'ER' alum
Bottom line:" Apt. 23" could end up back on the air filling a time slot at some point, perhaps in the summer. The network will probably want to put those remaining episodes to use. But will it ever go back into production on additional episodes? Hmm, don't trust the net that's ABC...

A wary Midwest watches the sky for another day
From Ed Payne and Sean Morris, CNN
updated 7:24 PM EDT, Wed May 29, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Forecasters warn of high winds, hail around Oklahoma City
Tornado watches stretch from Texas Panhandle to Nebraska
Sporadic warnings issued, but no immediate reports of damage
Warm Gulf moisture is fueling the storm system
(CNN) -- Tornado watches stretched from the Texas Panhandle to central Nebraska on Wednesday as another wave of storms put portions of the Plains states and Midwest squarely in the bull's-eye again.
It was the latest round of severe weather to settle over America's heartland as warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico saturated the area, bringing with it the risk of twisters, large hail and damaging winds.
Though radar indications triggered sporadic warnings for a handful of counties in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska, no tornadoes or damage had been reported by Wednesday evening.
However, a severe thunderstorm warning posted for the Kearney, Nebraska, area said golf ball-sized hail that could damage vehicles, roofs and crops was possible as the storm swept northward. In Macksville, Kansas, about 100 miles west of Wichita, residents reported wind gusts up to 80 mph, the National Weather Service said.
The watches also covered most of western Oklahoma and Oklahoma City and its suburbs. One of those, Moore, was hit May 20 by a top-scale, mile-wide tornado that killed 24 people.
The weather service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area Wednesday evening, saying hail and wind gusts up to 70 mph were possible.
The threat covers more than half the country, stretching from the Canadian border to the Gulf coast and from the Eastern Seaboard to the Intermountain West.
This will most likely occur in the form of severe thunderstorms, though the forecast notes there's also a greater probability than usual of large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes.
Opinion: Tornado risk goes beyond the 'Alley'
The powerful storms have been dumping heavy rain across the region, especially on portions of Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Illinois and Indiana, where flood warnings were in place, the Weather Service said.
Multiple tornadoes were spotted across Kansas on Tuesday evening. One touched down near the north-central town of Corning, striking six farms, one of which was destroyed, according to Nemaha County emergency manager Todd Swart. But there were no reports of injuries or deaths: "I imagine there are some dead hogs," Swart said.
Justin Strathman saw the twister first-hand, catching the video on his cell phone. "It was amazing," he told CNN affiliate KSHB. "It was scary. I ain't gonna lie."
A tornado's heading your way: Now what?
Later Tuesday, strong winds -- which National Weather Service reports said may have been a tornado, though local police said they were more likely potent straight-line winds -- caused damage near Waterford, Pennsylvania. This northwestern Pennsylvania town is about 15 miles south of Erie.
CNN's Matt Smith, Greg Botelho and Carma Hassan contributed to this report

Amelia Earhart mystery again rises to the surface
By Joe Sterling and Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN
updated 11:36 AM EDT, Sun June 2, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A grainy sonar image has been spotted, an aircraft recovery group says
Historian at Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum skeptical of anything conclusive showing up
Technology today is advanced enough to locate a plane, a trade association official says
(CNN) -- Could search crews be just a few hundred feet from solving a mystery that has riveted millions for 76 years?
That's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937.
Yet that evidence has been met with skepticism in some quarters.
Debate about the mystery gained new currency this week after researchers publicized images recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island in the South Pacific.
The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery raised the prospect of a big break in the case by publishing an image online. It showed something -- hard for the layman to size up -- on the ocean floor.

The group said, "It's the right size, it's the right shape and it's in the right place."
Could it really be a piece of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane?
Louise Foudray, caretaker and historian of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison, Kansas, chose her words carefully on Friday afternoon.
"We don't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing. We do like the idea that people are still interested," she said. "But we're skeptical."
Opinion: Will mystery of Earhart be solved?
She said there have been other theories that have emerged. One is that Earhart's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands. Another is that Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity.
There are people out there who buy those theories. But in reality, Foudray said, "no one has yet to come up with anything conclusive."
It wasn't until March that one analyst made a possible connection to Earhart in an online forum for the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery.
The group said experts have offered various interpretations. Some think the sonar image could be a man-made object, and others say it could be a geologic feature.
Earhart: The evidence we almost lost
"So did (last summer's) expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world's most famous missing airplane? Or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge?" the organization says on its website. "Of course we're not going to know until we can get back out there, but until then the anomaly is worth close study."
Richard Fredricks, executive director of the American Salvage Association, a trade group, said that "almost anything is possible" these days with advanced technology. And that includes locating a lost airplane.
He cited technology such as side-scan sonar and magnetometers but said finding a lost plane such as the Earhart craft is "more a function of funding than technology." Money is needed to invest in expeditions, he said. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery on its website is asking for contributions to continue its work.
Foudray said she's heard all of the evidence and nothing solid has risen to the surface. And that includes the latest foray into the South Pacific deep.
"We don't expect anything," she said.

New Year, new laws: Obamacare, pot, guns and drones
By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN
updated 10:49 AM EST, Tue December 31, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
40,000 measures set to become law in 2014
Obamacare mandate is the big federal law going into effect
But states and cities have laws impacting minimum wage, shark fins and gender identity

Washington (CNN) -- Not everyone subscribes to a New Year's resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014.
Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.
Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.

The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.
For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.
The Obamacare, or Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care.
Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1.
Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.
Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins
Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered.
Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.
California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement.
Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.
Illinois and drones
Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its "air angels" effort to protect against "cruel" and "illegal" hunting.
Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant.
Gender and voting identity
California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams "consistent with their gender identity," even if it's different than their gender at birth.
Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth.
Minimum wage and former felon employment
Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage.
While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey and Connecticut will see a slightly larger increase.
New Jersey residents voted to raise the state's minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.
California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.
Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application.
Social media and pot
Oregon: Employers and schools can't require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.
Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary.
