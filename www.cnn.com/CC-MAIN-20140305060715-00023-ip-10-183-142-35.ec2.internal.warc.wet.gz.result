'Horrorcore' singer suspected in Virginia killings Story Highlights 20-year-old rapper of "Horrorcore" accused of Virginia slayings Little known underground music genre celebrates macabre killings Tow-truck driver gave suspect a lift; said he was "stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled" Defense lawyer said he's unsure Richard McCroskey "gets the severity of everything" Next Article in Crime » By Wayne Drash CNN (CNN) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville, Virginia, when they strolled by a home on First Avenue. "Something smells dead," her friend said. Richard Samuel McCroskey has been arrested in connection with the killings of four people in Virginia. They were thinking animal. A dog, a cat, something like that. They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. It was Thursday, September 17. But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery. Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20-year-old rapper in the underground genre of "Horrorcore" who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings. The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma. The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University. McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Police and the prosecutor's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN. But in late September, authorities said more charges are pending. Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little-known music genre. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy. Nobody saw what would come next. Anderson Cooper 360

The slayings have been the talk of Farmville, a town of 7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden-Sydney College. Senseless is the word you hear most. It's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. It's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer; it's that it happened under their noses. McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. He went by the name Syko Sam. In one YouTube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags: "Last night I was the murderous rage. Now, I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting." Don't Miss WWBT: Mother, daughter laid to rest in Farmville

'Stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled' Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a.m. on Friday, September 18, tow-truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey, whose car was stuck. Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt and "was really smelling bad, like real bad. I can't describe it." McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock's Honda. Napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. At the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain. When McCroskey hopped into Napier's flatbed, the tow-truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows. "I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face," he said. "That was the stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled." Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store. McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted. Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee. According to police, McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport. By mid-afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue. McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night. When he was being led to jail, McCroskey told reporters, "Jesus told me to do it." Suspect's family, community grieve Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN-affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks. She mourned his arrest and struggled with the accusations against him. "I want to hear his voice. I am so concerned, so worried -- not just for him [but] other people, other families involved dealing with this loss," she said. Read WWBT's special coverage Defense attorney Cary Bowen told CNN, "I don't want to say he's in shock. That's a medical term, but it's a big experience for him. ... I'm not sure he gets the severity of everything right now." The community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley. The Rev. Sylvia Meadows of Farmville United Methodist Church baptized Emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. The pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity. "We have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists," Meadows said. "God is stronger than evil. God is bigger." Luther Glenn, a member of Walker's Presbyterian Church where Niederbrock was pastor, took issue with McCroskey's comment about Jesus telling him to act. "I think it's deeply rooted in Satan, if you want to know the truth." Elizabeth McCutchen, who passed the First Avenue home some time after the slayings, said the killings have affected every fabric of the community: the churches, the colleges, and their youth. "This is the kind of town that goes to the rescue of survivors, but there's nobody [left] -- we can't do anything about it," she said. "It's been really, really upsetting."

The Ken fire -- named for a local freeway exit -- had scorched some 350 acres was 40% contained late Monday night, said Forest Service spokeswoman Angelica Mendoza. The fire was first reported Monday afternoon in a mostly rural, sparsely populated area of the sprawling county in southeast California. Authorities do not know what started it. More than 500 firefighters, 18 fire engines and 11 aircraft worked the blaze Monday, Mendoza said. One firefighter suffered a knee injury. In addition, a ranch in the area was evacuated and at least one home was burned, Mendoza said. A separate fire also in San Bernadino County consumed about three acres before it was contained, according to the county fire department.

Indian activist tells protesters: 'Your revolution has energized me' From Ram Ramgopal and Harmeet Shah Singh, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSHazare's YouTube video warns he may extend fast another weekHazare will fast in Ramlila Maidan, a public ground in New DelhiIndian PM Singh says his government acknowledges the right to peaceful protestsAmnesty calls on U.S. President Obama to urge Singh to allow the protests (CNN) -- Anna Hazare, the 74-year-old Indian activist set to begin a 15-day hunger strike at a public venue, delivered a message Thursday to the thousands who have taken to the streets in support of his anti-corruption crusade. "Your revolution has energized me," he said in a YouTube video posted by his adviser, Kiran Bedi. Speaking from Tihar jail in which he was staying -- though he was not a prisoner -- he added, "I will stay here tonight and will be out with you tomorrow." "My health is good. In fact, I am more alert than ever. We will not stop until we get this Lokpal bill," he said, referring to the anti-corruption body that protesters want set up. And he warned his strike could go on longer. "They've given me 15 days, but if the Lokpal is not established, I will extend my fast by another seven days." He added, "The people out on the streets are finding it difficult to live because of the corruption. The public will continue to be on the streets as long as this Lokpal isn't created." Bedi, a former police adviser, wrote in a tweet posting a link to the video, "It was destiny doing this. Share. Anna is ours." She added, "Jai hind" -- long live India. Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday. As thousands took to the streets to protest the arrest, authorities let him free, but he refused to leave the jail. He accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks. The site chosen is Ramlila Maidan, a public ground that often stages exhibitions and events. He plans to arrive at the grounds Friday. Hazare only recently rose to national prominence, as his protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say. A new website ipaidabribe.com, in which people can denounce the corruption they encounter in their daily lives, quickly gained popularity. Hazare's detention appears to have added to his popularity, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions. Corruption is considered an endemic problem that affects all levels of Indian society. According to a 2010 Transparency International report, India ranked 87th out of 178 countries in its corruption-perception index. In April, Suresh Kalmadi, the chief organizer for last year's Commonwealth Games, was arrested and accused of buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. India's former telecom minister A. Raja, several bureaucrats and corporate officials are facing trial in connection with a multi-billion-dollar scandal involving the suspected below-price sale of mobile-phone radio waves in 2008. The draw of Hazare's planned hunger strike was so great that police tried to put conditions on it. Organizers did not accept six of 22 police conditions for allowing the protest, including limiting the crowd to the capacity of the ground, police said. As a result, Hazare was detained, as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join Hazare at a protest site. Indian activist to begin fast

Protests and Demonstrations
A magistrate sent Hazare and seven supporters to jail after they failed to post bail, according to Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman in New Delhi. They were freed hours later and brought to a prison office after the magistrate issued release orders, jail spokesman Sunil Gupta said. The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without the conditions, the jail spokesman said. Thousands gathered in several cities, chanting pro-Hazare slogans and echoing his demands. Supporters carrying Indian flags held sit-ins, marches and noisy demonstrations. Many had "I am Anna" labels on their shirts. Hazare conducted a similar five-day hunger strike in April at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar landmark, ending it after India's prime minister agreed to introduce long-pending legislation. Anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman, saying the bill, now in Parliament, is too weak a measure. Critics have accused the activists of undermining lawmakers who will decide the proposed law. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday justified the arrests in a statement before Parliament. "Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests," he said, adding that Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions. Amid shouts by opposition lawmakers over the police response to Hazare's protest, the Indian prime minister also cited supremacy of the legislature. "I am not aware of any constitutional philosophy or principle that allows anyone to question the sole prerogative of parliament to make a law," he said. Singh, whose government is roiled in massive corruption scandals, said in a national address earlier in the week that no single measure could handle chronic corruption. "I believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate corruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts," Singh said. Amnesty International called Thursday for U.S. President Barack Obama to urge Singh "to respect the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in the context of anti-corruption rallies taking place in India." "President Obama has repeatedly described India as a strong ally," the human rights group said in a statement, adding that Obama "should not miss this opportunity to prove that the United States is a friend of the Indian people." "Any silence will be misinterpreted as the United States looking the other way when it comes to the importance of basic rights like freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in India. President Obama should instruct the U.S. ambassador to India to visit protest sites." Activists have appealed to government employees to take a day off work in a show of solidarity with Hazare. In his video, Hazare warned that more arrests could lie ahead. "The jails that are empty, we will keep filling them," he said. "I tell these young people: As long as the Lokpal isn't created, the jails will never be empty." "We have no demands of the government," he said. "We have just sent them to do two things: look after our money and account for it and make good laws for the country." He insisted the Lokpal bill would reduce corruption by 65 to 70 percent. "I will not stop, as long as there's breath in my body, until this becomes law," Hazare said.

U.S. launches first drone strike since deadly November attack
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 4:57 AM EST, Wed January 11, 2012
Drone missions were halted last year after a set of controversial American strikes left two dozen Pakistani soldiers dead.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Four suspected militants killed, according to Pakistani intelligence sources The attack represents an apparent end to the pause in U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan
U.S strikes in November left 24 Pakistani soldiers dead, straining U.S.-Pakistan relations
The U.S. launches new drone attack against suspected militants in Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States has launched its first drone attack in Pakistan after more than a month-long lull, killing at least four suspected militants, CNN has confirmed.
The drone fired two missiles on Tuesday at a suspected militant compound near the provincial capital of Miranshah in the North Waziristan region, located in the country's volatile tribal belt that borders Afghanistan.
It represents an apparent end to the pause in U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, halted last year after a set of controversial American strikes left two dozen Pakistani soldiers dead at two mountainous border posts and further strained relations between the two nations.
Pakistan's military has repeatedly insisted that airstrikes that killed 24 of its soldiers on November 26 near the Afghan border were deliberate. Its government soon thereafter ordered the American military to vacate an air base used to launch drone strikes.
A U.S. investigation into the attacks blamed poor communication and "inadequate coordination" between both nations that prompted the deadly incident.
Brig. Gen. Stephen A. Clark said last month that a coalition team heading toward an Afghan village near the Pakistani border came under attack from "very direct and heavy" machine gun fire, as well as to incoming mortars.
The ground commander responded with a "show of force," with an F-15 jet and an AC-130 gunship making their presence known and dropped flares illuminating the area, Clark said. When the firing and mortars didn't stop, airstrikes were called in.
But Pakistani officials have argued that well-established operating procedures and an intricate system for operational information sharing were deliberately ignored, which led to the deaths.
The disagreement is thought to have further eroded the already fragile relations between the United States and Pakistan.
CNN's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson in Washington and Saboor Khattak in Pakistan contributed to this report.

Driven by destiny: Zanardi wins the race of his life to take gold
By Sarah Holt, for CNN
updated 10:05 AM EDT, Thu September 6, 2012
Alex Zanardi proudly displays the gold medal he won at the 2012 London Paralympics in the Individual H4 Time Trial.
Before taking up hand cycling, he had previously driven on the same Brands Hatch circuit, 20 miles outside of London, in a touring car.
Zanardi decided to give up his motor racing career three years ago at the age of 42, having continued it despite a life-threatening crash in 2001. Driving a Honda Reynard (No. 66) Zanardi sustained horrific injuries during a CART Championship series race in Germany as he collided with fellow competitor Alexandre Tagliani (No. 33). Zanardi made a successful return to motorsport after his horror crash and raced in single seaters and touring cars, using prosthetic limbs and modified vehicles. Zanardi was honored for his incredible comeback at the Laureus World Sports awards in 2005.
While he struggled in four seasons in Formula One, Zanardi enjoyed success in open-wheel racing as he twice won the U.S. CART series.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ex-Formula One driver Alex Zanardi claims gold medal in hand cycling at the London 2012 Paralympics
He lost both his legs in a horrific crash in 2001 but continued in motorsport
Italian first tried hand cycling in 2007 and made it his new career two years later
The 45-year-old says he has made the most of the chances fate has given him
(CNN) -- "It's been a magical adventure, and this is a fantastic conclusion."
Not many people get second chances in life, but Alex Zanardi is making the most of his.
In 2001 the ex-Formula One driver was at death's door, lucky to survive a horrific accident that left him with only 30% of his blood supply. He lost both his legs -- amputated at the knee -- after being pulled from the wreckage of his car at a race in Germany.
Fast forward more than a decade, to another race track, and the Italian is on top of the world.
While he was never able to reach the heights of success in F1 -- Zanardi never made the podium in 44 races -- he is a champion Paralympian.

Paralympics 2012: The best photos
Tatyana McFadden is an eight-time world champion sprint athlete from the United States. She has previously participated in Paralympic Games in Athens and Beijing. So far in London, she has added a gold to her medal stash. Before the London Paralympics, Jessica Long told usaswimming.com she wanted to have fun while competing this year. This relaxed attitude has worked well for Long who has won three gold medals since arriving in London, which she is adding to her nine previous Paralympics medals. Sarah Storey was a big name for ParalympicsGB before the Games started. She cemeted her name in the Paralympic record books by winning the first gold medal for the host nation and setting a new world record -- all on day one.
Not only is Esther Vergeer the female world number one in wheelchair tennis, but she also holds the remarkable record of 465 unbeaten singles matches over almost a decade. Alexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell of Great Britain got together as a sailing team in 2007 and have gone on to win four consecutive world titles. However, a paralympic medal has so far alluded them. U.S. athlete April Holmes competes in the women's 100m T44 event on day eight of the 2008 Paralympic Games. She beat her own world record, fulfilling an ambition she'd spoken about before the games. Sarai Gascon of Spain competes in the women's 100m Butterfly S9 on day one of the London 2012 Paralympic Games at the Aquatics Centre. She was up against preeminent South African Natalie du Toit. She placed second but with many races to go, the pair's battle is set to continue.
Jess Gallagher is the first and only Australian woman to win a medal at the Paralympic winter games, which she did in Vancouver in 2010. In London, she's aiming for a summer paralympics medal in long jump having come sixth in the javelin.

8 female Paralympians to watch Due to the Paralympics' classification rules, South Africa's double amputee "Blade Runner" Oscar Pistorius can line up against runners with only one prosthetic leg. Chinese swimmer Zheng Tao has no arms, but that didn't stop him winning gold against competitors more physically abled.
Britain's gold medalist Jonathan Fox looked "more able" outside the pool than his swimming rivals, according to former Canadian Paralympic middle-distance runner David Howe, who is now an academic.
Paralympic swimmer Mallory Weggemann, along with U.S. teammate Victoria Arlen, have both battled the International Paralympic Committee after having their classifications changed.
Athletes are placed in one of six main disability groups: those with spinal injuries, cerebral palsy, amputees, the blind or visually impaired, intellectual disabilities and those whose disabilities fall outside of those categories, like those born with dwarfism or multiple sclerosis.
Each of the Paralympics' 20 sports are divided between the different classifications and given a number that denotes the severity of the disability -- 1 being the most severe, 10 the least. The IPC has complicated things further by trying to slim down the number of medals and disciplines and look beyond the disability as the defining factor in classification. Instead, it says, look to the potential of the athlete.

Classifiying Paralympic ability
"I'm somebody very lucky who had a great life," the the 45-year-old Zanardi said after winning gold in his adopted sport of hand cycling at Britain's Brands Hatch circuit on Wednesday.
"I haven't wasted many opportunities that fate gave me. I've certainly had many more opportunities than I deserved, but luckily enough I ended up making the right choices."
From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann
In the buildup to the London Games, Zanardi joked, with a dose of black humor, that his accident "was how I won my ticket to the 2012 Paralympics."
Having failed to make a career in F1 after four difficult seasons, he turned to the U.S. CART series where he twice won the drivers' title for Chip Ganassi's team.
That earned him a return to the elite division of motorsport in 1999 with the Williams team, but again he struggled.
Drifting back to open-wheel cars, fate came calling at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz on September 15, 2001. He had worked his way up from the rear of the field to lead the race with 13 laps to go before that life-changing crash.
Given the severity of his injuries, the doctors at the scene of the accident said Zanardi should never have survived.
Remarkably just two months later, he was walking again using prosthetic legs of his own design. Another two years on, he finished the race that nearly took his life, completing the remaining 13 laps at Lausitz in a specially modified touring car.
By 2004 he was racing touring cars fulltime with the help of hand-operated brake and accelerator paddles. Zanardi even drove a modified BMW Formula One car in 2006.
Rwandan amputees bring message of hope: 'We are superstars'
But while most motorsport stars find it difficult to give up their high-octane thrills, Zanardi did just that.
It has been a long road to the London 2012 Paralympics for the Rwandan men's sitting volleyball team, which is the best in Africa.
Team captain Dominique Bizimana told CNN: "I think we are superstars. For us disability is nothing. We are able. We are making sure we tell people disability is nothing. It is not inability."
Most of the players are amputees from the country's 1994 genocide.
As many as one million people were killed when a civil war between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis broke out.
Hundreds of thousands of people were left maimed, but sport has provided an outlet for many and helped reconciliation between the two communities. Both Hutus and Tutsis are in the volleyball team.
The game itself is fast paced and, according to the team's Dutch coach, technically more demanding than able-bodied volleyball.
The team's training facilities in the capital Kigali are basic. The players hope to spring a surprise or two, but lost their opening game to Iran, one of the favorites for gold.
The Rwandans will also face Brazil, China and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Pool B. Sit down, stand up

Rwanda's sitting volleyball team
Elliot Mujaji was a member of Zimbabwe's national athletics team and qualified to compete at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, when he suffered severe burns in an electrical accident. His right arm was amputated, and he remained in a coma for two months. He came back to athletics, and won the first ever Paralympic gold for his country.
South Africa's "Blade Runner" Oscar Pistorius made history at London 2012 by becoming the first double amputee to compete on the track and make an Olympic final. He is the favorite in the Paralympics 100 meters run. In 1995, while training to become a professional runner, Henry Wanyoike became almost completely blind after suffering a stroke. He got back to competing, and became one of the fastest men on the planet. He holds two world records in 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and the record time for marathon.
Achmat Hassiem lost his foot to a Great White shark when participating in a lifeguard training session in 2006. After an amazing recovery, he qualified for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics and has been competing ever since. Inset picture: Hassiem shows off a fragment of a shark's tooth that was stuck in his leg after he was attacked.
South African Natalie Du Toit lost her left leg when she was hit by a car as a young promising swimmer. She kept training and, besides winning five gold medals in Beijing Paralympics, she qualified for Beijing Olympics 10 km swimming race, finishing 16th. She recently announced London will be her last major competition.
The star of Egyptian powerlifting, Metwaly Mathana started the sport at the age of 5. According to his bio with the Egyptian Paralympic committee, he had to leave his village as there was not enough steel for him to keep lifting. He won three gold medals in three consecutive Games. Tunisia's Somaya Bousaid won two gold medals in Beijing 2008 Games -- and became one of the most successful athletes from her country. She was born blind and competes in the category of visually-impaired athletes. Cyclist Roxy Burns, a South African cerebral palsy sufferer, made her Paralympic debut in Beijing in 2008. As an 18-year-old, she finished sixth in the 500 meters track time trial. Her results have been improving since Beijing and she is one of the favorites for a medal.
Tesfalem Gebru Kebede won a bronze medal in last year's world championship and is one of Ethiopia's top athletes. He lost his hand when his house was bombed during the Ethio-Eritrea war.

Paralympics Opening Ceremony
"Three years ago I decided to stop motor racing, not because I had to but because I wanted to," he said.
"It looked stupid, because at the age of 42 to dump everything to try to pursue an objective to qualify for the Games seemed to be against all odds for a man of my age.
"It felt very crazy but it's not the first crazy thing that I do in my life, so I guess it will not be the last."
Zanardi replaced one adrenaline buzz with another.
He discovered hand cycling -- a sport where the bikes are powered by the riders' arms -- at the 2007 New York marathon.
Invited to speak as a guest, Zanardi decided if he was going to fly all the way from Italy to the U.S. he might as well compete. Compete he did, finishing fourth after only a few weeks' training.
He had found his new passion, competing in the 2009 world championships and then setting about qualifying for the 2012 Paralympics.
"This was the horizon," he said, smiling as a burst of brilliant, afternoon sunshine lit up his face following his victory in the H4 classification road time trial.
"I'm very, very happy. It's never been a sacrifice. I've enjoyed every day of training as much as this moment now."
Paralympic sailing: A tale of triumph and technology
Immediately after his win, the F1 family -- including former world champions Mario Andretti and Jenson Button -- took to social media sites to congratulate Zanardi.
Although he was only briefly in their ranks, he is still remembered as one of the sport's "nice guys" and most charismatic competitors.

Paralympian Paul left his Wall Street job to take over Sail to Prevail - an organization which teaches disabled children to sail. From eight children a year, the charity, based in Newport, Rhode Island, now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually.
Paul, left, competes in the three-person sailing event at the Sydney Paralympics in 2000. The U.S. failed to win a medal, but gold is on the cards at London 2012 Callahan says.
Paul became a quadriplegic after slipping on a wet floor and breaking his neck as a 21-year-old. He was paralyzed from the chest down, keeping the use of his arms, but not his hands.

U.S. Paralympic sailor Paul Callahan eyes gold
The golden ending to his journey came at Brands Hatch, a circuit 20 miles from London where Zanardi had previously raced in a touring car.
"With an engine pushing me I didn't realize it was that hilly," he said.
"It's very, very hard but if I had to design the course for the Games this is what I would have done. It's absolutely beautiful, it's very hard -- I guess it really suits my characteristics as an old man."
So how does the thrill of winning a cycling race compare to the highs of motor racing?
"When you are in your twenties you just think the races are what matter the most," Zanardi said.
"When you are in your forties you really appreciate what you do every day. Of course today is very important but I really appreciate what I did in the past.
"Day by day, it's been magical, a magical adventure and this is a fantastic conclusion."
It seems unlikely that a man who could not be bowed by losing both of his legs will retire from sport anytime soon.
He has already mooted a possible return at the 2016 Rio Games, but Zanardi also joked that his next plan was to add another wheel and engine to his cycle and come back to Brands Hatch.
The circuit also hosts Superbike racing and, judging by the glint in his eye, perhaps Zanardi is already weighing up a new challenge of trying out a faster form of wheeled sport.

Don't blame Muslim Brotherhood for Morsy power grab
By Tarek Masoud, Special to CNN
updated 12:11 PM EST, Tue November 27, 2012
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy waves to his supporters in front of the presidential palace in Cairo on November 23.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy announced measures vs. judiciary
Tarek Masoud: Some say this shows an Islamist party can't be trusted to run a democracy
He says the power grab isn't a result of the Muslim Brotherhood, but of Egypt's power vacuum
Editor's note: Tarek Masoud is an associate professor of public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
(CNN) -- Twenty years ago, Edward Djerejian, a former U.S. diplomat, famously worried that Islamists would exploit democratic elections to come to power, after which they would pull the democratic ladder up behind them. Instead of one man, one vote, he said, Islamists wanted one man, one vote, one time.
Last week, Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and his country's first democratically elected president, seemed to fulfill Djerejian's grim prophecy.
In a series of unilateral amendments to Egypt's interim constitution, Morsy declared that his word "is final and binding and cannot be appealed by any way or to any entity," and that he is empowered to "take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution."
But, as shocking as Morsy's actions are, they do not prove that Islamists cannot be democrats. Morsy's decision to grant himself unquestioned authority was not the final, spectacularly public phase in some hitherto clandestine Muslim Brotherhood plan to erect a holy autocracy. Instead, the Egyptian president simply did what Egyptian presidents have been doing for more than 60 years — that is, loosening institutional restraints on their authority in order to more easily fulfill their agendas.
News: Is Morsy Egypt's next strongman?
That Morsy is an Islamist is largely irrelevant. It's likely that the autocratic temptation would have seized Egypt's president regardless of his party or ideological orientation. This is not only because Egypt has had a distressingly long history of powerful executives, it's also because, at this moment in Egypt's political history, there is no actor, institution or organization able to keep the presidency in check.
Under such circumstances, even the most earnest democrats would find themselves flirting with authoritarianism — first in the name of the greater good, and then later, when pretenses can be dropped, in the service of naked ambition.
Usually, presidential ambitions are tamed by legislatures, and this was to be the case under Egypt's interim constitution. A parliament was elected in January, but the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the body once it became clear that Morsy was on his way to being elected president.
Morsy stands by power grab
Egypt on the edge after Morsy power grab
Morsy under fire for expanding power The ostensible reason for the dissolution was that the parliamentary election law ran afoul of some foggy constitutional provision, but the real reason was that Islamists dominated parliament, and the court feared that this Islamist legislature, coupled with a Muslim Brotherhood president, would lead Egypt irretrievably down the road to theocracy.
In the absence of an elected legislature, it was left to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -- the consortium of generals who ruled Egypt for the 18 months following former leader Hosni Mubarak's overthrow -- to counteract the presidency. But the Egyptian people and the generals had grown weary of each other. Word in Cairo was that the septuagenarian minister of defense, Muhammad Hussein Tantawi, wanted a way out, a "safe exit" in which he could live out his days free of the indignities visited upon his old boss, who bounced between prison and infirmary.
A bargain was worked out. The president clawed back the council's powers and sent the minister of defense and the armed forces chief of staff into cossetted retirement (while naming them presidential advisers). The political landscape now lay prostrate before him.
Except for the judiciary, and particularly the SCC. To Morsy, the 17 men (and one woman) who make up that body constitute a defiant remnant of the Mubarak order. That a clash was inevitable was apparent from Morsy's first moments in office, when his inauguration was delayed for several hours over his reluctance to be sworn in before the outgoing head of the court.
Business: Morsy makes his power plays
When the president decreed that the dissolved parliament should return to work, the judges shut him down. Later, he tried to fire Egypt's attorney general, a Mubarak appointee. Again, he was told that this was outside his ken. Rumors swirled that the SCC was planning to dissolve the second constituent assembly; others reported that a court was about to rule the Muslim Brotherhood itself illegal.
Morsy and his men point to these things and argue that he was forced to take action. But what's remarkable is what the president didn't do. For all of his complaining about SCC's dissolution of parliament's lower house, and for all the damage that the decision did to Egypt's democratic transition, the president has indicated that he will uphold it.
Essam el-Erian, deputy chairman of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, has publicly called on Morsy to reinstate the parliament, but a presidential spokesman has said that there are no plans to do so.
The president's reluctance to bring back the parliament further reinforces the impression that his main aim is to expand the powers of his office, which he probably believes is better able to put Egypt right than a raucous legislature packed with unreliable Salafists and a fractious "liberal" wing.
Though the Muslim Brotherhood has generally fallen into line behind the president, there are signs that at least some of its members are deeply uncomfortable with what he has wrought. Muslim Brotherhood politician Ahmed Fahmi, the speaker of the upper house of parliament and a relative of Morsy's, was reported to have said, "We wish that the president had conducted a popular referendum on the constitutional declaration, because what he has done has divided the country between the secular and Islamic forces." (Fahmi has since denied making the statement.)
Muhammad Abd al-Quddus, a Muslim Brotherhood member and a member of the board of Egypt's journalists union, reportedly said, "despite my membership in the Brotherhood, I am a son of the revolution for freedom. Therefore, I reject unlimited powers for the president, regardless of the reasons and the duration."
Even some of the president's defenders have betrayed hints of ambivalence over his radical decision. Muhammad al-Biltagi, secretary general of the Freedom and Justice Party's Cairo branch, declared that "many have a right to be worried" about the president's move to place his decisions above oversight, and he called for a national dialogue to arrive at a solution that would preserve "the right of the president to perform his duties with full authority without political interference from Mubarak's Constitutional Court, as well as the right of the political and social forces to receive guarantees against even temporary presidential tyranny."
Today, the only check on Morsy's authority comes from the streets. And while the protests against the president's decisions have been surprisingly robust, Morsy has so far resisted making concessions. In a meeting with Egyptian judges, he reassured them that he would limit his use of his new powers, but, as of this writing, his decree still stands.
Though large protests are scheduled, the president may believe that he can afford to wait them out. After all, a repeat of the January 25 scenario is unlikely.
The opposition to the president, though significant, remains fractured and uncoordinated, and in any case is far narrower than it was in 2011. The military, which proved essential in removing Mubarak from power, has no appetite for a repeat engagement with the responsibilities of governance, and Morsy has more legitimacy — at home and abroad — than Mubarak did.
And Morsy may believe that the great, silent majority of Egyptians are behind him. After all, Egypt's GDP is about an eighth of the United States', and a greater percentage of Americans were literate during the Civil War than Egyptians are today. The vast countryside is likely untroubled by the president's constitutional maneuverings.
One might be tempted to ask what the United States, Egypt's greatest foreign patron, can do to set that country on the right course. Some have suggested withholding aid, canceling loans and other means of pressuring Morsy to step back from the authoritarian ledge on which he now finds himself.
These measures may produce flurries of positive statements and signals in the near term, but they won't change the fundamental alchemy of Egyptian politics. One only need examine the example of Iraq, which, after almost a decade of American tutelage has nonetheless glided into a form of dominant party autocracy, to realize that genuinely democratic governance cannot be imposed, especially on poor, underdeveloped countries.
None of this — Egypt's tradition of executive dominance, its feeble institutions, its weak political organizations or its enervated society — is particularly the fault of the Muslim Brotherhood.
In fact, if we are to take any lesson from the turmoil on the banks of the Nile, it is not that Islamists can't be trusted with Egypt's presidency, it is that no one can. Morsy may yet reverse course, but odds are that this will not be the last time that an Egyptian leader tries to convince his people that he must kill democracy in order to save it.

Inside the bunker: From storm shelter to boy's prison
By Mallory Simon, CNN
updated 8:38 PM EST, Wed February 6, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Bunker will be destroyed, sheriff says
Neighbors say kidnapper told them bunker was being built as storm shelter
Bunk beds lined one wall, space was "very narrow," law enforcement officials say
Michael Creel: Two-by-fours were "bracing the walls," bunker had insulation
(CNN) -- Jimmy Lee Dykes told neighbors he was building a storm shelter.
He told one neighbor tornadoes had come dangerously close to destroying his homes in the past.
But that bunker 4 feet below the Alabama dirt became a prison for one young boy named Ethan, surely more terrifying than any storm.
He was held there for six days after being stolen from his school bus by Dykes who killed the driver after demanding hostages.
There are many details that FBI and police officials haven't released about the bunker itself and what unfolded during those six days. Was there light? A bathroom? A stove?
Five-year-old Ethan, who was held captive in an underground bunker for nearly a week by Jimmy Lee Dykes, and his mother Jennifer Kirkland visit with Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley in the governor's office on Wednesday, February 13.
Ethan draws with Gov. Bentley in his office on Feb. 13.
A white PVC pipe used by FBI agents and Dale County, Alabama, negotiators to communicate with Dykes protrudes out of the ground on Monday, February 4. For almost a week, Dykes held a 5-year-old boy hostage in a bunker after taking the boy from his school bus and killing its driver.
Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson speaks to reporters about the hostage situation in Midland City, Alabama, on Monday, February 4. Reporter Ashley Thompson, left, and Marcus Effinger work on a report for Alabama News Network from their vehicle at the site of the standoff on February 4.
Law enforcement officers walk down a dirt road to the bunker to process the crime scene on Tuesday, February 5, after the standoff ended.
A tent covers the bunker where the standoff took place. An FBI team rescued the child and killed Dykes during the operation on February 4.

Alabama bunker standoff
What Alabama suspect's bunker looks like
Alabama bunker rigged with bombs
How Alabama hostage situation ended The space itself was very narrow, law enforcement officials told CNN, with a ladder going down one wall.
Bunk beds stood against the other wall and food, water and supplies were kept on the top bunk.
The bunker had a TV which Dykes was regularly watching, officials said. They think he let Ethan watch children's shows some of the time.
Two neighbors who saw the shelter when it was being built told CNN what they remember.
A hatch made out of plywood nailed together with hinges covered the bunker and acted as a door, neighbor Jimmy Davis Jr. told CNN's George Howell. Dykes, who had lived near Davis in Midland City, Alabama, for about a year and a half, had shown him inside the bunker.
Davis last saw it about eight months ago. Since then, he said Dykes turned violent towards him and his family, and he didn't know what was going on beneath the plywood cover he could see from the road.
It was anyone's guess what was happening inside as the days ticked by with no rescue of the 5-year-old child.
Beneath the plywood hatch, Davis remembers cinder blocks stacked to form a staircase and little red bricks lined the wall.
Michael Creel, who also lived nearby for about a year, saw the bunker as well.
"He'd be up from sunup to well after 10, sometimes past midnight out there moving sand," Creel said of the early construction of the bunker.
Inside the bunker Creel said he saw two-by-fours and two-by-six boards bracing the walls and floorboards. Dykes told Creel that the built-in ceiling protected against the possibility of wet ground above, Creel said.
The inside was wrapped with eight inches of insulation and several layers of plastic, he said.
And in between the brick walls, Davis remembers something else: A PVC pipe that ran from the bunker to the front of Dykes' property.
The kidnapper told Davis while he was building the bunker he wanted to hear people or passing cars coming in case he was trapped in a storm.
But as the nearly weeklong saga unfolded, that pipe took on a different purpose.
Police used it to communicate with Dykes along with the telephone inside the bunker and the hatch door. After the rescue, authorities found the pipe packed with explosives along with another explosive inside the bunker itself, authorities said.
FBI: Bombs found in Alabama kidnapper's bunker Police said Dykes was "contentious" the entire time, but he allowed them to deliver comfort items for Ethan including coloring books and toys.
While they were negotiating with him, officials told the media Dykes used an electric heater and blankets to keep the boy warm.
As the outside world waited to learn what was unfolding inside that bunker, rescue teams found a way to see inside.
Somehow, somewhere, they slipped a camera into the hideout, a law enforcement official said.
On Sunday things began to change. Negotiators sensed a change in Dykes' demeanor. But what they saw through the camera was what made them decide to storm the bunker and rescue the boy on Monday: Dykes was holding a weapon.
That's when federal agents, who had been practicing rescue missions in a wooden replica of the bunker, detonated large explosions and two agents dropped into the bunker and fatally shot Dykes, sources told CNN.
Ethan, who celebrated his birthday shortly after the rescue, was unharmed. It was all over in seconds.
The bunker is set to be destroyed after all the evidence is removed, Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson said. CNN's George Howell, MaryLynn Ryan and Martin Savidge contributed to this report.

Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a director at the New America Foundation and the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad," the basis for the HBO documentary "Manhunt" that will be shown on CNN at 9 p.m. ET Monday.
Washington (CNN) -- In the past few weeks, we've seen a British soldier hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London and bombers blowing up spectators at the Boston Marathon.
On the surface, terrorism is alive and well.
So how should the United States react to these continuing threats?
Peter Bergen For the first time on Thursday, President Obama laid out the full scope of his proposed counterterrorism strategy, and it boiled down to this: George W. Bush's endless war on terror is over.
And that's appropriate, since the enemy Bush went to war with after September 11 has largely been defeated.
Obama's speech at the National Defense University in Washington was designed to lay the political groundwork to wind down America's longest war, the war that began when al Qaeda destroyed the World Trade Center and a wing of the Pentagon 12 years ago.
Thursday's speech was the first time Obama had delivered an overarching framework for how to conceptualize the conflict that has defined U.S. national security policy since 9/11.

CNN Explains: Drones
Other speeches by Obama have focused on aspects of that conflict, such as Guantanamo and the Afghan war. But no speech has made such an expansive examination of the war against al Qaeda and its allies in all its manifestations, from drone strikes to detention policies to a clear-eyed assessment of the scope of the threats posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as by those "homegrown" extremists who attacked the Boston Marathon in April.
Much of the coverage of the speech has centered on the measures the president outlined to impose greater constraints on CIA drone strikes and to try to hasten the eventual closing of Guantanamo.
But the most significant aspect of the speech was the president's case that the "perpetual wartime footing" and "boundless war on terror" that has permeated so much of American life since 9/11 should come to an end.
Obama argued that the time has come to redefine the kind of conflict that the United States is engaged in: "We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us."
This is why the president focused part of his speech on a discussion of the seemingly arcane Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and its Taliban allies.
Few, if any, in Congress who voted for the authorization understood at the time that they were voting for a virtual blank check that has provided the legal basis for more than a decade of war. It is a war that has expanded in recent years to other countries in the Middle East and Africa, such as Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. has engaged in covert military operations against al Qaeda-affiliated groups.
Theoretically, when U.S. combat troops finally withdraw from Afghanistan in December 2014, the authorization should simply expire, and the nation will no longer be at war. After all, once combat operations are over in Afghanistan, why would you want to keep in place an authorization for a permanent war?
However, there are now some in Congress who would like to expand the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force beyond its present parameters to include military operations against terrorist groups that were not involved in the 9/11 attacks, which could prolong America's wars indefinitely and add additional terrorist groups to the United States' list of enemies it is at war with.
U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ranking member of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for instance, last month called for an expansion of the scope of the authorization.
Obama made it quite clear in his Thursday speech that he would oppose such an expansion, saying he hopes instead to "ultimately repeal the AUMF's mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further."
In short, Obama intends to end a seemingly endless war.
That's because, according to Obama, "the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us."
On Thursday, Obama asserted (in my view, correctly) that what remains of the terrorist threat, while significant and persistent, is nothing on the scale of the al Qaeda organization that launched the 9/11 operation and instead consists of "less capable al Qaeda affiliates, threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, homegrown extremists."
These threats, the president further asserted, can be managed by carefully targeted drone strikes overseas and efforts to counter extremist ideology at home and do not require some kind of broader war.
Obama is also looking to his legacy and the presidents who will follow him and is trying to begin to create the public consensus and legal framework that will help to ensure that the United States isn't "drawn into more wars we don't need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states."
Obama clearly hopes to leave office in 2016 as the commander in chief who finally ended America's longest war.

Redford: Women, young people must save U.S. from men 'behaving stupidly'
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 3:24 PM EDT, Wed October 16, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
President Obama "can't function" now in Washington, Robert Redford says
The actor says some in Congress are "crippling our whole country"
Redford sat down with CNN's Nischelle Turner to talk about his new film, "All Is Lost" He plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision
(CNN) -- Robert Redford says bigotry, fear of change and a determination to personally destroy President Barack Obama have paralyzed the U.S. government.
Women and young people are the answer to fixing the gridlock that has partially shut down Washington, the actor told CNN on Tuesday.
"Give them the reins," Redford said. "I think they can do better than we have."
Redford, 77, sat down with CNN's Nischelle Turner to talk about his new film, "All Is Lost," which he agreed could serve as an analogy to the shutdown crisis.
In the movie, Redford plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision with a container ship.
Redford: Why government is 'paralyzed'
2012: Redford's views on politics
"At a certain point, I think, when things really get awful, when things get really bad and all seems to be lost -- there's no hope, there's no possibility -- then a lot of people quit," Redford said about his character. "They say, 'What's the point?' and they quit. And others keep going for no other reason than that."
Opinion: Men dither while women lead
Redford: 'Why are these people behaving so stupidly?'
The conversation then turned to the drama playing out in Washington, where a standoff between Obama and Republicans in Congress has forced the federal government into a partial shutdown and threatened a default on the U.S. debt.
"It's so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past," Redford said. "And I was trying to figure out, why are these people behaving so stupidly? Why are they behaving so horribly that it's crippling our whole country?
"And I think it has to do with fear. I think it's a group of people that are so afraid of change, and they're so narrow-minded that some people -- when they see change coming -- get so threatened by change, they get angry and they get terrorized, and then they get vicious. I think that's who these people are. They're so afraid of change that they're behaving miserably."
Obama is "a compassionate man who can't function" in this political environment, Redford said. It "is so decrepit, it is so paralyzed, and the worst of it is it is paralyzed by intention," he said. "There is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system. I think what sits underneath it, unfortunately, is there's probably some racism involved, which is really awful."
Obama's opponents reject whatever he might propose "because their determination was to destroy this person," Redford said. "They wanted, if it meant destroying the government, anything to keep him from succeeding.
"I think just the idea of giving credit to this President, giving him credit for anything, is abhorrent to them, so they'll go against it. Never mind that it's the better good of the people, never mind that they're supposed to be in office representing the interest of the public. They're representing their own self-interests, which is very narrow and in some cases bigoted."
America's problem: We're too dumb
Redford: All is not lost
But, unlike his latest film title, all is not lost, Redford said. He said "something new" is starting to happen that offers hope.
"Susan Collins, who is a Republican, is saying: 'Enough of this. This is not the job I signed up for. I've got to do something,' " said Redford, referring to the U.S. senator from Maine. "So she's bringing a bipartisan group together of women. I think the future should belong more to women and young people."
Women must save the country "because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly," Redford said. "I mean, sometimes you say: 'Can we actually be this dumbed down, or am I actually hearing what I'm hearing from some of these people? Are they really, is that really happening?' It's sad."
Does this mean Redford is already throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton in a 2016 White House bid?
"No, I wouldn't single out one woman over another," he said. "I think it's time to give more women a chance."
"All Is Lost," which is almost a silent movie, with its sparse dialogue, hits U.S. theaters next week.
