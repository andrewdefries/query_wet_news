EW review: Tori Amos tones it downBy David Browne Entertainment Weekly

(Entertainment Weekly) -- As rock history has shown, wild-eyed, piano-playing odd-balls have a tendency to morph into adult-contemporary smoothies -- think Elton John, the most enduring example of this disheartening mutation. But would anyone have imagined such a thing happening to pop's high priestess of passion, Tori Amos? The first sign of her transformation was 2002's ''A Sorta Fairytale,'' a sad and bittersweet road-trip breakup song that featured lulling piano chords and a restrained delivery far removed from the orange-haired Medusa of old -- the Amos who erotically caressed her keyboard while singing unflinching songs about rape and masturbation.Not surprisingly, the single was an AC hit, and the album from which it came, "Scarlet's Walk," also signaled that Amos had entered a calmer era. On "The Beekeeper," Amos continues leaving the mannered eccentricities to new Toris like Nellie McKay, and seems hell-bent on out-doing Sarah McLachlan in the mellowed-new-mom department. Picking up where ''A Sorta Fairytale'' left off, Amos keeps the melodies and arrangements relatively pared down and gentle. Even when she's returning to exciting subjects like sex (''Sweet the Sting'') or confronting her lover about an affair (the very mildly funky ''Hoochie Woman'' ), she holds her most self-indulgent side in check. Maybe she yearns to make the massive follow-up hit Paula Cole never did after ''Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?'' and ''I Don't Want to Wait.''This refurbished version of Amos has its drawbacks. Her lyrics have grown even more conventional: Hard to believe from someone who once posed for an album photo with a piglet sucking at her breast, but she resorts to comparing herself to a revved-up automobile in ''Cars and Guitars'' and describing a flighty beau as the proverbial fluttery insect in ''Sleeps With Butterflies.'' In her new memoir-confessional book, "Piece by Piece," she explains that ''Barons of Suburbia'' is about fake friends and users, especially within the music industry. But what you'd expect to be a bilious screed turns out to be calm and meditative, with Amos' whooping-crane vocal so reined in that you'd hardly know she was angry. Same goes with the simmer-on-low groove of ''Witness,'' another song that also deals, elliptically, with betrayal.While these changes may be cause for concern for the devout, they're not such a bad thing. "The Beekeeper" is the Tori Amos album for those normally freaked out by Tori Amos. Her wack-job shtick was beginning to grow old anyway, so the reserved gospel choirs and humming soul organs that decorate these songs, while not exactly what one would call innovative, are easier on the ears. In any case, Amos remains too much of a weirdo to fully bland out: ''Wrap yourself around the Tree of Life and the Dance of the Infinity of the Hive,'' she sings at one point, adding, for reasons known only to herself, ''Take this message to Michael.'' Working in a world where it pays to be ordinary, Amos wants to retain at least some of her youthful quirks as she matures. It may sound like faint praise, but soul-baring singer-songwriters have suffered far worse fates. EW Grade: BMore from Entertainment Weekly: All about Tori AmosLCD SoundsystemWhite men can't dance; every so often, though, they can make fabulous dance music. Take James Murphy, the producer (and indie drummer) who, for all purposes, is LCD Soundsystem.With Tim Goldsworthy, his partner in the label and production team DFA, Murphy has jacked up everyone from Le Tigre to Junior Senior and been dubbed an underground version of N.E.R.D. frontman Pharrell Williams. The comparison runs even deeper: Murphy's a nerd too, but of the dance-rock kind. Exhibit A: ''Daft Punk Is Playing at My House,'' the opening salvo on "LCD Soundsystem."Over a euphoric house beat speckled with U2-like guitar, Murphy pledges allegiance to the French techno duo. More lyrically cutting, but no less geeky, is ''Losing My Edge,'' wherein the aging-hipster narrator rattles off his ancient rocknerd credentials (catching an early Can show, for instance) as a way to counter the alt-rock youngsters making him feel increasingly obsolete.Happily, there's little outdated about "LCD Soundsystem," which unites the club and indie-rock crowds in ways few have attempted since the '80s. Break-beats as crisp as starched shirts coexist with all things dank and underground: grim punk basses and Murphy's moody yelp, which add gravitas to what could have been slaphappy novelties. Some of Murphy's best work is on the second of LCD Soundsystem's two discs, which collects early 12-inchers like ''Yeah,'' a delicious techno-funk hybrid that'll give you vertigo even if you're seated. Compared with the second half, the first disc -- a full-length album -- bogs down in homages to art rock. ''Bear in mind, we all fall behind from time to time,'' yelps Murphy in ''Disco Infiltrator.'' To the relief of white guys everywhere, he rarely does.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Presidents Bush and Clinton launched a joint effort across partisan lines to raise money for victims of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunamis after the White House tapped them Monday to lead an effort to drum up private donations. President George W. Bush named his two immediate predecessors on Monday, saying, "The greatest source of America's generosity is not our government; it's the good heart of the American people."Flanked by his father and Clinton, Bush told reporters at the White House, "I have asked two of America's most distinguished private citizens to head a nationwide charitable fund-raising effort."The two men will "ask Americans to donate directly to reliable charities already providing help to tsunami victims," the president said.Both former leaders emphasized that cash, rather than goods, is what relief agencies need right now."It's better to give the aid agencies the money and let them spend it as they need it the next several weeks," Clinton said on CNN's "Larry King Live.""I want people here at home in America and throughout the world who are listening to this program to know that if you only have a dollar, $5, $10 to give -- if a million of you do, that you'll make a huge difference," Clinton said.Both presidents said American charitable efforts could boost the image of the United States abroad."What is being seen around the world is something that a lot of people in these afflicted countries might not realize happens, and that is when there's a tragedy outside of our shores, America comes together," the elder Bush said."That sends a strong message around the world of our own true compassion," Bush said. "I think a lot of good can come out of this horrible disaster."The United States has pledged $350 million in tsunami aid, the largest single contribution by a government after Japan's $500 million. The president and Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is visiting southern Asia, have said additional tens of millions of dollars will be spent on U.S. military operations to assist the victims. Even more millions have been raised through donations from private citizens.Bush was criticized for initially pledging $15 million, and then raising that to $35 million two days after the disaster struck. He also was rebuked for not speaking publicly on the matter for the first three days.U.S. officials said Bush made phone calls on the matter right away and raised the pledge when the scope of the devastation became clear."All week long, as we announced the smaller amounts," Powell said, "I made it clear and the president made it clear that we knew those numbers would rise. But you can't just throw a number out. You have to get some sense of what is needed."In an earlier interview with CNN, both of the former presidents rejected criticism that President Bush and the United States were slow to respond."I don't see how he could have done more," said Clinton, sitting with the president he defeated in 1992.And the elder Bush defended his son, saying the criticism of the administration is part of the "inside-the-Beltway game.""That's not what this is about. It's about saving lives," he said. "It's about caring. And the president cares."Earlier Monday, the two former leaders joined President Bush and first lady Laura Bush on a visit to the embassies of the four hardest-hit countries -- Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. "You can't help but be moved," the elder Bush said. "I noticed President Clinton talking to a woman in one of the embassies who lost both her mother and her father and a brother, I believe it was, and it just breaks you up." U.N. officials have said it will cost billions of dollars over a period of years to rebuild the destroyed region. The World Bank, which has pledged $250 million, said Sunday it may triple that pledge later.Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother who has overseen disaster relief efforts after hurricanes in his state, is visiting the region with Powell. (Full story)"Secretary Powell and Gov. Bush will report their findings directly to me so we can ensure that our government provides the most effective assistance possible," the president said."The devastation in the region defies comprehension," he said, noting that U.S. flags are flying at half-staff through Friday to honor the victims.The government is "in close contact with the governments of the affected countries. And America is playing a leading role in the relief and recovery efforts," he said.Private donations may alleviate pressure on the U.S. government -- which faces its largest deficit -- to contribute more money.Norway announced plans Monday to raise its pledge from $16 million to about $180 million -- an 11-fold increase that would make its contribution the single largest per capita pledge of any nation by a wide margin.With a population of a little more than 4.5 million, Norway's pledge would come out to approximately $39.50 per citizen. The U.S. pledge of $350 million comes out to $1.19 per person.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

29 miners confirmed dead after New Zealand mine explosion By the CNN Wire Staff Flowers and a note lay at the foot of the Strongman Mine Memorial on Monday in Greymouth, New Zealand. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: The official tells families all 29 trapped miners are deadThe air in the mine is high in carbon monoxide and methane, low in oxygenNo one has heard from the miners since Friday's explosion

Mining Accidents and Disasters
New Zealand
(CNN) -- All 29 miners trapped underground in a New Zealand mine are dead, the official in charge of a the rescue attempt said Wednesday. Gary Knowles, superintendent of Tasman Police Command, announced the deaths to the families. During the rescue attempt, air released from drilling into the mine contained high levels of carbon monoxide and methane but little oxygen, according to police officials. Authorities said the two camera-bearing military robots sent into the mine had found a worker's helmet with its light still on, but no sign of life. The helmet, police said, was dropped by one of the two miners who escaped the original explosion. Miners missing after explosion

One of the robots had broken down earlier Tuesday but was back online, said Peter Whittall, CEO of Pike River Coal, which owns the mine. Whittall said a third robot was on its way to the site. One the units reached a "fresh air base" and found nobody there, he said. The 29 men, ages 17 to 62, had been missing since Friday, when an explosion ripped through the Greymouth mine. Most of the miners are from New Zealand, but the group also includes Scotlanders and South Africans. The missing men are believed to have been spread throughout the mine, with perhaps half trapped in one area. Whittall and Knowles reiterated that potentially explosive gases in the collapsed mine have rendered a rescue attempt unsafe so far. "It's just too dangerous. You can't put the lives of the guys going underground at risk," Whittall said. Late Tuesday, officials showed family members and reporters a closed-circuit television video of the mine's entrance during Friday's blast. The minute-long video shows dust flying and a white screen flapping back and forth before it is blown out of the tunnel. The video "showed that the blast was quite large and went on for a long time," Whittall said. He said that the "sobering" video showed a site at least 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) away from the blast. Officials decided to play it for family members and reporters to illustrate "how dangerous it would be to re-enter the mine," he said.

Police: 5 found dead after Denver bar fire, homicide suspected
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 6:10 PM EDT, Wed October 17, 2012
Police are investigating the deaths of five people found inside Fero's Bar and Grill in Denver after it burned down Wednesday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Denver police ask the public for help in their investigation
It appears the bar was set on fire to hide the bodies inside, investigators say
"Each victim's body showed obvious signs of trauma," police say
Four women and one man were killed
(CNN) -- Denver police opened a homicide case Wednesday after firefighters found five people dead inside a bar that was set ablaze.
Police said they believe the bar was set on fire to mask the homicides inside.
"We'd like to say this was an isolated incident, but I can't say that with any certainty," Denver Police Chief Robert White said Wednesday afternoon as he asked members of the public to help investigators.
Police said they had received tips, but had no suspects yet.
"We're asking if anyone has any information, no matter how trivial they think it is, please contact us," White told reporters.
Reports of a fire at Fero's Bar and Grill came in around 1:50 a.m. Wednesday. Firefighters working to put out the blaze found four women and one man dead, police said.
"Each victim's body showed obvious signs of trauma indicating that a homicide investigation is warranted," police said in a written statement.
Authorities did not identify the victims or release further details about their cause of death.
Arson investigators were also looking into what caused the fire, police said.

Should we still fear al Qaeda?
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst
updated 2:36 PM EST, Wed February 6, 2013
Malian soldiers transport in a pickup truck a dozen suspected Islamist rebels on Friday, February 8, after arresting them north of Gao. A suicide bomber blew himself up on February 8 near a group of Malian soldiers in the northern city, where Islamist rebels driven from the town have resorted to guerilla attacks.
Malians look at the charred motorcycle used by a suicide bomber before he blew himself up near a group of Malian soldiers on February 8. The act marked the first suicide attack in the embattled west African nation since the start of a French-led offensive to oust the Islamists from Mali's north, where they had controlled key towns for 10 months.
A convoy of French army vehicles head toward Gao on February 7. France is mulling over when to hand off its four-week-old intervention to U.N. peacekeepers. A man searches through the ruins of a building destroyed by French airstrikes in Douentza, Mali, on Tuesday, February 5. The town was retaken by French and Malian troops in January. A child holds up a machine gun round found in the ruins of a building destroyed by French airstrikes in Douentza, Mali, on February 5.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: U.K. politicians called North Africa terror an existential threat
Bergen says core al Qaeda has been greatly weakened, hasn't mounted serious operations
Terror groups loosely affiliated with al Qaeda have also lost ground, he says
Bergen: Jihadist violence does continue, but it does no good to overstate threat
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad", and a director at the New America Foundation.
Washington (CNN) -- The attack in January on a gas facility in Algeria by an al Qaeda-linked group that resulted in at least 37 dead hostages has sparked an outpouring of dire warnings from leading Western politicians.
British Prime Minister David Cameron described a "large and existential threat" emanating from North Africa. Tony Blair, his predecessor as prime minister, agreed saying, "David Cameron is right to warn that this is a battle for our values and way of life which will take years, even decades."
Hang on chaps! Before we all get our knickers in a tremendous twist: How exactly does an attack on an undefended gas facility in the remotest depths of the Algerian desert become an "existential threat" to our "way of life"?
Across the Atlantic, American politicians also got into sky-is-falling mode. Republican Congressman Mike Rogers, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, fulminated, "This is going to get worse. You cannot allow this to become a national security issue for the United States. And I argue it's already crossed that threshold."
Peter Bergen Previous real U.S. national security threats and their manifestations include 9/11, the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (from the potential use of nuclear weapons) with the Soviets, Pearl Harbor and Hitler's armies taking over much of Europe.
A ragtag group of jihadists roaming the North African deserts is orders of magnitude less significant than those genuine threats to the West and is more comparable to the threats posed by the bands of pirates who continue to harass shipping off the coast of Somalia. They are surely a problem, but a localized and containable one.
Western politicians and commentators who claim that the al Qaeda linked groups in North Africa are a serious threat to the West unnecessarily alarm their publics and also feed the self-image of these terrorists who aspire to attack the West, but don't have the capacity to do so. Terrorism doesn't work if folks aren't terrorized.
North African group hasn't attacked in the West
Western politicians and commentators who claim that the al Qaeda linked groups in North Africa are a serious threat to the West unnecessarily alarm their publics...Peter Bergen
Much has been written, for instance, in recent weeks about al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), al Qaeda's North African affiliate, a splinter group of which carried out the attack on the Algerian gas facility. But according to Camille Tawil, who has authoritatively covered Islamist militant groups over the past two decades for the leading Arabic daily Al-Hayat and has written three books about al Qaeda, AQIM doesn't threaten the West: "To my knowledge no known attacks or aborted attacks in the West have been linked directly to AQIM."
AQIM was formed seven years ago so the group has had more than enough time to plot and carry out an attack in the West. By way of comparison, it took two years of serious plotting for al Qaeda to plan the 9/11 attacks.
So, what is the real level of threat now posed by al Qaeda and allied groups?
Let's start with "core al Qaeda" which attacked the United States on 9/11 and that is headquartered in Pakistan. This group hasn't, of course, been able to pull off an attack in the United States in twelve years. Nor has it been able to mount an attack anywhere in the West since the attacks on London's transportation system eight years ago.
Core al Qaeda on way to extinction
Osama bin Laden, the group's founder and charismatic leader, was buried at sea a year and half ago and despite concerns that his "martyrdom" would provoke a rash of attacks in the West or against Western interests in the Muslim world there has instead been.... nothing.
Meanwhile, CIA drone strikes in Pakistan during President Obama's tenure alone have killed 38 of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan, according to a count by the New America Foundation.

Al Qaeda threatens more attacks
Al Qaeda in Mali behind Algeria attack
Those drone strikes were so effective that shortly before bin Laden died he was contemplating ordering what remained of al Qaeda to move to Kunar Province in the remote, heavily forested mountains of eastern Afghanistan, according to documents that were discovered following the SEAL assault on the compound where bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
Core al Qaeda is going the way of the dodo.
Affiliates are no better off
And a number of the affiliates of core al Qaeda are in just as bad shape as the mother ship.
Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the virulent Southeast Asian al Qaeda affiliate that killed hundreds in the years after 9/11 is largely out of business. Why so? JI killed mostly Westerners in its first attacks on the tourist island of Bali in 2002, but the subsequent Bali attack three years later killed mostly Indonesians. So too did JI's attacks on the Marriott hotel in the capital Jakarta in 2003 and the Australian embassy in 2004. As a result, JI lost any shred of popular support it had once enjoyed.
At the same time the Indonesian government, which at one point had denied that JI even existed, mounted a sophisticated campaign to dismantle the group, capturing many of its leaders and putting them on trial.
In the Philippines, the Abu Sayyaf Group, a number of whose leaders had trained in Afghanistan in al Qaeda's camps, and which specialized in kidnapping Westerners in the years after 9/11, was effectively dismantled by the Philippine army working in tandem with a small contingent of U.S. Special Operations Forces.
In Pakistan, the Pakistani Taliban in 2009 took over the once-tranquil mountainous vacation destination of Swat, and destroyed some 180 schools and beheaded 70 policemen there. Suddenly, they were only 70 miles from the capital Islamabad and some warned that the Pakistani state was in danger. Today, the Pakistani Taliban have been rolled back to their bases along the Afghan border and 16 of their leaders have been killed by CIA drones since President Obama took office.
Al Qaeda militants based in Saudi Arabia mounted a terrorist campaign beginning in 2003 that killed dozens of Saudis, and they also attacked a number of the oil workers and oil facilities that lie at the heart of the Saudi economy. This prompted the Saudi government to mount such an effective crackdown that the few remaining al Qaeda leaders who were not killed or captured have in recent years fled south to Yemen where the remnants of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) are now based.
From its new headquarters in Yemen AQAP has made serious efforts to attack the United States, sending the "underwear bomber" to blow up Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and also smuggling bombs on to U.S.-bound cargo shipments in October 2010.
None of these attempts were successful.
Yemen militants decimated
As a result of the threat posed by AQAP, the United States has mounted a devastating campaign against the group over the past three years. There was one American drone strike in Yemen in 2009. In 2012 there were 46. That drone campaign has killed 28 prominent members of the group, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Among them was the No. 2 in AQAP, Said al-Shihri, who was confirmed to be dead last week.
In the chaos of the multiple civil wars that gripped Yemen in 2011, AQAP seized a number of towns in southern Yemen. But AQAP has now been pushed out of those towns because of effective joint operations between U.S. Special Operations Forces, the CIA and the Yemeni government.
The Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, even went to the United Nations General Assembly in September where he publicly endorsed the use of CIA drones in his country, something of a first.
A couple of years ago, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, Al- Shabaab ("the youth" in Arabic) controlled much of southern Somalia including key cities such as the capital Mogadishu.
Once in a position of power, Shaabab inflicted Taliban-like rule on a reluctant Somali population, which eroded its popular legitimacy. Shabaab was also the target of effective military operations by the military of neighboring Kenya, troops of the African Union and U.S. Special Operation Forces.
As a result, today the group controls only some rural areas and for the first time in two decades the United States has formally recognized a Somali government.
Mali conflict shows weakness of jihadist militant groups
Similarly, groups with an al Qaeda-like agenda captured most of northern Mali last year, a vast desert region the size of France. Once in power they imposed Taliban-like strictures on the population, banning smoking and music and enforcing their interpretation of Sharia law with the amputation of hands. The militants also destroyed tombs in the ancient city of Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, on the grounds that the tombs promoted "idol worship."
None of these measures endeared the jihadist militants to the population of Mali. In the past weeks, as a relatively small force of some 2,000 French soldiers has rolled through Mali putting the militants on the run, the French have been cheered on by dancing and singing Malians.
When French soldiers are greeted as an army of liberation in an area of the world that in the past century was part of a vast French empire, you can get a sense of how much the jihadist militants had alienated the locals.
Last week the French military took the city of Timbuktu. The defeat of the al Qaeda-linked groups as effective insurgent forces in Mali is now almost complete.
What has just happened in Mali gets to the central problem that jihadist militant groups invariably have. Wherever they begin to control territory and population they create self-styled Islamic "emirates" where they then rule like the Taliban.
Over time this doesn't go down too well with the locals, who usually practice a far less austere version of Islam, and they eventually rise up against the militants, or, if they are too weak to do so themselves, they will cheer on an outside intervention to turf out the militants.
The classical example of this happened in Iraq where al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) controlled Anbar Province, about a third of the country in 2006. AQI cadres ruled with an iron fist and imposed their ultrafundamentalist rule on their fellow Sunnis, who they killed if they felt they were deviating from their supposedly purist Islamic precepts.
This provoked the "Sunni Awakening" of Iraqi tribes that rose up against AQI. These tribes then allied with the U.S. military and by the end of 2007 AQI went from an insurgent group that controlled vast territories to a terrorist group that controlled little but was still able to pull off occasional spectacular terrorist attacks in Baghdad.
Jihadist violence still a threat
The collapse of core al Qaeda and a number of its key affiliates does not, of course, mean that jihadist violence is over. Such religiously motivated mayhem has been a feature of the Muslim world for many centuries. Recall the Assassins, a Shia sect that from its base in what is now Iran dispatched cutthroats armed with daggers to kill its enemies around the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries. In so doing the sect gave the world the useful noun "assassin."
And so while core al Qaeda and several of its affiliates and like-minded groups are in terrible shape, there are certainly groups with links to al Qaeda or animated by its ideology that are today enjoying something of a resurgence.
Most of these groups do not call themselves al Qaeda, which is a smart tactic, as even bin Laden himself was advising his Somali affiliate, Al Shabaab, not to use the al Qaeda name as it would turn off fundraisers because the shine had long gone off the al Qaeda brand, according to documents recovered at bin Laden's Abbottabad compound.
One such militant group is the Nigerian Boko Haram, which bombed the United Nations headquarters in Nigeria in 2011 and has also attacked a wide range of Christian targets in the country. However, the group has shown "no capability to attack the West and also has no known members outside of West Africa," according to Virginia Comolli of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies who tracks the group.

Ansar al-Sharia, "Supporters of Sharia," is the name taken by the militant group in Libya that carried out the attack against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in September in which four Americans were killed. Similarly, in Yemen militants that are aligned with al Qaeda have labeled themselves Ansar al-Sharia.
But this new branding hasn't done the militants much good in either country. In Libya, shortly after the attack on the U.S. consulate, an enraged mob stormed and took over Ansar al Sharia's headquarters in Benghazi. And, as we have seen, in Yemen the jihadists have now been forced out of the towns in the south that they had once held.
One strong foothold in Syria
The one country where jihadist militants have a serious foothold and are likely to play an important role for some period in the future is in Syria. That is because of a perfect storm there that favors them. The Sunni militants in Syria are fighting the regime of Bashir al Assad, a secular dictator who is also an Alawite, which many Muslims believe to be a heretical branch of Shiism.
For the jihadists, Assad's secularism makes him an apostate and his Alawi roots also make him a heretic, while his brutal tactics make him an international pariah. This trifecta makes funding the Sunni insurgency highly attractive for donors in the Gulf.
And for the Arabs who form the heart of al Qaeda the fight against Assad is in the heart of the Arab world, a contest that happens to border also on the hated state of Israel. Also Syria was for much of the past decade the entry point for many hundreds of foreign fighters who poured into Iraq to join Al Qaeda in Iraq following the American invasion of the country. As a result, al Qaeda has long had an infrastructure both in Syria and, of course, in neighboring Iraq.
The Al Nusra Front is the name of arguably the most effective fighting force in Syria. In December the State Department publicly said that Al Nusra, which is estimated to number in the low thousands and about 10% of the fighters arrayed against Assad, was a front for Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).
Al Nusra certainly seems to have learned from AQI's mistakes. For starters, it doesn't call itself al Qaeda. Secondly, it hasn't launched a campaign to crack down on social issues such as smoking or listening to music and so has not alienated the local Sunni population as AQI did in Iraq.
Barak Barfi, a journalist and fellow at the New America Foundation who has spent several months on the ground in Aleppo in northwestern Syria reporting on the opposition to Assad, says Nusra fighters stand out for their bravery and discipline: "They are winning over the hearts and minds of Aleppo residents who see them as straight shooters. There is a regimented recruiting process that weeds out the chaff. Their bases are highly organized with each person given specific responsibilities."
Arab Spring countries seen as an opportunity
The chaotic conditions of several of the countries of the "Arab Spring" are certainly something al Qaeda views as an opportunity. Ayman al-Zawahiri the leader of the group, has issued 27 audio and video statements since the death of bin Laden, 10 of which have focused on the Arab countries that have experienced the revolutions of the past two years.
But if history is a guide, the jihadist militants, whether in Syria or elsewhere, are likely to repeat the mistakes and failures that their fellow militants have experienced during the past decade in countries as disparate as Somalia, the Philippines, Yemen, Iraq, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and now, Mali.
That's because encoded in the DNA of al Qaeda and like-minded groups are the seeds of their own destruction because in power they rule like the Taliban, and they also attack fellow Muslims who don't follow their dictates to the letter. This doesn't mesh very well with these organizations' claims that they are the defenders of Muslims.
These groups also have no real plans for the multiple political and economic problems that beset much of the Islamic world. And they won't engage in normal politics such as elections believing them to be "un-Islamic."
This is invariably a recipe for irrelevance or defeat. In not one nation in the Muslim world since 9/11 has a jihadist militant group seized control of a country. And al Qaeda and its allies' record of effective attacks in the West has been non-existent since 2005.
With threats like these we can all sleep soundly at night.

Ducks overboard! What happens to goods lost at sea?
By Olivia Yasukawa, for CNN
updated 8:39 AM EDT, Wed October 9, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A container of plastic ducks, frogs and beavers broke free from a cargo ship and fell into the North Pacific in 1992
The durable bath toys have been floating around ever since providing insights into the flow of ocean currents
Some estimates suggest as many as 10,000 containers fall into the ocean every year

(CNN) -- On a stormy January night in 1992, out in the Pacific Ocean, 29,000 plastic yellow ducks, blue turtles and green frogs fell from a cargo ship and were lost at sea.
For the past 21 years, these durable plastic bath toys have been floating around the world, passing the site where the Titanic sank, landing in Japan, Alaska and Hawaii and even spending years frozen in an Arctic ice pack.
Originally sealed in a 40-foot steel shipping container, rough seas and huge waves knocked the bath toys overboard, along with several other containers that sank straight to the ocean floor.

Some estimates suggest that up to 10,000 containers fall into the ocean every year. The World Shipping Council, whose members represent 90% of the world's container ship capacity, say that figure is grossly exaggerated and estimate that on average no more than 350 containers are lost annually.
Due to severe weather and high seas, accidents or incorrect stowage, there are now shipping containers littering the seabed all around the world. Many float on the surface for months, some rupture and release their goods, but most eventually sink to the bottom -- creating deep-sea stepping stones between ports across the globe.
Ships lose containers when the ship starts rolling side-to-side at more than a 55-degree-angleCurt Ebbesmeyer, oceanographer
Oceanographer and self-confessed beachcomber Curt Ebbesmeyer says, "Usually container ships lose containers when the ship starts rolling side-to-side at more than a 55-degree-angle. You have to imagine a couple of dozen containers falling overboard together. When they start banging together, it's a very, very violent episode."
Approximately 90% of worldwide cargo travels by sea -- an overwhelming percentage. While often overlooked, shipping containers have transformed global trade, easily moving between truck, train and ship.

Drewry Shipping Consultants, who track container inventories at a microscopic level of detail, say 183 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) are moved globally by sea every year and at any one time, approximately 6.7 million containers are in transit.
According to Peter Glover, Master Mariner and Senior Associate at international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, "There is no international convention which places an obligation on shipping companies to report losses of containers at sea." However, a report will likely be required if the loss of the container is considered to be a marine accident, presents a danger to navigation, or if discharge of the contents of the container is such that it breaches the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.

In June of this year, a five-year-old container ship, the MOL Comfort broke its back in heavy weather and split apart off the coast of Yemen. There were no casualties but all 7,000 containers, reportedly carrying consumer electronics and clothes, were lost after the ship caught fire and subsequently sank -- a catastrophic event that cost insurers between $300-400 million in claims.
You literally never know what's going to wash up onto shoreCurt Ebbesmeyer, oceanographer
Over the years, a great wealth of unusual items has washed up on beaches around the world. In 2006, beachcombers scavenging the Outer Banks of North Carolina were greeted by thousands of sealed bags of Doritos tortilla chips that floated onto the beach, dry and still in an edible condition.
During a storm in 1990, a large wave washed 21 shipping containers into the North Pacific Ocean. 60,000 Nike shoes -- en route from Korea to the US -- splashed into the waves. Over the next year, hundreds of shoes -- from hiking boots to children's shoes -- were discovered on the beaches of the Queen Charlotte Islands, western Vancouver Island, Washington and Oregon.

But it is the plastic animals that have proved most valuable for scientific research of great ocean currents -- the so-called engine of the planet's climate.
For the last 21 years, Ebbesmeyer has been tracking the ducks, frogs and turtles from Sitka, where they first landed, all the way to Scotland and Maine. Having patiently recorded the date and location of each sighting, he has been able to learn an enormous amount about the ocean's conveyor belt.
While Ebbesmeyer says only 3% of findings are reported, the last sighting he is aware of was a frog in August of this year. Today, he believes there are only a few hundred left... still at the mercy of the winds and surface currents.
Once the tale of the tub toys is over, Ebbesmeyer says he still has plenty of other container spills to help him track the currents -- 34,000 hockey gloves and 5 million Lego pieces were dropped in the ocean 16 years ago, for example.
"It's a strange thing to be living on a planet and not know what's in 70% of it," Ebbesmeyer says. "You literally never know what's going to wash up onto shore."
