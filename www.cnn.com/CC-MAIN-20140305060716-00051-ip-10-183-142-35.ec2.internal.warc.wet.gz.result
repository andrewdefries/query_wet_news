BALAD, Iraq (CNN) -- As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made their surprise visits to Baghdad on Wednesday, many of the troops stationed north of Baghdad, in Balad and Dujail, say either they didn't know about it or didn't care."I'd ask him for a plane ticket home to see my wife. I have barely seen her in the last two years," said a young sergeant, who did not want to be identified. Like many of the soldiers with the 4th Infantry Division, he is on his second deployment to Iraq. Some joked that whenever VIP's come to visit they just go to the main bases and meet the "fobbits," the nickname given to troops who do not go outside the barbed wire. "They have to get out to see the people that are doing the jobs they are making them do. If they didn't they would not be very good leaders," said Maj. Michael Humphreys, one of the few soldiers here willing to tell journalists some of his opinions on senior leadership.At the time he was asked, he didn't know Rumsfeld and Rice were visiting. He was too preoccupied with his mission -- trying to set up a local paper for the Tribal Council in Dujail.Rumsfeld and Rice were visiting to show support for Iraq's movement toward a new government. And for many of the troops with the 3rd Battalion, 29th Field Artillery Regiment and 4th Infantry Division stationed in Balad and Dujail, they might just as well not have visited at all.As we discussed the visit, a tip came through -- a suspected leader of a cell dedicated to making "IED's," or improvised explosive devices -- military-speak for homemade bombs -- would be at a certain location at 1400 hours.The chase was on.Bumping along the dusty back roads to avoid insurgents, a VIP visit was the furthest thing from these troops' minds. For them, the priority is the mission. On this day they were following a lead, chasing a vehicle trying to escape as they approached the target house, and trying to find bits of intelligence from residents unwilling to talk.A top priority is getting themselves and their fellow soldiers home alive, and we are told that priority does not change -- no matter who visits.

Potentially tainted peanut products sent to schoolsStory Highlights Schools in three states may have been sent tainted peanut product Most products consumed by now with no illnesses reported Any recalled products still in schools will be removed Contaminated products linked to more than 500 illnesses nationwideNext Article in U.S. » (CNN) -- Peanut products sent to schools in three states may have been contaminated with salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday. However, most of the products have been consumed by now, and no illnesses have been linked to them, the department said. Don't Miss Critics: Poor oversight fueled salmonella outbreak
FEMA food kits may contain tainted peanut butter
Senator 'outraged' by food-borne illness cases
Between the beginning of 2007 and the end of June 2008, some schools in California received potentially tainted peanut butter and roasted peanuts; in Idaho and Minnesota it was only roasted peanuts, the Agriculture Department said. After the discovery that some products from Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) were contaminated with salmonella, the U.S. government initially recalled products dating back to July 1, 2008. But the government later expanded the recall to include products dating back to January 1, 2007. As part of that expansion, the government is recalling products from PCA that the Agriculture Department had sold to some schools in the three states. The department, which provides 20 percent of what is served in schools, had bought some products from PCA. Any recalled products still in schools will be removed, tested and destroyed, the department said. It announced Thursday that it was suspending PCA and its subsidiary, Tidewater Blanching LLC, from doing business with the federal government for at least a year. Neither PCA nor Tidewater Blanching returned calls seeking comment. Many hundreds of commercial products potentially linked to the outbreak have been recalled. Contaminated products have been linked to more than 500 illnesses nationwide, including eight deaths.

Who's really eligible to be president? By Gabriel "Jack" Chin, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSGabriel "Jack" Chin: Constitution is vague on meaning of eligibility for presidentChin says "natural born" citizen hasn't been defined by Supreme Court or CongressIf a child is born to a U.S. citizen, that person should be eligible to run, he saysExperts have called "natural born" requirement the "stupidest" clause in Constitution, he saysEditor's note: Gabriel J. Chin is the Chester H. Smith Professor of Law at the University of Arizona's Rogers College of Law. A graduate of Wesleyan University and the Michigan and Yale law schools, he has written extensively about immigration, citizenship and race and law. Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The Constitution provides that only "natural born citizens" can be president. Never has this obscure restriction been more controversial; in spite of conclusive evidence that President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, "birthers" insist that he is ineligible because, they claim, he was really born in Kenya or Indonesia. Meanwhile, because his opponent in the 2008 election, Sen. John McCain, was born in the Panama Canal Zone, some believe that he was ineligible to run. Unfortunately, the text of the Constitution does not define natural born citizenship, and neither the Supreme Court nor Congress has weighed in on the question. This much is clear. The term "natural born citizen" was borrowed from the English concept of "natural born subject," which came from Calvin's Case, a 1608 decision. Natural born subjects were those who owed allegiance to the king at birth under the "law of nature." The court concluded that under natural law, certain people owed duties to the king, and were entitled to his protection, even in the absence of a law passed by Parliament. Republicans distance themselves from "birther" issue Trump looking into Obama's birthplace
Arizona governor vetoes 'birther' bill
Explain it to me: 'Birthers'
Natural born subjects included people born in the sovereign's territory with two exceptions. First, children born to foreign diplomats were not subjects at birth; because they were protected by diplomatic immunity; they were legally outside the sovereign's control. In addition, children of foreign soldiers were not subjects; they were practically outside of the control of the king. All others born in the kingdom were natural born subjects. The Supreme Court held that the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, recognizing the citizenship of persons "born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," embodied the rule of Calvin's Case. In addition, given that there were U.S. citizens before 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed, the Supreme Court held that the amendment was "declaratory" of unwritten law in force even before the amendment was passed. Accordingly, there is agreement that "natural born citizens" include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment. This means that, for example, although there have been proposals for change, the children of undocumented noncitizens born in the United States are both citizens at birth and natural born. Also clear is that people who are not U.S. citizens at birth are not natural born, and cannot be made such after the fact. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a citizen, but a naturalized citizen, not natural born, so he can never be president. Even if President Obama had been born overseas, he is still a natural born citizen. ...--Gabriel "Jack" Chin

The real controversy is whether people who are U.S. citizens at birth, but only by act of Congress rather than under the Constitution itself, are eligible to become president. One reading of Calvin's Case would mean that those born overseas are not natural born because they are not citizens by "natural law"; they are citizens only by virtue of compliance with a statute. On this view, the only natural law governing citizenship is now in the 14th Amendment, therefore, only 14th Amendment citizens are natural born. Most scholars, including me, believe that natural born citizenship extends further, to all of those who obtain citizenship at birth by law. Calvin's Case was about subjectship, duties owed by subjects to a monarch who claimed to rule by the grace of God. U.S. citizenship, by contrast, involves membership in a political community based on democratic principles. Those born overseas are natural born citizens not because of natural law, but because Congress determined that they are naturally part of the political community. If this argument is right, then even if Obama had been born overseas, he is still a natural born citizen, because he obtained citizenship at birth through his mother who unquestionably was a U.S. citizen. If the current controversies about the natural born citizenship clause amount to a tempest in a teapot, that does not mean the clause is wise, or that it might not create a genuine problem in the future. For all of the Framers' wisdom, they erred in the Constitution in denying citizenship and political rights to women, African-Americans and others, and the natural born citizen clause's suspicion of naturalized citizens seems to reflect the same kind of bias. In a symposium of distinguished constitutional scholars, the combination of unintelligibility, interference with democratic choice and suspicion of naturalized citizens made Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy and Yale Law School Dean Robert Post nominate the clause as the "stupidest" in the Constitution. They may be right; it may be that We, the People of the United States, are perfectly capable of sensibly choosing presidents. Unless there are some justifications for it that make sense in a modern, free society, it may be time to consider getting rid of the clause. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gabriel "Jack" Chin.

(CNN) -- Barcelona, Buenos Aires and Miami top a list of 29 cities that attract single men on the go. The cities on the list, compiled by the editors of AskMen.com, were considered for factors from the cost of a pint of beer and a cab ride to culture, weather and food. Various aspects of the social scene also proved a dominant factor. From scouting out sports to nightlife, today's single men are looking for an all-encompassing adventure, editors said. Not surprisingly, women are a factor as well. The rest of the top 10 (out of 29) included New York City, London, Seoul, Paris, Melbourne, Bangkok and Las Vegas. Las Vegas and Bangkok have both been the setting for popular guy films "The Hangover" and due out at the end of May, "The Hangover 2." The cities of Tel Aviv, Berlin and Amsterdam topped the list for best nightlife scene, while Barcelona, Miami, and Uruguay's Montevideo topped the list for best beach cities. Sports are often a factor for single male travelers and not all the top spots are domestic. While New York's Yankee Stadium is the second most popular "arena" destination, Barcelona's Camp Nou, Mexico City's Estadio Azteca and London's Wembley Stadium beat out sports meccas like Chicago's Wrigley Field, which is not mentioned. As for single men wanting to journey into the land of (available) women, Bangkok, Miami and Tel Aviv received the highest score, all netting a 9.47 out of 10. "Explorability" is also a key factor for traveling single men. They are looking to discover new places outside of the expected, including Tangier, Morocco; Punta del Este, Uruguay; Tallinn, Estonia; and Istanbul, Turkey. Share this on:

Ignore racism? Fat chance, Rush
By Roland Martin, CNN Contributor
updated 1:48 PM EDT, Sat May 5, 2012
Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh, who upbraided Roland Martin on his radio show for comments on racism STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Roland Martin responded to racist reaction to Joel Ward's game-winning NHL goal
On his radio show, Limbaugh veered off one Martin tweet to a soliloquy about liberals and race
Martin: Limbaugh didn't even bother to note what the issue was before ranting
Racism is in America's DNA, Martin says, and Condoleeza Rice, for one, agrees
Editor's note: Roland S. Martin is a syndicated columnist and author of "The First: President Barack Obama's Road to the White House." He is a commentator for the TV One cable network and host/managing editor of its Sunday morning news show, "Washington Watch with Roland Martin."
(CNN) -- It's always funny to get tweets and e-mails from followers of radio entertainer Rush Limbaugh. None of them ever actually think of checking the facts out before they begin their ignorant, vile and rambling rants. I suppose that's to be expected because all they are doing is following their feckless leader, Limbaugh.
Last week I took to Twitter to express my disgust with the racist tweets sent to Joel Ward, the Washington Capitals forward who scored the game-winning goal against the Boston Bruins in the pivotal Game 7 of their first round matchup.
Roland Martin
Ward, who is black, should have been praised for great play. Instead, he was insulted, ridiculed and called the N-word.
As a result, I sent out the following tweets:
-- "It's no shock that a black hockey player is being called nasty vicious things for a game winning goal. Only folks in denial about racism are.
-- "The reality is that weak-minded punks hide behind anonymous comments on message boards AND social media.
-- "I had my arms crossed one day in an editorial meeting and was called "intimidating" & "threatening." Thinking While Black, huh? LOL
-- "I simply accept the reality that racism is in the DNA of America. And when that button is pushed, the true feelings come tumbling out!
-- "Trust me, I know the inherent bigotry in 'we want our country back' and 'he's not like us' or 'you have a different worldview.'"
-- "Why do I love a changing America? Because the walls are tumbling down! One of the last bastions? Media. Some folks are still holding on!"
-- "Sports is great because talent ain't subjective. It's clear. You win or lose. I know from media history/experience that talent is irrelevant"
-- "So to all of the soft/hard bigots, we ain't going anywhere. Keep hatin, we'll keep on fighting & winning. But do know we know who you are!"
Limbaugh was apprised of what I tweeted, so when a young listener called in, he brought up what I wrote and said:
Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter and Facebook.com/cnnopinion
"Roland Martin is a friend of Obama's and here is his Tweet: 'I simply accept the reality that racism is in the DNA of America and when that button is pushed the true feelings come tumbling out.'
"You asked me about racism and the media; well, here is a black journalist at CNN. I don't know what this is relating to but again Paul, 'I simply accept the reality racism is in the DNA of America.' So here is a mainstream journalist who just lives with the assumption that this is a racist country. Always there. And in his case is first because he's black, but he's liberal first.
"All liberals are liberals before they're anything else, if they're Jewish, if they're gay, female, male, they're liberals first, Paul. That is their religion. And that religion requires loyalty. You must have faith in them. They are the equivalent of your higher power. You must trust them; you must let them manage your affairs. This guy tweeting today that racism is in the DNA of America, so we are as a country founded in a flawed, sinful way. We are unjust as a country, it's immoral as a country, and that belief allows Mr. Martin excuse to be able to have power over people, to be able to punish people he thinks are racist."
Here is the key phrase out of all of the nonsense Rush spewed: "I don't know what this is relating to."
Had Rush and his crack research team bothered to get the context -- is that a bad disease going around lately? -- he would have realized that I was speaking about the racial slurs against the black hockey player.
That's when all of the knuckleheads began to write me, and many said that I was inciting the issue by even bringing it up. Several suggested that by ignoring racism, all will be well and it will just go away.
Really? Is that how it works?
Look, there is no need for Americans to stop living in denial. Race has been in the DNA of America since its founding. Slavery. Formation of our precious U.S. Constitution. The Civil War. Reconstruction. Jim Crow. The turbulence of the Civil Rights Movement. Integration. Busing.
Pick the subject and we've had to contend with the issue of race. I was only speaking truthfully to what so many Americans love to ignore.
But hey, don't believe me. Here is what Republican star and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had to say about race in America on CBS's "Face the Nation" in 2011:
"It is a birth defect with which this country was born out of slavery; we're never really going to be race blind. I think it goes back to whether or not race and class -- that is, race and poverty -- is not becoming even more of a constraint.
"Because with the failing public schools, I worry that the way that my grandparents got out of poverty, the way that my parents became educated, is just not going to be there for a whole bunch of kids. And I do think that race and poverty is still a terrible witch's brew."
Earlier she discussed the advancements of African-Americans in the U.S. -- whether it's a CEO or president of the United States -- yet even she concluded that "we're never going to erase race as a factor in American life."
So I say DNA. Rice says birth defect. Hmmm, is it really that different?
Ignoring racism will do nothing to solve the problem. Calling it out, speaking against it and educating others is what's important.
I find it hilarious that as an African-American, I'm told to ignore racism. I couldn't imagine telling someone Jewish, "anti-Semitism isn't a big deal! Stop harping on it. It'll disappear."
The problem for too many of us is that we live in a world of denial. We choose not to confront the problem because that means looking inward and confronting how we were raised; what our parents taught us; or even having to check out friends for their bigotry.
Racism isn't just black or white. It can be a two-way street between any groups. I prefer to not be silent about it and call it out.
Have I experienced racism in my life, as well as in the media? Of course! Sure, I grow tired of having to fight battles that should have been long gone, but it is what it is.
So Rush, I'm not going anywhere. I won't back down. I won't surrender. And when racism rears its ugly head, I'll be right there standing up for righteousness and to rid our world of this wretched evil.
Got it?

By the numbers: Why Ohio matters
By Caitlin Stark, CNN Library

If those don't put Ohio on your map, then consider the state is heavily contested on this year's electoral map. With 18 votes up for grabs, the battleground state is now polling in favor of President Obama. A recent Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll shows Obama leading Republican challenger, Mitt Romney 50%-44% in the state. Sixty-percent of the population was also found "strongly supporting" Obama in the poll, compared to 42% who said the same for Romney in the Buckeye state.
Here's a look, by the numbers, at a state that could help decide this year's election.

Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform
By Mariano Castillo, CNN
updated 4:56 PM EST, Mon January 28, 2013
Immigrants who came to the U.S. as children line up in August to file deferral applications at an office in Los Angeles.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Barack Obama promised but couldn't deliver comprehensive reform
Latinos factored heavily in Obama's re-election, giving them more political clout
In defeat, Republicans may see immigration reform as politically smart (CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform has so far eluded President Barack Obama. But with his re-election victory in battleground states propelled by strong Latino support, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have a stronger interest in cultivating support from a group with growing political clout.
Here are five reasons why the time may be right for immigration reform to take hold in Washington.
1) The voters have spoken
Immigration reform may not have been the biggest issue in the election -- the economy was paramount -- but it is very important to a key segment of voters. Latino voters turned out in force and helped to tip battleground states in Obama's favor. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the past four years to 12.2 million, or 8.7% of all voters. That means this demographic will only increase its political power. Issues important to this minority logically will become increasingly important to both major political parties.
A new electorate has arrived
Giuliani: Immigration reform a hurdle
2) Obama promised but failed to deliver on immigration reform
Obama promised to push for immigration reform before the 2008 election and had to answer tough questions from Latinos about why that did not occur. At a forum by the Spanish-language Univision network, Obama was pressed to admit that he had fallen short and took responsibility for a lack of action. But the president also said he didn't promise he would accomplish everything he wanted right away.
There also is some Latino disillusionment with the stalled Dream Act in Congress. This proposed law would create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, but it did not change current immigration law.
The president has said he is ready to act. He told the Des Moines Register in an interview before the election that he believes he will achieve immigration reform next year.
Opinion: How progress is possible
3) There is a bipartisan starting point
Having bipartisan support for immigration reform will not ensure passage -- it didn't for President George W. Bush in 2007 -- but without it, chances are even slimmer.
Just days after the election, a leading Democrat and Republican announced that they hope to start debate this year. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina say they will officially restart immigration reform talks that crumbled two years ago.
Schumer told NBC's "Meet the Press" that he and Graham have a plan designed to appeal to interests on all sides of the highly contentious issue, and he's optimistic that it can get through a Congress hobbled by political gridlock in recent years.
The plan includes four key elements: stronger border security, creation of forgery-resistant proof-of-citizenship documents, fairer legal immigration for desirable candidates, and a "tough love" path to citizenship for those already in the United States.
Opinion: Both parties must lead
4) Republicans want to win a larger share of the Latino vote
The election results thrust the immigration issue back into the spotlight partly because Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 27% of the Latino vote compared to 71% for Obama.
Why Romney lost
The GOP wants to reverse the trend of decreasing Latino support at the ballot box. Already, Republican lawmakers, political commentators and thought leaders have adopted a more conciliatory tone when discussing immigration.
Carlos Gutierrez, the former commerce secretary who led Romney's outreach to Latino voters, told CNN's "State of the Union" the candidate "made some mistakes" during his campaign that ultimately led to a precipitous drop in Latino support.
The Republican primary process forced Romney to move to the right on immigration, something that didn't sit well with many Latino voters. To avoid repeating the mistake, Republicans may consider working on immigration reform.
5) Democrats do not want to diminish their share of Latino vote
The Democratic Party benefited from Latino votes but that support is not assured in the future, especially if the Republicans move toward the center on immigration. The Obama administration is responsible for a record-setting number of deportations even as it has employed prosecutorial discretion to focus on high-priority cases. The Democrats will have to work with Republicans if they want to reform an immigration system both parties agree is broken.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
There will be plenty of time to kill when you get to the Super Bowl party hours before kickoff
One of the things to discuss are the brothers Harbaugh and how their family remains neutral
Ravens linebacker has gone from murder suspect to Reverend Ray
Host city wants to show America how far it has come since Hurricane Katrina
(CNN) -- America has spent $12 billion getting ready for the big game Sunday. Now it's time to cook the wings, prepare the dip, order the pizza, put the beer on ice.
The San Francisco 49ers are favored to win their sixth NFL title, but can the Baltimore Ravens send their magnificent, but controversial, linebacker Ray Lewis into retirement with a second championship ring?
Will the Baltimore defense be able to stop young quarterback Colin Kaepernick from beating them with his right arm and his legs?
Who will win the battle of super siblings?
Who will have the best commercial? Will it be sexy or funny?
Will the halftime show be live? OK, Beyoncé assures us it will.
Bruno Mars has a high bar to clear with his Super Bowl XLVIII performance on February 2. We have faith that the Grammy-winning crooner will shut down the halftime show -- although we do hope he doesn't knock out the lights like Beyonce did in 2013. How do you think his performance at Super Bowl XLVIII will rank on this list? Let's look back at some of the most memorable halftime shows through the years:
Thanks to Michael Jackson's game-changing 1993 performance, during which he sang hits including "Black or White" and "Billie Jean," Super Bowl halftime shows became as significant a draw for viewers as the football game itself.
In 1997, Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman and Jim Belushi performed as The Blues Brothers. The men looked like they were having a blast, but it was still one of the weakest halftime shows to date.
Britney Spears, Aerosmith, 'N Sync, Mary J. Blige and Nelly put on an entertaining show in 2001, performing hits like "Bye Bye Bye" and "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing," but it was the big finale where the entire group sang "Walk This Way" that puts this performance into the halftime hall of fame.
At the first Super Bowl after 9/11, U2 performed a tribute to those lost in the attacks. As the band played "MLK," the names of victims appeared on a screen. The show ended with a stirring version of "Where the Streets Have No Name," and Bono revealing the American flag in the lining of his jacket.
After Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction" the year before, Paul McCartney's 2005 performance was a show everyone could get behind. McCartney took the stage to play fan favorites such as "Live and Let Die," "Drive My Car" and "Hey Jude."
In addition to his own hits "Let's Go Crazy," "1999" and "Purple Rain" (in the rain), Prince used the 2007 halftime show to masterfully weave in other artists' classics such as Queen's "We Will Rock You," Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Proud Mary" and Bob Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower."
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took the stage in 2009, the same year he released his 16th studio album, "Working on a Dream." He urged viewers to "put your chicken fingers down and turn the television set all the way up," before launching into hard-rocking hits such as "Born to Run" and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out."
Beyonce's performance at the 2013 Super Bowl was of epic proportions. The superstar blew through her greatest hits and landed each dance move, even bringing out her old Destiny's Child groupmates, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, for a quickie reunion. We are not exaggerating -- or speaking on behalf of Kanye West -- when we say this was one of the best Super Bowl halftime performances of all time.
In 1989, Elvis Presley impersonator Elvis Presto took to the Super Bowl stage in head-to-toe gold lamé to perform "the world's largest card trick" among a bevy of Solid Gold dancers.
Talk about a family-friendly halftime show. Mickey Mouse and a bunch of children opened for New Kids on the Block in 1991. NKOTB, who performed "Step by Step" and "This One's for the Children," can't be held accountable for landing on this list. They did the best they could, considering the large number of actual kids on their block.
In 2000, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Phil Collins and Toni Braxton performed in another Disney-themed halftime show. The concept was "Tapestry of Nations" and included a song called "Reflections of Earth" and narration by actor Edward James Olmos. Need we say more?
The 2011 halftime show showed promise. The crowd was pumped as the Black Eyed Peas entered from the ceiling, but once they hit the stage, things fell apart. Not even hundreds of dancers clad in glowing green lights could save this performance.
In 2004, Janet Jackson, Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock and Justin Timberlake put on quite a performance for viewers -- although it doesn't much matter what they sang since the show will be forever remembered for Jackson's infamous "wardrobe malfunction."

Photos: Super Bowl by the numbers
Here are five other story lines you might be talking about around the snack table before the game kicks off in New Orleans at 6:30 p.m. ET:
1. Some fans are 'Switzerland'
Indiana Hoosiers basketball coach Tom Crean will be one of the 72,000 fans at the game.
But he and his wife, Joani, and her parents won't be pulling for the Ravens to maul the 49ers or for San Francisco to knock off Baltimore.
You see Joani's brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, are the two opposing head coaches in the big game. John coaches the Ravens, Jim leads San Francisco.
"I get, 'Which brother are you rooting for?' " Joani told the New York Times. "I'm sure it's a joke. I'm neutral. I'm Switzerland."
In a perfect world, Jackie Harbaugh would like to see the Super Bowl end in a tie, but she and her husband, Jack, know they will have one son on Sunday night who'll be ecstatic and one who'll be melancholy.

"There is going to be one winner and there is going to be one who is going to be totally disappointed," said Jack Harbaugh, who coached for 43 years." My thoughts go to that one that will not experience the thrill of victory. That's where our thoughts will be."
And mom and dad, married for 51 years, will be there to make things a little better.
"We're going to hug both of them and tell them how proud we are of them and their teams," Jackie Harbaugh said.
The old coach said he was just as proud of his sons this week as he was in the days when they each told him they made the junior high or high school football team. Or when they said they earned a college scholarship -- Jim to Michigan and John to Miami University in Ohio.
"The thrill that you feel -- I know this is on a big stage -- but in parenting, those don't rank any differently," he said.
2. "Reverend Ray" inspires, draws criticism
At Pastor Jamal Bryant's church, God is on the Ravens' side. And why not? Bryant is Ray Lewis' pastor, the man who helped lead Lewis to redemption.
People at the Empowerment Temple AME Church call Lewis "Reverend Ray." Bryant says the title fits.
"He's a jack leg preacher without a license, no Bible college, but it's just in him," Bryant said. "He's spoken here a couple of times, I've put him up to do our Bible study, and he's like Billy Graham and Bishop (T.D.) Jakes wrapped into one."
Fans say Lewis' in-your-face faith and extensive community service is beautifully sincere. His critics find it phony -- a redemption tour with no true redemption.
"Redemption? Stop acting like you are one of those people that come out of the Bible," Greg Wilson told CNN.
Thirteen years ago, Wilson's nephew, Jacinth Baker, and his buddy, Richard Lollar, were stabbed to death outside of an Atlanta nightclub.
Lewis and two others were charged in their killings.
Opinion: Keep dancing for Jesus, Ray Lewis!
Four months later, Lewis pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. A jury acquitted Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley. "It was self-defense for me because someone attacked me," Oakley told CNN.
Today, Lewis insists whatever happened in Atlanta changed him.
"With everything I've been through in my whole life, the thing for me to be here today and my only purpose in life is to find ways to help people and encourage people and make our world a better place," he said.
Bryant compares Lewis to the biblical figure King David.
"David was a man after God's own heart, after committing adultery, after committing murder, after being negligent on the job, after being taken out of position," Bryant said. "He's still somebody who God honored, and I think that many times history can't appreciate it while you're in it, it's only after you walk away."
That is the definition of redemption, Bryant said. It's not what you've done, it's what you've become.
3. From starter to mentor
Alex Smith can't help but be a little disappointed even though the 49ers are in the game of their lives. Just a few months ago, Smith was San Francisco's starting quarterback before a concussion sent him to the sideline.
Kaepernick, the second-year backup, played even better than Smith, stayed in the lineup and had a big role in getting the 49ers to the Super Bowl. He said Smith has been supportive since losing his spot.
"It means a lot," Kaepernick said this week. "I think it really shows his character and the kind of man he is. He's helped me through everything, from Week 1 'til now."
The non-fan's guide to Super Bowl parties
Smith, who is healthy again, said he said he became a starter in college at Utah when their No. 1 quarterback went down.
"I'd be pretty hypocritical to be upset about it," Smith said. "It's the nature of sports. He got an opportunity, stepped up and made the most of it."
NBC Sports reported this week that Smith will ask to be released in the offseason, giving him greater control of which team he will play for next. The 49ers also could trade him, or keep him, but not many teams would want to pay their backup quarterback $8.5 million.
It's unlikely Harbaugh will pull Kaepernick if he struggles, but if he is injured the 49ers have little to worry about in his replacement.
4. Distractions, distractions, distractions
This Super Bowl has had more distractions than most. First there was Lewis being asked whether he had taken a banned substance called deer antler spray. Then 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver said Tuesday he didn't want any gay players on his team. Add to that the story of TV analyst Dan Marino fathering a child out of wedlock and San Francisco's Randy Moss boasting he was the best receiver of all time (to which Jerry Rice replied, "Scoreboard.")
Players were sure the media circus wouldn't affect Super Bowl XLVII.
"You get to play at this level because most of the guys are mentally tough, so when you get out there, the last thing you're going to be thinking about is what people are saying," 49ers center Jonathan Goodwin said.
Puppy Bowl Sunday: Survival of the cutest
Ravens center Matt Birk said the being a professional football player requires staying focused at the task at hand, something some guys can't handle. He said he compartmentalizes the bad stuff, blocks it out.
Patrick Willis, a 49ers linebacker, defended Culliver.
"In this business, it's always going to be something, and we know those guys," he said. "We know those guys' hearts. We know that those things that come out of their mouths aren't intended to hurt anyone or intended to make it about them."
Culliver apologized Wednesday and again Thursday, saying: "I'm sorry that I offended anyone. They were very ugly comments, and that's not what I feel in my heart. Hopefully, I can learn and grow from this experience and this situation. I love San Francisco."
5. New Orleans on the comeback
The Big Easy is playing host to its 10th Super Bowl and even though locals are crushed that the hometown Saints aren't playing in the game, they are happy to show a city that has rebounded strongly from Hurricane Katrina seven years ago.
"We're in an economic resurrection of the city," actor and businessman Wendell Pierce said. "This is a point in time that people will remember that New Orleans was on its way back. We came from total destruction and now we're hosting one of the great events known to the world."
The New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. says the big game served as a goal line to cross for more than $1 billion in improvements to the city. Much of that was spent fixing up the airport, where most fans will get a first impression of the city that depends heavily on tourism.
New Orleans officials hope that some of the fans don't pack up and leave on Monday. After all, there's another big event going on. Mardi Gras!
it's the best time ever, Pierce said.
"You're right in the middle of the greatest street party in the history of the world, Mardi Gras," he said. "To have the Super Bowl join that, it's one of the most festive times to be here in New Orleans. We're going to have great food, great time and one of the greatest games in ... world sports."
'Super Gras' a big score for New Orleans

Hawaii official who confirmed Obama birth certificate dies in crash
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 3:18 PM EST, Thu December 12, 2013
Lorretta Fuddy was killed after a small plane with nine people aboard crashed into the water off the Hawaiian island of Molokai.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Loretta Fuddy died Wednesday night in a crash about a mile off Kalaupapa, Molokai
Eight others aboard the small plane survived
Fuddy was director of the Hawaii's health department
In 2011, she confirmed Obama's birth certificate to put to rest questions about his nationality
(CNN) -- Loretta Fuddy, the Hawaii official who confirmed the authenticity of President Obama's birth record in Hawaii, died Wednesday night in a small-plane crash.
The aircraft, with nine passengers on board, crashed into the ocean about a mile off Kalaupapa, Molokai, on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
The other eight people survived, Petty Officer Stephen Woodbury said. One person swam ashore, a Maui Fire Department helicopter picked up four, and a Coast Guard helicopter rescued three.
Fuddy was director of the state's health department.
"Our hearts are broken," Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a prepared statement. "Loretta was deeply loved and respected. She was selfless, utterly dedicated and committed to her colleagues in the Department of Health and to the people of Hawaii. Her knowledge was vast; her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience."
President Obama's "long form" birth certificate
President Obama's "long form" birth certificate
In April 2011, Fuddy confirmed Obama's "long form" birth certificate as part of the state's effort to put to rest questions about whether he was really born in the United States.
"I have seen the original records filed at the Department of Health and attest to the authenticity of the certified copies the department provided to the President that further prove the fact that he was born in Hawaii," she said at the time.
A biography at hawaiihealthconnector.com said she was a recognized leader in the public health field and won numerous awards for her work. Her hobbies included singing in a church choir, "enjoying her cat Flint, and spending time with her grand nieces and nephews."
