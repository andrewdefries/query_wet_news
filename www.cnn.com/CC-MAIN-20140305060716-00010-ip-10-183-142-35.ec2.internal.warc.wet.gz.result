The Americans are comingBy Bob Greene, CNN Contributor Haitian children watch a U.S. helicopter January 20 as the American mission to aid the earthquake-stricken country continues. STORY HIGHLIGHTSHaiti aid operation continues tradition of U.S. helping around the world, says Bob GreeneHe says there were criticisms of the speed of the aidGreene says that the response shows that Americans are eager to contribute and to helpHe says Americans can still aspire to be the hope of the world
RELATED TOPICS
Haiti
Earthquakes
Disaster Relief
Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a bestselling author whose new book is "Late Edition: A Love Story." (CNN) -- There was a phrase, or so we have long been told, that was heard in occupied Europe during World War II. It was often said as a whisper, the story goes. It had the sound of a prayer. The words were so simple, but to people who were feeling utterly abandoned and who needed help, those words meant so much. Four words: "The Americans are coming." Sometimes we forget about the power of those words, and about how, for so long, they defined the real meaning of what this country, at its best, could be. Sometimes, in the midst of all the bad news, in the midst of the mistakes this country inevitably makes, we lose sight of how much the people of the United States are counted on by those in need. Which is why the humanitarian efforts in Haiti this month, in the wake of the earthquake, have been a reminder of who we are when we strive to find our finest selves. The relief efforts have been an international undertaking; the heartache on the streets of Haiti has summoned compassionate and heroic assistance from around the globe, all of it deserving of praise and gratitude. But the United States has been at the forefront, as it has so often seemed to be in so many places when hope was in short supply. It is almost beyond imagining to think what has been in the terrified minds of the citizens of Haiti who have been without water, without food, without a way to rescue their trapped and dying children. When there is nothing left to depend on, when all is desolation and despair, what must the hungry and the hurt wish for as they look into the empty distance? Someone to care. Someone to travel many miles, with the will and the means to heal. The slowness with which medical supplies and water and heavy equipment have reached the people of Haiti has been thoroughly reported. Some of the results of the relief effort have been troubling, beset by bottlenecks and breakdowns under arduous conditions. But this is not about the frustrations in getting the job done. It is about the American impulse to help. There is nothing particularly controversial, these days, about pointing out the failings of the United States. You can say just about any derogatory thing about the U.S., and it's not especially shocking. We're used to hearing it. Already, as the tragedy in Haiti continues to unfold, there have been pockets of harsh criticism of America's efforts to help. French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet alluded to the United States "occupying" Haiti instead of assisting it. It is not the first time the United States has been chastised, and it will not be the last. The history of the U.S. involvement in Haiti has not always been a happy or unsullied one. But perhaps we can take just a moment to think about the honor that is inherent in being the ones who, at junctures like this one, are counted on -- the ones who show up, every time. During World War II, those four words -- "The Americans are coming" -- referred to the armed forces who had traveled across the ocean to liberate the people the Nazis had enslaved. In times of natural disaster, the context is different. In Haiti the words refer to the 82nd Airborne, yes, but they also refer to the American doctors who are volunteering their time and risking their own safety to soothe the pain of people they had never before met. The words refer to the American volunteers assisting at Haitian orphanages, not giving up on the children who have no families to comfort them. The words refer to the American search-and-rescue teams who work past the point of exhaustion as they seek signs of the living among the rubble, and they refer to the Americans back home who, during difficult economic times in the U.S., have donated their money to help people who, for now, have no way to say thank you. The focus of the news will shift soon enough -- that shift has already started. There will be other crises, other major stories. We, as a country and as individuals, will continue to be imperfect. There will be political squabbles and high-decibel partisan fights. We will at times focus on the trivial and the coarse. At such times, we might do well to pause and recall the sound of those four words. And to let the words remind us that, when we set our souls to it, we still can aspire to be the hope of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.

Zimmerman speaks, raises funds on new website
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 2:54 AM EDT, Tue April 10, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"I assure you, the facts will come to light," George Zimmerman writes online
"Website is a luxury that Trayvon Martin doesn't have," Martin family lawyer says
Martin's killing has provoked debate over race and Florida's self defense law
A Florida prosecutor says she won't send the case to a grand jury Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- The man at the center of a firestorm over his shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager has launched a website, warning supporters about groups that falsely claim to be raising funds for his defense and soliciting donations for himself.
"I am the real George Zimmerman," declares the website, set up over the weekend.
"On Sunday February 26th, I was involved in a life altering event which led me to become the subject of intense media coverage. As a result of the incident and subsequent media coverage, I have been forced to leave my home, my school, my employer, my family and ultimately, my entire life. This website's sole purpose is to ensure my supporters they are receiving my full attention without any intermediaries."
Zimmerman's "life altering event" was the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, an act that the neighborhood watch volunteer told Sanford, Florida, police was an act of self defense. Zimmerman has not been charged with a crime in Martin's death, a fact that has provoked demonstrations and calls that he be prosecuted for killing the teen.
George Zimmerman posts new website
Lawyer: Zimmerman's website is a luxury
Legal experts discuss Martin Case
Zimmerman attorneys say media unfair
The statement posted on therealgeorgezimmerman.com warns viewers that "some persons and/or entities have been collecting funds, thinly veiled as my 'Defense Fund' or 'Legal Fund.' I cannot attest to the validity of these other websites as I have not received any funds collected, intended to support my family and I through this trying, tragic time."
War of words continues in Trayvon Martin case
But the site includes a link through which viewers can donate money to pay for Zimmerman's lawyers and living expenses "in lieu of my forced inability to maintain employment." Zimmerman pledges to "personally maintain accountability of all funds received."
"I am grateful to my friends that have come to my aid, whether publicly or personally, never questioning my integrity or actions, understanding that I cannot discuss the details of the event on February 26th, and allowing law enforcement to proceed with their investigation unhindered," the 28-year-old Zimmerman wrote on another of the site's pages. "Once again, I thank you for your patience and I assure you, the facts will come to light."
Until now, only friends and relatives have come forward to speak on Zimmerman's behalf. His attorneys have said he wants to share his story but can't, because of threats to his safety and the possibility of criminal charges.
Zimmerman's lawyers and a friend confirmed the authenticity of the website. The friend, Frank Taaffe, told CNN sister network HLN that while the site is being used to raise funds for a legal defense, it doesn't mean Zimmerman expects to be charged in connection with Martin's death.
"That has nothing to do with it," Taaffe told HLN's "Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell."
But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Martin's family -- which also has a site raising funds to support their efforts -- said it's unfair that Zimmerman is still free to express his views and solicit money.
"If the situation was reversed, Trayvon Martin would have been arrested day one, hour one," Benjamin Crump told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Monday night. "We believe Zimmerman should have been arrested and put into jail. This situation with this website is a luxury that Trayvon Martin doesn't have and never would have had."
The special prosecutor assigned to oversee the investigation, Angela Corey, announced Monday that she would not present a case against the Zimmerman to a grand jury. But her office added in a written statement, "The decision should not be considered a factor in the final determination of the case."
Crump said earlier that Martin's family hopes to see charges against Zimmerman as soon as possible.

Understanding the spoken word in Martin case
"We were anticipating that there would be no grand jury, because the family has always been hopeful that there would just simply be an arrest," Crump said. "We believed, from day one, that they had enough evidence to arrest the killer of Trayvon Martin and now, as the evidence has continued to unfold, we think there has been a plethora of evidence to simply effect probable cause to do an arrest -- not for a conviction, but for an arrest."
He told CNN that the victim's mother, Sybrina Fulton, "said that she's prayerful" Zimmerman will be arrested.
"We want a very public trial so the evidence can come out and show people that the justice system works for everybody," Crump added.
And the Justice Department said the grand jury decision does not affect any federal role. "The department's parallel investigation remains ongoing," Justice spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said.
"We hope this decision signals the special prosecutor's intention to live up to her reputation as a passionate, justice-focused attorney and bring charges against Zimmerman herself," said NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. "The future of this case now rests solely with her and we have faith that she will do her best to secure justice for Trayvon Martin."
Zimmerman supporters say he was protecting neighborhood
Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed Corey as a special prosecutor as calls for "Justice for Trayvon" grew in the days following the shooting. She said previously that she had never used a grand jury to decide on charges in a case that hinged on questions of whether a killing was justifiable.
"We do a thorough investigation. We make that decision ourselves," she said.
Zimmerman's attorney, Hal Uhrig, told CNN that he was "not surprised" that Corey wouldn't present a case to a grand jury.
"Don't know what her decision will be. Courageous move on her part," he wrote in a text message to CNN's Martin Savidge. Uhrig said he and Zimmerman legal adviser Craig Sonner plan to meet with Zimmerman for the first time "probably later this week."
Martin's death has triggered a nationwide debate about race in America and Florida's "stand your ground" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury.
Lawyers: Zimmerman whispered 'punks' before shooting
Sanford police questioned Zimmerman and released him without charges. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. But thousands have converged on Sanford to join in protests calling for Zimmerman's arrest and criticizing the police department's handling of the case.
On Monday, a group of students calling themselves the Dream Defenders marched to the Sanford police station. Six of the demonstrators wore hooded sweatshirts, as Martin did the night he was shot, as they blocked the department's main entrance; others linked arms, sang and chanted as they stood facing the building.
The demonstration closed the police department headquarters briefly, and City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. and Acting Police Chief Darren Scott met with leaders of the student group and community leaders.
Although details of the February 26 incident remain murky, what is known is that Martin, who was African-American, ventured out from his father's fiancee's home in Sanford to get a snack at a nearby convenience store. As he walked home with a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea, he was shot and killed by Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, and who had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood.
CNN's Terry Frieden, George Howell, Vivian Kuo, Eric Fiegel and Ashleigh Banfield contributed to this report.

Presumably because of his health, Chavez has not held as many rallies or traveled as often as he has in previous campaigns. His re-election effort has been mostly through presidential addresses that state-run television stations are mandated to carry.

Chavez, who has been president since 1999, defeated Henrique Capriles Radonski, whose campaign criticized the Chavez administration for inefficiencies, infrastructure shortcomings and corruption.
Chavez highlighted his accomplishments in housing, education and health initiatives and acknowledged he needed to do more on crime and government bureaucracy.
With 90% of the ballots counted Sunday night, Chavez has 54.42% of the vote compared with 44.97% for Capriles, according to Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council.
Chavez had secured 7.4 million votes and Capriles 6.1 million votes, election officials said.
The country saw one of its highest participation rates in decades, with almost 81% of voters going to the polls, Lucena said.
In fact, some polls were kept open two hours after their scheduled closing because lines of voters were waiting for ballots.
Capriles battles 'too rich' image
Venezuelan voters fear violence Can Capriles beat Chavez?
Hugo Chavez looks to change his image
As throughout the day, the army was still deployed Sunday evening and was standing by throughout the country to ensure a peaceful and secure vote, said Maj. Gen. Wilmer Barrientos, commander of strategic operations command.
Earlier in the evening, Chavez thanked his campaign staff in a phone call aired on state-run television at mid-evening and asked people to remain calm until the election results were completed. Chavez said people were still voting in some places.
"Let us wait for the results patiently, calmly and prepare ourselves to accept the results whatever they may be," he said.
"This will be a triumph for democracy," he added. He asked that there be no violence.
Long lines began forming in the early morning hours at polling stations from remote regions of the Amazon to the bustling capital of Caracas.
One election official, Rosalin Montiel, told state-run television that polling stations in the municipality of San Francisco in the state of Zulia would remain open past the schedule closing time -- "until the last elector casts his vote."
Nearly 140,000 troops were deployed throughout the country to guard polls and keep the peace, state-run VTV reported.
By mid-afternoon, Barrientos reported 15 electoral offenses throughout the entire country, the Venezuelan military said on its Twitter account. No further details were immediately available.
After casting his ballot, Chavez called on Venezuelans to vote and remain calm.
"Have no doubt that we will respect the results, whatever they are. ... We have to recognize the results," he told reporters.
After casting his vote, Capriles said governors nationwide had reported "massive participation, demonstrating one more time that Venezuelans want to resolve our differences through democratic means."
He told reporters that "whatever the people say today, for me, is sacred," and said he would push for national unity after the results are released.
"There will be a winner. There will a president-elect. But there will not be a defeated people," he said. "Tomorrow, we are only one country, only one Venezuela. Tomorrow in the country there are many problems that we have to resolve. Problems do not wait."
On the eve of the election, Chavez -- who is facing the strongest challenge to his 13-year-rule -- stressed that the election would be free and fair and called on people across the political spectrum to "prepare emotionally" for Sunday's result.
"It won't be the end of the world for anybody," he said.
Chavez has dismissed his much younger challenger as a "fly" not worth chasing, when challenged to a debate earlier this year.
The president's critics were confident that Capriles could unseat the long-ruling leftist leader, a refrain previously heard before eventual defeats.
Yet the incumbent is a political survivor and remains popular at home. But there were signals, observers said, that this time Chavez really was on the ropes.
Chavez's influence over Latin America's left-leaning governments has often rankled the United States, Venezuela's largest trading partner. Venezuela is the fourth-largest exporter of oil to the United States. Despite that tight economic relationship, the two countries are not exactly close allies: Chavez often rails against the U.S. and its allies as "imperialists."
Further complicating the U.S.-Venezuela relationship is how Chavez is allied with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, defended former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and has even offered his support for Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad.
At stake for Venezuelans is the ideological trajectory of their country.
Chavez, 58, has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism, a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs.
Observers say Capriles, 40, represents a moderate alternative.
He has vowed not to end the social programs that Chavez has set up, and he promises to fight corruption that has grown in the public sector.
The candidates offer two distinct paths to solve the problems that are on Venezuelans minds: decaying infrastructure, high crime rates and political polarization.
The election also drew voters from beyond the country's borders as thousands of Venezuelans living abroad lined up to cast their ballots at diplomatic offices.
In New Orleans, Louisiana, voters streamed into the Venezuelan Consulate. Many traveled by bus from Miami, where Venezuelan authorities closed a consulate in January after the United States expelled the office's top Venezuelan diplomat.
In Caracas, voters said they were happy to be casting their ballots.
"I'm really proud of the people, because everyone is cheerful about this event and I think there is a good feeling," said Jesus Betancourt, a 25-year-old student.
Standing outside the Caracas school where Chavez cast his ballot, Katherene Rivas said she hoped Venezuelans would respect the results.
"For now, everything is quiet here, and we want that after the results are announced, that people remain calm," she said.

Sharapova and Serena fight injuries ahead of Brisbane
updated 2:19 PM EST, Thu December 27, 2012
Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams are both expected to compete at the upcoming Brisbane International.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams confirmed for Brisbane International
Australian competition runs between December 30 to January 6
Sharapova fit after withdrawing from exhibition game with sore collarbone
Williams set to compete following successful toe operation despite pulling out of game in Thailand
(CNN) -- Tennis stars Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams are both set to step up their preparations for the Australian Open by competing at the season-opening Brisbane International, despite injury problems.
World No. 2 Sharapova, who has received a first-round bye, was forced to pull out of an exhibition match in Seoul after complaining of a sore collarbone.
But the French Open champion, who missed the Brisbane tournament 12 months ago with an ankle problem, is keen to return to action ahead of the first grand slam of the New Year in Melbourne.
Keys unlocks door to Australian Open
Commenting on her withdrawal from the exhibition clash against Caroline Wozniacki, Sharapova wrote on her Facebook page: "For everyone in Korea, I'm sorry I had to withdraw from my exhibition match.
How do you beat Serena Williams?
Serena Williams' rise to greatness
Maria Sharapova's greatest hits "I woke up the other day with a neck pain and, after doing a few tests, the doctor wants me to take the next few days without any playing."
World No. 3 Williams is also set to feature in the $1.5 million tournament, despite pulling out of an exhibition match against Li Na in Thailand following successful toe surgery.
How Serena turned disaster into triumph
Williams, who is aiming for a 16th grand slam triumph next month after winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2012, is among eight of the world's top-10 women competing in Brisbane.
First-round matches start on Sunday, and tournament organizer Cameron Pearson is delighted that both Sharapova and Williams will be present along with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka.
"I think Maria and Serena are the two biggest stars in women's tennis so it's great that they're both going to be here and both be fit and ready to play the first tournament of the year," he told Australian media.
Meanwhile, U.S.Open champion Andy Murray suffered defeat at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi.
Murray was beaten 6-3 6-4 by Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic, who will now face Spain's Nicolas Almagro in the semifinal.
David Ferrer booked his place in the last four and a showdown with Novak Djokovic following a 6-2, 6-4 win over Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic.

'I just hoped for the best,' woman who caught falling baby says
By Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 8:04 PM EDT, Thu June 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"He felt light as a feather," the woman who caught a falling baby tells CNN
Cristina Torre, daughter of former Yankees manager Joe Torre, caught the boy as he fell
The boy is out of the hospital
His parents are awaiting arraignment on child endangerment charges
(CNN) -- It must have been a terrifying sight. Two stories up, a baby, legs dangling, clutching the black metal edge of the fire escape with his little hands.
And then, the even more terrifying sight of a child in free fall.
But what could have been a horrifying tragedy turned into a celebration Wednesday when Montessori school teacher Cristina Torre -- daughter of the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre -- caught the 1-year-old after he bounced off an awning.
"I honestly did not feel his weight," she told CNN Thursday. "It was effortless. He felt light as a feather."
Joe Torre's daughter saves falling baby Torre was hailed as a hero for catching the child, who police say had crawled out onto the fire escape after pushing aside a piece of cardboard covering a hole next to the second-floor apartment's air conditioner.
The boy's parents, however, weren't receiving quite the same reception.
They were awaiting arraignment Thursday on child endangerment charges. Three other children in the apartment, ages 2, 3 and 5 -- were placed in the custody of Child Protective Services.
Their 1-year-old son, whose name has not been released, was discharged from Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn hours after the incident, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear where he was Thursday.
Torre said she was passing by the apartment building when she looked up and saw the baby's precarious situation. She got on her phone and called 911 while she maneuvered herself into position under the boy.
She told CNN's Alina Cho, "I saw the baby, kind of straddling (a) pole ... and I started talking to him, as I'm talking to 911, and saying, 'Please stay up there, please.' "
"The minute he let go, I just hoped for the best and had my arms out waiting for him," she said.
Torre said the boy was crying and bleeding from the mouth after hitting something on the way down, but otherwise seemed to be all right.
The boy's father came down later, thanked Torre for saving his son and gave her a hug.
She hugged him back, she said.
Torre's dad released a statement Wednesday night saying, "I am very proud of my daughter Cristina's actions today during an incident in Brooklyn involving a small child. Fortunately for that child she was in the right place at the right time to lend a hand."
Cristina Torre, in turn, credited her father, who was a major league All-Star catcher in his playing days, with having a role in the rescue, sort of.
"I do think I got that hand-eye coordination from my dad," she said.

Body modification -- or mutilation?
By Dr. Anthony Youn, CNN Contributor
updated 12:05 PM EST, Thu November 7, 2013
Dennis Avner, aka "Cat Man," arrives at a 2007 party for "Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorium" in New York. Avner died last year of an apparent suicide.
Filipino fashion designer Herbert Chavez underwent plastic surgery to transform himself into Superman. He had his nose thinned and a cleft made in his chin. He also had silicone injected for fuller lips, liposuction to flatten out his abdomen and implants to bulk up his buttocks and hips. A man at Venezuela Tattoo Expo in January appears as "Satan," complete with apparent horns. Tom Leppard -- the so-called "Leopard Man of Skye" -- shot to fame after becoming the world's most tattooed man -- a crown he held until recently. His entire body is covered with leopard spots. English freak and sideshow performer Horace Ridler exhibited himself as "The Great Omi" or "The Zebra Man." Ridler died in 1969. Annette Edwards, a British mother of 10, spent more than 10,000 pounds to transform herself into a real-life Jessica Rabbit, an animated character in the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"
Showman Erik Sprague, also known as "The Lizardman" with his scales and forked tongue, poses for photographs during a 2012 interview in Madrid. Maria Jose Cristerna poses for pictures during a 2011 news conference in Bogota, Colombia. The Mexican tattoo artist said she started to cover her body in tattoos, piercings, titanium implants and dental fangs to reinvent herself as a vampire, her reaction after suffering domestic violence.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Body modification can go well beyond tattoos and piercings
Some have bolts implanted in their skin or get their tongues forked
These procedures may not be done using medical anesthesia
Editor's note: Dr. Anthony Youn is a plastic surgeon in metro Detroit. He is the author of "In Stitches," a humorous memoir about growing up Asian-American and becoming a doctor.
(CNN) -- Horns. Forked tongues. Elf ears. Whiskers.
No, these aren't features from the latest fantasy film. Today, thousands of people are getting their bodies modified in all sorts of bizarre and unusual ways. Tattoos are just the tip of the iceberg for people interested in body modification, referred to as "body mutilation" by detractors.
People called "body modification artists" perform these unconventional surgical procedures, typically on young clients. These treatments range from the simple, such as implanting metal bolts on a person's neck, to the extreme, such as creating ridges under a person's skin in order to make him look like a human lizard.
Hard to believe? The website Body Modification Ezine has more than 3 million photos of people who've undergone these various types of body modification.
Dr. Anthony Youn
And it's not just in the United States. Other industrialized countries are seeing the body modification trend expand with new, and increasingly bizarre, treatments. In Japan, young people are plumping up their forehead by injecting large amounts of saline, then pressing their thumb into the middle to create an indentation. This leaves a temporary doughnut-like appearance, dubbed the "Bagel Head."
Extreme body modification procedures are almost never performed by actual physicians. These treatments are more often associated with tattoo parlors than medical offices. In fact, I've never heard of a single plastic surgeon who's admitted to performing extreme body modification. And because actual doctors aren't involved, the patients don't benefit from modern anesthetics.
Should you trust your doctor?
Yes, people have this done without real anesthesia.
2011: Surgery to look like Superman
RidicuList: Bagel-shaped foreheads
Want to fork your tongue? Take a swig of whiskey, apply some ice, and try to stay still while the body modification artist slices it in half. Seriously.
Although I've never been asked to fix or treat a split tongue, there is one body modification trend I've been asked very commonly to repair: gauge earrings. These are circular earrings that function to gradually dilate an ear piercing, often to massive size. People with gauge earrings may believe their earlobes look stylish when the earrings are in place, but they look like limp noodles when the jewelry is removed.
Most of my patients who've undergone repair of their stretched earlobes have had it done to improve their job prospects -- what works for an interview at a tattoo parlor may not be appropriate when applying for a managerial position.
Apart from its effect on professional prospects, can extreme body modification be a sign of underlying psychiatric issues?
One of the most famous body modification subjects, Dennis Avner, spent years making himself look like a cat. He went so far as to have whiskers implanted into his cheeks and his teeth filed into fangs. About a year ago, he died of an apparent suicide. Some have speculated that Avner may have suffered from body dysmorphic disorder, a psychiatric condition involving a person's self-image. It has a very high rate of suicidal ideation.
As a board-certified plastic surgeon, I'm well aware that the patients in my medical field have a much higher rate of BDD than the general population. Plastic surgery is basically a more socially acceptable form of body modification.
Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian
However, there is a big difference between plastic surgery and extreme body modification. Board-certified plastic surgeons are required to undergo at least nine years of schooling and training, pass a slew of rigorous exams and perform their procedures in a safe, accredited medical center.
So if you're considering extreme body modification, think about it very seriously. Surgical procedures should be performed in a sterile medical environment under the hands of an experienced surgeon. Things can go wrong even under the best of circumstances.
Also consider that what you want today may not be want you want in the future. Fashion changes. While it may be cool to have Frankenstein's bolts in your neck now, in 10 years they may just make you look like a monster.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Anthony Youn.
