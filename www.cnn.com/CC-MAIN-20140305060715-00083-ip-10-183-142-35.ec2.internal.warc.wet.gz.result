Inmate takes too-fat-to-execute argument to Supreme CourtStory Highlights Richard Cooey, set to die Tuesday, has exhausted most state, federal appeals Justices are expected to decide whether he should receive stay of execution They could also address constitutional claims about medical fitness for execution Cooey: Drug interaction, weakened veins would make punishment cruel, unusual Next Article in Crime » WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Ohio death row inmate who says he is too overweight to be executed took his plea to the Supreme Court on Friday. Richard Cooey, 41, and an accomplice were convicted of the 1986 murders of two college students. Richard Cooey is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday and has exhausted most of his state and federal appeals. Gov. Ted Strickland earlier Friday denied the 41-year-old prisoner's clemency petition. Cooey murdered two college students in 1986. The justices were expected to decide whether he should receive a stay of execution, and whether to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment. His lawyers have argued that the inmate-- at 5-foot-7 and 267 pounds -- is "morbidly obese," and has gained about 70 pounds since his incarceration at age 19. Prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day, limiting his opportunities for exercise, contributed to his weight problem, his legal team said in recent court filings. Cooey also says regular medication he takes for migraines will weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the a three-drug cocktail administered during execution. He says his veins are weakened because of his health issues, and the lethal drugs would amount to cruel and unusual punishment. In 2003, one day before Cooey was scheduled to die, a judge stopped his execution on issues unrelated to his health claims. Don't Miss A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Cooey waited too long to raise the medical issues, saying he "knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to July 2005." Cooey and a then-17-year-old accomplice were convicted of the brutal murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery, students at the University of Akron. The men had been tossing concrete slabs onto Interstate 77, and one of them struck Offredo's car. Pretending to rescue the women, Cooey and Clinton Dickens took them to a remote field, according to prosecutors. There, the students were subjected to 3� hours of rape, torture, stabbings and fatal bludgeonings. Cooey had carved an "X" into the stomachs of both women, prosecutors said. Each man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows, but both were convicted of murder. Dickens received a life sentence because of his age. Cooey tried to escape from death row in 2005, when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bedsheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area. At an August clemency hearing, Jon Offredo, brother of one of the victims, said, "Our family has never gotten an apology from Richard Cooey. We've gotten blatant lies and excuses. Is an apology too much to ask? How could he commit such a heinous act and not feel regret?" But Cooey's lawyer, Dana Cole, said his client is sorry for his crimes. The high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death. But in a case five years ago, the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution. The high court had sided with a convicted Alabama killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs. Writing for the unanimous court, then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the court was not going to "open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges," as Alabama feared. "Our holding is extremely limited." That inmate is still on death row. Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a data-resource group that opposes capital punishment, said the Supreme Court indicated that "how you're going to be executed is a civil rights matter, the same as if you were discriminated [against] on the basis of race or gender or something like that." A Washington state killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang. Mitchell Rupe at one time was more than 425 pounds, but weight-loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years. Subsequent legal efforts to execute him failed. He died in prison two years ago from a long illness. The Ohio case is Cooey v. Strickland.

Cannes gets specs appeal as 3D 'Up' opens festivalStory Highlights Pixar's "Up" is first animation to open world's most prestigious film festival Follows success of 3D pictures such as "Coraline" and "Monsters vs. Aliens" DreamWorks CEO: 3D is a film revolution akin to the inception of sound Problem of 3D screens has been solved by digital cinemaNext Article in Entertainment » Read PHOTOSMAP By Mairi Mackay CNN	CANNES, France (CNN) -- Dark glasses are de rigueur on the sun-kissed French Riviera, but this year glamorous cineastes attending the opening night of Cannes were matching another kind of face wear with their tuxedoes and designer dresses. The crew of "Up" pose for photographers ahead of the animated movie's premiere at Cannes.more photos » The audience donned 3D glasses as they attended the premiere of Pixar's "Up," an animation in 3D, which marked the start of world's most prestigious film festival. It is the first time in the festival's 62-year history that Cannes has opened with an animation. "Up" will show out of competition. John Lasseter, chief creative officer of acclaimed filmmaker-led animation studio Pixar described the moment as "one of the greatest things that has happened to us in our careers." He said: "To have your movie actually open it is really, really exciting -- and to be the first 3D film too." The festival's surprise choice, in the wake of the recent success of 3D pictures "Coraline" and DreamWorks' "Monsters vs. Aliens" earlier this year, is perhaps the boldest message yet that 3D is being embraced by the mainstream as the format of the future. According to Lasseter, who is also chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar's tenth film also marks a major shift for both studios. "All of our films from now on will be made in 3D both at Pixar and at the Disney Animation Studios as well," he said. "Up," co-directed by Pete Docter and Bob Petersen, tells the story of a grouchy 78-year-old widower who ties thousands of helium balloons to his ramshackle house and floats away to realize his dream of visiting South America. Don't Miss Cannes icons throughout the years
Cannes 2009: The movies to watch out for The heart-warming tale, which took four years to complete, is visually stunning, using 3D to make the screen like a window into the world of the film. "We really tried to use depth in the same we use color and cinematography, and that is to further the emotion of the scene," said Docter of the philosophy behind the team's use of 3D in "Up." The computer animated drama showcases the strength of the format to immerse viewers in the narrative -- especially when it is in the hands of talented storytellers. Docter and Petersen steer clear of using 3D to create wow factor with the visual gags the format can provide. Lasseter agrees that 3D should be used as an aid to storytelling and not just for cheap visual thrills. "3D has a tendency, especially when you do all that 'comin'-at-you' stuff, everybody laughs, but now they're out of the story, so we try to restrict that." Lasseter who co-founded the legendary animation studio behind animations "Toy Story' (1995), and "Monsters Inc." (2001), is one of many high profile 3D advocates. DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has said that 3D is a film revolution akin to the inception of sound, which ushered in the era of the "talkies" in the early 20th Century. Pixar made its first 3D film, "Knick Knack" in 1989. "The problem was that there was no theater in the world that you could see it in," said "Up" producer, Jonas Rivera. "We were waiting 16 or 17 years to see it in 3D." The problem of 3D screens has been solved by digital cinema, and although the roll out of 3D-enabled cinemas has been dealt a blow by the economic downturn, exhibitors are continuing to install screens all over the world. Hollywood is also squarely behind 3D, green-lighting features from directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas. The studios hope it will be the format global audiences will be watching films in the future -- in the cinemas and not in their living rooms. In April, DreamWorks Animation's latest feature, "Monsters vs. Aliens," opened on 2,000 3D screens in the U.S and there are high hopes that James Cameron's 3D title "Avatar" will be a 2010 Christmas blockbuster. This year at Cannes, there are even some 3D films screening in the market including, "Station 21," a sci-fi thriller from French director, Olivier Parthonnaud. Pixar's innovation in filmmaking will be honored later this year at the Venice Film Festival, when the studio will be presented with a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement -- the first time in the festival's history that a studio has been awarded this prize.

Power dressing: What world leaders' clothes say about them By Barry Neild, for CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSHistory has shown that hunger for power goes hand-in-hand with sartorial obsessionBarack Obama, Kim Jong Il and Hamid Karzai have all been touted as style iconsLamb hats, elevated shoes and chunky knitwear among leaders' unusual choices (CNN) -- When Marilyn Monroe quipped that all it took to conquer the world was the right pair of shoes, she perhaps knew more than she was letting on. Shoes, suits, dresses and even hats have all become the obsessions of many of the people who have conquered if not the world, then at least parts of it. The link between style and global leaders is nothing new. As historical figures such as France's Napoleon Bonaparte have shown, interest in fashion goes hand-in-hand with a hunger for power -- often with mixed results. Recently it was revealed that former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak had his name woven into the pinstripes of his immaculate suits, a sartorial touch that has probably endeared him even less to the people who have stripped him of power and put him on trial. Here we've put together a list of some of the powerful men and women of today who have chosen to cloak their naked political ambitions in outfits that have raised their profile as fashion icons -- and more often than not raised a few eyebrows. Barack Obama Habitually clad in a boiler suit tailored to highlight his portly frame, Kim Jong Il seems an unlikely style icon Barack Obama's presidency might be looking a bit frayed around the edges these days, but the commander-in-chief is still looking as dapper as ever in his sharply tailored suits. Of course, it's easy to argue that, as one of the world's most powerful men, the U.S. president is always going to enjoy a certain fashion kudos, but it's hard to envision his defeated 2008 Republican rival John McCain being voted -- as Obama was in a 2009 survey -- more stylish than Brad Pitt, David Beckham and Daniel Craig. Hamid Karzai Hamid Karzai's flowing cape and hat combo has remained unchanged since he was installed as president of Afghanistan nearly a decade ago. But when American fashion designer Tom Ford describes you as "the chicest man on the planet," it's probably wise to keep wearing the same outfit, even if it does include headgear made from an unborn lamb. Kim Jong Il Habitually clad in a boiler suit tailored to highlight his portly frame, Kim Jong Il seems an unlikely style icon. But, if you believe North Korean state media, his monotone zip-up outfits -- usually coupled with the kind of dark glasses favored by oxy-acetylene welders -- are so cool, the secretive leader has sparked a major craze. A report in 2010 quoted a "French fashion expert" claiming "Kim Jong Il mode" was spreading worldwide. Curiously, Vogue magazine has yet to pick up on this. Yulia Tymoshenko The striped pullovers favored by Bolivia's socialist president Evo Morales make a strong political statement She's no longer prime minister but Yulia Tymoshenko is still a visible presence in Ukraine, even if this is largely down to her hair: a braided blonde halo in a style not seen much since Princess Leia's planet was destroyed by the Death Star. Tymoshenko's glamorous frocks and stiletto heels have also created a disturbance in The Force, reportedly violating parliamentary dress codes, but she has recently toned things down after being put on trial (for alleged abuse of power, not crimes against fashion). Evo Morales Knitwear doesn't usually get a mention when it comes to power dressing, but though they might look nice and cosy, the striped pullovers favored by Bolivia's socialist president Evo Morales make a strong political statement. Morales is regularly seen greeting fellow leaders while wearing chompa traditional garments that many say shows Morales' affinity with his indigenous countrymen. Some have grumbled that the Bolivian leader should adopt a business suit as a sign of respect. This seems unlikely to happen, unless he gets given one by the same embarrassing elderly relative who knits sweaters for the rest of us. Nicolas Sarkozy One politician who does appear to heed the advice of Marilyn Monroe is Nicolas Sarkozy. The diminutive French president is seldom seen without a pair of elevator heel shoes that lift him closer to the height of his statuesque wife, Carla Bruni. It not known whether it was his stature or his penchant for fashionable sunglasses that once drew disparaging comments from political rival Dominique de Villepin. According to reports, Villepin once greeted Sarkozy, at the time wearing Ray-Ban aviators, with the salutation: "Ah, here comes Tom Cruise!" Goodluck Jonathan Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan, a man with a penchant for felt fedoras RELATED TOPICS
Fashion and Style
Politics
Culture and Lifestyle
When it comes to making a political statement with a hat, it's hard to beat Salva Kiir, the charismatic leader of newly-independent South Sudan, whose black stetson has its own Facebook page (but no friends). However, even Kiir must tip his Texas-sized headgear to Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan, a man with a penchant for felt fedoras that sets him alongside icons of cool such as the Humphrey Bogart, Michael Jackson and, er Freddie Krueger. Vladimir Putin The Russian prime minister's sense of style is defined more by what he doesn't wear than what he does. Since 2007, Vladimir Putin has been photographed bare chested on several occasions, displaying a remarkably toned physique for a man now aged 58. Although possibly aimed at proving he is strong enough to keep his grip on power, these Rambo-style photoshoots might seem a bit a undignified for a senior statesman. It would, however, take a very brave person to tell a former KGB agent and judo expert he looks a little bit silly. Fidel Castro OK, so Fidel Castro is no longer president of Cuba, but he still wields considerable power even if only as a symbol of his country's communist revolution. Admittedly, the military fatigues, peaked cap and bushy beard that Castro wore for most of his political career aren't to every one's tastes (nor are the leisure suits he wears in retirement) but according to Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, these are enough to make him a style icon. "His uniform is impeccable. His boots are polished, his beard is elegant," Chavez told supermodel Naomi Campbell (yes! Naomi Campbell!) in a 2008 interview for GQ magazine. Moammar Gadhafi History is unlikely to judge Libya's fallen leader favorably, but fashion may take a kinder view of the surreal sartorial legacy he leaves behind. Exhibiting a flamboyance that would've made Liberace look like an office clerk, Gadhafi regularly turned heads on the world stage with outfits that wouldn't have been out of place in Studio 54, Hogwarts or an upholstery workshop. In April this year, the New York Times received a purported Gadhafi government request for help in organizing a Metropolitan Museum exhibition of the dictator's "four decades of superior dress sense." Perhaps, even while fighting his war, Gadhafi cared more about his wardrobe.

Teddy the foam-headed president finally wins Nationals' mascot race
By Greg Seaby, CNN
updated 6:24 PM EDT, Wed October 3, 2012
For the first time in more than 500 attempts, Teddy Roosevelt beats the other Mount Rushmore presidents to the finish line.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The mascot race involves four foam-headed caricatures of presidents
Teddy Roosevelt had never beat Honest Abe and crew
The rival Philadelphia Phillies' mascot gave him the help he needed
The Nationals head into the playoffs, like Teddy, on a winning streak
(CNN) -- A long-running losing streak dating back to 2006 in Washington has finally come to an end.
Theodore Roosevelt has won the presidents' race at Nationals Park after more than 500 consecutive losses.
For years, baseball fans have repeatedly watched the foam-headed version of the 26th president lose the traditional mascot footrace held during a break in the fourth inning of Nationals' home games. Fans, and even some politicians, began a public campaign to "Let Teddy Win."
The caricatures of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and even George Washington have conspired to prevent Teddy from crossing the finish line first. But not Wednesday, the last game of the regular season against the Philadelphia Phillies.
As the presidents rounded the warning track along the right-field wall, the older three American leaders were tripped by a version of the Phillie Phanatic mascot and fell to the ground. Teddy broke free from the pack and turned the corner along the first baseline. The crowd erupted in cheers and chanted "Ted-dy, Ted-dy."
No. 26 sprinted the final stretch, winning by a wide margin. Victory belonged to the foam Rough Rider.
The president with the most victories is Lincoln, with a stunning 214 wins.
Teddy and his Washington Nationals are now both in uncharted winning territory, as playoff baseball will return to the nation's capital for the first time since 1933. The Nats clinched the National League's East Division over the weekend.

Report blames poor security, inadequate response in Benghazi attack
By Jill Dougherty, CNN
updated 2:41 PM EST, Mon December 31, 2012
Attackers set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Senate committee finds that terrorists "walked right into the Benghazi compound unimpeded"
Intelligence community, Defense Department, Congress, Obama administration also blamed
"Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi" released Monday
The September 11 attack killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans
(CNN) -- Terrorists in Benghazi, Libya, "essentially walked right into the Benghazi compound unimpeded and set it ablaze," a special Senate report on the September 11 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans says.
The bipartisan report, "Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi," released Monday by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, cites "extremely poor security in a threat environment that was 'flashing red.' "
The State Department comes in for the major portion of blame for failing to respond to, even ignoring, repeated requests from U.S. staff in Benghazi for more security resources, especially more personnel.

The department, the report says, left it to Libyan security personnel to protect U.S. diplomats, even though those guards were unreliable and had "conflicting loyalties," a problem that it says was "deeply troubling, especially since this problem was recognized long before the attack."
Read the report (pdf)
In her preface to the Senate report, Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member of the committee, says the committee also found fault with the intelligence community, the Defense Department, the Obama administration and Congress.
"While the Defense Department attempted to mobilize its resources quickly, it had neither the personnel nor other assets close enough to reach Benghazi in a timely fashion," Collins says.
The report also underscores the need for the intelligence community to "enhance its focus on violent Islamist extremist groups in the region to improve the likelihood of obtaining such intelligence."

Lack of adequate funding for security also played a role, the committee found. "We have seen finger pointing about the lack of resources for embassy security," Collins writes, "but the budget is a shared responsibility. The inadequate security in Benghazi was a product of both budgets approved by Congress and of the desire of the Administration for a light footprint."
Critics say the administration gave conflicting and misleading statements on what sparked the attack, and the report agrees, concluding that the intelligence community recognized it as terrorism "from the beginning."
"Nonetheless, Administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack," the report says.
"If the fact that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack had been made clear from the outset by the Administration, there would have been much less confusion about what happened in Benghazi that terrible night. The attack clearly was not a peaceful protest in response to a hateful anti-Muslim video that evolved into a violent incident. It was a terrorist attack by an opportunistic enemy."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Falcons host the Seahawks in the NFL's divisional playoffs Sunday
The team has been plagued with woes since the Falcons formed 47 years ago
Player Eugene Robinson propositioned a cop for sex the night before Super Bowl XXXIII
Quarterback Michael Vick served time for running a dogfighting ring

Atlanta (CNN) -- Here we go again. Every time the Atlanta Falcons are on the verge of making the rest of the National Football League take them seriously beyond just an occasional tease, along comes -- well, something.
Danny White to Drew Pearson.
An arrest on the night before the Super Bowl.
Dogfighting.
Thousands of cheeseheads dominating the stands to turn the Georgia Dome into Lambeau Field South.
So here we are now, with the Falcons preparing during their 47th season to play hosts on Sunday afternoon to the Seattle Seahawks in the National Football League's divisional playoffs. There will be none of that past silliness this time for the Falcons.
At least, that's what those associated with the team keep saying, and why shouldn't we believe them?
History, for one. Lots of brutal history. But there are so many signs that the Falcons are in the midst of a renaissance with their personal Mount Rushmore of owner Arthur Blank, general manager Thomas Dimitroff, coach Mike Smith and quarterback Matt Ryan.
They've been together since 2008. They've produced five consecutive winning seasons for a franchise that hadn't managed two in a row before that. They've accumulated one of the NFL's best records (56-24) during that stretch, and they've been particularly dominant in the Georgia Dome. They also entered the postseason with the best record in the National Football Conference at 13-3 to earn home-field advantage along the way to the Super Bowl.
That is, if they keep winning. And they could.
Only the prolific likes of Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and the Mannings (Peyton and Eli) have been as consistently impressive as Ryan during the past five seasons. Plus, Blank has given Dimitroff enough financial freedom to acquire talent as he sees fits, and Smith has won enough in Atlanta to shatter the record for most victories by a Falcons head coach.
Playoff weekend X-factors
The results? Three previous trips to the playoffs for the Falcons' Mount Rushmore, and three losses.
Even so, before usually gabby Falcons wide receiver Roddy White decided to go silent this week with the media for one of the few times during his eight-year career, he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "With the team that we have now, and all the guys that have been around each other, with (Ryan) leading us as a group and knowing that everybody is on the same page, it's going to be a different outcome."
Uh-huh. We'll see.
The Falcons Nation has heard this before.
In 2008, the Falcons were picked to handle a rising but suspect Cardinals bunch on the road in Arizona. The Falcons lost 30-24.
Two seasons later, those 2010 Falcons resembled these current Falcons by building a 13-3 record that led to home-field advantage throughout the NFC side of the playoffs. It didn't matter. With all those cheeseheads screaming like crazy, and with Falcons fans either silent or heading down the local highways by the end of the third quarter, the Green Bay Packers smashed the Falcons 48-21.
Then came last season. The Falcons were just slight underdogs when they headed to New York to face the Giants. Instead, with Ryan and his offensive teammates vanishing for long stretches, the Falcons made the oddsmakers look silly with a 24-2 loss.
When you combine the Falcons' recent and past playoff struggles with a historically shaky fan base that has a tendency to come and go (even during games) and with the appearances of all those "somethings," this has been one of the NFL's most jinxed franchises.
"When you're growing up here, you're not conscious of that. You're not even thinking of that," said Terance Mathis, 45, a former NFL wide receiver who played 13 seasons in the league, including a franchise-record-filled eight for his hometown Falcons through 2001. "After my junior year in high school, I had a chance to watch them practice in training camp, and then go through their locker room. ..."
Still, as has been the case for many around Atlanta, filled with transients and dominated by Southeastern Conference college football fans, the Falcons weren't Mathis' favorite team.
Cowboys, Steelers, Raiders.
"That's where all the big superstars were from, so you gravitated to them, but I did watch the Falcons growing up," said Mathis, who particularly was fond of their teams during the late 1970s and early 1980s, which featured quarterback Steve Bartkowski and running back William Andrews. "If you loved football, you loved players who played well, and they had guys on those teams who played very, very well."
Thinking fan's guide to the playoffs
It's just that, after a wretched start that lasted for more than a decade after the Falcons' debut in 1966, the Bartkowski-Andrews era featured the first of many horrors to come for the franchise.
There were those come-from-ahead (and I mean WAY ahead) playoff losses to the Cowboys in 1978 and 1980, with relatively unknown quarterback White leading the way for Dallas. In both games, White kept finding his receiver, Pearson, in the clutch.
Years after the Bartkowksi-Andrews era, there was Deion Sanders, the only Pro Football Hall of Famer in Falcons history, leaving with his Prime Time act for San Francisco as a free agent.
There was Eugene Robinson, the Falcons' supposedly squeaky clean leader, going from saint to sinner on the day before the Super Bowl in 1999. He was arrested and accused of propositioning a female cop in Miami for oral sex, and the Falcons were flattened by the Denver Broncos in the game.
Remember the Falcons' 2007 season?
They wish to forget. That's when the Falcons spent most of their time discussing Michael Vick's (ahem) hobby with pit bulls instead of his ability to mesmerize opponents with his speed.
That same year, Bobby Petrino didn't even finish his first and only season as the Falcons' head coach. After a controversial 3-10 start, Petrino bolted in the middle of the night with two games left to play to take over the University of Arkansas football team.
Pig sooie, indeed.
Now the Falcons hope to get it right this time.
OK.

United Airlines sells 'free' tickets on website
By CNN
updated 6:52 AM EDT, Fri September 13, 2013
Human error lead to numerous $0 fare (plus tax) tickets being sold on United's U.S. domestic routes.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Customers bought $0 fare tickets on United Airlines' website
Buyers spread the word before United corrected the error in about 15 minutes
Mistake blamed on glitchy human United hasn't stated whether or not it will honor the tickets
(CNN) -- Just when you thought there were no more air-fare bargains left to be found online ...
Customers cruising United Airlines' website for tickets on Thursday got a pleasant surprise.
As reported by Forbes, air fares between cities such as Washington, DC and Minneapolis were being sold on the site for $0 to $10.
Ticket prices on other domestic routes were displayed as $0, plus $5 tax.
2012: Best time to buy airline tickets
Word quickly spread around the Internet and savvy buyers scooped up untold numbers of the dream tickets before United spotted the error.
The $0 fare and other wildly reduced fares appear to have been available for about 15 minutes, before United shut down its online reservations system, reporting that its site was undergoing maintenance.
"One of our filings today contained an error which resulted in certain fares being displayed as zero. We have corrected this error, " said United in a statement that also blamed human error for the mistake.
The site has since resumed normal operations.
The tickets are sold, now what?
The question now: will United honor the erroneously priced tickets?
Sales of airline tickets based on erroneous fares are nothing new.
In 2012, as reported by hackmytrip.com, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines and Travelocity all wrangled with the problem.
Some believe companies should stand by their sales and accept the consequences of their own mistakes.
Others say airlines shouldn't be held accountable for honest mistakes.
United has yet to issue a statement regarding its plans on whether or not to honor the tickets sold at mistaken fares.
Should United Airlines honor the tickets it sold Thursday for $0, $5 and $10? Leave a comment below.

The final days of the Sumatran tiger?
By Lee Poston, Special for CNN
updated 8:58 AM EDT, Tue October 29, 2013
As recently as 1978 more than 1,000 Sumatran tigers lived on Sumatra. Now, thanks to high deforestation and poaching, their numbers have dwindled to around 400.
A rare 12-year-old Sumatran tiger named 'Trenggani' jumps into the water within its enclosure at Ragunan Zoo in Jakarta, Indonesia. Many Sumatran tigers now live in captivity.
Two six-week-old Sumatran tiger cubs sit in their enclosure at a zoo in Krefeld in west Germany. Two 26-day-old endangered Sumatran Tiger cubs play together at the 'Taman Safari Indonesia' Animal Hospital, West Java, Indonesia. HIDE CAPTION

WWF's Tiger Protection Units patrol vulnerable areas and remove poachers' snares
Editor's note: Lee Poston is Director of Media Relations at WWF and worked with the Expedition: Sumatra team on an eight-part program with CNN Special Correspondent Philippe Cousteau who explores the Sumatran rainforest and its animal sanctuaries. (CNN) -- Ever heard of a Balinese Tiger? How about a Javan Tiger?
No? That's not surprising. These two tiger sub-species went extinct decades ago thanks to massive habitat loss and poaching. The question is whether their cousins the Sumatran tigers, will soon join them.
The odds are not in their favor. As recently as 1978 more than 1,000 Sumatran tigers lived on Sumatra. But thanks to appallingly high deforestation and rampant poaching their numbers have dropped to around 400. The once-lush green island has lost more than half its forest cover since 1985.
According to TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring arm of WWF and IUCN, poachers kill at least 40 Sumatran tigers per year, and the killing is made that much easier as their habitat shrinks.
This also brings them into conflict with people, which often results in retaliatory killings when they attack livestock or villagers.
Fence separates wildlife, civilization

It's not hard to poach a tiger. A length of metal cable, a few strong branches and a little expertise in setting a snare can bag one pretty quickly.
As Philippe Cousteau demonstrates in the groundbreaking CNN series Expedition: Sumatra, these snares are simple but stunningly effective tiger killers. And there just aren't enough anti-poaching patrols to find all of the snares and the people who set them.

So is there hope for the tigers of Sumatra?
In short, yes. Using camera traps, scat surveys and other scientific tools WWF and its partners are able to estimate the population size and distribution of tigers across Sumatra.
The camera traps are an especially valuable tool, allowing researchers to gather more precise data on individual tigers using their stripe patterns. Just like humans and fingerprints, no two tiger stripe patterns are the same.
Understanding tiger distribution allows scientists and forestry officials to designate protected areas and wildlife corridors that allow tigers to breed and disperse, and also to understand where best to patrol against poaching.
WWF's Tiger Protection Units patrol vulnerable areas, gather vital intelligence about poachers and remove poachers' snares. In places where they operate, poaching has dramatically declined. Tiger Protection Units also work with communities to help them better understand tigers and develop solutions to human-tiger conflict.
The longer-term solution is more complicated but just as critical. It all comes down to zoning and land use planning that benefits critical wildlife habitat and the needs of indigenous groups such as the Orang Rimba and Talang Mamak. It's tough to make the case for protecting tiger forests when faced with stiff competition from the highly profitable pulp, paper and palm oil industries. But one innovative solution may help make the case.
So is there hope for the tigers of Sumatra? In short, yes.
Lee Poston, WWF
Read more: The devastation of Indonesia's forests
In Indonesia, most forest areas are owned by the government and leased out for commercial activities in long-term concessions. By rezoning critical tiger habitat currently slated for deforestation, mining or agriculture into ecosystem restoration concessions, the Indonesian government can protect wildlife, support local communities and ensure that the forests are managed sustainably.
One such joint venture is currently under consideration in the buffer zone outside Sumatra's Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, also known as 30 Hills. As documented on Expedition: Sumatra, this is an ambitious and forward thinking venture that could be the best last hope for the tigers of 30 Hills.
To find out how you can help, go to Change.org and add your name to a petition urging Indonesia to re-zone the areas around 30 Hills for conservation concessions.
If given enough habitat, plenty of prey and protection from poaching, tigers are breeding machines. Their populations can rebound from even the low numbers currently seen in Sumatran tigers. The weak link in all of this is humans. We can be their worst enemy or their best friend.
By rallying the political will to protect their habitat and stopping the relentless onslaught of poaching, we can be part of the solution and ensure that future generations will share a planet with these noble creatures.

Golfer hits hole in one but joy short lived updated 10:48 AM EST, Sat November 23, 2013
Stuart Manley thought he won this car after hitting a hole in one but he was a round too early. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Welsh golfer Stuart Manley hits a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne
Manley celebrates wildly as he thinks he has won a new Mercedes But the car only goes to those who hit a hole in one in the fourth and final round
A disappointed Manley then hits an 11 on the par-4 fourth and finishes with a 72 (CNN) -- Talk about going from ecstasy to agony.
Welsh golfer Stuart Manley thought he won a new Mercedes when he struck a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne.
The world No. 346 celebrated wildly and even patted the car -- which was on display.
But then Manley was told the car only went to those who hit a hole in one in the fourth and final round and he slumped to an 11 on his ensuing hole, the fourth.
"It's the highest high and then the lowest low I've ever experienced on a golf course," Manley told the tournament website. "I thought the car was mine, and with the crowd, all the hype, I was just buzzing. The adrenaline was pumping so much.
Tiger talking Turkey!

"Then I found out about the car and go and have an 11.
"I kept asking my caddie, 'How many shots is that now?' I actually thought it was a 10 but I was not going to argue, because my head was pretty fried at that point."
Despite the disastrous fourth, Manley managed to finish the round at one-over 72 and stands at two under, total, entering play Sunday.
"If somebody had told me I would've finished on two under at the end of the day after taking an 11, I would have taken it," he said. "I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that point, but you've just got to pick yourself up and get on with it.
"I won't forget this day for a while."
Jason Day -- who lost eight of his relatives in the deadly typhoon in the Philippines this month -- led on home soil, one shot better than Denmark's Thomas Bjorn. Manley was tied for eighth, seven shots adrift.
