Zimmerman speaks, raises funds on new website
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 2:54 AM EDT, Tue April 10, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"I assure you, the facts will come to light," George Zimmerman writes online
"Website is a luxury that Trayvon Martin doesn't have," Martin family lawyer says
Martin's killing has provoked debate over race and Florida's self defense law
A Florida prosecutor says she won't send the case to a grand jury Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- The man at the center of a firestorm over his shooting of an unarmed Florida teenager has launched a website, warning supporters about groups that falsely claim to be raising funds for his defense and soliciting donations for himself.
"I am the real George Zimmerman," declares the website, set up over the weekend.
"On Sunday February 26th, I was involved in a life altering event which led me to become the subject of intense media coverage. As a result of the incident and subsequent media coverage, I have been forced to leave my home, my school, my employer, my family and ultimately, my entire life. This website's sole purpose is to ensure my supporters they are receiving my full attention without any intermediaries."
Zimmerman's "life altering event" was the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, an act that the neighborhood watch volunteer told Sanford, Florida, police was an act of self defense. Zimmerman has not been charged with a crime in Martin's death, a fact that has provoked demonstrations and calls that he be prosecuted for killing the teen.

Lawyer: Zimmerman's website is a luxury
Legal experts discuss Martin Case
Zimmerman attorneys say media unfair
The statement posted on therealgeorgezimmerman.com warns viewers that "some persons and/or entities have been collecting funds, thinly veiled as my 'Defense Fund' or 'Legal Fund.' I cannot attest to the validity of these other websites as I have not received any funds collected, intended to support my family and I through this trying, tragic time."
War of words continues in Trayvon Martin case
But the site includes a link through which viewers can donate money to pay for Zimmerman's lawyers and living expenses "in lieu of my forced inability to maintain employment." Zimmerman pledges to "personally maintain accountability of all funds received."
"I am grateful to my friends that have come to my aid, whether publicly or personally, never questioning my integrity or actions, understanding that I cannot discuss the details of the event on February 26th, and allowing law enforcement to proceed with their investigation unhindered," the 28-year-old Zimmerman wrote on another of the site's pages. "Once again, I thank you for your patience and I assure you, the facts will come to light."
Until now, only friends and relatives have come forward to speak on Zimmerman's behalf. His attorneys have said he wants to share his story but can't, because of threats to his safety and the possibility of criminal charges.
Zimmerman's lawyers and a friend confirmed the authenticity of the website. The friend, Frank Taaffe, told CNN sister network HLN that while the site is being used to raise funds for a legal defense, it doesn't mean Zimmerman expects to be charged in connection with Martin's death.
"That has nothing to do with it," Taaffe told HLN's "Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell."
But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Martin's family -- which also has a site raising funds to support their efforts -- said it's unfair that Zimmerman is still free to express his views and solicit money.
"If the situation was reversed, Trayvon Martin would have been arrested day one, hour one," Benjamin Crump told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Monday night. "We believe Zimmerman should have been arrested and put into jail. This situation with this website is a luxury that Trayvon Martin doesn't have and never would have had."
The special prosecutor assigned to oversee the investigation, Angela Corey, announced Monday that she would not present a case against the Zimmerman to a grand jury. But her office added in a written statement, "The decision should not be considered a factor in the final determination of the case."
Crump said earlier that Martin's family hopes to see charges against Zimmerman as soon as possible.

Understanding the spoken word in Martin case
"We were anticipating that there would be no grand jury, because the family has always been hopeful that there would just simply be an arrest," Crump said. "We believed, from day one, that they had enough evidence to arrest the killer of Trayvon Martin and now, as the evidence has continued to unfold, we think there has been a plethora of evidence to simply effect probable cause to do an arrest -- not for a conviction, but for an arrest."
He told CNN that the victim's mother, Sybrina Fulton, "said that she's prayerful" Zimmerman will be arrested.
"We want a very public trial so the evidence can come out and show people that the justice system works for everybody," Crump added.
And the Justice Department said the grand jury decision does not affect any federal role. "The department's parallel investigation remains ongoing," Justice spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said.
"We hope this decision signals the special prosecutor's intention to live up to her reputation as a passionate, justice-focused attorney and bring charges against Zimmerman herself," said NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. "The future of this case now rests solely with her and we have faith that she will do her best to secure justice for Trayvon Martin."
Zimmerman supporters say he was protecting neighborhood
Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed Corey as a special prosecutor as calls for "Justice for Trayvon" grew in the days following the shooting. She said previously that she had never used a grand jury to decide on charges in a case that hinged on questions of whether a killing was justifiable.
"We do a thorough investigation. We make that decision ourselves," she said.
Zimmerman's attorney, Hal Uhrig, told CNN that he was "not surprised" that Corey wouldn't present a case to a grand jury.
"Don't know what her decision will be. Courageous move on her part," he wrote in a text message to CNN's Martin Savidge. Uhrig said he and Zimmerman legal adviser Craig Sonner plan to meet with Zimmerman for the first time "probably later this week."
Martin's death has triggered a nationwide debate about race in America and Florida's "stand your ground" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury.
Lawyers: Zimmerman whispered 'punks' before shooting
Sanford police questioned Zimmerman and released him without charges. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. But thousands have converged on Sanford to join in protests calling for Zimmerman's arrest and criticizing the police department's handling of the case.
On Monday, a group of students calling themselves the Dream Defenders marched to the Sanford police station. Six of the demonstrators wore hooded sweatshirts, as Martin did the night he was shot, as they blocked the department's main entrance; others linked arms, sang and chanted as they stood facing the building.
The demonstration closed the police department headquarters briefly, and City Manager Norton Bonaparte Jr. and Acting Police Chief Darren Scott met with leaders of the student group and community leaders.
Although details of the February 26 incident remain murky, what is known is that Martin, who was African-American, ventured out from his father's fiancee's home in Sanford to get a snack at a nearby convenience store. As he walked home with a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea, he was shot and killed by Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, and who had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood.

Mine Kafon: The low-tech, high-design tumbleweed minesweeper
By George Webster, CNN
updated 12:20 PM EDT, Fri July 12, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
The Mine Kafon is a low-cost wind-powered mine detonator with the appearance of a giant, spiky-armed tumbleweed. A multitude of plunger-like arms made from lightweight bamboo spread out from a spherical core that contains a cheap GPS tracking device. The Mine Kafon can withstand the loss of about a third of these arms before it can no longer propel itself forward by the wind. The recycled rubber feet ensure maximum contact with the ground as the Mine Kafon tumbles with the wind across areas known or suspected to contain anti-personnel landmines. The structure was designed by former Afghan refugee Massoud Hassani, who was inspired by the hand-made toys -- like the one pictured above crafted from paper and plastic straws -- that he and his friends would fashion when they were kids growing up in Afghanistan. As a student at Design Academy Eindhoven, Hassani began remaking the paper orbs of his youth but at 20 times the scale and weight -- with the hope that such a structure could be used to detonate some of the 10 million or so undetected mines that the United Nations says still cover his home country. The resulting design has been under testing by Dutch military and development groups for the past few years. Mine-sweeping is predominantly carried out manually by mine diffusing experts, and often at great expense. Hassani says that one of the main advantages of his creation is that it can be produced for around $40 and, he hopes, eventually without significant expertise. However, mine clearing expert Adam Komorowski says that, while a noble and inspiring concept, the current Mine Kafon prototype falls far short of industry safety standards. His main concern is that it depends on the capricious mood of the wind, which makes it less systematic than it needs to be. Hassani acknowledges the existing limitations, but says he has other remote-controlled models in the pipeline -- such as the cylindrical version pictured above -- containing small motors and even metal detection units. In the meantime, the Mine Kafon has been warmly received by design aficionados. It was recently showcased during Dutch Design Week and is due to be exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art early next year. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mine Kafon is a cheap, light, wind-powered mine detonating device
Created by an Afghan designer who was inspired by toys he modeled as a child Industry expert says concept is laudable, but does not currently meet safety standards
(CNN) -- An Afghan designer and former refugee has developed a low-cost, wind-powered mine detonating device inspired by the toys he played with as a child.
Massoud Hassani's Mine Kafon is composed almost entirely from bamboo and biodegradable plastics, with a skeletal structure of spiky plungers that resembles a giant spherical tumbleweed from another planet.
At 70 kilograms, Hassani says his invention is light enough to be propelled by a normal breeze, while still being heavy and big enough - 190cm in diameter - to activate mines as it rolls over them.

According to the U.N., there are more than 110 million active mines scattered across 70 countries, with an equal number stockpiled around the world still waiting to be planted.

Meanwhile, manual diffusion by trained mine-clearing experts remains the most common method of removal globally, according to the Landmine Monitor, an industry publication published by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
But this method can be prohibitively expensive - in some cases it costs thousands of dollars to clear just a single mine.
By contrast, Hassani claims the Mine Kafon -- which includes a basic GPS tracking device used to record the area "cleared" by its tumbling path - costs as little as $40 to build.
"The core sphere that contains the GPS system is high enough from the ground to avoid damage from most anti-personnel mines," explained Hassani.

We are developing a remote-controlled model with a motor and a metal detectorMassoud Hassani, designer
The lengths of the spikes are based on the height of an adult's leg - because the kinds of mines that it is designed to clear are those that will take a leg off below the waist of an adult.
"So, as it moves the spikes get blown off, but the center stays intact," Hassani said. "It can withstand up to four explosions before it loses too many of its legs to carry on."
As a young kid growing up in Afghanistan, Hassani did what children the world over do: made up games and created his own toys.
"One of them was a little rolling object that was carried by the wind," he recalled. "We would race them against each other in the local fields.
"Sometimes, due to the presence of landmines, they would roll off into places that we weren't permitted to go."

After his father was killed in a rocket attack during the late 1980s, Hassani fled Afghanistan with his mother, brother and sisters. Living first in Uzbekistan, then traveling through central Asia and ending up four years later as a refugee in Holland, Hassani went on to study at the Design Academy in Eidenhoven.
It looks to me that there is also a huge limitation in terms of terrain ... I can't see it working on hills or areas with dense vegetationAdam Komorowski, Mine Advisory Group head of operations
What started life as his final graduate design project has since undergone strength testing at the hands of the Dutch military. This year, a full-scale mock-up was tested in the deserts around Morocco and Hassani hopes to fundraise $100,000 so he can engineer the design to mass produced, industry standards.
However, some are skeptical about Mine Kafon's chances of ever meeting the official International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) -- considered to be the minimum grade of delivery for responsible mine clearing operations.
"There are many citizens who live in mine-affected areas who carry out their own DIY clearances, and while this is noble it is also very dangerous," explained Adam Komorowski, head of operations at the UK-based Mine Advisory Group.
"For any mine clearing technology to be adopted by a serious mine action organization, it needs to conform to IMAS.
"As much as I welcome all new ideas -- and I think this is a nice concept with great potential to raise awareness and perhaps inspire other solutions -- I can't see it meeting those standards in anything like its current form," he said.
Komorowski, who stresses that his assessment is based solely on what he has read and viewed online, believes that Hassani's creation is undermined by its dependence on the "serendipity of random gusts" -- making it a haphazard option in a field traditionally characterized by highly methodical techniques. "Every square centimeter of land should be properly checked," he said.
"I'm also not convinced that the device can be relied upon to necessarily detonate every mine it crosses," said Komorowski, who argues that if a couple of its spikes are blown off during a clearance, then the holes in its structure could cause it to miss other mines as it rolls on.
"It looks to me that there is also a huge limitation in terms of terrain," he added. "I can't see it working on hills or areas with dense vegetation."
I think we can use our talents to find design-based solutions to more serious problemsMassoud Hassani, designer
Hassani says he is aware of these limitations, and claims to have a number of solutions in the pipeline.
"We are developing a remote-controlled model with a motor and a metal detector -- so that even if it fails to detonate a mine, it should map-out the presence of metal structures underneath," he said.
Whether the Mine Kaffon can be engineered to overcome the criticisms of industry insiders like Komorowski, the strikingly-designed structure with its poetic symmetry has already brought the issue of landmine clearance to new audiences in the design world.
It was recently showcased during Dutch Design Week and the Lodz Design Festival, and in March of next year will enjoy a run at New York's prestigious Museum of Modern Art.
"The design industry is perhaps too focused on tables and chairs," said Hassani. "I think we can use our talents to find design-based solutions to more serious problems."

London (CNN) -- UK and world leaders led tributes to Britain's "Iron Lady," former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday, with words reflecting on her passion, courage and determination -- as well as her polarizing politics.

"Margaret Thatcher took a country that was on its knees and made Britain stand tall again," Prime Minister David Cameron said outside 10 Downing Street.
"We cannot deny that Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. For many of us, she was and is an inspiration. For others, she was a force to be defined against."
Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to become British prime minister, has died at 87 after a stroke, a spokeswoman said Monday, April 8.

The life and legacy of the 'Iron Lady'
Margaret Thatcher's political legacy
Thatcher: I enjoyed company of elders
But if one thing runs though everything she did, he said, it was "her lion-hearted love of this country. She was the patriot prime minister and she fought for Britain's interests every step of the way."
Cameron cut short a trip to Spain to return to London following news of her death.
Buckingham Palace said the "Queen was sad to hear the news of the death of Baroness Thatcher. Her majesty will be sending a private message of sympathy to the family."
U.S. President Barack Obama said the world had "lost one of the great champions of freedom and liberty" and the United States had lost "a true friend."
"As a grocer's daughter who rose to become Britain's first female prime minister, she stands as an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can't be shattered," Obama said in a White House statement.
"As prime minister, she helped restore the confidence and pride that has always been the hallmark of Britain at its best. And as an unapologetic supporter of our transatlantic alliance, she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the Cold War and extend freedom's promise."
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world had "lost a transformative leader who broke the glass ceiling in global politics" and "defined grit on the world stage."
Thatcher took the helm amid tumultuous times, he said. "She would face wars abroad, terrorism at home, and deep uncertainty about the United Kingdom's future. She met all these challenges and many others with unyielding drive and courage."
Political battleground
British Foreign Secretary William Hague told CNN that Thatcher had taught her country about political determination and leadership as Conservative Party leader and prime minister.
"She stuck to things through thick and thin, through many demands that she should change course," he said. "She really showed what difference an individual could make, what difference a leader could make."
At home, she "changed the entire political battleground," he said, with her influence still felt by all Britain's parties today. "She was at times, of course, polarizing, but no leader could have accomplished what she accomplished purely based on consensus decisions."
Thatcher had also shown people in Britain and around the world the value of freedom, democracy and human rights, he said.
Former Prime Minister John Major, who served in Thatcher's Cabinet and took the reins when a party rebellion over Europe and an unpopular tax forced her from office in 1990, said hers was "a very remarkable life."
When she broke the glass ceiling in politics in 1979, she did something no one could even have dreamed of at the start of the decade, he told CNN. "She was the right prime minister for the right time," he said.
As for the vitriol directed toward her by her critics, "in private she did care. She did understand it, and she did care, but she had a mission and she wasn't going to be put off that mission."
He had "very big shoes to fill" when he followed Thatcher into 10 Downing Street, Major said.
Nancy Reagan: Thatcher had a soft side
Thatcher and Reagan: political soulmates
Margaret Thatcher, the chemist
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the opposition Labour Party in government from 1997 to 2007, said Thatcher was a "towering political figure" who would be greatly missed.
"Very few leaders get to change not only the political landscape of their country but of the world. Margaret was such a leader. Her global impact was vast," he said in a statement.
Some of the changes she made in Britain were retained to a degree by his government, he said, and their influence spread around the world.
"Even if you disagreed with her as I did on certain issues and occasionally strongly, you could not disrespect her character or her contribution to Britain's national life," he said.
'A great lady'
Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told CNN that Thatcher was a "tremendous prime minister. She was a great lady, she had very strong opinions. And to those of us who knew her over the decades, she was a very warm person, which is not the public image that is often given."

Thatcher's great achievement for Britain was its success in the Falklands crisis, he said, referring to the war over the disputed islands known to Argentina, which also claims them, as Las Malvinas.
"For the United States, it was her staunch loyalty and commitment to the Atlantic alliance -- she was a reliable and steady ally."
She was also one of the first leaders to see the way forward to ending the Cold War, he said, spotting the potential for a new kind of leader in Mikhail Gorbachev.
"I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together," she said in December 1984, three months before he became Soviet leader.
Her dealings with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, a fellow political conservative, were notably warm, Kissinger said.
"Margaret Thatcher, in her relationship with Ronald Reagan, gave it an additional personal dimension and it was unusually close, and they acted between themselves almost as if they were part of the same government."

Ending the Cold War
Gorbachev, too, paid tribute to a "great politician" with a strong voice, who helped shape 20th century history.
"Our first meeting, in 1984, marked the beginning of a relationship that was at times difficult, not always smooth, but on both sides serious and responsible," he said.
"Gradually, our relationship became more and more friendly. At the end, we were able to reach an understanding, and it was a contribution to the change in atmosphere between our country and the West and to the end of the Cold War."
Kissinger: Thatcher's strong convictions

2009: Inside Margaret Thatcher's papers
Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush -- whose first years in the White House overlapped with the end of Thatcher's time as prime minister but who served as vice president at the height of her power and influence -- called her one of the "fiercest advocates of freedom and free markets."
He said in a statement that Thatcher was a leader of rare character who "carried high the banner of her convictions, and whose principles in the end helped shape a better, freer world."
Thatcher famously told Bush, "this is no time to go wobbly," as the first Gulf War loomed.
His son, former President George W. Bush, said that he and his wife, Laura, were grieving the loss of a "strong woman and friend" in Thatcher.
Reagan's widow, Nancy, said she was terribly saddened by the loss of a dear and trusted friend.
"Ronnie and Margaret were political soul mates, committed to freedom and resolved to end Communism.
"As prime minister, Margaret had the clear vision and strong determination to stand up for her beliefs at a time when so many were afraid to 'rock the boat.' As a result, she helped to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of millions of people."
Former President Bill Clinton said Thatcher "understood that the special relationship which has long united our two nations is an indispensable foundation for peace and prosperity.
"Our strong partnership today is part of her legacy."
'Great hurt to Irish and British people'
But Northern Ireland politician and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams gave a very different view of Thatcher's legacy.
"Margaret Thatcher did great hurt to the Irish and British people during her time as British prime minister," he said in a statement.
"Working class communities were devastated in Britain because of her policies.
"Her role in international affairs was equally belligerent whether in support of the Chilean dictator (Agusto) Pinochet, her opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa; and her support for the Khmer Rouge.
"Here in Ireland, her espousal of old draconian militaristic policies prolonged the war and caused great suffering."
She will be remembered in particular for "her shameful role during the epic hunger strikes of 1980 and 81" and her Irish policy "failed miserably," he concluded.
His longtime political opponent in Northern Ireland, the former Rev. Ian Paisley, now Lord Bannside, had kinder words for Thatcher.
"In every phase of life she was great -- great as a woman, great as a wife, great as a mother, great as a political candidate, great as a Member of Parliament, especially as the first woman prime minister, great as a winner of the war, and great as a member of the House of Lords," he said.
Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny also gave a more positive assessment.
"While her period of office came at a challenging time for British-Irish relations, when the violent conflict in Northern Ireland was at its peak, Mrs Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement which laid the foundation for improved North-South cooperation and ultimately the Good Friday Agreement."
Falklands: 'We will always be thankful'
Officials in the Falkland Islands said they would never forget Thatcher's decision to defend the South Atlantic territory in 1982.
"Her friendship and support will be sorely missed, and we will always be thankful for all that she did for us," said Mike Summers of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly.
The United Kingdom and Argentina went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain says its civil and military losses amounted to 255.
For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between the two countries over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, and Argentina's state-run Telam news agency offered an unflinching look Monday at the South American country's take on Thatcher's legacy.
Articles described her as "a symbol of war," "an expression of inequality" and "a great destroyer."
Britain in Europe
European leaders paid tribute to Thatcher's role in shaping Britain's place in Europe.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: "She was without doubt a great stateswoman ... and a circumspect yet engaged player in the European Union. She will be remembered for both her contributions to and her reserves about our common project.
"She signed the Single European Act and helped bring about the Single Market. She was a leading player in bringing into the European family the Central and Eastern European countries which were formerly behind the Iron Curtain."
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Thatcher "changed Britain permanently. In the same way, she leaves European and world history a great legacy.
"Margaret Thatcher counted among the very few people who you knew, even within their lifetime, had helped write history. She always had her own unmistakeable, pithy and distinctive opinion."
French President Francois Hollande said that Thatcher's relationship with France "was always frank and honest."
She had established "a constructive and fruitful dialogue" with former President Francois Mitterrand and worked to strengthen the ties between Britain and France, he added.
Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said Thatcher "was a remarkable personality and one of the most influential European leaders of her time."
'Pioneering leader'
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the world owed a great deal to Thatcher's leadership.
"She was a pioneering leader for her contribution to peace and security, particularly at the height of the Cold War," he said.
"She was also a great model as the first woman prime minister of the United Kingdom, who not only demonstrated her leadership but has given such great hope for many women for equality, gender equality in Parliament."
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Thatcher "was an extraordinary politician who was a staunch defender of freedom, a powerful advocate of NATO and the transatlantic bond."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thatcher had inspired a generation of political leaders.
"She was truly a great leader, a woman of principle, of determination, of conviction, of strength; a woman of greatness," he said. "She was a staunch friend of Israel and the Jewish people."
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the world had lost a "giant among leaders" with Thatcher's passing.
She "had that rarest of abilities to herself personify and define the age in which she served. Indeed, with the success of her economic policies, she defined contemporary conservatism itself," he said.
Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan said she would be remembered "for her very unique, distinctive and purposeful leadership which restored pride and respect to her country" and put it back on the global stage.
'Love her or hate her'
Hollywood star Meryl Streep's portrayal of Thatcher in the 2011 film "The Iron Lady" gave some younger viewers their first insight into the former politician's character.
"To me she was a figure of awe for her personal strength and grit," Streep said Monday.
"To have withstood the special hatred and ridicule, unprecedented in my opinion, leveled in our time at a public figure who was not a mass murderer; and to have managed to keep her convictions attached to fervent ideals and ideas -- wrongheaded or misguided as we might see them now -- without corruption -- I see that as evidence of some kind of greatness, worthy for the argument of history to settle."
Iain Dale, author of the biography "Margaret Thatcher: In Her Own Words," told CNN the politician was unique in the way that her legacy still dominates British politics long after she left office.
And she polarized the country because she was a politician of conviction, he said.
"You see the reaction on Twitter to her death. You have people who absolutely idolized her who are devastated today, and you have others who are spewing out the most hateful things," he said.
"That's what happens when you are a conviction politician -- people either love you or hate you."
Thatcher's unbending opposition to the trade unions is behind many people's dislike, he said.
But, Dale said, she transformed the British economy, pulling it out of a malaise and restoring the nation's sense of self-belief.
When he last met her, about three years ago, she was still sharp when it came to remembering details of her time in office, Dale said, although her dementia affected her grasp of what was happening in the present.
Her electoral success can be credited to her ability to tap into the national psyche, he said, in the same way that Tony Blair managed in the 1990s.
"She understood what drove 'middle Britain,'" he said. "She was both a conviction politician and a popularist -- and that kind of politician is usually quite popular."
The current speaker of the UK House of Commons, John Bercow, said he was greatly saddened by her death.
As a 16-year-old student in Thatcher's own constituency at the time of the 1979 general election which put her in power, he is part of a generation of British politicians to have grown up in her shadow.
Parliament will come back early from recess to allow lawmakers to pay their tributes to Thatcher at a special session on Wednesday, Cameron said.
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said on Twitter: "Her memory will live long after the world has forgotten the grey suits of today's politics."

General strike brings Greece to a halt as unions protest austerity moves
By Elinda Labropoulou and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 10:53 PM EDT, Tue July 16, 2013
A protestor holds a banner denouncing the Greek government on July 15 in Athens.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Police: 16,000-17,000 people take part in a peaceful protest march on parliament
A general strike affects public transit, flights, garbage collection and hospital staffing
Parliament is to vote Wednesday on further austerity measures
Greece has to reform its public sector in order to receive international bailout funds
Athens (CNN) -- A 24-hour general strike protesting further austerity measures brought many public services in Greece to a grinding halt Tuesday.
Public transit systems, flights and garbage collection services are affected by the nationwide action -- the fourth general strike this year -- while hospitals are running on skeleton staffing.
Labor unions held a rally in central Athens Tuesday morning, followed by a march to the national parliament building.
About 16,000 to 17,000 people took part in the demonstration, which was peaceful and resulted in no arrests, Athens police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos said.
The crowds started to disperse after they reached parliament.
Greece's former finance minister should be prosecuted, lawmakers say
A rally was also held outside parliament Monday night, but it did not attract large numbers of protesters. Many people have left the capital to escape the summer heat.
The general strike takes place ahead of a vote in parliament Wednesday on a bill containing further austerity measures.
The measures include the tightening of financial control of municipalities and other local authorities, changes to municipal policing and a provision making it easier to fire people in the civil sector.
The legislation must be approved in order for Greece to receive the next package of international bailout funds.
The bill is expected to go through, as the coalition government holds a slim majority in parliament.
Greece, the first country to receive a European Union bailout more than three years ago, is struggling to bring its huge public debt under control.
The country is in its sixth straight year of recession, and unemployment stood at 26.8% as of March this year, according to official figures. The jobless rate among young people in Greece has soared to nearly 60%.
OECD jobless rates forecast to remain stubbornly high
CNN's Elinda Labropoulou reported in Athens, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Dunn verdict a win for prosecution, despite critics
By Danny Cevallos, CNN Legal Analyst
updated 7:34 AM EST, Tue February 18, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Danny Cevallos: Critics of the Michael Dunn verdict miss a feature of trials
They're always unpredictable, and it's impossible to get inside the mind of a jury, he says
He says jury may have been unsure about meaning of various degrees of homicide
Cevallos: The prosecution scored a win, despite public criticism of the verdict
Editor's note: Danny Cevallos, a CNN legal analyst, is a criminal defense attorney practicing in Philadelphia, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
(CNN) -- If trials were predictable, they wouldn't happen.
You can root for a jury to see a case your way and disagree with its ultimate verdict, but you cannot criticize the jury system for being unpredictable. In that sense, a Florida jury's recent verdicts -- and nonverdicts -- against Michael Dunn demonstrate a fundamental truth about trials. They are not only unpredictable; they are designed that way.
The case against Dunn stemmed from an incident on November 23, 2012. Dunn, a 47-year-old white man, arrived at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, and parked next to an SUV that contained Davis and other black teenagers. When Dunn complained about loud music coming from the SUV, words were exchanged and Dunn ultimately fired a gun that killed Davis. Dunn said he saw a gun barrel pointing out of the SUV, but the prosecution said there was no gun.
Danny Cevallos
Dunn was found guilty of three counts of attempted second-degree murder as to the other occupants of the car, but the jury was not able to reach a verdict on the first-degree murder charge in the death of Jordan Davis.
In the eyes of critics, this case was a "sure thing" for the prosecution, and anything less than guilty verdicts across the board is now considered by them to be a miscarriage of justice. Guilty verdicts were expected.
That sentiment belies a fundamental misunderstanding about the criminal justice system: With juries, there is no such thing as a "sure thing."
Case against Michael Dunn continues
Is Dunn verdict Zimmerman?
Race and justice in Florida
No one can accurately predict how each juror might perceive the evidence, argue a case in deliberations or be persuaded by his or her fellow jurors. Jurors can and do bring their own life experiences to the jury room, and no two jurors are the same.
Yet anyone who has waited for a jury's verdict has engaged in the same helpless jury astrology because there is simply no hard science to predict their behavior. The best example is the rabid divination of the meaning of juror questions: those inscrutable, handwritten missives intermittently sent out to the judge and read to the lawyers in chambers.
Tonyaa Weathersbee: An empty verdict, a hollow victory
This system is about as sophisticated as note-passing in grade-school algebra, but just a few lines from an innocuous jury inquiry will leave seasoned attorneys pondering the hidden meaning and the potential direction of the deliberations. The bottom line is this: Reading these tea leaves is an exercise in futility. There's no way to predict a verdict with certainty.
To many observers, including me, this was a strong prosecution case, but not a sure thing. In fact, it's generally only the close-call cases that go to a jury. The most obvious cases of guilt or nonguilt should result in plea agreements or voluntary withdrawals by the prosecution.
Simply look at the statistics. The vast majority of all cases, criminal and civil, are resolved before trial. Verdicts are simply too risky for either side, especially to put up a case that they believe is a loser. A jury trial means each side believes their theory of the case is strong enough to roll the dice in this riskiest game of all.
Whether you agree with the jury's verdict or not, these verdicts give us some insight into the jury's thought process.
The jury convicted on attempted second-degree murder for shots fired at the other passengers in the SUV with Davis. It makes sense. By Dunn's own concessions, he intentionally shot at a vehicle speeding away from him. Even if Dunn's testimony were completely believed, at best only Davis was the aggressor, so Dunn had a minimal self-defense claim against the other occupants.
But, the verdict on attempted second-degree murder may have put a figurative "cap" on Dunn's level of intent. In other words, the jury may have agreed that Dunn's level of intent as to all victims was consistent -- perhaps not the specific intent to kill characteristic of a first-degree murder, but something slightly less.
In the case of second-degree murder, this could be an intentional act so indifferent to human life it evinced a depraved mind.
The "depraved heart" variety of murder is often analogized, coincidentally enough, to law students as closing your eyes and shooting into a crowd with a gun. It may be true that you did not actually intend to hit anyone, but the act was so likely to kill that your level of intent is just below that of specific, premeditated murder. That law school example used to explain the concept to students is eerily similar to the facts here.
While it's possible that the jury was hung up trying to apply the law of self-defense, it may also be that the jury simply had trouble with the definitions of homicide. It's understandable. They are complicated for lawyers and lay persons alike.
Florida's standard jury instructions are available online. Take a look at each of the suggested instructions for the different degrees of murder and manslaughter. They, like all jury instructions, are complicated. They do not get much less complicated just because the judge reads them slowly and out loud to the jury. They involve abstract concepts and seemingly overlapping definitions of nuanced "states of mind."
It's very likely that the jury was hung up on whether self-defense applied, but they also may have deadlocked over the different definitions of homicide.
Despite public frustrations, this was a win for the prosecution. It secured a successful verdict on four of five counts that will, because of Florida's minimum mandatory sentencing scheme and the defendant's use of a firearm, send Dunn to prison for at least 60 to 75 years. That's day-for-day: no gain time, no early release except for a win on appeal.
Plus, the prosecution can retry Dunn for the killing of Davis. When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution does not bar a new trial of the defendant.
The double jeopardy clause provides: "[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in criminal ... cases." If the state reprosecutes the Davis killing, Dunn will certainly feel as if he's being tried twice for the same crime. Constitutionally, however, a retrial following a deadlocked jury is permissible.
Defense counsel deserves recognition as well.
They hung a jury on what many observers expected to be a clear-cut murder conviction. Even without the wave of public acrimony against the defendant, this was always an uphill self-defense case. It was clear from the trial that the defense prepared this case and the client, and gave Dunn the best chance at a not-guilty verdict. Overall, a good job with bad facts for the defense.
The big question now is whether we will see the state of Florida retry Dunn for the murder of Davis.
On one hand, they have achieved a virtual life sentence on the other convictions, which achieves one of the philosophical goals of punishment: incapacitation and isolation of Dunn from the community.
It does not achieve another goal of punishment for the Davis family: retribution. The state has indicated for now that it will retry Dunn, but if it does, one thing will remain certain:
There are no sure things in retrials, either.
