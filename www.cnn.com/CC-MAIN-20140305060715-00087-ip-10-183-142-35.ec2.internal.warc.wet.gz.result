How a fake Google news story spread online
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 6:10 PM EST, Thu November 29, 2012 | Filed under: Web
PR Web issued a retraction of its Google-ICOA post, saying that "even with reasonable safeguards" it was a hoax.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fake news report about Google sheds light on Web news pitfalls
Press release saying Web giant bought Wi-Fi company was a hoax
In rush to publish, many online outlets failed to double-check accuracy
NEW: CEO apologizes, promises changes
(CNN) -- It was big news in the tech world -- or at least it would have been if it had been true.
Google, so the story went, had purchased ICOA, a Wi-Fi provider, for $400 million. Some news organizations pounced, with everyone from long-established outlets like The Associated Press to new-media tech blogs like TechCrunch reporting the news Monday.
But hours later, both companies would deny the story, which PR Web, a site that distributes press releases for a fee, says was planted by someone falsely claiming to represent ICOA.
Hoaxes have slipped their way into the public eye for as long as journalism has existed. But media experts say the way bad information spread so quickly casts a light on how reporting can go wrong in the fast-paced world of Web journalism.
Long gone are the days when newspapers and the evening TV news were the only game in town -- when reporters had hours, if not days, to sift through a report before sharing it with the masses. In their place is an info-hungry Web that wants news now and rewards the quick with a currency of page views, Twitter links and Facebook "likes."
"With something like this, there are a lot of blogs and websites that build their reputation on the tech world," said Kelly McBride, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit devoted to the study and teaching of journalism.
"If Google is spending $400 million to buy something, there are people who are expected to have something to say about that and they want to be in that mix."
The Onion: We just fooled the Chinese government!
While a rush to get into that mix as quickly as possible probably played a role, McBride said there were multiple breakdowns in the Google-ICOA nonstory.
The first, obviously, was the person who -- according to PR Web owners Vocus -- impersonated an ICOA representative.
"Vocus reviews all press releases and follows an internal process designed to maintain the integrity of the releases we send out every day," the company said in a written statement. "Even with reasonable safeguards identity theft occurs, on occasion, across all of the major wire services. We have removed the fraudulent release and turned the matter over to the proper authorities for further investigation."
On Thursday, Vocus CEO Rick Rudman published a letter apologizing for the gaffe and promising that the company had improved it's process.
"It's clear that we have to hold our service to an ever-higher standard, so PRWeb will continue to evolve," Rudman wrote. " We will continue to deliver a service that's valuable to our customers, valuable to our readers and valuable to our distribution and media partners -- and we'll work tirelessly to deliver on these promises."
Financial experts say the hoax looks like an illegal effort to inflate ICOA's meager stock. Shares, which trade for a fraction of a penny, jumped in price dramatically Monday and hundreds of millions of shares changed hands before the stock was frozen.
ICOA CEO George Strouthopoulos told Mashable, a CNN content partner, that the release apparently originated in Aruba and was sent from an e-mail account designed to look like an official ICOA address.
But the most damning gaffe may have been PR Web's, McBride said.
Acquired by Vocus in 2006, PR Web aims to compete with the decades-old PR Newswire and other press-release outlets.
"Their quality-control process in printing out press releases obviously has some problems," McBride said. "It's not just that they got 'hacked' -- but that it was a pretty crappy press release."
The release had several grammatical errors, included no contact information for representatives of Google or ICOA, and didn't include biographical information about the companies that is typical in releases from major corporations.
In a post titled "How PRWeb Helps Distribute Crap Into Google & News Sites," Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land searched PR Web and found one of the Internet's ubiquitous "how to buy cheap Viagra" posts and other content that would seem more at home in a spam e-mail than on a news site.
The final error, McBride said, was on the part of reporters. Whether racing to publish fast or working on analysis of the supposed purchase, news outlets missed what should have been red flags.
"Journalists who were looking at it should have spotted those same weak spots in the press release and questioned whether it was real or not," she said. "Those journalists were relying on PR Web to do that and they shouldn't have.
"It would be easy to conclude that we're all going too fast. But it could be that we placed way too much trust in PR Web ... and assuming it had the same checks and balances and safety nets that other PR wires have."
(Full disclosure: Last year, this reporter, like others at numerous news outlets, was duped by pranksters who created an entire website for a fictional consulting firm to release a phony survey comparing the IQs of users of various Web browsers.)
Perhaps helping push the fake ICOA story, McBride said, was the Web's ability to share news stories in real time.
"Once one organization does it, other organizations tend to place even more blind faith," she said. "Once the AP (for example) does it, then everyone does it."
The Associated Press retracted and issued a correction for the story. When contacted, an AP spokeswoman referred CNN to the wire service's retraction, which cited ICOA and "a person close to Google" as saying the original report was untrue.
TechCrunch apologized to its readers, both owning up to the error and appearing to take a shot at PR Web in the process.
"We were wrong on this post, for not following up with Google and the other company involved but posting rather than ... waiting on a solid confirmation beforehand from either source," read an editor's note atop the original post. "We apologize to our readers, to the companies involved, and we'll be sure to act in a more responsible manner for future stories, rather than trusting the word of a website that doesn't necessarily hold itself up to any journalistic standards."
Forbes and Reuters were among the other news outlets that reported the fake purchase, as were popular tech sites PC Magazine, The Next Web, Business Insider, Engadget, VentureBeat, The Verge and GigaOM. Other outlets, like MSNBC and USA Today, ran the Associated Press account.

Is Asia on cusp of space race?
By Ramy Inocencio, for CNN
updated 8:20 PM EST, Wed January 30, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
'Asia already in space race in some sense', says ICG's Daniel Pinkston
China, India have moon and Mars ambitions in 2013
Space race is proxy for arms race but 'could be worse', says Pinkston
South Korea rocket launch will not be condemned, says Peace Institute's Cheong
Hong Kong (CNN) -- The United States and the Soviet Union defined the world's first space race, but following South Korea's successful orbital rocket launch this week, it appears Asia -- particularly North Asia -- is the world's new epicenter for space rivalries in the 21st century.
"In some sense we are already there," says Daniel Pinkston, North East Asia Deputy Project Director for International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. "The Chinese have been very active... (also) Japan, North and South Korea. It's quite a competitive atmosphere."
The race will only ratchet up later this year.
In the second half of 2013, China will shoot for the moon with the aim of landing a rover vehicle on its surface; building on exploration milestones in 2003 and 2012 with the first man, then woman, in space. India plans to send an unmanned probe into Mars orbit this November.
South Korea launches its own rocket
North Korea's threats annoy China
Last July, Japan's government set up the country's first-ever Cabinet-level office for space strategy to oversee the country's space policy and related budget.
And on December 12 last year, North Korea joined the space club -- ahead of more technologically advanced South Korea -- with the successful launch of an Unha-3 rocket that placed an Earth observation satellite into orbit. It was a controversial first for the poverty-stricken nation, yet the country has vowed more launches.
South Korea's own successful rocket launch makes it the fifth Asian country -- and just the 13th nation in the world -- to break the bonds of Earth.
Space race as proxy for arms race? However, many see the space race as a proxy for a regional arms race.
"Many people will say that everybody is already running -- that it's already on," says Pinkston. "That said it's all relative."
"It could be much worse. If you look at the percentage of GDP that's allocated militarily it could be much higher. For Japan, it's stayed under 1% of GDP. South Korea's is about 2.5%. North (Korea) spends a lot, but there's no official number out. It's secret and difficult to ascertain."
South Korea's launch of the Naro-3 -- and its 800-kilometer range -- could add to regional tension. If used to propel a ballistic missile, it could reach most of East Asia. And with South Korea a strong Asian ally of the United States, other regional competitors may be rattled.
"China's main concern is that South Korea will be (used as) one of the (United States') first containment strategies," says Cheong Wooksik, Director of South Korea's Peace Network in Seoul. "South Korea's extension of the range of its ballistic missiles will be used to check or contain the rise of China."
A South Korean ballistic missile can now hit most of China's main eastern seaboard cities including the financial hub of Shanghai, the northeastern port cities of Tianjin and Qingdao as well as the Chinese capital of Beijing.
From apprehension to anger Seoul's successful launch may be viewed with apprehension if not outright anger by its regional neighbors.
"North Korea will strongly condemn South Korea's launch," says Cheong of Peace Network, but adds that Pyongyang does not feel the international community would condemn South Korea's launch.
"North Korea will ask 'Why does the international community differentiate (between the launches of the two countries)'. It will consider that the world is applying a double standard," says Cheong.
On January 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning North Korea's rocket launch from December and expanded existing U.N. sanctions.
With China, analysts believe the country's official response to South Korea's launch will be more muted but that North Korea will pressure Beijing to bend to its own line.
"North Korea will try to exploit the South's launch as hypocritical so they will pressure China to take that position...to share that view that this is an example of the hypocrisy and inequality of (this month's) U.N. Security Council Resolution 2087," says Pinkston.
China was a signatory to that resolution, as was Japan.
"I don't think they (Japan) will say anything in that the South Korean program has been transparent," adds Pinkston.
"They've conducted themselves in a way that's non-threatening. South Korea does not have a nuclear weapons program. It has signed all the non-proliferation treaties."
But Cheong of South Korea's Peace Network disagrees.
"I don't think Japan will welcome (the) South Korean launch," he says. "South Korea and Japan have many issues including (a maritime) territorial dispute. Japan's fundamental concern is that South Korea becomes stronger and stronger. South Korea's launch may, at least in small part, spur Japan's rearmament."
'Fully competitive' Looking to the future, the historical lack of cooperation between Asia's orbit-reaching nations alludes more to competition than camaraderie.
"There's been some cooperation... I know Japan has launched one satellite at least for South Korea," says Pinkston. "But in most other areas, science exploration, remote sensing, manned spacecraft... it's limited."
"If you look on a continuum of 'full cooperation' to 'fully competitive' it's more leaning towards competitive."

How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'
By Arion McNicoll, for CNN
updated 7:42 AM EDT, Thu October 3, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
Since the early twentieth century life expectancy has improved in most parts of the world. But what if life could be extended past its current boundaries? In this gallery, CNN Labs takes a look at some of the current research being done into life extension. First up, cryonics -- a discipline where a person's body is preserved in low temperatures, often using liquid nitrogen, in the hope of resuscitating them in the future. Here, the head of the Russian cryonics firm KrioRus, Danila Medvedev, looks inside a low-temperature human storage unit just outside Moscow.
Extremely low temperatures are also used in cryotherapy -- a medical treatment that has gained currency with a number of international sports teams. Here, French soccer player Franck Ribery is immersed in a cryotherapy tank, subjecting the body to temperatures as low as minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius). Cryotherapy aims to decrease pain and inflammation and aid healing. Nanotechnology is a relatively new discipline that some scientists hope will have multiple applications to healthcare. Ray Kurzweil, an American futurist says that in his view by the 2020s, it may become possible to deploy tiny robots (or 'nanobots') through the body to overcome the problems of incorrect DNA replication -- one of the central causes of aging. In this photo, a student in the nanotechnology research and education center at the University of South Florida, looks through a microscope.
Early research into the effects of growth hormones on mice suggests various kinds of hormonal treatment may help to increase life expectancy. It is not yet known whether the results will be transferable to humans, but some hormone therapies have already made it to market.
Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have been experimenting with stem cell treatments, injecting rapidly aging mice with a shot of young stem cells to make them live dramatically longer, healthier lives. "Our experiments showed that mice that have progeria, a disorder of premature aging, were healthier and lived longer after an injection of stem cells from young, healthy animals," Dr Laura Niedernhofer who led the experiment told Science Daily. "That tells us that stem cell dysfunction is a cause of the changes we see with aging."
According to a report by Global Industry Analysts the global anti-aging products market will be worth $291.9 billion by 2015. Every year in the U.S. alone, those fearing the inevitable signs of aging invest over $50 billion in skin care solutions. One of the more effective services is skin rejuvenation therapy or photorejuvenation in which a laser is used to induce controlled wounds on the skin, which then heals by creating new, wrinkle-free cells.
The premise behind "mind uploading" is that if you can't keep your body, at least you can keep your brain. Some might even see this as the ideal. Extensive research is underway: The process would involve the precise mapping of a conscious mind onto a computer, allowing it to be reused, either in a humanoid robot or biological body. The Brain Preservation Foundation is offering a prize to promote exploration in this field. It calls for scientists to try and fully map a mouse brain and then a larger animal brain in such a way that could be used to "reboot" a mind in virtual space.
Telomeres are the ends of a chromosome that protect cells against degradation. According to researchers if we can work out a way to preserve telomeres, then we would be another step closer to defeating aging. Dr Aziz Aboobaker from Nottingham University's School of Biology, said: "Usually when stem cells divide -- to heal wounds, or during reproduction or for growth -- they start to show signs of aging. This means that the stem cells are no longer able to divide and so become less able to replace exhausted specialized cells in the tissues of our bodies. Our aging skin is perhaps the most visible example of this effect."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Google's new company Calico will 'tackle aging and illness'
Many believe that Calico will take a 'big-data' approach to speed the way to health care discoveries
Exploratory disciplines including cryonics, cloning and nanotechnology hope to extend human life
(CNN) -- It is an age-old question: will humankind ever defeat old age?
Plenty of skin care companies would like us to believe so. And now, the multinational tech giant Google would like us to think it might be possible too.
Last month Google announced a new medical company called Calico, whose explicit aim is to take on aging itself. But what will Google's approach be? And what other research into prolonging life already exists?
With its proliferation of businesses, products and services, it would be easy to forget that not so very long ago Google was just a search engine. Today, offshoots of the sprawling global corporation can be found researching self-driving cars, developing their own smart phones and tablets and even launching giant balloons into near space.

To really make a difference in human health you need to tackle the aging processJoão Pedro de Magalhães, biologist
Calico -- or the California Life Company -- has been set up to research subjects related to aging and its associated diseases. Announcing Calico at a media briefing, Google said that the new and independent company will largely focus on age-attendant conditions such as Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease.
Larry Page, Google's ever youthful CEO said: "Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, I believe we can improve millions of lives."
But the question is, what will Calico actually do? At the moment the company isn't giving much detail away: "(Incoming CEO Arthur Levinson) and I are excited about tackling aging and illness," Page wrote in his Google+ blog post. But repeated requests from CNN to interview either Page or Levinson were politely declined.

In the absence of any real information, many commentators have speculated that Calico will pursue a 'big-data' approach to health: gathering massive amounts of information from patients and 'crunching it' to help speed the way to health care discoveries. Some have suggested that Calico's new CEO will take the view that the best way to tackle aging is to focus on preventing diseases.
Aubrey de Grey
The goal of Calico is to keep people healthy irrespective of their age, and ill-health is the main cause of death, so increased longevity will be an inevitable and excellent side-effect of such work.Aubrey de Grey, Chief Science Officer of SENS Foundation
Aubrey de Grey, an expert in the field of regenerative medicine, told CNN that it is too soon to speculate on what Google's approach will be: "in relation to Calico, I think it's vital to keep in mind that there is essentially no concrete information about their planned direction and emphasis, and any guess that they will take a heavily data-driven approach is no more than a guess."
However, he does think that Calico will not limit its focus to a single disease: "The statements from Page and Levinson thus far indicate quite strongly that the emphasis will not be just cancer, or even just a range of specific diseases, but will be 'aging itself': Page in particular has highlighted the paltry longevity gains that would arise even from totally eliminating cancer."
João Pedro de Magalhães, a Portuguese biologist who leads the Integrative Genomics of Aging group at the University of Liverpool, agrees: "From what I've read, I don't think the company will mostly focus on cancer. In the Time interview Larry Page clearly states that solving cancer is 'not as big an advance as you might think'. This is reminiscent of what experts studying aging have been saying for a while, which is that to really make a difference in human health and longevity you need to tackle the aging process rather than individual age-related diseases."

So where might Calico's focus lie? A broad range of technologies and therapies that promise life extension through different means are currently being researched and tested. CNN Labs takes a look across the scientific landscape to bring you the view from the front line of the war against aging.
Cryonics
Cryonics is a process where the body -- or occasionally just the head -- is suspended in liquid nitrogen to 'preserve' it indefinitely. The idea is that in the future the body will be able to be resuscitated and brought back to life.
Once the preserve of celebrities and multimillionaires, cryonics is now gaining traction among the broader public. Several months ago, The Sunday Times reported that three senior staff at Oxford University have signed up to have their bodies frozen with two U.S.-based cyonics organizations: the Cryonics Institute and the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.

The cost of cryonics can vary wildly. The lowest price at the Cryonics Institute is reportedly $28,000 for 'cryopreservation'; Alcor Life charges customers up to $200,000 for similar services. But does it work?
The Cryonics Institute underline on their website that, as yet, their treatments are based on projections of technology to come rather than present day science: "We firmly believe that with the incredible advances being made in nanotechnology, medicine and science today, cryonics has the same potential to become an everyday reality in the not-so-distant future ... The goal of cryonics is to halt (the 'dying') process as quickly as possible after legal death, giving future doctors the best possible chance of reviving the patient by repairing or replacing damaged tissues, or even entire organs using advanced computer, nanotech and medical equipment and procedures".

The related field of cryotherapy has gained currency in some quarters of athletics, with coaches immersing their athletes in cryotherapy chambers during or after exercise in a bid to aid training and heal injuries. The French soccer team used cryotherapy during the European Cup in 2012, and the Wales rugby union squad use it as well. Cryotherapeutic chambers expose players to very low temperatures -- around minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) -- for short periods. Some theorists believe that doing so can help speed the body's recovery, but others say that the evidence is incomplete.
Self-healing worms and telomeres
In 2012 a group of scientists at Nottingham University discovered that a species of flatworm -- the Planarian worm --can divide 'potentially forever' and thus heal itself. Some researchers hope that the discovery will provide fresh insight into how it may be possible to alleviate aging in human cells.
Dr Aziz Aboobaker from Nottingham University's School of Biology, said: "Usually when stem cells divide -- to heal wounds, or during reproduction or for growth -- they start to show signs of aging. This means that the stem cells are no longer able to divide and so become less able to replace exhausted specialized cells in the tissues of our bodies. Our aging skin is perhaps the most visible example of this effect. Planarian worms and their stem cells are somehow able to avoid the aging process and to keep their cells dividing."
According to researchers looking at the worm, the key may be in understanding the function of telomeres -- the ends of a chromosome that protect cells against degradation.
In 2009 three scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on how telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation.
One theory suggests that if we can work out a way to preserve telomeres, then we would be another step closer to defeating aging.

Cloning and body part replacement

Another major area of investigation is looking into organ creation and replacement. Many people die due to organ failure, but imagine if you could just create your own new liver and replace a faulty one?
Scientists have already successfully implanted functioning lab-grown kidneys into rats. If the therapy could be successfully (and affordably) replicated for humans, it could help overcome the significant organ donor shortages that persist in many countries. Early work into creating organs using 3D printers has also yielded promising results.
Nanotechnology
Organ replacement will probably only ever be part of the solution however. Many scientists believe that longevity through repairing the human body requires a broader focus than just replacing individual parts.
Ray Kurzweil, an American author, inventor and futurist argues in his book The Singularity is Near that by the 2020s, nanotechnology may be able to help cure disease. Kurzweil says that deploying tiny robots (or 'nanobots') in the body could help overcome the problems of incorrect DNA replication -- one of the central causes of aging.
de Grey says that nanotechnological research is interesting, but that he believes it is further away from finding a solution to aging than some other treatments: "I pay attention to molecular manufacturing (the discipline that coined the term "nanotechnology" but then effectively had it stolen by the field of nanomaterials), but I think its relevance to medical interventions, whether in aging or otherwise, still seems likely to be further off than the more traditionally biomedical work".
So will Google's new company discover a workable solution to aging and death? Only time will tell.

Dressed in pink, hundreds mourn Colleen Ritzer, slain Massachusetts teacher
By Alexandra Field and Rande Iaboni, CNN
updated 9:16 PM EDT, Mon October 28, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
400 students were among the estimated 1,000 people at Colleen Ritzer's funeral
"Colleen's gift was that of inspiration," her cousin said in a eulogy
The math teacher was allegedly killed by one of her students last week
(CNN) -- The church where Colleen Ritzer's family worshiped was filled with mourners for the slain Massachusetts math teacher's funeral Monday.
"You can see the effect she has had and how the community has bonded together to commemorate and celebrate Colleen's life," Ritzer's cousin, Gina McDaniel, said in her eulogy.
About 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects to Ritzer, who was killed allegedly by one of her own students -- 14-year-old Philip Chism -- a week earlier.
"Colleen loved her brother and sister very much and always did her best to be a sister, friend, and mentor to them," McDaniel said. "She is the daughter that every parent hopes their children will become once they grow up."
Many mourners wore pink clothing -- Ritzer's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of Andover's St. Augustine Church.
"Colleen's gift was that of inspiration," McDaniel said. "In such a short period of time, one person has made a world of difference."
The Rev. Peter G. Gori, in his homily, offered advice on how to approach Ritzer's death. "Perhaps we should ask not why, or even how she died, but rather why and how did she live," Gori said.
Ritzer's parents, brother and sister followed the hearse to a private burial for family and close friends.
Ritzer, 24, was found dead in woods near the campus where she taught Tuesday morning. Authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing.
Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago may shed light on Chism's past. The documents showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of "prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."
The documents, however, said the parents were attempting to reconcile.
Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida.
Blaine told CNN affiliate WKRN in Nashville, Tennessee, last week that something may have provoked his nephew. "Might could have been upset," Blaine said. "You know -- teenagers go through that. He's 14, he's growing up still. That's the only thing that I can imagine. I can't imagine anything else because he's like a storybook kid -- a perfect family."
Chism's mother, Diana Chism, released a statement through her son's attorney saying her "heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer."
"Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear," the statement said. "She is struggling to understand this."
CNN's Sheila Steffen and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.
