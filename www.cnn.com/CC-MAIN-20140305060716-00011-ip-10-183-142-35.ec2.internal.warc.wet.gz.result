Greenfield: The curse of congressional leaders?By Jeff Greenfield CNN Senior Analyst

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the most powerful leaders of Congress is leaving under fire. It's not only a big story in itself; it's also a sign of a striking change in our political process.Once upon a time, the most powerful members of Congress were all but immune to challenge. But in more recent years, the watchword has come from Shakespeare: "uneasy lies the head that wears a crown."As speaker of the House at the start of the 20th century, Republican Joe Cannon - "Uncle Joe," they called him - used and abused so much power that the House revolted in 1910, stripping him of some of his clout.It took 79 years for another House speaker -- Jim Wright - to be brought into check. He resigned his post, and his House seat, after Republican back-benchers, led by Newt Gingrich, leveled a series of ethics charges against him.Democratic Majority Whip Tony Coelho, whose finances became a target of inquiry, also left the House in 1989.Wright's successor, Tom Foley, fared no better. Not only did he lose his speaker's post when Republicans won the House in 1994, he also lost his own seat - the first speaker to suffer such an indignity since 1860.His successor was Gingrich, who led a series of ethics attacks against Democrats. But Gingrich himself was the target of an ethics investigation over fundraising; he was forced to pay a large fine, was almost ousted by his fellow Republicans in a coup ... and after Republicans suffered losses in the 1998 midterms, Gingrich resigned.His successor was supposed to be Bob Livingston, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. But in late 1998, in the midst of impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, Livingston - facing sexual misconduct allegations of his own - announced to the House that he would resign.And the Senate hasn't provided security for its leaders lately, either. Republican Trent Lott was forced from his post in 2002, after suggesting that the country might have been better off had it elected segregationist Strom Thurmond as president.And in 2004, Tom Daschle, a Democrat, became the first Senate party leader in more than 50 years to lose a re-election effort.It really is a measure of how Washington has changed; the one-time assumption of civility, of political adversaries remaining friends and colleagues after-hours, is pretty much gone now. The idea of not challenging a key leader of the opposition party is considered hopelessly out of date, especially given the relatively narrow margins of control in both houses.It was a lot easier for Republicans and Democrats to be civil when both parties knew that Democratic control of Congress was more or less a given. Now, if the other side thinks it can bring you down, it doesn't matter how high up you are. Story Tools

Nazi war crimes trial 'could be last of its kind'Story Highlights Expert: Trial of Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk could be last of its kind Leading Nazis prosecuted at Nuremberg but many lesser Nazis escaped justice Struggle to prosecute Nazis influenced creation of International Criminal Court ICC has remit to probe war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO By Simon Hooper CNN	(CNN) -- The forthcoming trial in Germany of John Demjanjuk could be the last occasion on which a Nazi war crimes suspect faces prosecution. German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp. But the legacy of decades-old efforts to bring the perpetrators of World War II atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily, according to a leading war crimes prosecutor. Many leading Nazis such as Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer were prosecuted by the main allies -- the U.S., the Soviet Union and the UK -- shortly after the end of the war at the Nuremberg Trials. South African judge Richard Goldstone, formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, told CNN that Nuremberg had been the "first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable" and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law. Yet many lower-ranking servants of the Nazi regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes, assuming new identities, fleeing Europe or even finding employment with Soviet or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the Cold War, according to Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. "These murderers walked into small cities and killed men, women and children and walked away without a trace," Hier told CNN. "The sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute Nazi war criminals after Nuremberg, and had (countries) put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice." But Goldstone said that the creation in 2002 of the International Criminal Court marked a "very important step forward" to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten. While previous tribunals investigating crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were ad hoc creations set up by the U.N. Security Council, the ICC is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Goldstone said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than Nuremberg had been, recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants. "Modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at Nuremberg," he said. The jurisdiction of the ICC is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the U.S., Russia or China. But Goldstone said the court was "moving quickly" towards universal ratification and said U.S. President Barack Obama's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the ICC than predecessor George W. Bush had been in office. "I'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to," he said.

Nazi suspect Demjanjuk arrives in Germany
Nazi guard deported for war crimes trial
High court denies deportation stay for accused Nazi guard Germany refuses to halt Demjanjuk transfer
Demjanjuk, an 89-year-old native Ukrainian deported from the U.S. this week, is alleged to have been a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people. Hier said Demjanjuk's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the U.S. since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial. An Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on U.S. soil, while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired U.S. citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their Nazi pasts. But he said Demjanjuk's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large. "You can't just have a trial with documents. You have to have living witnesses," Hier said. "Most of those witnesses are very old, most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial." But Hier said it was very important that former Nazis were pursued to the grave, living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them. "(Nazi hunter) Simon Wiesenthal talked about two kinds of justice. There is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial. But there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door," he said. "Every Nazi war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door."

Cancer 'iron man' puts hope in drug trials By Wayne Drash, CNN Drug trials give hope to cancer patientSTORY HIGHLIGHTSJohn Cossman has been battling cancer for eight yearsHe turned to clinical trials to stay alive after regular treatment options ran outHe underwent his fourth clinical study this summer; he's one of 16 people in the studyBefore FDA approval, a drug goes through yearslong testing (CNN) -- John Cossman's friends call him cancer's iron man. He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago. The cancer has spread to his right lung, his right arm and his brain. Four years ago, he ran out of treatment options -- every available form of chemo had been used. If he wanted to live, he'd have to enter clinical trials. "How long do I have here?" he asked his doctor. "With treatment, two years," the doctor responded. "Without treatment, six months." Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check. He's on his fourth clinical trial. Three times, he's heard bad news. He tries not to think about that as he slides into the giant machine that envelopes his body. He thinks instead of his wife and 13-year-old daughter, adopted from China. Life offers too much to give in. "I will know when there's not a whole helluva lot of time left. And I don't feel that way right now. ... If what I'm doing can help somebody down the line, then it's worthwhile." Holding disease at bay Cossman is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cerulean Pharma. The company hopes to add another 20 patients to the trial in laboratories in Arizona, California and New Mexico. The test drug is in the second phase of a three-phase process that takes years before the Food and Drug Administration even considers whether to bring the drug to market. Cossman is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, there are more than 96,500 trials under way in 174 countries. Cossman learned of drug trials through his oncologist --"otherwise, I'd know nothing about them." He wants to make others "aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available," he says. "People need to be aware, though, that they are rolling the dice." In this case, the chemotherapy drug, known as CRLX101, is placed inside nanoparticles -- tiny particles just slightly bigger than molecules -- that are delivered intravenously every two weeks to patients. The hope is that the nanoparticles target the cancer and release chemotherapy inside the tumors while shielding healthy tissue from the toxicity of chemo, says Oliver Fetzer, the president and CEO of Cerulean. By doing that, the drug homes in on the tumors and, at the same time, patients can maintain a decent quality of life. "You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay," Fetzer says. Adds John Ryan, Cerulean's chief medical officer: "The true measure of success in oncology is extending the length of time someone stays alive." Yet this drug is far from market. The FDA can put a stop to a clinical trial at any moment if unexpected safety issues arise. "We keep in touch with the FDA constantly throughout the clinical trial," Ryan says. "There's a constant interchange with the FDA, particularly with respect to the safety of the drug and anything unexpected." If what I'm doing can help somebody down the line, then it's worthwhile.--John Cossman

It takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to FDA approval, said Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, director of The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent nonprofit research group. According to a 2007 study by the center, a drug company spends about $1.3 billion per approved product, a figure that includes costs of failed test drugs. When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms. Success is often measured in small steps. "What you're normally looking at in this patient population, if you can keep it at bay for two months, you are actually doing quite well, because the patients are so far along" with cancer, says Fetzer. "It's a rule of thumb at best, because every disease is different, every patient is different." 'I went through every type of chemo' It started with a lump in his throat eight years ago. Cossman thought it would go away. His doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to Cossman because he's never been a heavy drinker or smoker. He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2½ months. He survived on a feeding tube for six months. The next three years would be cancer free. But in June 2005, a tumor popped up in his right lower lung. Chemo and radiation began again. The tumor was eliminated, yet a spot showed up again about a year later. "You get to a point where they can't radiate the lung any more." He still has breathing problems from the radiation to his lung. One chemo treatment clogged up his tear ducts. Another created a rash all over his body. "By June 2006," he says, "I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer. The chemo would either stop working or the side effects would be more detrimental to my health." His option: Die or enter clinical trials. The first study kept his tumors -- by that time he had four -- in check for about five months. To remain in a trial, tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent. A scan showed 22 percent growth. "You can't immediately go from one study to another. You have to be washed out for 30 days of chemicals and radiation." In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm. He soon was having vision problems and started losing his hair. The man who had already endured so much was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In December, he underwent surgery to remove it. His third study earlier this year did not work. "You hold your breath, hoping that it's working. Then, when the CT scan comes back and it shows the tumors are growing, it's really frustrating." "Do I get depressed? Yes. But do I want to give up? No," he says. So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma. Fighting on Dressed in a medical gown, Cossman awaits the CT scan. He's gently glided into the large tube. The tests take just a few minutes. He doesn't look for sympathy. He has no complaints about what he's been dealt. In fact, he celebrates life because "it's been good to me." His little girl was 5 when he was diagnosed. She's now 13. He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them. He wants others who are suffering to be more proactive -- to ask their doctors about all their options. Slowly, he emerges from his CT scan. The waiting for results begins. He heads home. He tries not to get his hopes up. His phone rings after a few hours. On the other end of the line, his doctor delivers the best news he's had in more than a year. His cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent, enough to remain on the study. Yet the good news is only temporary. A few weeks later, blood shows up in Cossman's bladder and a new tumor is found on his back. His doctor advises getting him off the study. Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon. "You're always on a roller-coaster when you have cancer. You have some successes and a lot of failures." Does he still have the fight to live? "Definitely," he says.CNN's Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report.

Theories abound on N. Korea attack By Andrew Salmon, For CNN The Koreas clashSTORY HIGHLIGHTSOpinions vary widely among North Korea watchersTheories include a show of strength and a miscalculated reaction to an apparent threatAnother expert says the North is frustrated by being ignored diplomaticallyYet another theory: Pyongyang needs constant military tension to unite its people
RELATED TOPICS

South Korea
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- With South Korea returning to an uneasy calm down after a fatal artillery attack on an offshore island Tuesday, North Korean watchers in Seoul were scrambling to explain what may have been the thinking behind Pyongyang's fatal attack. Experts offered a range of opinions, saying that recent events could be a show of strength designed to bolster the reputation of the successor to the state's leadership, and suggesting that North Korea's recent actions fit into a predictable pattern of provocation. Others, however, warned that North Korea's military brinksmanship will continue regardless of who is in charge in Pyongyang, and warn that if South Korea does retaliate, it could ignite a potentially lethal --- and uncontrollable -- cycle of escalation.

"Our judgment is that North Korea carried out the attack to consolidate the succession process in the country by showing off the leadership of Kim Jong Un," South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Defense Minister Kim Tae-young as saying in a meeting with lawmakers. Kim Jong Un, the third son of ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, was named a four-star general just before a rare Workers Party Congress in September, and was named to the party's powerful military committee. He has since been seen widely alongside his father and senior generals, leading North Korea watchers to believe that a succession process is now under way, designed to place the younger Kim in his father's place on the latter's passing. South Korean pundits agreed with the minister. "The first reason for this attack is the instability of Kim Jong Un. That is the fundamental reason," said Young Howard, who heads the NGO Open Radio for North Korea, which maintains a network of contacts north of the two Koreas' demilitarized zone. "Constant military tensions help him to keep the support of his military, and to unite the North Korean people." Others suggested that it is the militaristic nature of North Korean society, rather than the current succession process that is the key to its behavior. "I think there is a danger in the West's tendency to interpret all North Korean actions in the context of topical events, in other words, by saying everything North Korea is doing is aimed at ensuring a smooth succession for Kim Jong Un," said Brian Myers, author of "The Cleanest Race," an authoritative study of North Korean propaganda. "This is implying that once Kim Jong Un is firmly seated in power, this behavior is not going to continue, and I think that is dangerous. If you are a military first regime, you flex your muscles; this is what North Korea is, and this is what it does." While some in the South had hoped that Kim Jong Il's successor might be reform-minded, recent events, and Kim's strong identification with the North Korean People's Army, suggests a continuation -- or possibly a buttressing -- of the regime's current Songeun, or "military first" policy. Still, the apparently calibrated pattern of recent North Korean provocations --- last week, it was revealed that North Korea had displayed a new and well-equipped uranium enrichment plant to visiting U.S. scientists -- is predictable, another expert said. "The North Koreans asked in late summer for a resumption of aid and essentially they were ignored, so now they are sending a message to South Korea --- by shelling an island -- and to United States --- with their uranium plant --- that they are not withering away, they are still here and still dangerous," said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Kookmin University. "They chose the soft spots of both sides, so this is a way to a send a message to both the White House and the Blue House: "We are here, we are crazy, we are dangerous. And our last paycheck is long overdue." Read more from Andrei Lankov The Blue House is the South Korean presidential residence. Alternatively, North Korea could have felt legitimately threatened, said another expert, citing the fact that Pyongyang had demanded the halt to a South Korean firing exercise off their shared coast --- the South Korean side refused to heed the demand -- before it opened fire. "The North Koreans sound like communist lunatics, and fanatics, when in fact most soldiers in the North Korea army are tending rabbits and farming crops," said Michael Breen, a biographer of Kim Jong Il. "There is good reason for them to be nervous: There is firing off their coast. They have to make a judgment call, so they start, and the whole world thinks they are bad guys, and that Kim Jong Un is strengthening its position, but it could have been a miscalculation." Tuesday's attack was the second time this year that the North Korea has introduced a weapons system that has been unused on the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea says. In March, a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, was sunk in what a South Korean investigation says was a North Korean submarine torpedo attack. The North has denied sinking the warship. Tuesday's artillery exchange was the first such since an armistice, rather than a peace treaty, halted the fighting in summer 1953. While South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has demanded massive retaliation should North Korea repeat its actions, that raises a risk of dropping the peninsula into a potentially uncontrollable vortex of retaliation and counter-retaliation. Still, there are limits to the country's forbearance. "The South has been pretty tolerant, but how much can you tolerate?" asked Dan Pinkston, who heads the International Crisis Group's Seoul office. "I don't know what the red line is, but if you don't retaliate, this is giving a green light" to North Korea. Should retaliation take place, could it unleash Korean War II? "I think it is unlikely, I think it will cool off," Pinkston said. "But it is dangerous."

Preventing tween behavior problems
By Linda Rodgers, Parenting.com
updated 7:43 AM EDT, Fri April 20, 2012
"Teenagers live up or down to our expectations. If you expect negative behavior, kids will behave accordingly," says Ginsburg.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Attributing all irritating behavior to hormones may be a cop-out In a study, kids whose parents were permissive were three times as likely to drink heavily
Kids who are involved in extracurricular activities are less likely to use drugs
(Parenting.com) -- Last summer while we were visiting family, my then 12-year-old daughter, Anna, and her cousins went to a neighbor's BBQ to hang out with their friends under the watchful (or so we thought) eyes of the adults there.
Less than an hour later, they were back at the house. What happened, we asked? "Some kids were sneaking beer and getting drunk, so we decided to leave," the girls said.
Yes, we were relieved -- and grateful that our kids told us what happened. Still, I couldn't help but worry: Could Anna resist the same temptations when she was a teenager? After all, at 14, I was smoking, drinking, and going out with the biggest pothead at school (who, luckily for my mother, dumped me after a few weeks).
Sure, I came out all right in the end, but who wants to go through the lying and sneaking around again -- this time from a mom's perspective?
It also doesn't help calm a parent's fears when every stat about teen behavior is scarier than the last (like the ones from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that one in every four teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease and more than half of all teens have engaged in oral sex).
Your tween is probably already spending more time with his pals and less time with you. Sooner or later, he'll face pressure to try a beer (or five), a joint, or "hook up" with a girl. So are there things you can do now to prepare your tween for that?
You bet, say moms and experts. The key: building a close relationship. "That way, you'll have more resources to draw upon later, especially during conflicts," says Christy M. Buchanan, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Wake Forest University and the mom of teens.
"It's completely normal for kids to spread their wings and test their limits," adds Kenneth R. Ginsburg, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of Building Resilience in Children and Teens. "They need to figure out who they are -- and who they are has to be different from you." Although you can't control the conflicts, you can maximize the chances that your soon-to-be teen won't get into the really bad stuff. Here's how:
Parenting.com: 8 discipline mistakes even good parents make
Raise your expectations
"Teenagers live up or down to our expectations," says Dr. Ginsburg, a dad of teenage twins. "If you expect negative behavior, kids will behave accordingly. But if you expect compassion and thoughtfulness, that's what you'll get."
Sounds too good to be true, right? Research even bears it out. A study by Buchanan published in the Journal of Research on Adolescence surveyed 250 sixth- and seventh-graders and their moms and found that the moms who expected their kids to take risks and test limits later on tended to get what they bargained for.
And while parental expectations are just one of many influences on a teenager's behavior, Buchanan says raising yours can make a difference.
Why? Buchanan has several theories. First, our assumptions may tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies because of the way we interact with our kids, she says. So if you think it's inevitable that your child will get into trouble, then you're probably less likely to believe that what you do matters -- and you may not try as hard to monitor or discipline him.
Buchanan also thinks that parents with low expectations could be sending their kids that message, either subtly or explicitly. For example, if your tween hears you say "Drinking is something all teenagers do eventually," when he finds himself in a situation where he's being pressured, he may be more likely to give in because he wants to be like everyone else.
Don't blame it all on hormones It's true that older tweens and teens are hormonal -- and that their brains won't develop the ability to control impulsive behavior until they're in their early 20s. But Buchanan says attributing all irritating behavior to hormones may be a cop-out -- the effects are small for most kids, and there are often more important causes.
When one of her teens gets grumpy, Buchanan tries to see it as a reaction to something else (academic stress, say, or a problem with pals) and asks if anything's going on. "You need to say to yourself, there must be a reason for this behavior, and I need to take the time to ask," she notes.
Of course, we all have our bad days when we snap back when barked at. But you can get back on track. Ask your tween: "You don't seem like yourself today. Is something going on?" Maybe your tween will respond with "Nothing," but at least you've shown her you care enough to listen.
Parenting.com: The 6 most annoying things kids say
Find the right balance
You've heard the drill since your tween was a tot: Kids need reasonable limits -- and if they break the rules, there should be consequences. Discipline becomes even more important as kids get older.
Teens who behave badly tend to have parents who are either too permissive or too strict. Slacker parents give their teens a long leash, which just gives them too many opportunities to get into trouble. And overly strict parents clamp down too hard, so kids rebel.
Need evidence? A recent study on drinking published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that parenting style affected how much a kid drank. The kids whose parents were permissive were three times as likely to drink heavily; those whose parents were too strict had double the risk.
Those with the lowest risk? Teens who enjoyed a warm relationship with their parents but were held accountable for their actions. Other studies have found the same is true for sexual activity -- the more involved and supportive you are and the more you set limits, the less likely your child is to have sex at a young age.
For instance, once Anna hit sixth grade and was allowed to walk home after school by herself, I realized I had to start setting rules -- otherwise, she'd go off to a friend's house without permission.
So now she has to let me know where she's going; if she goes elsewhere, she has to text first to check in. So far, so good, and her reward has been more freedom to go places alone with her BFFs, like the movies.
And that's how it should be, says Buchanan: "Rule setting is never black-and-white: You have to give your child the freedom she deserves based on past behavior." And if your kid breaks that trust, set stricter rules.
Stay connected
Yes, it's hard to drag your tween away from the demands on her time (friends, homework, perfecting her hair), but that's why you need to schedule get-togethers. While family dinners are great, if you only have time to eat together a couple of nights a week, that's good enough, says Dr. Ginsburg.
Then find other ways to check in: take a walk together, grab a Starbucks, go outside and shoot hoops. "I find that Taylor is more willing to talk when we don't have eye contact," says Leah Beckman of Boston, about her 10-year-old. "So when we're in the car, or walking to school, or sitting at the restaurant counter, he's more willing to share information."
What if your tween doesn't want to talk when you do? Try to be available when she is -- for example, knock on her door if you see the light on late at night, says Dr. Ginsburg. And let her know you'll listen without lecturing. "You want to be a good sounding board -- not solve her problems," he adds.
Parenting.com: How to raise a grateful child
Help them handle stress From worrying about tests and team tryouts to stressing about oil spills, kids are under a lot of pressure these days. "The things we worry about as parents -- the sex, drugs, drinking, and violence -- are often reactions to stress," says Dr. Ginsburg. "So you want to raise your child to have a wide repertoire of healthy coping skills."
One way to do that: Model them. If you drink and smoke when you're stressed, your child will think that's acceptable and copy your behavior as he gets older. Kids who have sex too early also tend to come from homes where the parents drink and smoke, according to the Institute of Marriage and Family Canada.
Keep them busy (Just not too busy)
Another stress buster: getting kids involved in an after-school activity they love, whether it's an art class or a spot on the soccer team. Studies show that kids who are involved in extracurricular activities are less likely to use drugs; and there's evidence that kids who do sports are less likely to smoke or drink -- and, in the case of girls, less likely to get pregnant.
"Any extracurricular activity usually has a caring adult to supervise, but sports also has the team aspect--kids who can act as good role models for one another," says Megan Bartlett, director of research for Up 2 Us, a nonprofit that encourages kids' participation in sports.
Plus, belonging to a team (or any activity, for that matter) can help boost a kid's self-confidence as he masters a new skill.
Natalie Mines of East Hills, New York, also credits sports for getting her oldest son, Alex, 13, in healthier shape. "I've read that it's the kids who have tons of free time who tend to get into trouble," she says.
Alex, who did track, cross-country, volleyball, and baseball last year, started eating better and staying away from junk food and fast food "with no prodding from me," says Mines, a mom of two boys.
Parenting.com: The best way to end homework hassles
Keep tabs on their friends
We often worry about the ways our kids' classmates can lead them astray, but friends can be a force for good, too -- getting one another involved in volunteering, say, or becoming better students.
"Encouraging and discouraging friendships can be tricky," says Megan Lotz of Boise, ID, a mom of three. "When Elizabeth, my oldest, wants to have a sleepover, we suggest one with a friend of hers we like, and we try to make it easier by offering to drive the girl over or take everyone out for pizza."
Lotz doesn't actively discourage friendships with the pals she doesn't approve of ("that just causes angst and resentment"), but she may put some rules on the relationship -- like telling Elizabeth she can see her buddy at home but can't go over to that friend's house.
Social media is another way to keep track. Lotz is Elizabeth's Facebook friend: "I promised never to embarrass her, but it does help me gain insight into my daughter's friends and classmates."
So there is some good news: "Teens don't suddenly turn into aliens at thirteen, despite the hormones and stresses of growing up," says Buchanan. That doesn't mean your child won't make a bad decision. But it does mean he'll be more likely to tell you when he's feeling pressured.
Your kid's been caught shoplifting, smoking, or cheating on a test. Now what? Buchanan's advice:
Lay down the law. Tell your tween why you disapprove, what the dangers are ("Smoking harms your lungs, so you'll get winded when you play soccer"), and why you don't want this to happen again.
Place the penalty. Come up with a reasonable consequence, such as taking away an enjoyable privilege (she can't go shopping with her buddies next weekend), but not so severe that you can't follow through.
Monitor her behavior. Stay rigorous about keeping track of her whereabouts and asking questions. Tell her: "As long as you have my trust, I'll give you more privileges. If you break it, I'll clamp down."
Praise honesty. If your child fesses up about a bad thing she did, hold off on the consequence for now and help her figure out ways to avoid the situation in the future.

North Carolina passes same-sex marriage ban, CNN projects
From the CNN Wire Staff
updated 11:04 AM EDT, Fri May 11, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Opponents admit loss, pledge to keep fighting Supporters serve wedding cake in celebration Amendment 1 would put an existing ban on same-sex marriage into the state constitution
Opponents say the measure is unnecessary and will have unforeseen consequences
(CNN) -- North Carolina voters have passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, CNN projects, putting a ban that already existed in state law into the state's charter.
With more than 2 million votes counted from Tuesday's referendum, supporters of the ban led opponents by a 61%-39% margin, according to figures from the State Board of Elections. Its backers celebrated by serving wedding cake to their supporters in a Raleigh ballroom.
Tami Fitzgerald, the head of Vote for Marriage NC, said she had been confident that "the people of North Carolina would rise up and vote to keep the opposition from redefining traditional marriage."
"We are not anti-gay, we are pro-marriage," she said. "And the point -- the whole point -- is simply that you don't rewrite the nature of God's design for marriage based on the demands of a group of adults."
Will Obama come out for gay marriage?
Pastor who advised punching boys speaks Sen. Lugar fights for political life
The amendment alters North Carolina's constitution to say that "marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state." Supporters argued that the amendment was needed to stop those trying to redefine marriage and ward off possible future actions of "activist judges."
Opponents called the measure redundant and warned it could result in jeopardizing domestic violence protections for women and affect couples' health benefits. Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat, also urged a no vote, arguing that writing a discriminatory provision into the state charter "is just plain wrong."
Jeremy Kennedy, campaign manager for the Coalition to Protect All North Carolina Families, acknowledged the loss and told opponents, "It's OK to grieve." But he urged advocates of same-sex marriage to keep fighting.
"All eyes in the nation are on us tonight, wondering not only how we came together to fight this epic campaign, but what is it going to leave behind -- what's going to happen to North Carolina after this," Kennedy said. "And I have to say that we are stronger for it. We are better for it. Our voices are louder now. We have courage like we've never had before."
"No" votes led in Charlotte, in the Triangle counties around Raleigh and in the Winston-Salem-Greensboro area, according to figures from the State Board of Elections. But it was winning by wide margins in rural counties and in the suburbs of Charlotte -- the home of famous evangelist Billy Graham, who endorsed the ballot measure last week.

Graham's endorsement was a rare move for a preacher who has typically avoided political fights. He took out full-page ads in 14 North Carolina newspapers touting his support for the measure, saying "the Bible is clear -- God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman."
On the other side, former President Bill Clinton opposed the amendment in a recording sent by phone to hundreds of thousands of North Carolina homes.
"So the real effect of the law is not to keep the traditional definition of marriage, you've already done that," Clinton says in the recording. "The real effect of the law will be to hurt families and drive away jobs."
The amendment also would strengthen the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue. Several municipalities in North Carolina provide benefits to same-sex couples, and Duke University law professor Kathryn Bradley said those rights could be lost with passage of the amendment.
Opinion: Obama keeps his conscience in the closet
Concerns over the measure also honed in on the potential for unintended consequences, she said, affecting issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence among unmarried couples because of the narrow definition of the new statute.
"Before domestic violence laws, we relied on criminal assault laws, which don't always protect against things like stalking," added Bradley, who says the measure could also affect heterosexual couples.
The state House and Senate voted in 2011 to put the amendment before state voters. Both chambers are Republican-controlled for the first time in the past 140 years.
Americans overall are closely split on the issue, according to a recent Gallup survey, with 50% of Americans believing same-sex couples should be allowed to wed -- up considerably from polls in past years. Another 48% say such marriages should not be legal.
Before Tuesday, 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue.
Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits same-sex couples to wed in that state as of January 1, 2013.

Source: CIA using Patriot Act to collect money-transfer data
By Evan Perez, CNN Justice Department Reporter
updated 4:34 PM EST, Fri November 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CIA collects bulk records on international money moves, says source
Source: The program is an outgrowth of terror-finance tracking programs
Most transactions are purely non-U.S., but some are to or from the United States
CIA says it doesn't comment on "alleged intelligence sources or methods"
Washington (CNN) -- The CIA is collecting bulk records on international money transfers, using the same Patriot Act legal authority that has become the center of controversy in U.S. surveillance programs, a source told CNN.
A person familiar with the program said the agency's efforts are an outgrowth of terror finance-tracking programs that were established in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and revealed that al Qaeda funded the hijackers using methods such as smuggled cash, money transfers, and credit and debit cards.
The Treasury Department and the National Security Agency have other programs that similarly focus on financial transaction data. The CIA program provides some redundancies intended to catch transactions that may not draw attention in other programs.
The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times first reported the existence of the CIA program Thursday night, saying it has sparked concerns from lawmakers.
The revelation comes amid debate in the United States over whether to pare back some surveillance in light of privacy concerns raised after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents describing secret spy programs.
The CIA program focuses on transfers that the agency believes could be the source of terrorism financing and that use services such as MoneyGram and Western Union. The vast majority are purely non-U.S. transactions, but it includes some transactions to or from the United States.
Such U.S.-related transactions could raise concerns about data of U.S. people, which the CIA is generally prohibited from collecting.
The court that oversees Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has established legal rules governing the CIA program, as it has with NSA surveillance programs, and requires evidence of a connection to potential terrorism before data belonging to U.S. people can be accessed, the person familiar with the program said. The agency works with the FBI to target potential financing of terrorism.
A U.S. intelligence official said any activity in such programs includes what the government calls "minimization procedures to protect U.S. person information" and court-approved restrictions on specially trained analysts who can query the data, and on the length of time such data is allowed to be retained.
The CIA said it doesn't comment on "alleged intelligence sources or methods."
Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, said that "the CIA protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of Americans by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with U.S. laws."
Boyd said that the agency's activities are overseen by Senate and House intelligence committees, the FISA court, the Justice Department and other agencies.
A Western Union spokesman said: "We collect consumer information to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws. In doing so, we also protect our consumers' privacy and work to prevent consumer fraud."
CNN also received a similar statement from MoneyGram.
"We value our customers' privacy and work hard to protect it, just as we work hard to protect customers and others from fraud and other crime. We comply with the laws of all the countries where we do business, including the laws that govern privacy, government investigations, and compliance with lawful subpoenas and court orders," the company said.
"We have reporting obligations related to suspicious transactions, money laundering and other financial crimes around the world. The laws to which we are subject generally prohibit us from discussing details."
While the details of the CIA program provide new information on the scope of Patriot Act bulk records collection, U.S. government monitoring of financial transaction data has become well known since 9/11.
The 9/11 attacks cost al Qaeda between $400,000 and $500,000 to carry out, according to the 9/11 Commission, and the plotters transferred much of the money through readily detectable means via banks, money-transfers, travelers checks, and credit and debit cards. At the time, the financial transactions didn't raise any flags. Among the transactions uncovered after the attacks were MoneyGram and Western Union money transfers, the commission said.
Since the attacks the United States has tightened banking rules. The government collects data from the Belgian-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which operates a global system that helps banks clear financial transactions. Banks, money transfer outfits and casinos are also required by the United States to flag suspicious transactions under the Bank Secrecy Act, which also is the law used to police money laundering and other illicit financial transactions.

What is it like to land a plane at the world's busiest airport?
updated 8:28 PM EST, Thu January 16, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest airport More than 95 million passengers passed through the Atlanta airport in 2012
It handled 930,000 flight movements in the same year
(CNN) -- The world's busiest airport is not in New York or London, but Atlanta. Whatever way it is measured -- passenger traffic or airplane movements -- Atlanta's international airport tops the ranking.
More than 95 million passengers passed through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2012, according to Airports Council International's latest report that was released last year. The airport also boasts the highest number of takeoffs and landings, with 930,000 flight movements in 2012.
With such sheer volume, navigating an aircraft there can be a great challenge. Tom Staigle, chief pilot of Delta, whose main main hub is at Atlanta, compares the airport to "a congested freeway."
"We have on a clear day, 120 airplanes per hour flying in and out of here, so you have to be on your toes," Staigle says.

Tales from the air traffic control tower
Atlanta has five runways that are kept busy with aircraft's comings and goings. Pilots need to pay attention even when they are on the ground.
"You have to be careful to ensure you're on the correct taxiway and you don't end up on a runway," says Delta pilot Stuart Kenny, "or do something else and taxi to the wrong place as you're getting ready for takeoff."

To give an idea how daunting it is to fly from and into Atlanta, Kenney takes CNN Business Traveller to a flight simulator.
As a plane approaches Atlanta, a pilot would see the airport's multiple runways, a field of aircraft and a multitude of activities.
You have to be on your toesTom Staigle
"You'd see aircraft in front of you, see aircraft over here on the north complex," says Kenny, "see aircraft taking off at the far end, and you'd see guys turning onto the south runways."
That's why those in the cockpit need to work closely with those in the airport control tower.
"Air traffic control and the pilots are working together," says Kenney, "so you have to monitor all these targets and make sure nobody incurs into your air space and causes a problem."
As the result, "the radio traffic is daunting, says Kenney. "The radio calls are constant, so you have to listen carefully."

And it is not just about managing landings and takeoffs. "Think about the bags, and transferring passengers from all over the world," Staigle says. "Not only do they get where they need to be on time most of the time, but their bags come with them, and it's a pleasant experience."
The world's busiest airport is not among the world's best, however. Of the 100 airports listed in Skytrax's 2013 World Airport Awards ranking, Atlanta's is at No. 48, though it's also named one of the most improved airports.
For many pilots, their first landing in Atlanta is likely to be an unforgettable experience. "It was really busy. I was a young co-pilot, and I was probably sweating a gallon of water," Kenney recalls.
As soon as they landed, he had to go through the after-landing checklist and talked on the radio. "There's no time to savor the experience," says Kenney.
It is the world's busiest airport, after all.
