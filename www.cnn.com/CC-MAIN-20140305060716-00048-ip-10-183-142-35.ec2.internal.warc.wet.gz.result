Washington (CNN) -- Education Secretary Arne Duncan has spent the past couple days backpedaling from comments he made Sunday suggesting that Hurricane Katrina was good for New Orleans' failing schools. But, while he's apologizing for poor word choice, his comments echo a truth spoken by many in New Orleans. "It was a dumb thing to say, and I apologize," Duncan said Tuesday. In a Sunday broadcast of TV One's "Washington Watch with Roland Martin," Duncan was asked about the progress New Orleans schools have made since Katrina hit in 2005. He replied: "This is a tough thing to say, but let me be really honest. I think the best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina. That education system was a disaster, and it took Hurricane Katrina to wake up the community to say that 'We have to do better.' " Excerpts of the interview were released by the show Friday. Shortly afterward, numerous networks and newspapers picked them up, sparking the controversy that continued once the remarks were broadcast. Friday evening, Duncan called New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant, his office said. Duncan said Tuesday that he regrets what he said but insisted that the storm motivated the city to reinvest in its children like never before. "I said it poorly. And my point was very simple. Hurricane Katrina was a devastating, devastating tragedy. The progress we've seen subsequent to that has been absolutely remarkable. The teachers, the principals there are working so incredibly hard," Duncan said. "Almost all the students missed three months, four months, six months. I talked to students who missed more than a year off school, and yet they came back. And in a short amount of time, four years, they came back, subsequent to the devastating tragedy. Amazing progress. And I just tip my hat to the hard work there. I was simply trying to point out how impressed I am, the remarkable commitment and the sense of urgency." Several Louisiana officials defended Duncan's remarks. The state's superintendent of education, Paul Pastorek, said, "I know it's a strong statement, but it's actually quite accurate. It was a pathetic system before the storm." Paul Vallas, superintendent of the Louisiana Recovery School District -- a special program administered by the state with the aim of boosting underperforming schools -- noted that "local people have said that time and time again." Duncan said in the TV One interview that New Orleans in the past "was not serious about its education" but called the school system's reform since Katrina "unbelievable." Duncan has made several trips to New Orleans since becoming education secretary one year ago. His most recent was October 15. Regarding that city, Duncan said, "What this is about was this huge sense of urgency. And folks understood you had to literally build from the ground up. ... I just want to do whatever I can to continue to support the remarkable, remarkable progress." Education is a priority in the Obama administration, as evidenced by the president's proposed 2011 budget, released Monday, which would increase federal education spending by 7.5 percent, or $4 billion. Duncan is using federal dollars to promote reform in state and local school systems. He also is overhauling former President George W. Bush's Elementary and Secondary Education Act, better known as the No Child Left Behind Act. But Tuesday, he said, "We talk about the growth of No Child Left Behind, and New Orleans is a prime example. Is it where it needs to be? No. Still, clearly, it's a long journey, a long ways to go. But the progress has been amazing."

Getting to know Syria's first family
By Nicole Dow, CNN
updated 9:19 AM EDT, Wed July 18, 2012
An undated photo shows former Syrian President Hafez Assad seated with his wife, Anisa. Behind them from left to right are children Maher, Bashar, Basel, Majd and Bushra.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Behind the scenes, the relatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hold significant influence
Al-Assad has put some of them in important government positions
His brother Maher is a military leader often considered Syria's second most powerful man
His nephew Rami Makhlouf is regarded as the richest person in the country
(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is the face of his country's regime, but his family members are also believed to wield a powerful influence on issues facing the country.
In the past year, as pressure on the regime increased, al-Assad's inner circle has become more of a family affair, said David Lesch, a professor of Middle East history and author of "The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and Modern Syria."
"That's part of what Bashar has been doing ever since he came to power," Lesch said. "He has put members of his extended family ... in various parts of government and military security apparatus. If the day came -- and it did come -- where there was a threat to the regime, he could count on the loyalty of those closest to him."
Here is a closer look at the al-Assad family, an authoritarian dynasty that has been in place for more than 40 years.
The matriarch
Anisa Makhlouf al-Assad
Bashar's mother, Anisa, was married to Hafez Assad, Bashar's father and predecessor, who died in 2000.
The Makhlouf family gained wealth and status through Anisa's marriage to Hafez, taking on contracts in key industries, among them telecommunications, banking and oil. Anisa's nephew, Rami, is regarded as Syria's wealthiest man, worth some $5 billion.
Anisa is said to be an influential figure within the regime despite keeping an extremely low profile over the years (she was not even seen during coverage of her husband's funeral). Syrian writer Ayman Abdel Nour, who went to college with Bashar, says there was distance between Bashar and his father and that Anisa was "the mother and father and mentor of the family."
The first lady
Asma Akhras al-Assad
Asma al-Assad is the Syrian-British wife of the president. Born to a cardiologist father and a diplomat mother, she grew up in London, where she was known by friends and classmates as "Emma."
Experts say it's uncertain exactly how much influence first lady Asma al-Assad holds in Syria.
Asma graduated from King's College in London with a degree in computer science. She worked for JP Morgan as an investment banker before marrying Bashar in 2000, six months after he became president.
Her influence remains unclear. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert who knew Asma al-Assad and worked with her told CNN: "No one can say what's happening behind closed palace doors, but I doubt she feels she has any control or would ultimately have much influence over what her husband is doing."
The last major profile of her was by Vogue in spring 2011; however, a cache of emails recently leaked to CNN shed deep light on the first lady's personal life over the past year, amidst the civilian uprisings taking place in her country. One e-mail features an apparent request to a friend for the latest "Harry Potter" DVD. Another series of e-mails features exchanges about shopping for high-end jewelry, furniture and art. (More about Asma al-Assad)
The younger brother
Maher al-Assad
Maher al-Assad is Bashar's youngest brother and considered by many to be the second most powerful man in Syria. He oversees two of the Syrian army's strongest units: the Republican Guard, which protects the regime in Damascus, and the elite Fourth Armored Division, which suppressed the early uprisings in the southern part of Syria.
A hard-liner with a reputation for being cruel and moody, according to television channel France 24, Maher allegedly shot his brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, in the stomach during an argument in the presidential palace in 1999.
A New York Times profile on Maher reports that many Syrians who know him say he has a sharp intellect as well as a harsh and ruthless nature. He has apparently attempted to restructure Syria's military and intelligence so that both entities reflect his persona.
The older sister
Bushra al-Assad
Bushra al-Assad is the eldest of al-Assad's five siblings. A pharmacist by training, she is said to be very intelligent. She also had a close relationship with her late father.
Described by one insider as "ruthless," Bushra, like her mother, brandishes influence in the Assad inner sanctum and stays out of the public eye. A profile of Bushra in Mideast Monitor said although "she shuns the spotlight, her behind-the-scenes political influence has been decisive at times."
There have been reports of tension between Bushra and her sister-in-law Asma. Bushra is said to disapprove of Asma's public appearances in Syrian society, according to French newspaper Le Monde.
In 1995, Bushra married Asef Shawkat, a military officer 10 years older and a divorced father of five. Despite her family's staunch objections to the union -- her brother Maher apparently had Asef imprisoned on several occasions to keep them apart -- they eventually accepted Asef into their circle, where he was appointed head of the army's intelligence services for a time.
Bushra has four children, all named after members of her family: Bushra, Maher, Basel and Anisa.
The brother-in-law
Asef Shawkat
Shawkat was once in charge of the army's intelligence services, eventually becoming deputy chief-of-staff of Syria's armed forces. He is said to be one of Bashar's close allies, although there are reports that he was demoted after Hezbollah military commander Imad Mugniyeh was assassinated in Damascus in 2008.
According to Mideast Monitor, Shawkat and Maher were once locked in a power struggle over who had the ear of the president. Bushra is said to have interceded, easing tensions and resolving the dispute.
[Update: July 18, 2012] Shawkat was killed in a blast at a national security building in Damascus during a meeting of ministers and security officials, state TV reported.
The lost brothers
Basel al-Assad
Majd al-Assad
Not much is known about the president's brother Majd, who in 2009 died from "a long illness" at age 43, according to Syria's official news agency SANA. Majd, like many other members of his family, remained out of the public eye.
Basel al-Assad was 31 years old when he died in a 1994 car accident, crashing his Mercedes on a city highway in Damascus.
Known to have been charismatic and outgoing, Basel was older than Bashar and groomed to be his father's heir apparent, according to The Guardian.
Upon news of his brother's death, Bashar was brought back to Damascus to undergo military training to eventually take his brother's place as successor to their father's role as president. At the time, Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London.

Why Instagram pulled its photos from Twitter
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 1:54 PM EST, Mon December 10, 2012 | Filed under: Social Media
Instagram created Web-based user profiles last month, helping pave the way to take images off Twitter.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Twitter-Facebook fight escalates with latest Instagram move
Images from the popular photo app no longer appear on Twitter
Facebook bought Instagram in April for a reported $1 billion
Keeping users on your website equals money in the digital age
(CNN) -- Images from Instagram, the photo-sharing app that lets user spruce up their work with a slate of arty and retro filters, no longer show up on Twitter, a popular place to share them.
The change, foreshadowed when photos began appearing buggy on Twitter last week, was confirmed Sunday by both Twitter and Instagram. It marks a shift in how the app will be used and signals a new round in the escalating feud between two of the Web's social media titans.
Since Facebook bought Instagram in April, it's been apparent that Facebook and Twitter, which rank one-two in popularity among social-networking users, are distancing themselves from each other.
In the Internet age, data and dwell time equal money. With Facebook pushing to grow its mobile revenue (and modest stock price) and Twitter still searching for effective ways to translate its popularity into profit, this rift was perhaps inevitable.
In July, Twitter stopped letting Instagram users find friends via Twitter they may want to follow on the photo app. (They did the same for popular blogging site Tumblr after buying rival blogging platform Posterous.)
In the most recent move, users began noticing that images posted to Twitter were cropped weirdly. By Monday, sending an Instagram photo to Twitter simply posted a link directing followers to Instagram's recently beefed-up website.
The move was first mentioned by Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom last week at Le Web, a tech conference in Paris.
"We're working on building an awesome Web presence, which we just launched," Systrom said. "We revamped our Web properties, and now we're able to staff up teams to work on Web properties with the Facebook acquisition."
A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed Monday that Instagram turned off support for "Twitter cards," the app that lets third-party images appear on the site. In its statement posted Sunday, Twitter also confirmed what happened.
"Instagram has disabled photo integration with Twitter. As a result, photos are no longer appearing in Tweets or user photo galleries," the statement reads. "While tweeting links to Instagram photos is still possible, you can no longer view the photos on Twitter, as was previously the case."
At Le Web, Systrom said the shift wasn't payback for Twitter shutting down its friend-finder function. But he also said there are no plans to disable Instagram images on other sites.
"This is more of a one-off," he said.
Underlying all the back-and-forth, of course, is the possibility that hard feelings still exist after Twitter's reported offer to buy Instagram was spurned in favor of a reported $1 billion deal with Mark Zuckerberg's Web juggernaut.
By allowing its images to show up on Twitter, Instagram gave Twitter users no incentive to visit its own site or mobile app. The amount of time visitors stay on a website is an important figure for advertisers choosing which sites to patronize. Keeping Instagram photos off Twitter also could encourage users to publish their pictures to Facebook, which allows them to show up in all their glory.
Meanwhile, there are reports that Twitter is planning its own photo-filtering app, which could be out by the end of the year.
Such moves and countermoves are to be expected, many in the tech blogosphere were saying Monday.
"The companies obviously realize how important photos are to getting users to share and interact on the web, so it looks like the competition isn't stopping any time soon," wrote Eliza Kern for GigaOM.
Others were saying this won't change the actual Twitter-Instagram user experience all that much.
"Breaking: one click to see Instagram photo now requires two clicks," wrote TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler on Twitter. "Trillions of man click hours lost."

Hundreds of dead pigs fished from Shanghai river By Katie Hunt and Zhang Dayu
updated 11:43 PM EDT, Mon March 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Pig carcasses test positive for porcine circovirus
More than 2,800 dead pigs found floating in Shanghai river
Authorities say local tap water still safe to drink but residents worried
Reports suggests that more than 10,000 pigs died in a neighboring province earlier this year
Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink.
State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water.
It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai.
"We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers," the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday.

As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had "no significant effect on tap water supply," the commission added.
This horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on WeiboXue Manzi However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink.
"Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo," business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account.
The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus.
According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own.
Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river.
A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months.
"According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs," a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying.
Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant.

How brushing your teeth lowers your risk of cancer
By Alexandra Sifferlin, TIME.com
updated 10:08 AM EDT, Fri August 23, 2013
Brushing regularly and keeping the mouth environment clean could help control HPV in the oropharynx.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CDC: About 60% of oropharyngeal cancers are related to human papillomavirus
Poor oral health is an independent risk factor for oral HPV infection, study finds
White men have the highest rates of HPV-related throat cancer
(TIME.com) -- HPV-caused throat cancer made headlines this summer when the Guardian reported that actor Michael Douglas contracted throat cancer not through tobacco and alcohol, but from human papillomavirus.
Douglas later said the statement was a misunderstanding, but doctors say HPV could actually contribute to malignant growths in the throat, most likely via oral sex. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control reports that about 60% of oropharyngeal cancers — cancers of the throat, tonsils and the base of tongue — are related to HPV.
Now, a study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research reports that poor oral health, which includes dental problems and gum disease, is an independent risk factor for oral HPV infection, and by extension, could also contribute to oral cancers. The research team from the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston studied more 3,400 participants between the ages 30 to 69 who were part of the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
The volunteers provided data on their oral health as well as on their HPV-infection status.
TIME.com: Yes, you can get throat cancer from oral sex
Douglas confession: TMI or FYI?
Those who reported poor oral health had a 56% higher rate of HPV infection than those whose mouths were healthy, and people who had gum disease and dental problems had a 51% higher risk of being infected with HPV than those who didn't have these issues.
The connection between the virus, which is most often associated with sexually transmitted diseases, and oral cancers only emerged about five years ago, Dr. Maura Gillison, a professor at Ohio State University who studies HPV infections in the head, throat and neck, told TIME in June.
Every year in the United States, more than 2,370 new cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers are diagnosed in women and about 9,356 are diagnosed in men. White men have the highest rates of HPV-related throat cancer, fueling a recent rise in HPV-related oral cancers overall while tumors associated with tobacco have been declining.
"In the U.S., there is an active shift going on," Gillison told TIME. "Fortunately thanks to tobacco policy and public-health awareness, the incidence rate for the classical head and neck cancer caused by smoking is declining. But unfortunately, the rate of oropharynx cancer is still going up and it's because of the HPV component."
Some of that rise can be attributed to barriers that public health campaigns faced in addressing a sexually transmitted virus. When two vaccines that protect against the most common forms of HPV became available after 2006, for example, political and social resistance to vaccinating young girls as part of the childhood vaccination schedule led to slow uptake of the inoculation.
Parents and politicians worried that the shot would promote promiscuity among pre-adolescents, and were also concerned about reports that the immunizations caused serious side effects such as fainting. There were even claims that they also contributed to mental disorders. Both proved unfounded, as studies verified the safety of the vaccines and the lack of heightened sexual activity among vaccinated girls.
If left untreated, HPV can cause cancers in the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, as well as in the head and neck. Some forms of the virus also contribute to genital warts, but the latest studies suggest that the HPV vaccines can lower infection rates and therefore may be important weapons in fighting not just cervical cancer but oral cancers as well.
That's important since there is currently no scientifically proven way of testing for oral HPV, which makes monitoring for these virus-related cancers in the mouth more challenging and preventing them more critical.
TIME.com: New cancer screening guidelines include HPV tests
Even without a shot, however, the researchers say their results hint that it may be relatively easy to control HPV in the oropharynx — by brushing regularly and keeping the mouth environment clean.
"The good news is, the risk factor is modifiable -- by maintaining good oral hygiene and good oral health, one can prevent HPV infection and subsequent HPV-related cancers," said study author Thanh Cong Bui, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in a statement.
And there are other benefits to brushing as well. Good oral health may also prevent other conditions such as the gum disease gingivitis, which has been linked to heart disease. A healthy mouth, it seems can also be a sign of a healthy body.

Students return to New Mexico school two days after shooting
By Chandrika Narayan, Lateef Mungin and Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 10:31 PM EST, Thu January 16, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Students return to New Mexico school for the first time since shooting
12-year-old faces three charges of aggravated battery, court documents Shooter's father bought the gun used in the shooting
His parents say a judge ordered that their son receive mental health treatment
(CNN) -- New Mexico's Berrendo Middle School reopened its doors two days after a preteen with a sawed-off shotgun opened fire in a crowded gymnasium.
Police are still investigating the shooting that left two students seriously injured and the suspected shooter in custody.
As students and teachers trickled back to school Thursday, the community turned out to show support.
Crowds lined up on the road near the campus, cheering as the school buses appeared.
They waved flags, and black and gold streamers. They held up signs with the words "Love," "Hope," "Faith," and "Courage."
Gov. Susana Martinez greeted the students as well.
"They have a counselor in every single classroom," Martinez told CNN affiliate KOAT. "There are people here supporting them in everything they need."
She said both the children and their teachers needed counseling.
For many parents, bringing their kids to school Thursday was not an easy decision. Some said it was happening too soon, but others said their kids needed to return.
"I told her last night she didn't have to go if she didn't feel like she wanted to, and she said, 'well, I can't be scared to go to school,' is what she told me this morning," Florence Dosher Nieto told CNN affiliate KRQE.
Another parent said she is looking into home schooling.
The attack has rattled residents of Roswell, a city about 200 miles southeast of Albuquerque. It is the latest community in the United States to go from a relatively peaceful enclave to a site of a school shooting, joining places like Littleton, Colorado, Paducah, Kentucky, and Newtown, Connecticut.
Tuesday's incident is also the second one at a middle school in the last three months.
In October, a 12-year-old in Nevada opened fire with a handgun he took from his parents, killing a teacher and wounding two students before he eventually killed himself.

New Mexico 911: "A kid just got shot" Three shells and a plan
Police say the 12-year-old shooting suspect entered his middle school Tuesday morning with a 20-gauge pump shotgun that he had sawed off. He shot three rounds.
The first shot hit the ceiling, said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. The second went into the gym floor. The third sped toward the stands where, about 12 to 15 feet away, it hit two students who had been waiting with others for classes to start.
"We did find evidence that the suspect had planned this event," Kassetas said. "I can't discuss the particulars as to why."
He said the victims were targeted at random.
Police have carried out three search warrants and interviewed more than 60 people, Kassetas said.
The boy faces three counts of aggravated battery, according to New Mexico state juvenile court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KOAT.
The suspect's parents, Jim and Jennifer Campbell, and grandparents, Robert and Nancy Bowles, issued a statement Wednesday saying they are "praying that God will be with everyone who has been affected."
They didn't try to explain the shooter's actions, which left "his whole family ... heartbroken," though they didn't ignore his impact.
"For all of the anguish that many suffered yesterday," his parents and grandparents said, "our family offers our heartfelt condolences and remorse in words that we cannot fully express."
The family singled out the two hospitalized victims.
Victims still recovering
The victims were both taken to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas -- about 175 miles east of the school
A 12-year-old boy is in critical condition with injuries to the side of his face and neck, according to Martinez, the governor. He has undergone at least two surgeries since the incident.
The other victim, 13-year-old Kendal Sanders, is in stable condition.
Police: Suspect took parents' gun
The suspect is being held at an unspecified location in Albuquerque and has met with his parents, Kassetas said.
In their statement, the parents indicated a judge "ordered ... our son receive an evaluation and mental health treatment and sincerely want him to receive all of the help that he needs."
"As a family we will cooperate in all ways with law enforcement to piece together how this awful tragedy occurred," they said.
Kassetas said the shotgun came from the suspect's home. His father had bought the gun -- the only one of several weapons in the house not locked in a safe -- at a Walmart, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
Authorities believe the 12-year-old "modified the weapon by cutting off the stock," Kassetas said.
The search warrants executed in connection with the investigation were on the suspect's locker, his duffel bag and his Roswell home.
The law enforcement source said the suspect kept a handwritten journal at home describing "what he was planning, what he wanted to do."
But just before he fired, authorities believe, the suspect gave "preliminary warnings ... to some select students who he ran into before he entered the gymnasium," Kassetas said.
'Hero' teacher
Teacher John Masterson didn't know the shooter had used all his ammunition when he walked to the student and persuaded him to put the gun down, Martinez said.
"Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ... who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him," the governor said at a vigil Tuesday evening, "and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt."
The Berrendo staff directory lists John Masterson as an eighth-grade social studies teacher.
Masterson has taught at the school for a decade and coaches track and soccer, according to the Albuquerque Journal.
When contacted by the newspaper, he said police had told him not to discuss details of the shooting.
"It was a harrowing experience," he told the paper. "All I can say was the staff there did a great job."
