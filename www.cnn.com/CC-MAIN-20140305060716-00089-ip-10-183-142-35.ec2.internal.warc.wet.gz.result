Police seek tips in teacher's 1992 slaying By Philip Rosenbaum, Nancy Grace Producer Christy Ann Mirack, a 25-year-old teacher, was found bludgeoned to death in 1992. STORY HIGHLIGHTSChristy Mirack, 25, described as all-American girl who always wanted to teachPolice: She was raped, strangled and bludgeoned to death in her apartment Many cleared by DNA, including older married man Mirack was discreetly datingKnow something? Call police at 717-291-4676. A $10,000 reward is offered New York (CNN) -- As a child, Christy Ann Mirack played teacher while her brother and sister pretended to be her students. As it turned out, Mirack was rehearsing for adulthood. "Her dream in life from early on was to be a schoolteacher,'' recalled Vince Mirack, her brother. Soon after she reached her goal, ''it was taken away from her," he said. On December 21, 1992, Mirack did not show up to teach her first-grade class at Rohrerstown Elementary School in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Phone calls to her home went unanswered, and the school's principal, Harry Goodman, drove to the apartment Mirack shared with a female roommate who had already left for work. The door was ajar, and inside Goodman discovered a gruesome and terrifying scene. Mirack, who was 25, had been strangled, beaten and raped, said Det. Joseph Edgell, who leads the murder investigation for the East Lampeter Township Police Department. There was no sign of forced entry, and an object from inside the home was used in the beating, Edgell said. He declined to describe the object because the investigation is ongoing and the killer may still be alive. "There were a number of 'persons of interest' from the onset of this investigation,'' Edgell said. Tip LineAnyone with information on Christy Ann Mirack's death is asked to call the East Lampeter Township police at 717-291-4676.

Many were cleared by DNA testing, including a significantly older married man Mirack was discreetly dating. But to this day, investigators keep an eye on a few people, Edgell said. A white vehicle with black louvers covering the rear window, similar to a Dodge Daytona, may have been in the area at the time of the crime, authorities said. East Lampeter Township, in Pennsylvania Amish country, has about 13,500 residents, according to the 2000 census. It covers 21 square miles. Mirack lived in a quiet development of townhomes near a business park. Edgell said one of the early investigators on the case who spoke with her friends and colleagues described Mirack as an all-American girl. Lack of information has made the case difficult to solve, Edgell said. He believes someone must know something about the case that could help police. "Even something which a person may believe to be trivial could be useful in determining who did this,'' he said. Vince Mirack describes his sister as a great, bubbly person with a good sense of humor. He imagines by now, at 41, she would have been married with children of her own. "She really liked kids. That's why she taught elementary school,'' he said. Mirack said he has struggled over the years to keep the case going and to maintain public awareness. At his own expense, he put up a billboard seeking information on his sister's slaying. "We still don't have the answers that we want today,'' he said. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the East Lampeter Township Police Department at 717-291-4676. A $10,000 reward is offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Are baby boomers to blame for debt crisis? By Ed Hornick, CNN A woman takes part in a rally to protect federal health programs July 15 in Oakland, California. STORY HIGHLIGHTS"Baby boomers" are described as those between 45 and 65One analyst says his generation may not understand what adversity is really likeAnother baby boomer says his generation isn't to blame for the bad economy; it's Congress Washington (CNN) -- Baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- have been described as "the pig in the python" and the "sandwich generation." They lived well, grew up in relative abundance and, some say, expected their Social Security, health care and government support to be there as they grew old. Now, as the future of the country's economy is up in the air, is this group of 80 million aging Americans -- many of whom are sprinting toward retirement age -- the ones to blame for the nation's shaky economic system? The answer is not so simple. Baby boomers grew up during relative prosperity, from the economic boom of the post-World War II '50s to the "Me" generation of the '60s through the lucrative uptick in the Reagan '80s. And then there were the budget surpluses they enjoyed during the Clinton '90s. As a result, many were able to buy second homes, take out loans at low interest rates, buy cheap gas and pump money back into the economy. Life was good, many say, until September 2008. In the last days of the Bush administration, the economy went belly-up, forcing Washington to bail out Wall Street in order to prevent another Great Depression. "Keep in mind that our parents who lived through the depression understand what adversity looks like. I'm not sure baby boomers know what that looks like," said David Cork, a demographer and baby boomer himself. "So maybe we got a bit of a taste for it two years ago." Cork, a Canadian businessman and author of the book "The Pig and the Python," said the American economy has been thriving especially in boomers' formative years, "so they're not used to adversity."

"It's not because the boomers are a nasty generation. It's just that there's a lot of us, and we have a tendency of wanting to get it our own way," he added. "I think we've been very successful at that. We've created great wealth, but we are looking at it at a time when you have to pay the piper." An analysis of data from the past three censuses shows that because of baby boomers' "aging in place," the population of those age 45 and over grew 18 times as fast as the population under age 45 between 2000 and 2010, said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institute. Frey's report also found that the baby boomers (or "pre-seniors," as he called them) are "growing rapidly in all areas of the country," including college towns like Austin, Texas, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Madison, Wisconsin. Regions experiencing the fastest senior -- age 65 and older -- growth are in the Sun Belt, which stretches from Western states such as California and Arizona east to Florida, according to the report. Frey, also a boomer, said that although his generation is not necessarily taking the entitlement programs that their parents are, they can see what's coming down the road. "They're not trying to skim off money from everybody else," he said. "It's just that these are issues that are now front and center for them where they weren't before." Still, as a generation, they will have paid less into the Social Security system than they are expected to take out. According to a report from the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees, the Social Security system is expected to be solvent until about 2037 -- largely because of the surplus in the Trust Fund -- even though the payroll taxes flowing in stop being enough to cover the expenses flowing out in 2017. Thomas Firey, a senior editor at the conservative Cato Institute and member of generation X, said it's unclear as to what's going to happen to Social Security. "Under current law, what's supposed to happen is once the trust fund runs dry, the benefits are to be cut by roughly 25% to bring it back into balance. Each year's income will equalize the outflow," said Frey, who wrote a 2001 column titled "Boomers Fleece Generation X with Social Security. "But no one expects that to happen. (So) are we going to raise taxes on current workers? Are we going to get rid of the tax?" But criticizing baby boomers is not necessarily a politically wise thing to do, especially when it comes to their voting behavior. Older voters consistently turn out in elections and are a key demographic for politicians on both sides of the aisle. Jerry Shereshewsky, the self-described "chief grown-up" at the firm GrownUpMarketing, is a baby boomer. The 65-year-old said it's not his generation group to blame, it's Congress'. "It was not a secret that this largest cohort in American history was going to get older every year," he said. "The fact that Congress has not done a very good job of keeping up with what is really happening in the world: life expectancy, better medical care. You give people a lot of cake and ice cream, they're going to eat it." Frey added that any good demographer would have told you 20 years ago that "we would be hitting the wall around now. But it hasn't seemed to sink in for folks on Capitol Hill or anywhere else." Shereshewsky also issued a stern warning to those in Congress who may blame boomers for today's economic problems. "If you want to look through the telescope and say who should be getting beaten up here a little bit, I would say every member of the legislative branch for the last 30 years should be taken outside and spanked, because they did really stupid things," he said. "Why did they increase these benefits? They get votes. Why don't they raise taxes? They're afraid someone's not going to vote for them." David Certner, legislative policy director for the AARP, said the country got into its debt mess not because of older Americans but because of Washington's out-of-control spending. "The problem we're in today was caused by things we've done in the last two years, in particular engaging in two wars that haven't been paid for in any way, shape or form -- as well as the fact that we've had a significant drop in revenues partly as a result of our changes in the tax laws," he said. Certner added that it's the rising health care costs that should worry all Americans. "Health care costs are burdening people right now who are trying to pay for it. ... We need to get the whole health care cost problem under control, because it really does put a crimp on the rest of the economy," he said. "People who are working now are probably seeing their wages go up slower because more of their money is going to health care costs." And that's something 23-year-old Jordan Balkin is finding out, at least when it comes to how much comes out of her paycheck for entitlement programs. "It's a little less than 1%. But when you add it up, it's about $100, which would be nice to use towards other things, especially not knowing if I will get a chance to see that money in the future," said Balkin, who works in social media in Washington. As for whether she's worried about her own retirement, Balkin -- part of what's described as generation Y -- said she can only hope that some of the money will be returned. For now, it's all about the present. "I just keep thinking about saving for the near future when I want to have a family, buy a house," she said. "I mean, there is that offhand dream that I'll win the lottery -- hey, someone's got to be a winner."

U.S., allies expel Syrian diplomats after massacre
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:09 PM EDT, Tue May 29, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A former Syrian general says the army is no longer "of the people," but a tool of the regime
NEW: Bulgaria, the Netherlands join the United States and others in expelling diplomats
If the peace plan fails, "may God help us," says Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan
72 people were killed Tuesday, an opposition group says
(CNN) -- Close to a dozen countries, including the United States, announced Tuesday they were expelling Syrian diplomats in a coordinated move reflecting the international outrage about a massacre in the town of Houla.
A U.N. official said it's "clear" that Syrian government forces were involved in the massacre, which left more than 100 people dead, nearly half of them children.
A "fairly small number appear to have been killed by shelling, artillery and tank fire which took place over a period of more than 12 hours," said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office.
Should the U.S. 'airdrop' millions of phones into Syria?
The majority appear to have died as a result of "summary executions" by "armed men going into houses and killing men, women and children inside," he said.

"What is clear is government forces were involved. They were shelling, using tanks and artillery. And it appears to be Shabiha militia (a government militia group), entering houses and slaughtering people in what is really an abominable crime that took place throughout the day on Friday."
Syria has denied being behind the killings, insisting that "terrorists" carried them out. Syrian officials said the government would investigate.
The bloodshed continued Tuesday, when at least 72 people were killed across the country, including nine children and two women, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
Syria said 21 "army and law enforcement martyrs" were buried.
Children shot, knifed, axed to death in Syria's Houla massacre, reports say
The Netherlands, the United States, Australia, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Canada all announced Tuesday that they were expelling some Syrian diplomats. In some cases, it was just the ambassadors; in others, numerous diplomats were expelled.
The U.S. State Department decided to expel the Syrian charge d'affaires, two State Department officials told CNN. Zouheir Jabbour was called to the department Tuesday morning and told he and his family had 72 hours to leave.
He has been the top Syrian envoy in the United States since the ambassador, Imad Moustapha, was called back to Syria in October in a response move after the United States said it was pulling its ambassador out of Syria.
"We hold the Syrian government responsible for this slaughter of innocent lives," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement Tuesday. "This massacre is the most unambiguous indictment to date of the Syrian government's flagrant violations of its U.N. Security Council obligations ... along with the regime's ongoing threat to peace and security."
White House spokesman Jay Carney was even more emphatic.
"This weekend's massacre is a horrifying testament to this regime's depravity. The international community is united in its revulsion at the regime's actions through both its military and its thug forces, and we are ratcheting up the pressure on and isolation of this murderous regime," he said.
Sen. Bob Carr, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement, "The Syrian government can expect no further official engagement with Australia until it abides by the U.N. cease-fire and takes active steps to implement the peace plan agreed with Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan."
The Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was declaring the ambassador persona non grata and expelling four other diplomats "for the unacceptable repression carried out by the Syrian regime on its population."
But Annan, envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League, took a markedly different tone after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

While he said he "conveyed in frank terms the grave concern of the international community about the violence in Syria, including the recent shocking events in Houla," he also said that Syria's vow to organize its own investigations "is very encouraging."
He also said he "expressed appreciation for the cooperation of the Syrian government, which enabled the U.N. to deploy an observer mission to Syria, quickly."
"We are at a tipping point. The Syrian people do not want the future to be one of bloodshed and division. Yet the killings continue and the abuses are still with us today," Annan said, according to a statement released by his office. He said he appealed to al-Assad "for bold steps now -- not tomorrow, now -- to create momentum for the implementation of the plan."
"I also appeal to the armed opposition to cease acts of violence," he added.
Talking to reporters in Damascus, Annan was asked what he thought would happen in Syria if the peace plan was not implemented.
"If the plan is not implemented, I would worry for the future of Syria. I would worry about stability in the country. ... If we do not (implement the plan), may God help us," he said.
"Words are wonderful, but action is better. What is important is demonstrate through action a real commitment to the plan and this is what the international community is asking for now: action, not words," he said.
Al-Assad told Annan that "terrorist groups" have escalated operations, including killings and kidnappings, in recent days, and he stressed the urgency of getting countries that are "financing and harboring terrorist groups" to commit to Annan's plan, Syrian state-run TV reported.
Residents in Houla say Syrian regime forces terrorized the town, a suburb of the anti-government bastion of Homs.
An 11-year-old survivor recalled his experience.
"They were talking to my mom. I'm not sure what happened but they shot her five times. They shot her in the head. Then he turned and shot my sister, Rasha, in the head. Then he shot my brother, Nader, in the neck and back," the boy said.
'SNN,' YouTube help amplify voices in Syria
Months of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions have yet to quash the violence, and anger over perceived inaction by world leaders boiled over after the Houla massacre, which the United Nations said left 108 people dead.
Opinion: Only Russia, China can stop carnage in Syria
Horrific images of dozens of mutilated children's corpses in Houla prompted a rare moment of unity Sunday from the U.N. Security Council.
Even Russia, the staunchest defender of the Syrian regime on the council, signed on to a statement that condemned the Syrian government for its "outrageous use of force against (the) civilian population."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a conversation with Annan, "expressed grave concern about the tragedy in Houla and emphasized that all sides in Syria must give up violence in order to avoid similar incidents in the future," according to a statement from the ministry. "An objective and independent investigation of all circumstances of the tragedy must be done under the U.N. Mission in Syria," the statement said.
Yet few Middle East watchers predict the Houla massacre will break the diplomatic deadlock that has cemented itself around Syria for a year.
Timeline: Syria -- How a year of horror unfolded Unlike in Libya, where NATO-led airstrikes contributed to deposing longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi, al-Assad has powerful regional allies in his corner: Iran, Russia and, to an extent, China.
Syria also has "five times more sophisticated air defense systems than existed in Libya, covering one-fifth of the terrain," Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey testified before Congress in March.
But a former Syrian general said the country's capabilities were exaggerated.
"It is good to face civilians or light armed freedom fighters ... but when it faces a superior power it will collapse right away. I'm saying that with all sadness because this is the army I served like for 27 years, but this is not the army of the people anymore ... It's the army of the regime itself," Akil Hashem told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed and tens of thousands more have been uprooted since the crisis began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people.
CNN cannot confirm death tolls and reports of violence from Syria, as the Syrian government limits access by foreign journalists.
CNN's Ivan Watson, Yasmin Amer, Arwa Damon, Anderson Cooper and Holly Yan contributed to this report.

Israeli Defense Minister Barak says he's quitting politics
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:53 PM EST, Mon November 26, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: PLO official: "I hope this signals recognition of the futility of the military approach in ... dealing with the Palestinians"
Ehud Barak says he wants to spend more time with his family
Despite speculation of a new party, he says he won't contest the elections due in January
His resignation comes after a lethal conflict with Hamas in Gaza
Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak announced his resignation Monday, saying he will quit politics in January to spend more time with his family.
His resignation comes at a highly delicate time for Israel, which is observing a fragile cease-fire with the militant Palestinian group Hamas after an eight-day conflict that killed more than 160 people -- the overwhelming majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.

Barak, who is married and the father of three children, said Monday at a news conference in Tel Aviv that he will continue as defense minister for the next three months, as elections are due in January. He said he won't contest the elections.

Barak: Iran heading toward objective Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee, weighed in on the announcement.
"I hope this signals recognition of the futility of the military approach in the adoption of violence as means of dealing with the Palestinians," she said. "If it is for personal reasons, we cannot comment, but if it's recognition that his whole career was based on the military approach to political life, then this demonstrates the recognition of the futility of militarism and violence."
Some Israeli political commentators had speculated ahead of the announcement that Barak was planning to quit the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new center-left party.

But Barak told reporters that new faces in leadership roles would benefit Israel.
"I feel it is important that other people should take leading positions in Israel. Changes in the position of power are a good thing. There are many ways to contribute to the society and the country, and not necessarily through politics," he said.
Barak served as defense minister under former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert between 2007 and 2009, and retained the post under Netanyahu from 2009 until the present. He also held the title of deputy prime minister for both administrations.
He had previously served as prime minister between July 1999 and March 2001, when he was defeated in an election by Ariel Sharon. From 2001 until his return to politics in 2005, Barak worked in the private sector.

Skiing's 'dark arts' to invade Olympics
By Oliver Lukas, for CNN
updated 9:04 AM EST, Thu January 10, 2013
Two new freestyle skiing events will be introduced at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi -- slopestyle and ski halfpipe -- meaning freestylers will have as many medals to aim at as their alpine cousins.
Slopestyle skiers perform a series of tricks on a course laden with jump-off opportunities while the ski halfpipe discipline is similar, though the track is a semi-circular ditch carved out of the snow.
More and more people are making the crossover from alpine to the "dark side" of skiing -- freestyle. Canadian Kelsey Serwa made the switch in 2009 and has since become an X Games gold medalist and world champion in ski cross.
Ski cross is a four-way fight to the finish line across a specially constructed course complete with jumps, waves and steep turns. It enraptured audiences on its Olympics debut in Vancouver in 2010.
Part of its appeal is its fast and furious nature, which often leads to crashes.
Some believe the drama of freestyle is taking viewers away from traditional downhill alpine skiing. John Fry, International Skiing History Association president, thinks alpine is missing chances to boost its popularity. He says a refusal to sanction a race-off between Maria Riesch and Lindsey Vonn when they were practically tied for the Alpine World Cup title in 2011 was a mistake.
Rather than television, most amateur freestyle skiers find their fame on the internet. Finnish urban skiing company Real Skifi comprises Ilkka and Verneri Hannula and Juho Kilkki. Their short films, shot by Janne Korpela, often attract half a million hits.
As well as ski halfpipe, ski slopestyle and snowboard slopestyle, other new events for Sochi 2014 include snowboard parallel special slalom, women's ski jumping, biathlon mixed relay, team figure skating and luge team relay.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A pair of freestyle skiing events to be introduced at 2014 Winter Olympics The "dark arts" of slopestyle and ski halfpipe will make their debut at Sochi
Several athletes are making switch from alpine competitions, including Kelsey Serwa
Some experts say there are too many "minor" freestyle events included at Games
(CNN) -- We love the glamor of alpine skiing, the glow of tradition, the glitz of stars like Lindsey Vonn, and the gumption of her quest to race the men.
But do we love it enough to keep watching when skiing's "dark side" is so much more exciting and dangerous?
Freestyle skiing is taking over the Olympics. A global passion for taking two skis to new extremes is reaching its zenith, and the Olympic movement has responded by adding a succession of new events to its program.
When slopestyle and ski halfpipe make their debut at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games, freestyle skiers will for the first time have as many medals to aim at as their alpine counterparts.

And as fans are increasingly drawn to new, high-octane breeds of winter sport, so top athletes are making the switch too.
In 2009, Kelsey Serwa left behind alpine racing for ski cross. Within two years she had become an X Games gold medalist and world champion.
Lindsey Vonn vows to take on the men Longer skis reduce alpine injuries?
Lara Gut wins World Cup downhill
"Ski cross is full of outcasts from alpine," the Canadian 23-year-old tells CNN. "Alpine is so strict on rules. Ski cross is more relaxed, for free spirits or people looking for something more exciting than racing the clock."
Ski cross, a thrilling four-way straight fight to the finish line, blew the socks off TV audiences on its debut at Vancouver 2010, where Serwa finished fifth overall.
For some, it made the blue riband downhill races look almost pedestrian. Serwa calls it the "dark side" of ski racing.
"It's so simple," she says. "You don't have to know anything about it, it's obvious: Whoever is leading is the best, right? And if they make a mistake and get passed, you see why. You don't have to understand, just watch and enjoy."
Contrast that with alpine, where even experts can struggle to identify exactly how and why a race was won -- including Serwa.
"I've raced alpine but even I didn't understand everything," she admits. "Is that guy faster than the fastest split time? Or faster than the fastest racer in general? It's kind of like, 'I don't know what's going on.' "
As president of the International Skiing History Association, John Fry has been watching alpine skiing for more than half a century. In that time, he hasn't solved this problem.
Read: Val d'Isere: The hidden home of skiing's 'madmen'
"It's very difficult, even for a highly trained eye, to see how a race was won. Sometimes you have five or six racers who finish within one second of each other. It's a built-in problem," says Fry, who helped to found alpine's World Cup circuit in the 1960s as the editor of Ski magazine.
Yet having witnessed the birth of freestyle skiing in the 1970s and its subsequent explosion, he believes freestyle could end up eating itself. Is the proliferation of events making freestyle as hard to grasp for the novice as the intricacies of downhill?
Ski cross is more relaxed, for free spirits or people looking for something more exciting than racing the clockKelsey Serwa, ski cross gold medalist
"To me, there are too many Olympic events," he says. "They keep inventing more and more, and they're all relatively minor. In your great classic sports such as golf and tennis, which I think are comparable to skiing, you have all this history.
"Commentators and writers can refer to golf's Masters champions, how Jack Nicklaus did, how Bobby Jones played, and how that compares to today. There's great history there.
"All these novelties, these new events, have very little history to them."
But Fry also thinks alpine skiing is missing vital chances to broaden its appeal in an era where younger generations, their attention spans waning by the second, are overwhelmed by choice.
"A couple of years ago, when (alpine superstars) Lindsey Vonn and Maria Riesch were virtually tied for the season title, they refused to have a race-off which would have attracted a huge television audience," he said.
Read: 'Crazy' dead heat in World Cup downhill
"They didn't let it happen 'because of a rule.' It's the same thing now that Vonn wants to race the men. They say: 'No, there's a rule, women can't race.'
"Can you imagine the international TV audience they would attract with that race? These opportunities are presented on a platter, but they don't seem to happen."
Bighorn is an apt title for this palatial chalet on the Rainbow Range of mountains in British Columbia. It sleeps 16 and comes with its own helipad. Also included are a Teppanyaki grill, an outdoor fireplace and a hot tub with a sparkling vista.
As is customary, size does matter in the United States and at Casa Nova you can sleep a small army of 25. Nestled in the Deer Valley Resort, it has four bars, as well as an oxygen bar, a 15-seat screening room, while a privately patrolled ski trail is a mere seven yards from the front door. Yours for just $125,000 a week in peak season.
Edelweiss raised the bar when it came on to the rental market in September 2012; at peak season in January it will cost you $516,000 for a 10-day stay. With its four floors, nine en-suite bedrooms and accessories that include its own nightclub (pictured), you might never want to leave if you've got deep pockets.
Grace has everything you'd expect from a luxury chalet, with the requisite yoga room to the extensive bar, but the real selling point is the stunning views it offers of the Matterhorn.
You can have a waterfall or air jet massage at the Tivoli Lodge, but if you bring any kids most of your time will be spent on crowd control in the chalet's indoor two-storey soft play gym that can cater for 20 children. Just bring your earplugs.
Kernow has a plethora of ways to keep you occupied with games consoles, giant TVs, a spa, a gym and study but it is heaven for wine buffs with a purpose-built cellar that houses a private collection of over 2,500 bottles. That's a lot of vino.
Marco Polo has an extensive balcony complete with barbecue and heated seating but should you prefer to stay indoors a wellness center on the first floor has the prerequisite pool, hot tub and sauna complete with a full entertainment system.
You may have come to ski but when you are off piste there are few better chalets to keep you entertained than La Grand Roche, which has a full cinema room with a 103" HD television. There is even a waterproof 42" TV in the pool area. Yours for just $120,400 a week.
Spa's spa is fitted to the highest standard of course, but perhaps the outdoor seven seater jacuzzi is a better bet with its views of the Alps? There is a Scandinavian rock sauna, therapy room and a humidification system throughout to promote restful sleep.
On a clear day Mont Blanc will shimmer in the distance; if not, the 180 degree views from the glass sauna should suffice. There is also a slide that takes you from the fourth floor bar to the wine cellar. Perfect when you need another bottle of vintage claret.
Chesa Falcun in the Klosters Valley has all the mod cons and comes with a personal chef and two chauffeurs, but its pièce de résistance is its covered outdoor hot tub -- perfect when the snow is falling.
Despite its lush indoor decor surely the terrace at Les Anges will entice you into the crisp mountain air. With a 14-seat table and a barbecue, you might not even visit the natural stone relaxation area.
Ormello underwent a $1.2 million facelift in 2009 and offers 1,000 square meters of space. It has a lift to all floors, a range of spa and pool facilities, and a state-of-the-art private cinema.
If you fancy working out in front of a five-star view then Zermatt Peak could be just the ticket. It makes the most of its stunning views with a jacuzzi that begins in the wellness center and extends outside onto the terrace. Should you want to stay inside, three HD cinema rooms should keep you entertained.
If you are lucky enough to be staying in the master en-suite room in Chalet B at Trois Couronnes you have a 19th century elevator that drops you right by the pool. Heated by solar and geothermal power, it also boasts an art gallery, wine cellar and banqueting hall.

Chalet stay or chalet go now?
Watch any ski race on TV and you will hear the same dull, persistent background clanging of cowbells ringing. Marcel Hirscher's feet are pictured here next to a cowbell during the podium ceremony of the men's slalom race at the FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup in January 2012.
Over the last two decades cowbells, already steeped in Alpine history, have become a global success and Winter Olympic icon.
Bells have been used, especially in downhill skiing, for a long time. It started in Switzerland, where in summer the cows all walk around the mountains with bells on.
"If the Swiss are coming to an event they'll bring really big bells, a foot high or more," said California-based cowbell importer Elisabeth Halvorson.
Cycling and triathlon are increasingly the domain of the cowbell. Tennis racket manufacturers gave away branded versions at the U.S. Open. Here a fan of the Tampa Bay Rays is pictured holds up a cow bell during game one of the 2008 MLB World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Go to most major sporting events in 2013 and the ambience will be provided by vast, booming speaker systems. The sound of the vuvezela at the World Cup in 2010 offered a very different soundscape.
Back in 1949, football fans in England came to matches armed with very different instruments of noise -- wooden rattles.
When a Winter Olympics is within sight, cowbells become Norwegian cowbell manufacturer Moen's hottest commodity. The company produces approximately 30,000 bells each year, but in an Olympic Year over twice as many cowbells would be churned out.
The ting-a-ling sensation of a cowbell feels warm and traditional -- part of the very fabric of sport.
"For us, it started before the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer in 1994," said Moen Grude, chief executive of the Norwegian company. "The fans saw it as the only souvenir that let them take the spirit of the Olympics back home."
Cowbells have many different uses and are not just for skiing fans. Here American sprinter Carl Lewis of the USA is presented in 1997 with a huge cow-bell by promoter Andreas Brugger at the IAAF Weltklasse Grand Prix at the Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich, Switzerland.

Noise and sport: how the cowbell came of age
Lindsey Vonn is a marketeer's dream, with her skiing prowess and profile taking the sport to new corners of North America.
Vonn burst on to the scene as a 16-year-old and represented the U.S. team on home soil at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 as a 17-year-old.
Skiing is a treacherous sport, demonstrated by this fall Vonn had at the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin. She was airlifted to hospital but returned two days later to compete and finished eighth. Her grit earned her the U.S. Olympic Spirit Award.
Vonn married fellow U.S. skier Thomas Vonn in 2007. Vonn also became her coach. The pair split in November 2011.
Vonn secured her first World Cup title in 2008. She set a new record for the most World Cup downhill victories in a season with 10. Vonn would go on to win it again two years in a row and now has four to her name.
Another serious injury, this time to her thumb, ruled Vonn out of the World Ski Championships in Val d'Isere back in February 2009.
Vonn's only Olympic gold medal to date came in the downhill competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. "Seeing my name and the number one next to it was the best feeling I've had in my life," she told reporters.
Lake Louise is Vonn's playground. She has dominated there in recent years, winning all three downhill events in December 2012, like she did the year before. Her request to race against the men there this year was rejected.
Vonn missed out on a fourth successive World Cup title to her good friend Maria Riesch by three points in 2011.
Vonn took time out of her preparations for an Alpine World Cup event in Val d'Isere to catch up with CNN's Alpine Edge show.

Vonn and on: Lindsey's quest
For freestyle skiing's fans, TV is largely irrelevant. Their home is the web, where anyone with the right moves and a camera can find a huge audience.
Meet the Hannula brothers -- Ilkka and Verneri, both 19 -- their friend Juho Kilkki, 20, and cameraman Janne Korpela, 18. They call themselves Real Skifi. They live in the town of Jyvaskyla, in central Finland, and the internet loves them.
"Our latest episode has been viewed over half a million times," Korpela tells CNN. "I didn't dare to dream we would get this popular."
The quartet spend their days and Jyvaskyla's long, dark midwinter nights finding rails, walls and other beguiling items of street furniture in their hometown. What they find, they ski on. Or over, or under, or through. They call it "urban skiing."
"We try to choose our spots so we aren't too close to people's homes," says Korpela. "The one time the police kicked us out was when we were filming about 200 meters from the local hospital, in between two roads."
Dozens of dangerous takes might be needed to get each trick right, but it pays off: short compilations are uploaded to Vimeo and each one becomes a hit with thousands of Facebook fans. There have, as yet, been no serious injuries.
Disciplines like slopestyle incorporate a lot of the same moves you will see Real Skifi pulling off in their videos.
As a sport, freestyle speaks to them far more than watching one skier after another race the clock down the same old slope -- Vonn or no Vonn.
Read: The art of noise: How the cowbell came of age
"It would be boring to just ski down the slope," says Verneri Hannula. "That's why we like to do tricks. When we do tricks, the only limit is our imagination. But when we do alpine skiing, the limit is the 100m-high slope we have."
Kilkki adds: "The only skiing you see on television is pretty much alpine stuff, and that's boring to my eyes.
To me, there are too many Olympic events. They keep inventing more and more, and they're all relatively minor John Fry, International Skiing History Association president
"Freeskiing is a wildly rising sport. Our local ski hill is full of young kids on their new twin tips (double-ended freestyle skis). That's one reason our videos have become popular. Freeskiing is a lot different from alpine, the videos are a much bigger part of the sport."
Freestyle skiing now enticingly combines a young, passionate fanbase, avidly consuming the sport through the web, with a raft of Olympic disciplines which are guaranteed mainstream airtime next year.
But if alpine racing's position on top of the pile is ever to be truly threatened, freestyle needs to match alpine's impressive presence on worldwide TV, which remains the kingmaker of sports even this far into the 21st Century.
For example, Olympic downhill champion Vonn (televised) has more than 150,000 Twitter followers; ski cross world champion Serwa (streamed) has 650. That makes Sochi 2014 an unparalleled opportunity which freestyle athletes know they must take.
"Alpine will always be strong, it has its roots set pretty deep," admits Serwa. "But we're going to get more followers from a younger crowd. We race at the X Games and that crowd, those kinds of kids will be watching it when they grow up.
"Right now we're battling most with exposure. I believe we have only three or four races broadcast in Canada this year, and last year we had none, not even a race that was held in Canada. For us to get big, we need that TV time.
"Once people see freestyle skiing, they'll really get into it. We won't have to do anything different from what we're doing right now to get people to follow it."

Independent's Day: King hopes to bridge divided D.C.
By Alan Silverleib, CNN Congressional Producer
updated 2:00 PM EST, Fri February 15, 2013
Sen.-elect Angus King, I-Maine, speaks to members of his staff at the U.S. Capitol after being elected last year.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Angus King, an independent, was elected to the Senate from Maine last year
King caucuses with Democrats, but hopes to be a bridge between the two parties
King bemoans the decline of centrism and compromise in politics
King's personal hero is Civil War leader Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain
Washington (CNN) -- Angus King knows a thing or two about deep political divides.
Raised near the shadow of Robert E. Lee's Virginia home, Maine's freshman senator today lives down the street from the house once owned by Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Union hero who oversaw the formal surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox.
Chamberlain ordered his men "to salute the Confederate soldiers as they were surrendering their arms," King told an audience in 2009. "This was an unbelievably controversial act (but) it was the right thing to do. ... (It) helped profoundly to repair the breach of the Civil War."
Chamberlain "is my hero," King told CNN in a recent interview on Capitol Hill. A bust of the colonel greets visitors to King's Senate office. A depiction of Chamberlain's desperate defense of Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg hangs on the wall.
Career in government: Governor of Maine, 1994-2002; aide to Maine Sen. William Hathaway, chief counsel to U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics, 1972-1975.
Professional career: Founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc., energy conservation project developer, 1989-1994; general counsel and VP, Swift River/Hafslund Co., 1983-1988; host, MaineWatch on Maine public television, 1975-1993; attorney, Smith, Lloyd and King, 1975-1983; staff attorney, Pine Tree Legal Assistance, 1969-1972.
Born: March 31, 1944, in Alexandria, Virginia
Education: B.A., Dartmouth College, 1966; law degree, University of Virginia, 1969
Family: Married to Mary Herman; four sons and one daughter; five grandchildren
In today's harshly polarized political climate, King, 68, is the rarest breed of Washington politician -- an independent, beholden to neither political party. A popular former two-term governor, he was swept into the Senate last November in a landslide.
He now occupies the seat previously held by Olympia Snowe, who surprisingly announced her retirement in early 2012. Snowe also was a rarity in national politics, a genuinely moderate Republican in an age of growing tea party turmoil.
King caucuses with Democrats. While aligning with one of the two parties is necessary to obtain valuable committee assignments and protect his state's interests, the political maverick insists he will not be in "automatic opposition" to either party.
"Being fiercely independent doesn't mean you have to be fierce," he declared on election night. The goal is "to be a bridge between my new colleagues on either side of the aisle, to bring people and our country closer to that more perfect union envisioned by our founders."
Senator questions drone killings
Building SOTU expecatations
Sen. King: Working together in Congress
King told jubilant supporters that his election "and the message it sends can make a difference in the poisonous atmosphere of American politics today."
So roughly 40 days into his term, is the atmosphere on the Potomac as poisonous as he expected?
"I don't think so," he told CNN. "Or at least not so far. I think maybe that's the best way to put it. ... There are some glimmers of light."
Filibuster deal a glimmer of hope
One glimmer was the recent bipartisan negotiation over filibuster reform -- an attempt to get the Senate's legislative gears turning again by reducing the number of procedural roadblocks and showdowns requiring 60-vote supermajorities. While the relatively small changes enacted were "not as extensive as I would have liked, (they were) the result of bipartisan discussion, listening and compromise," King said. "That's what we want."
King is optimistic about immigration reform. The contentious issue rocketed up the GOP's priority list in the wake of Mitt Romney's dismal showing among Hispanic voters last fall, and President Barack Obama renewed his push on the issue in the State of the Union address.
A "bipartisan group of senators (is) talking about immigration ... and (considering) a pretty substantive package," King said. These are "not just vague goals but pretty clear steps. So those are positive signs."
King says he's now met individually with about 40 senators from both parties, and hasn't met anyone who fits "the pompous, pretentious, condescending movie image of the senator who talks in platitudes."
"What I've met are a lot of people who come from a variety of walks of life, who are here because they want to solve problems. They (just) have different views of how to do it."
As for his relationship with Senate GOP leaders since caucusing with the Democrats, King insists he's been "warmly received."
"All I can tell you is impressions," he cautioned. "We're not blood brothers, but ... I'm being treated with respect and with a degree of cordiality."
In meeting with several Republicans, "they're finding I'm not exactly the guy they thought I was," he told CNN.
"For example, (when) we're talking about regulation and I express my skepticism about overregulation and my desire to minimize and streamline regulation, you can almost see them say, 'hmm, this isn't what I thought.'"
Like most people in Congress, King is frustrated by what he describes as the self-inflicted wound of the looming budget sequester. The sequester is Washington-speak for nearly $1 trillion in new spending cuts across government agencies. The Pentagon will account for about half the savings, which would total roughly $85 billion this year alone. They are set to take effect on March 1 absent an agreement in Congress to defer or avert them entirely.
King blasted the process that led to sequester -- specifically the failure of a 2011 congressional super committee to agree on a more reasonably designed deficit-reduction package.
The sequester cuts were "supposed to be the sword of Damocles over the super committee and the super committee failed to reach a consensus. So here we are," King said. "We're like Wile E. Coyote, where we throw the anvil off the cliff, run to the bottom, and then act surprised when it hits us on the head."
Sequester a 'self-inflicted crisis'
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, presents Sen.-elect Angus King with Senate cufflinks in Collins' Capitol Hill office.
This "is a totally self-inflicted crisis," he noted. "There's nothing magic about March 1. There's no credit default or immediate impact or anything. It's a totally arbitrary date and it just makes no sense. ... We're in a very fragile recovery right now, and to suddenly slam the breaks on a significant hunk of federal spending could very easily tip us back into some kind of recession."
King supports gradual deficit reduction efforts, but warns that both parties' sacred cows have to be on the table. For Republicans, that means higher taxes. For Democrats, Medicare and Medicaid.
"The sequester hits the two areas of the budget (defense and non-defense discretionary spending) that are in pretty decent control," he insisted. "The conventional wisdom that the federal government is out of control and spending is out of control (in these areas) just isn't accurate in terms of the numbers."
Unlike a lot of congressional freshmen, King isn't a Washington novice. His first stint on Capitol Hill came in the 1970s as an aide to William Hathaway, then a Democratic senator from Maine. Asked what's changed the most since, King cited the sharp rise in partisanship as more conservatives became Republicans and more liberals became Democrats.
"When I was here in the '70s there was a swath of ideological views from the right to the left. But it wasn't necessarily strictly according to party," he said. "One of the most conservative people in the Congress was John Stennis of Mississippi. He was a Democrat. One of the most liberal people in the Congress was Jacob Javits of New York, a Republican. So there was a lot of overlap, and there was a lot more willingness to sit down and try to find bipartisan solutions."
King remembers sitting in closed committee sessions and seeing legislative giants "argue and disagree and say 'that won't work' or 'this won't work.' But ultimately they found some kind of consensus and moved on."
"I was here two and a half years and I don't remember a single filibuster on anything," he said.
Today, Maine still has ideological diversity across the political spectrum. King's home state colleague is moderate Republican Susan Collins, but that's the exception to the increasingly ironclad rule.
What happened to the liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats? Why did they disappear?
King cites three factors: Increasingly precise gerrymandering of congressional districts, the fragmentation and balkanization of the news media, and an explosion of special interest money due partly to court rulings like Citizens United.
King's hero, Union Gen. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, was instrumental in the North's decisive battlefield victory at Gettysburg.
"Both parties, but particularly the Republicans, have sort of pulled back toward their base," King noted. "The Republicans have practically no moderates left. And 25, 30 years ago the Senate was full of them. ... That's a recipe for confrontation. You add all those things together and it has created a much more partisan atmosphere."
Trailblazing Maine senator another hero
Next to the depiction of Chamberlain's Gettysburg heroics hanging in King's office, there is a black and white picture of Margaret Chase Smith.
Smith, a trailblazing Maine Republican who served in Senate from 1949 to 1973, was the first woman to have her name in placed in nomination for president at a major party's political convention. She also led the charge against fellow Republican Joe McCarthy with her "Declaration of Conscience" speech on the Senate floor in 1950.
"She was no liberal, but she was certainly an independent thinker," King said. "I think she would chafe at the expectation of partisanship. She was a bit of a maverick (and) was never one of the good old boys. ... She had no trouble standing on her hind legs and calling them as she saw them."
While King draws inspiration from the memory of Smith and other Maine political giants, he also turns to religion.
A lifelong Episcopalian, he attends church regularly.
"I believe in a God who is engaged with the world but that we are individuals of free will who carry out his will," King said. "It's a paradox."
Faith is "a source of strength and perseverance under difficult circumstances," he added. "I want to live my faith and reflect it in my work, but I view it as personal guidance for me, not how other people should act."
But it's the story of Chamberlain that may resonate most deeply in terms of King's independent political career. A four-term governor, president of Bowdoin College, and eventual Medal of Honor winner, Chamberlain fell out of favor with Maine's political establishment.
King notes that local Republicans turned on Chamberlain with a vengeance for failing to support the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson -- a stance which probably cost the Civil War hero a U.S. Senate seat.
"He was deemed too independent," King said. Chamberlain instead ended his career as surveyor of the port of Portland.
The lesson of Chamberlain's life? That's an easy one.
"Do the right thing," King said. "And don't be afraid to charge every now and then."

Above the law: America's worst charities By Kris Hundley and Kendall Taggart, Special to CNN
updated 7:50 AM EDT, Thu June 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A year-long investigation identified America's 50 worst charities
At the top of the list is Kids Wish Network, which gave nearly $110m to corporate solicitors
This charity, like many others on the list, mimic well-known charity names that fool donors The data show the worst charities devote less than 4% of donations to direct cash aid Editor's note: CNN has partnered with the Tampa Bay Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting to showcase the results of their year-long investigation to identify America's worst charities.
(CNN) -- The worst charity in America operates from a metal warehouse behind a gas station in Holiday, Florida.
Every year, Kids Wish Network raises millions of dollars in donations in the name of dying children and their families.
Every year, it spends less than 3 cents on the dollar helping kids.
Most of the rest gets diverted to enrich the charity's operators and the for-profit companies Kids Wish hires to drum up donations.
In the past decade alone, Kids Wish has channeled nearly $110 million donated for sick children to its corporate solicitors. An additional $4.8 million has gone to pay the charity's founder and his own consulting firms.
No charity in the nation has siphoned more money away from the needy over a longer period of time.
But Kids Wish is not an isolated case, a yearlong investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and The Center for Investigative Reporting has found.
Using state and federal records, the Times and CIR identified nearly 6,000 charities that have chosen to pay for-profit companies to raise their donations.
Then reporters took an unprecedented look back to zero in on the 50 worst - based on the money they diverted to boiler room operators and other solicitors over a decade.
America's 50 worst charities
These nonprofits adopt popular causes or mimic well-known charity names that fool donors. Then they rake in cash, year after year.
A year-long investigation by the Tampa Bay Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting ranks these U.S. charities as the five worst, based on money blown on soliciting costs, according to the latest 10 years of available tax filings. Click through the gallery for more details. No. 1: Kids Wish Network: In the past decade alone, Kids Wish has channeled nearly $110 million donated for sick children to its corporate fund-raisers. That makes it the worst charity in the nation, according to a Times/CIR review of charities that have steered the most money to professional solicitation companies over time. Kids Wish Network says it has helped make a positive difference for thousands of children.
No. 2: Cancer Fund of America: CFA raises millions yearly and sends 82% to its for-profit fund-raisers. Over the past decade, fund-raisers have collected $98 million in donations. Patients have gotten less than $1 million in direct cash aid over those 10 years, IRS records show. The group's founder said, "We can only help others with the funds we net whether it be 90 or 20%."
No. 3: Children's Wish Foundation International: This group reported spending about $600,000 granting wishes to terminally ill children in 2010 and gave them donated goods valued at $3 million. It paid professional fund-raisers nearly $6 million for their services that year. Its founder said telemarketing has helped the charity find children in need of its help.
No. 4: American Breast Cancer Foundation: One of the most wasteful charities in the nation for 13 years, this group lured donors by promising to pay for breast cancer screenings. It now says it's using community events to raise money. In its latest tax filing, the charity reported giving a total of $100,000 to five medical facilities to help pay for breast cancer screening services for low-income women.
No. 5: Firefighters Charitable Foundation: This group says it provides financial assistance to people who have been affected by a fire or disaster. From 2002 to 2011, it raised $64 million in donations and paid $55 million of that to its solicitors. The charity spent less than 10 cents of every dollar raised on direct financial assistance to those in need. The group said in 2007 that it planned to change. That hasn't happened.

5 worst charities
Scam artists target tornado victims Beware of these cancer charity rip-offs
Beware fake Boston bombing charities
Official: Scam allegations are shocking
Can charities be trusted to do good?
The nation's 50 worst charities have paid their solicitors nearly $1 billion over the past 10 years that could have gone to charitable works.
AC360: CNN's Drew Griffin investigates
Until today, no one had tallied the cost of this parasitic segment of the nonprofit industry or traced the long history of its worst offenders.
Among the findings:
-- The 50 worst charities in America devote less than 4% of donations raised to direct cash aid. Some charities gave even less. Over a decade, one diabetes charity raised nearly $14 million and gave about $10,000 to patients. Six spent no cash at all on their cause.
-- Even as they plead for financial support, operators at many of the 50 worst charities have lied to donors about where their money goes, taken multiple salaries, secretly paid themselves consulting fees or arranged fund-raising contracts with friends. One cancer charity paid a company owned by the president's son nearly $18 million over eight years to solicit funds. A medical charity paid its biggest research grant to its president's own for-profit company.
-- Some nonprofits are little more than fronts for fund-raising companies, which bankroll their startup costs, lock them into exclusive contracts at exorbitant rates and even drive the charities into debt. Florida-based Project Cure has raised more than $65 million since 1998, but every year has wound up owing its fundraiser more than what was raised. According to its latest financial filing, the nonprofit is $3 million in debt.
-- To disguise the meager amount of money that reaches those in need, charities use accounting tricks and inflate the value of donated dollar-store cast-offs - snack cakes and air fresheners - that they give to dying cancer patients and homeless veterans.
Over the past six months, the Times and CIR called or mailed certified letters to the leaders of Kids Wish Network and the 49 other charities that have paid the most to solicitors.
Most declined to answer questions about their programs or would speak only through an attorney.
Approached in person, one charity manager threatened to call the police; another refused to open the door. A third charity's president took off in his truck at the sight of a reporter with a camera.
Kids Wish has hired Melissa Schwartz, a crisis management specialist in New York City who previously worked for the federal government after the 2010 BP oil spill.
Schwartz said Kids Wish hires solicitors so its staff can focus on working with children, not on raising donations. According to its 2011 IRS filing, the charity has 51 employees. Schwartz also said donors who give directly to the charity instead of in response to solicitations ensure that 100% of their pledge will be spent granting wishes.
She declined to answer additional questions about Kids Wish's fund-raising operations, saying the charity "is focused on the future."
Charity operators who would talk defended their work, saying raising money is expensive especially in tough economic times.
"No parent has ever turned me down for assistance because we got our money from a telemarketer," said David Thelen, who runs the Committee for Missing Children in Lawrenceville, Georgia. The charity is No. 13 on the Times/CIR list.
Identifying the 50 worst To identify America's 50 worst charities, the Times and CIR pieced together tens of thousands of pages of public records collected by the federal government and 36 states. Reporters started in California, Florida and New York, where regulators require charities to report results of individual fund-raising campaigns.
Fundraising company under investigation
Berger: Do research before donating
Should charity marketers be avoided?
The Times and CIR used those records to flag a specific kind of charity: those that pay for-profit corporations to raise the vast majority of their donations year in and year out.
Search for charities that have been disciplined
The effort identified hundreds of charities that run donation drives across the country and regularly give their solicitors at least two-thirds of the take. Experts say good charities should spend about half that much - no more than 35 cents to raise a dollar.
For the worst charities, writing big checks to telemarketers isn't an anomaly. It's a way of life.
The Times and CIR charted each charity's performance over the past decade and ranked them based on the total donations diverted to fundraisers, arriving at the 50 worst charities. By this measure, Kids Wish tops the list.
Tracking donations diverted to fund-raising is just one way to rate a charity's performance. But experts called the rating fair and said it would provide a unique resource to help donors avoid bad charities.
Doug White, one of the nation's foremost experts on the ethics of charity fund-raising, dismisses the argument made by charities that without telemarketers they would have no money.
"When you weigh that in terms of values, of what the charity is supposed to be doing and what the donor is being told in the process, the house comes tumbling down," said White, who teaches in Columbia University's fund-raising management master's degree program.
Share your tips on suspicious charities
Collectively the 50 worst charities raised more than $1.3 billion over the past decade and paid nearly $1 billion of that directly to the companies that raise their donations.
If that money had gone to charity, it would have been enough to build 20,000 Habitat for Humanity homes, buy 7 million wheelchairs or pay for mammograms for nearly 10 million uninsured women.
Instead it funded charities like Youth Development Fund.
The Tennessee charity, which came in at No. 12, has been around for 30 years. Over the past decade it has raised nearly $30 million from donors by promising to educate children about drug abuse, health and fitness.
About 80% of what's donated each year goes directly to solicitation companies.
Most of what's left pays for one thing: scuba-diving videos starring the charity's founder and president, Rick Bowen.
Bowen's charity pays his own for-profit production company about $200,000 a year to make the videos. Then the charity pays to air Rick Bowen Deep-Sea Diving on a local Knoxville station. The program makes no mention of Youth Development Fund.
In its IRS tax filings, the charity reports that its programming reaches "an estimated audience of 1.3 million."
But, according to the station manager, the show attracts about 3,600 viewers a week.
Bowen, who runs the charity out of his Knoxville condo, declined to be interviewed. He defended the practice of hiring his own company with the public's donations.
"We just happened to be the low bidder," he said.
Good vs. bad charities
America's worst charities look nothing like Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls Clubs or thousands of other charities, large and small, that are dedicated to helping the sick and needy.
Key questions to ask someone requesting a charitable donation:
• What is the full name of the charity?
• Do you work for a paid fundraiser?
• How much of my donation actually goes to charity?
• Will any local programs directly benefit? If so, how?
• What is the website address of the charity?
Well-run charities rely on their own staff to raise money from a variety of sources. They spend most of their donations on easy-to-verify activities, whether it's running soup kitchens, supporting cancer research, raising awareness about drunken driving or building homes for veterans.
The Times/CIR list of worst charities, meanwhile, is littered with organizations that exhibit red flags for fraud, waste and mismanagement.
Thirty-nine have been disciplined by state regulators, some as many as seven times.
Eight of the charities have been banned in at least one state.
One was shut down by regulators but reopened under a new name.
A third of the charities' founders and executives have put relatives on the payroll or the board of directors.
How states failed to regulate charity scams
For eight years, American Breast Cancer Foundation paid Joseph Wolf's telemarketing company to generate donations.
His mother, Phyllis Wolf, had founded the Baltimore-based charity and was its president until she was forced to resign in 2010.
While she ran the charity, her son's company, Non Profit Promotions, collected $18 million in telemarketing fees.
Phyllis Wolf left the charity after the payments to her son attracted media attention in 2010. The charity has since stopped using telemarketers, including Joseph Wolf's.
Phyllis and Joseph Wolf did not respond to several calls seeking comment.
How to help: CNN's Impact Your World
The nation's worst charities are large and small. Some are one-person outfits operating from run-down apartments. Others claim hundreds of employees and a half-dozen locations around the country. One lists a UPS mail box as its headquarters address.
Several play off the names of well-known organizations, confusing donors.
Among those on the Times/CIR list are Kids Wish Network, Children's Wish Foundation International and Wishing Well Foundation. All of the names sound like the original, Make-A-Wish, which does not hire professional telemarketers.
Make-A-Wish officials say they've spent years fielding complaints from people who were solicited by sound-a-like charities.
"While some of the donations go elsewhere, all the bad public relations that comes with telemarketing seems to come to us," said Make-A-Wish spokesman Paul Allvin.
Donors who answer calls from the 50 worst charities hear professionally honed messages, designed to leverage popular causes and hide one crucial fact: Almost nothing goes to charity.
When telemarketers for Kids Wish call potential donors, they open with a name you think you've heard before.
Then they ask potential donors to "imagine the heartbreak of losing a child to a terminal illness," according to scripts filed with North Carolina regulators in 2010.
Kids Wish, the callers say, wants to fulfill their wishes "while they are still healthy enough to enjoy them."
They leave out the fact that most of the charity's good deeds involve handing out gift cards to hospitalized children and donated coloring books and board games to healthy kids around the country. And they don't mention the millions of dollars spent on salaries and fund-raising every year.
The biggest difference between good charities and the nation's worst is the bottom line.
Every charity has salary, overhead and fund-raising costs.
But several watchdog organizations say charities should spend no more than 35% of the money they raise on fund-raising expenses.
The Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central and North Florida is one of dozens of Make-A-Wish chapters across the country.
Last year, it reported raising $3.1 million cash and spent about 60% of that -- $1.8 million -- granting wishes.
The same year, Kids Wish raised $18.6 million, its tax filing shows. It spent just $240,000 granting wishes -- 1% of the cash raised.

There yet? UPS, FedEx moving Christmas packages late
By Josh Levs, CNN

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: FedEx had "isolated incidents," the company says Some customers say UPS packages were declared "delivered" but weren't The U.S. Postal Service says it did some deliveries on Christmas Amazon refunds shipping for UPS packages and offers gift cards
(CNN) -- UPS has trucks up and running Thursday -- and hopes that holiday cheer may assuage the frustrations of angry customers.
The shipping giant's backlog left some Americans with gifts missing from under the Christmas tree Wednesday.
"We're terribly sorry," spokeswoman Natalie Black told CNN.
FedEx was late with some deliveries as well, but those were "isolated incidents," the company said in a statement Thursday.
FedEx "experienced no major service disruptions in the week before Christmas despite heavy volume. Every single package is important to us, and we will continue to work directly with customers to address any isolated incidents," the statement said.
On Wednesday, FedEx spokesman Scott Fiedler told The Associated Press, "We're sorry that there could be delays and we're contacting affected customers who have shipments available for pickup."
The U.S. Postal Service had no immediate comment on whether it experienced any similar delays. Spokeswoman Zy Richardson said in an e-mail, "We take great pride in delivering packages for our customers in time for their holiday. ... Our carriers continued to deliver mail on Christmas Day, in many locations, to make sure everyone enjoyed their holiday." UPS did some package sorting Wednesday, but the company stuck to its plan to make no deliveries on Christmas, giving drivers a break after doing a lot of special deliveries Sunday.
Both UPS and FedEx noted they were handling hundreds of millions of shipments in a compressed holiday shopping time frame, because Thanksgiving was later than usual this year.
FedEx is projected to handle 275 million shipments, and "operated with very high service levels -- over 99% at FedEx Ground, for example -- during our busiest time of the year," Fiedler's statement said.
Black, at UPS, said that last week, during the peak of shipping season, "we projected to deliver more than 132 million packages."
The company got more air shipments than it expected and was already dealing with a backlog from previous severe weather in the Dallas area, Black said.
"Thanks for totally screwing us AND lying about it all day," customer Mo Husseini posted on Twitter in response to a UPS tweet.
Some packages declared 'delivered' weren't, customers say
Some UPS customers said they received tracking notices stating their packages had been delivered. But they weren't.
And they complained about their experience on Twitter.
"Expected 3 packages on Xmas eve. All marked 'Delivered - Left at Other - Released' at exactly 5 pm," Von Hertzog tweeted. "No delivery made here. Answers?"
UPS customer support tweeted back, providing an e-mail address to help get the situation resolved.
But the company had no immediate comment Thursday about what may have happened.
"We know how hard it is for everyone to receive their holiday packages, and we're working around the clock to resolve this issue," Black said Wednesday.
On the company's Facebook page, Melissa Gilbreath wrote that she ordered her sons' gifts on December 9, but the packages have sat in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 18. "I realize it is not about the gifts but that is part of Christmas," she wrote.
But the Facebook page is also filled with messages from people who say they are UPS employees and proud of their work and the company. "We all work really hard and I think people have too high of expectations," Misty Fulton wrote.
Amazon responds
Online retailers who promised customers delivery in time for Christmas have been affected by UPS' problems.
Some customers received messages from Amazon.com alerting them of the "failure in the UPS transportation network." In the message, the company offered to refund shipping charges and provide gift cards.
"Amazon fulfillment centers processed and tendered customer orders to delivery carriers on time for holiday delivery," spokeswoman Mary Osako told CNN. "We are reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers."
"We have a relationship with Amazon. We will definitely work with all of our retailers," Black said. "We're going to make good on our service commitments. What that exactly entails I don't know, but we'll work with them to maintain that relationship."
After January 2, the day the industry processes returns of holiday gifts, the company will examine what happened and gauge its contingency planning and losses, she said.
Weather has caused delays in previous years. Technical glitches have as well, but Black said it's been "quite some time" since that happened.
Medicine didn't arrive
The backlog isn't just affecting Christmas presents.
The Warren family of Heath, Texas, had to go a few days without special medicine their 14-year-old son needs in order to eat. "It was just sitting" at a UPS outlet in Mesquite, where the family finally picked it up, Patrick Warren told CNN affiliate WFAA-TV on Tuesday.
"People are really upset in there. They have security guards," one woman outside the UPS distribution center in Fort Worth told WFAA.
CNN's Lateef Mungin, Ryan Rios and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.
