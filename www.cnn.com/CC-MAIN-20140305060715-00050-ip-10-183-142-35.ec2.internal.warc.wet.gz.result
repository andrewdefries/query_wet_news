Why suing McDonald's could be a good thing

FINDLAWFOR THE PUBLICSelect a topicAutosBankruptcyConsumerCriminal LawDivorceEmploymentEstate PlanningFamilyImmigrationLandlord-TenantPersonal InjuryTaxes Legal commentary from FindLaw's WritLAW DICTIONARY (FindLaw) -- Last year, Bronx teenagers Ashley Pelman and Jazlyn Bradley sued McDonald's, claiming that it had caused them to become obese and unhealthy. Earlier in January, however, New York federal judge Robert Sweet dismissed their case, Pelman v. McDonald's Corp.
The problem, Judge Sweet explained, was that the girls' complaint was not specific enough. Complaints, under modern federal practice, are allowed to be quite spare, but Judge Sweet still held that the plaintiffs here had fallen short.
The judge did permit the girls to amend their complaint and presumably, they will do so. However, Judge Sweet's opinion suggests that they are unlikely ultimately to prevail.
The judge ruled that, to survive another motion to dismiss, the girls must allege (and be prepared to prove) that McDonald's has successfully fooled its customers into a state of ignorance about the health risks of eating its product and that in the absence of McDonald's deception, they would not have become overweight.
Why the lawsuit appears ridiculous at first glance
From the moment that the case was filed, it struck most people as the punchline of a joke. Question: "What do you do if you become obese from eating too much fast food?" Answer: "Sue McDonald's." From a comedian's perspective, the lawsuit was almost too good to be true. Who could be more undeserving of compensation than McDonald's customers who "supersize" their meals?
Both the girls' lawsuit, and the similar suit brought by plaintiff Caesar Barber -- which was modeled quite deliberately on the tobacco litigation -- have faced significant legal and public relations hurdles from the start.
Nonetheless, it may be beneficial for a suit to have been brought to try to force McDonald's to pay for the harm that it knowingly inflicts in the name of profits. A lawsuit, in other words, is not solely about compensating deserving plaintiffs. It is also about making companies internalize the costs of business, when those costs would otherwise fall primarily on others.
How litigation can help internalize the costs that a business inflicts on others
As now-Judge Guido Calabresi pointed out years ago, a business (or, for that matter, an individual) that imposes costs upon others, but not upon itself, is likely to pursue activities that are not cost-justified.
To put it a different way, if my conduct hurts you but makes me rich, then even if the harm to you is much greater than the benefit to me, I may nonetheless consider my conduct worthwhile. Costly though they are, my actions' costs may not bother me as much if I don't have to bear them, particularly if I am a corporation whose primary (or perhaps even sole) objective is profit.
Consider an example. Suppose I drive an enormous SUV that pollutes the air more than other vehicles do. Though I too breathe the air, most of the excess pollution that my car generates will be inhaled by others.
On the plus side, my larger car may give me prestige and allow me to transport all of the things that I might want to have throughout the week, rather than having to feel stressed each morning as I determine what I will need to pack into the car for the day. A big car may also make it easier for me to avoid being cut off on the highway and to cut off others if I am in a big hurry.
The bulk of benefits associated with my giant car apparently accrue to me, while the bulk of costs accrue to others. Accordingly, my inclination -- in the absence of altruism -- will be to purchase the big car, rather than a smaller one that might have greater fuel efficiency. Why not? The negative effects of my choice are experienced externally, by others rather than by me.
For me to make a decision that properly weighs all costs and benefits, a higher tax on gas might be a necessary step. Such a tax, which would make me pay more for using extra fuel and dirtying the air to a greater extent, would "internalize" some of the costs I cause -- meaning that I would have to bear them.
Internalizing costs gives someone like me an incentive to keep costs down -- for instance, it may motivate me not to choose an SUV.
Externalities at McDonald's: Health effects
Perhaps that's true, you might be thinking, but what does it have to do with McDonald's? Unlike the purchaser of a gas guzzling vehicle who hurts all who must breathe the dirty air, the consumer who buys and eats her meals at McDonald's hurts only herself: She is the one who becomes obese and develops heart disease or diabetes.
Therefore, you might reasonably suggest, the consumer is already well situated to perform a valid cost/benefit analysis. If I eat Big Macs (and the other delights that McDonald's has to offer) every day and become morbidly obese and sick, it would seem that I have my own gluttony -- and not some other actors' selfish disregard for my interests -- to blame. Both the benefits (pleasure) and the costs (weight gain and bad health) should register on my internal balance sheet.
This position sounds persuasive. However, as anyone who has tried to diet but failed repeatedly, knows, immediate benefits often feel a lot more beneficial than more substantial, delayed costs feel costly. Therefore, McDonald's may be more like the SUV owner than meets the eye.
This intuition, moreover, is borne out empirically. As George Ainslie demonstrates in his book, "Breakdown of Will," human beings and animals both engage in a process called "hyperbolic discounting," which systematically undermines the proper internalization of future costs. This problem is only aggravated in the case of youths such as the Pelman plaintiffs, one of whom is only fourteen years old.
How can plaintiffs be made to face those future costs realistically? Taxes might work. Currently, however, McDonald's low prices fail to reflect such future costs.
Potential liability could similarly help McDonald's to internalize the health costs of its business that are otherwise disproportionately or entirely borne by consumers, who -- in all likelihood -- are not well-situated to consider the future suffering they will experience if they pass through those golden arches. In addition, a tax or liability could reduce the load on other cost-bearers who have little control over consumer choices: Medicare, Medicaid, and state health care systems that must pay when consumers' eating too many meals at McDonald's damages their health.
Like the consumer of the giant car that guzzles gas, the consumer of Big Macs might buy a more wholesome alternative if prices were comparable. One way to make them comparable is to impose a tax on unhealthy food. Another is lawsuits that translate suffering into liability, and force companies to raise prices in response to high damages awards.
Other externalities at McDonald's: Suffering of animals
Health harms are not the only costs McDonald's fails to internalize. There is an additional feature of its business that also brings harms which fail to touch (and therefore to "count" for) McDonald's. That feature is the suffering of animals kept in cruel and horrific conditions and then slaughtered on an assembly line, to produce McDonald's products.
McDonald's is reportedly one of the largest purchasers of factory-farmed beef in the world. Factory farming, in turn, involves cruelty to animals on a scale that is historically unprecedented. As Matthew Scully put it in his eloquent, compelling, recent book, "Dominion,": "[n]o age has ever been more solicitous to animals, more curious and caring. Yet no age has ever inflicted upon animals such massive punishments with such complete disregard, as witness scenes to be found on any given day at any modern industrial farm." McDonald's is complicit in this disregard.
The factory farms at which most meat is produced are grotesque in their treatment of animals. Animals are kept in filthy enclosures in which they lack the space to lie down and the opportunity to interact with each other. They can only stare out at the people who pass, and chew on the cage wire until their mouths bleed. Though mammals and birds, including cattle, pigs, and chickens bred for slaughter and consumption at McDonald's, are social animals, they are not given opportunities to play with one another or root around in the grass -- or, indeed, to do any of the things that farm animals on an old-fashioned farm do as a matter of course.
Then when it comes time to kill them, animals are put to death in view of their fellow creatures about to meet the same fate, screaming, bellowing, and fighting to the end. For many, there is no refuge from the misery and pain they endure from the moment of birth until a terrifying death, all for profit. As author Alice Walker described meat consumption in today's world, "You're just eating misery. You're eating a bitter life."
Once again, of course, the consumer must take his share of responsibility. No one forces people to eat at McDonald's or to eat meat at all, for that matter. Fast food meats are neither necessary nor even conducive to human health and flourishing.
Nonetheless, once again, it is McDonald's that profits without paying the costs it inflicts. It can charge the low prices it does because it externalizes the costs of its business. The more deprived and cruel the animal's life, it seems, the cheaper the burger at the end. And animal welfare laws -- most of which do not apply to "food animals" -- do virtually nothing to intervene.
Lessons from the McDonald's litigation
Does any of this mean that the plaintiffs should necessarily win their lawsuit? Not at all.
Consider what Judge Sweet has required the plaintiffs to allege and later prove. The girls must show that McDonald's deceived them about the health risks of its food. That might be possible -- they could cite, for instance, commercials with happy sports teams eating at McDonald's -- but it will be an uphill battle, when nutritional information is available at McDonald's for the asking.
They must also prove that they would not have become overweight absent McDonald's deception -- and that too, may be difficult, if the rest of the girls' diets are (like most Americans') far from faultless.
Meanwhile, the lawsuit does not challenge McDonald's role as a major participant in the cruel and unnecessary torture of animals, though many animal rights organizations publicize the fact.
Still, the McDonald's suit can provide some important lessons. It should remind us that a business's profits can sometimes be inflated relative to the benefits that the business truly confers. The inflation often reflects the fact that those who suffer, and those who profit from the suffering, are not the same individuals. And sometimes, there is no overlap at all. McDonald's shareholders may grow rich as its customers grow unhealthy and the animals it uses to make its products live and die in pain.
Litigation can play a role in correcting a flawed cost/benefit analysis. And it can also raise consciousness about an otherwise ignored phenomenon.
Perhaps it is the case, for example, that if paying for the obesity of its customers would drive McDonald's out of business, then McDonald's should not be in business in the first place. And if the animal welfare laws protected every sentient animal from gratuitous suffering, then it certainly would not be.

Bodies litter streets of Somali cityStory Highlights Resident says there are six bodies in front of her home Violence comes after Islamic group takes of port city of Kismayo Humanitarian group says 5,500 displayed after fighting Group says there is lack of medical care and only one doctor, two nurses at hospital Next Article in World » From Mohamed Amiin Adow Special to CNN (CNN) -- Bodies littered the streets of the third largest city in Somalia on Friday after Islamic fighters took control of the city, residents said. Fighters from the armed Islamic group Al Shabab took control of Kismayo, a port city in southern Somalia, after fighting between tribal militias. Kismayo is 300 miles southwest of Somalia's capital of Mogadishu. Halimo Mohamed Hassan, a mother in Kismayo's Alaney neighborhood, said six bodies were in front of her house.

"From 9 a.m. this morning, the fighting has intensified, with both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti-aircraft guns," she said. "My children and I took cover under our beds and we stayed for three hours, till the situation subsided." Hassan said heavily-armed Islamist militias remained on the streets, and the rival clan militia are rumored to have left the city in defeat. "There is (a) very harsh humanitarian crisis in the city," said Ali Bashi Abdullahi Igal, head of Fanole human rights group. "The fighting has displaced more than 5,500 people from the city." Fifteen civilians were killed on Friday, he said, including a mother and her two children, ages 3 and 5, who were crushed in their house when it collapsed under heavy anti-aircraft fire. More than 70 people were killed and 168 wounded in three days of heavy fighting between Al Shabab and tribal militias. "We are condemning this inhumane acts of violence," Igal said. "Both sides have breached the international laws." There is a lack of medical care for the wounded, with only one doctor and two nurses at the city's only operational hospital, he said. Civilians are "suffering at the hospital," Igal said.

Ancient skeletal remains shed new light on evolution By Alan Silverleib, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTS Unearthed remains are believed to be remains of an unknown species Partial skeletons of adult female and young male hominid are nearly 2 million years old. The species is thought to have been taller and stronger than older species Team leader says discovery may help clarify a murky biological picture of that time

(CNN) -- Scientists may have discovered a new branch on your family tree. A team of researchers working in South Africa has unearthed what they believe are the remains of a previously unknown species predating modern humans. They recently discovered a couple of partial skeletons -- an adult female and a juvenile male -- that are nearly 2 million years old. The two are believed to have been significantly taller and potentially stronger than "Lucy," the roughly 3 million year old skeleton discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Known as "Australopithecus sediba," the pair may provide a window into a previously little-defined period in human evolution. "Australopithecus" means "southern ape," the researchers noted. "Sediba" refers to a "natural spring" or "fountain" in Sotho, a local language in South Africa. The discovery of the remains was akin to stepping into a time machine, said Dr. Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It's providing a "really a special look into hominid evolution at that time," he told reporters. Blog: Using satellites to find skeletons Hominids are part of the biological family that includes humans, gorillas and chimpanzees. The two skeletons, discovered in the remains of a collapsed cave, were not alone. At least two more partial skeletons have been discovered but not yet dug out, Berger said. Berger and other researchers, including Dr. Paul Dirks from Australia's James Cook University, believe the pair may have fallen into the cave while searching for water. Their remains were washed into an underground pool and eventually entombed in rock in South Africa's Malapa cave complex. The male is believed to have been between the ages of 10 and 13 when he died, the researchers concluded. The female was at least in her late 20s or early 30s. Specifically, the two hominids lived between 1.78 and 1.95 million years ago, Berger's team concluded. They walked upright and shared several physical characteristics with the earliest known hominids. Among other things, they had short fingers but extremely long forearms, Berger noted. Compared to other early specimens, their legs were long -- potentially signifying the start of an era marked by faster running and overall greater mobility. Despite the fact that development of their feet was still in a "primitive" stage, he noted, "they could still climb trees [and] they were very competent walking ... on the ground." Berger noted that they had "remarkably small" brains, but a more developmentally advanced pelvis and smaller teeth -- one of the hallmarks of modern man. Could Australopithecus sediba be the so-called "missing link" that scientists have been looking for? "I don't like the use of that term," Berger told reporters. It's a "Victorian-era" term that "implies some (specific) chain of evolution." But this is "undoubtedly a highly transitional species" with characteristics shared by later hominids, he noted. The discovery promises to help clarify what has been, until now, a murky biological picture from 1.7 million and 2 million years ago, he said. It will "contribute enormously to our understanding of what was going on" at that critical juncture in the evolution of humans. Researchers working with Berger and Dirk also discovered fossils in the cave from a saber-toothed cat, a brown hyena and a wild dog, among others.

Looming health care ruling will be among Supreme Court's most important
By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer
updated 5:47 AM EDT, Mon June 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A ruling on the sweeping law is expected in the coming weeks
The Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 along partisan lines
The law requires individuals to buy health insurance or face a fine
Justices will decide whether that mandate is unconstitutional
Washington (CNN) -- Winners and losers are the natural consequence of the American legal system. In the Supreme Court, five majority votes among the nine members are enough to fundamentally change lives and legacies.
The high court in coming days will issue rulings in perhaps its most important appeal in a dozen years: whether the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama will be tossed out as an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.
The stakes cannot be overstated -- what the justices decide on a quartet of separate questions will have immediate and long-term impact on every American, not only in the field of medicine but in vast, untold areas of "commerce." Health care expenditures alone currently make up 18% of the U.S. economy, and the new law promises to significantly expand that share.
Five scenarios: Health care options before the justices
"I think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up. They had hundreds of briefs and months to study them," said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney. "The oral arguments [in March] might have changed their minds around the margin. But we won't find out until the end of June."
A century of federal efforts to offer universal health care culminated in the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. After months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy, the legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and 450-some provisions.
At issue is the constitutionality of the "individual mandate" section -- requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties. Twenty-six states in opposition say if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go. The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed traditional hot-button topics: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. The high court now has the final word.
The court will not say precisely when the health care opinions will be released, but the last scheduled public session of the term is set for June 25. Depending on how long it takes the justices to finish up, that deadline could easily slip a few days.
The justices have already secretly voted on the health care cases, as well as a dozen or so other separate appeals. They met privately as a group just days after the late March arguments, voting preliminarily. Individual justices were assigned to write the one or more opinions, as well as separate dissents. Only they and their law clerks know how this will end.

And no one is talking -- that's an unbroken tradition of discretion rare in leak-loving Washington.
"At the Supreme Court, those who know, don't talk. And those who talk, don't know," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Friday in a speech at the American Constitution Society convention in Washington.
The court holds fast to an unofficial but self-imposed deadline to have all draft opinions finished by June 1. They are circulated to colleagues, and subsequent dissents and concurrences must be submitted by June 15. Nothing is final until the decision is released to the public. Votes can and do change at the last minute.
The last two weeks beginning Monday will be the busiest, most chaotic time. Justices and their law clerks are holed up in chambers, furiously working to frame and craft the final opinions, making sure every fact, every footnote, every legal theory is fully checked and articulated. The nine members know they are writing their legacies with this one issue. The outcome may be disputed, but the constitutional reasoning-- at least in their own minds-- must be sound.
"Getting themselves organized, identifying the different majorities, getting opinions written and circulated in dissents and concurrences will really test their capabilities in the final days," Goldstein said.
Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling The opinion-writing exercise is little-known, and the court likes it that way. Consistently predicting the outcome is a time-honored Washington parlor game, but rarely successful.
"Obviously everybody in a case of this magnitude is trying to read tea leaves. I think it's hard to read tea leaves," Paul Clement, lawyer for the 26 states opposing the law, told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan moments after the last of the cases were argued March 28. "I suppose if half the justices were snoozing through it, that would have been a bad sign for my side of the case. They obviously weren't snoozing through it."
The first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the legislation two years ago. After a series of reviews in various lower federal courts, the petitions arrived at the high court in November, when the justices decided to review them. Written briefs were filed, oral arguments held.
The court is considering four key questions:
• Does the law overstep federal authority, particularly with the "individual mandate?"
• Must the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act be scrapped if that key provision is unconstitutional?
• Are the lawsuits brought by the states and other petitioners barred under the Anti-Injunction Act, and must they wait until the entire law goes into effect in 2014?
• Are states being "coerced" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse?
Everything hinges on the mandate, also known as the "minimum coverage" or "must-buy" provision. It is the key funding mechanism -- the "affordable" aspect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- that makes most of the other 450 or so provisions possible.
It would require nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face financial penalties. May the federal government, under the Constitution's Commerce Clause, regulate economic "inactivity"?
The coalition of 26 states led by Florida says individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a "product" they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not "choose" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. The law would expand insurance by at least 30 million people, according to government estimates.
As with multiple questions, the justices have multiple options: allowing the mandate to stand or fall; if it falls, keeping all, parts, or none of the rest of the law; issuing a definitive statement on the centuries-long tension between federal and state power; treating health care as a unique aspect of "market" activity, allowing an exception upholding the law; and deciding who will craft the all-important opinions.
"Anyone who says the individual mandate isn't in any trouble is just deluding themselves," Goldstein said. "It's not clear that it will be struck down but you cannot say from those arguments, that it's anything other than a toss-up. The [Obama] administration had as hard a time from those justices as they could have expected, and they are desperately hoping that they can pull together a fifth vote in favor of the mandate."
Timeline of the health care law
The justices never discuss internal strategy, and the full story of how health care was decided in the marble halls of the court may never be fully known.
The current waiting game has prompted anxiety and a touch of political rancor outside the court.
Legal sources say the White House has quietly set up an informal "war room" of sorts, ready to respond when the rulings are handed down.
Low-key coordination is under way between the White House Counsel's office, Political Office, senior Oval Office and campaign staff, Capitol Hill Democrats, as well as select outside advisers and friendly advocacy groups.
Republicans are quietly doing the same, with outreach to conservative activists and candidates. Managing the message will be all-important in a presidential election year.
Publicly, Obama has said he was "confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress, and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law."
Some conservative critics interpreted those remarks as a challenge to judicial authority, suggesting Obama was putting direct political pressure on the high court. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged the bench -- and Chief Justice John Roberts in particular -- to "do the right thing" and uphold the mandate.
Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the same words when urging a different outcome.
"I hope they do the right thing and turn this thing down," Romney told donors last week in Atlanta. "And say it's unconstitutional, because it is."
No one doubts the health care cases will have an immediate impact on Obama's re-election chances, as well as the long-term credibility of the federal courts, which are supposed to be beyond politics.
Recent polling suggests a "legitimacy crisis" in the Third Branch. A New York Times/CBS poll this month shows only 44% of Americans approve of the Supreme Court's job performance -- a steady drop over recent years. Three-quarters of those polled now say the justices are sometimes influenced by their political views.
A separate CNN/ORC International poll released June 8 found a majority -- 51% -- oppose the health care law in general, most because they think it is "too liberal," while 13% think it is "not liberal enough;" 43% of those surveyed favor the law.
The key players could be two conservatives on the court: Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, long labeled a "swing" vote.
"With the four more liberal justices almost certain to vote to uphold the individual mandate, the administration is really hoping for the votes of either the chief justice, who signaled that he had questions for both sides," said Goldstein, "or the traditional swing vote in the court, Anthony Kennedy, who really was tough on the government lawyer but toward the end suggested that maybe insurance was special enough that he could vote to uphold the mandate."
Roberts has long talked about achieving consensus on divided issues, saying it brings long-term credibility and public confidence to the court's work. It has been mostly a pipe dream, as his nearly seven years of leadership has shown a continuing 5-4 conservative-liberal split on most hot-button issues.
"The court is bitterly divided over the individual mandate," Goldstein noted, "so if the administration is going to get his vote, it's either because he believes in a broad federal power or that he doesn't believe that the Supreme Court shouldn't overturn such an incredibly important economic statute."
Health care will soon enter the history books, among the handful of the high court's greatest cases, the outcome no doubt monumental -- legally, politically, socially. An issue that affects every American will naturally attract that kind of attention.
Picking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective, even partisan, exercise. The court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules. But as an institution, it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority: slavery, racial integration, corporate power, abortion -- even Bush v. Gore.
Rapid-fire reaction to health care will be swift and furious, from the campaign trail, professional punditry, and halls of government. Some individual Americans stand to gain from the decision, others could be hurt -- financially, emotionally, and physically.
So why entrust all this in the hands of nine judges?
The Supreme Court usually gets the last word in these matters, regardless of whether one agrees with their decisions -- even matters of life and death, which many argue are the stakes in this health care debate.
Justice Robert Jackson may have put it best: "We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final."

Q&A: Dreamliner woes explained
By Kevin Voigt, CNN
updated 6:05 AM EST, Fri January 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: U.S. regulators Wednesday ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s Two fleets of Boeing 787s have been grounded in Japan after one jet made an emergency landing
The woes come after the debut of the plane in 2011, nearly three years behind its production schedule
About 50 aircraft have been delivered; Boeing has more than 800 unfilled orders from airlines
Hong Kong (CNN) -- The woes of Boeing's new 787 mount as U.S. regulators ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s.
The U.S. move comes after two fleets of Boeing 787s have been grounded in Japan after alarms and a burning smell in the cabin forced a Dreamliner to make an emergency landing Wednesday.
The incident is the most serious in a spate of problems that have bedeviled the new aircraft, and comes after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design as well as its manufacture and assembly.
"The Boeing 787 incidents have taken on a new seriousness with the grounding" by All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), said Richard Quest, CNN's aviation correspondent.

'Teething problems' for Dreamliner
"The potential of fire on board an aircraft is among the most serious issues in aviation," he said. "The plane is still safe to fly. However, Boeing must ensure the reliability of the aircraft for the airlines and the confidence of the traveling public to fly on the planes.
"That is the fundamental problem that Boeing is now facing," Quest said.
U.S. grounds Dreamliners over fire risk
What happened?
As CNNMoney reports, a Boeing 787 operated by All Nippon Airways was forced to make an emergency landing Wednesday in Japan. The domestic aircraft was traveling to Tokyo when irregular battery activity and smoke in the forward electrical compartment were detected. The aircraft then made an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport after a burning smell was detected in the plane's cabin.
Following the incident, both All Nippon and Japan Airlines said they were immediately grounding their Dreamliner fleets -- which effectively grounds about half of the Dreamliners now in operation worldwide. The Japanese airlines were among the first to take delivery of the Boeing 787. ANA has 17 aircraft, while JAL has seven Dreamliners.
Worldwide, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners -- but hundreds more are on order. More than 150 Dreamliner flights occur daily, according to Boeing.
Japanese airlines suspend Dreamliner flights after emergency landing
What problems has the Dreamliner had?
In recent weeks, many. The most recent Dreamliner setbacks occurred Friday. Oil was discovered leaking from a generator on an engine at a Japanese airport, and a crack appeared in a cockpit window of a plane en route from Tokyo to western Japan, a spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways said.
On January 8, a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo aborted takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel. On January 7, a maintenance worker discovered the electrical fire aboard an empty plane being prepared at a gate at Logan for a return trip to Japan. Another Japanese flight was cancelled last week after sensors detected problems with the plane's braking system.
In December, a United Airlines 787 traveling from Houston to Newark, New Jersey, was diverted to New Orleans because of mechanical problems. A general inspection of all 787s in September turned up cracked engines on two planes.
The woes come after the debut of the plane in 2011 -- nearly three years behind its production schedule.
Related: More trouble for Boeing as Dreamliner forced to make emergency landing Do Dreamliners fly in the U.S.?
United Airlines -- which has six 787s -- debuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes last November. "We continue to have complete confidence in the 787 and the ability of Boeing," United said Friday in a statement. The airline described the problems as "early operational issues."
United's Dreamliner fleet travels primarily on routes connecting Houston and Chicago and between Newark and Los Angeles. Last week, the airline kicked off its first international 787 service between Los Angeles and Tokyo. Other U.S. carriers are in line to buy Dreamliners, including Delta. American Airlines has announced an order, but it's not yet "firm." What does the troubles mean for Boeing?
The company's stock has taken a hit as the troubles mount. Several hundred are under order, making its success crucial for Boeing, which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the Dreamliner.
"The 787, being a new airplane, does have teething problems," John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN last week. It's common for new planes to have "these kinds of problems," he added.
Airlines have been excited by the Boeing 787 as the first mid-size, long-range airplane, which would allow airlines to open up routes where they don't have enough demand from passengers to justify a larger plane like a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380.
Related: How the 787 will change the way we fly
Boeing has more than 800 unfilled orders from airlines around the globe that will take years to fill. In addition to the Dreamliner assembly line at its Seattle-area factory, it built a new 1,000-worker factory in South Carolina to handle the demand. It hopes to double production of the plane this year to about 10 a month.

Navy owes $1.5 million for damage to reef, Philippines says

updated 1:01 PM EDT, Mon April 8, 2013
The stern of the USS Guardian, the last piece of grounded ship, is removed by a crane vessel on Saturday, March 30. The U.S. Navy minesweeper became trapped on a reef off the western Philippine island of Palawan on January 17. The Navy has pledged to clean up debris and restore the reef as much as possible.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New survey shows grounded minesweeper did less damage than originally thought
Minesweeper ran aground on Tubbahata Reef on January 17 Ship's commander, three others relieved of duty, U.S. Navy says
(CNN) -- The U.S. government is getting its bill for the damage a Navy minesweeper did to a Philippine coral reef, and it's less than expected.
Philippine officials say the USS Guardian damaged 2,346 square meters (25,252 square feet) of Tubbataha Reef after it ran aground January 17. That's down from the original estimate of about 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet).
And that means, under Philippine law, the United States owes $1.5 million in fines, the Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board said in a posting on the Tubbahata Reefs Natural Park website Monday.
The fines are based on the amount of reef that has been damaged, the state-run Philippine News Agency reported.
The Tubbahata board said the revised damage estimate was made by a team of U.S. Navy and Philippine marine biologists from Wednesday to Friday.
The original survey was conducted January 27 while the warship was still on the reef.
The Guardian was completely removed on March 30, when the ship's stern, the last of four sections into which its 224-foot-long hull had been cut, was lifted from the reef by a massive seagoing crane.
"Using aerial imaging, the grounding zone was originally outlined using the ship's length as the basis for computing the total damaged area. This image was later observed to be obliquely angled thus artificially expanding the area plotted on mapping software," the statement on the park's website said.
The cost of the salvage operation to remove the ship from the reef was $45 million, Stars and Stripes reported Monday, citing a U.S. 7th Fleet spokesman.
An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but last week the Navy relieved the commanding officer and three members of the minesweeper's crew of their duties based on initial results of the probe, a Navy statement said.
"The initial investigation findings clearly indicate that the CO, Lt. Cmdr. Mark A. Rice; the executive officer (XO)/navigator, Lt. Daniel Tyler; the assistant navigator; and the officer of the deck at the time of the grounding did not adhere to standard U.S. Navy navigation procedures," the Navy statement said. "The U.S. Navy has the highest accountability standards, and all four Sailors were relieved by Rear Adm. Jeffrey Harley due to their role in the grounding and a loss of confidence."
Tubbahata Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds.

The French Open: Best photos
Serena Williams' rise to greatness
Radwanska: Playing Serena was tough
Serving for the match, Williams took the first of two championship points, clinching it with a thunderous ace, her 10th of a gripping final.
"I was so nervous, I'm just happy to be champion," she told the capacity crowd on the Philippe Chatrier Court, speaking in French.
"I had a dream when I was 10 years old that I would win the title here and talk to the crowd in French," she admitted after lifting the Suzanne Lenglen trophy for the second time.
"I played a great tournament but ran into a really tough champion today," said the beaten Sharapova, whose victory over Sara Errani of Italy in last year's final completed her career grand slam.
Williams, who has been in superlative form on the Roland Garros clay, crushed Errani in just 46 minutes in the semifinals to serve notice of her intent ahead of the title match.
But Sharapova, herself an impressive winner over Victoria Azarenka in the last four, made a fine start to break early and take the initiative.

Serena Williams: 'I'm in awe' of Venus Williams, who has lost just three matches since her upset defeat to Virginie Razzano in the first round of the French Open last year, immediately hit back and led 4-3 with a second break of Sharapova's service.
World No.2 Sharapova refused to bow and claimed Williams' service to level at 4-4 before she was broken for a third time.
Williams served it out to go a set to the good in 51 minutes and a single break of service in the second in the end proved decisive.
It was her 31st straight win and with it Williams has moved to within two of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, who are tied fourth in the all-time list of grand slam singles titles winners.
At 31 years and 247 days, she is oldest woman in the Open Era to win the French Open title, the previous mark held by Evert since 1986.
She has now won three of the last four grand slams, a run interrupted by a shock defeat to compatriot Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open earlier this year.
Rafael Nadal bids for his eighth men's title at the French Open when he plays fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in Sunday's final and will start heavy favorite after his epic semifinal win over No.1 Novak Djokovic.

4 arrests made in fatal New Jersey mall carjacking By Elizabeth Landers, CNN
updated 1:20 PM EST, Sat December 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The incident happened at a mall
The victim was an attorney
His wife was unharmed
(CNN) -- Authorities in New Jersey have arrested four men in connection to a fatal carjacking earlier this month.
Hanif Thompson, Karif Ford, Basim Henry, and Kevin Roberts were arrested between Friday night and early Saturday morning and are charged with murder and felony murder. They also face charges of carjacking, conspiracy to commit carjacking, possession of a weapon, and possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose, according to the prosecutor's office.
The arrests were made in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the men are between the ages of 29 and 33, Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray said.
Local authorities worked alongside the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service to track down the men, who are accused of shooting and killing a young attorney on December 15.
Murray applauded the public's assistance in the case.
"Many of the leads we received in this case came from our four most urban towns," said Murray. "It really was old-fashioned police work combined with technology."
The incident occurred on a parking deck of The Mall at Short Hills, police said, when attorney Dustin Friedland was walking with his wife to their 2012 silver Range Rover.
Friedland was walking behind the vehicle after opening his wife's door and helping her get in when he was confronted, authorities said.
A struggle ensued, authorities believe, and shots were fired.
His wife heard the struggle and got out of the SUV, and the two attackers got in the vehicle and drove off. She was not injured.
Friedland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
The crime appears to have been motivated by the desire for that particular type of vehicle, Murray said.
U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman added, "You have the right to be safe and the expectation that you should be safe in this county and the state of New Jersey and in particular you shouldn't have to worry that wherever you go...that somebody will put a gun to your head and take your car."
All four men are currently being held at the Essex County Jail. If found guilty, the men could face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Bail has been set at $2 million for each defendant.
