WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The charge that Saudi Arabia made a secret pact with President Bush to lower gasoline prices in time to help him in the November presidential election was denied Monday by the White House, the Saudi ambassador to the United States -- and even by journalist Bob Woodward, who raised the specter of such a quid pro quo in a book released Monday."I don't say there's a secret deal or any collaboration on this," Woodward told CNN's "Larry King Live" Monday. "What I say in the book is that the Saudis ... hoped to keep oil prices low during the period before the election, because of its impact on the economy. That's what I say."The Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, who appeared on the program with Woodward, said his characterization of Saudi policy was "accurate.""We hoped that the oil prices will stay low, because that's good for America's economy, but more important, it's good for our economy and the international economy," he said. "This is nothing unusual. President Clinton asked us to keep the prices down in the year 2000. In fact, I can go back to 1979, President Carter asked us to keep the prices down to avoid the malaise.""So yes, it's in our interests and in America's interests to keep the prices down. But that was not a deal."Bandar said much the same thing on April 1, after he met with national security adviser Condoleezza Rice at the White House amid concerns that OPEC production cuts might further push up the price of oil, with U.S. gas prices already at record levels.Bandar said then that the Saudis wanted to keep the per-barrel price of oil, now topping $33, to between $22 and $28 a barrel, and he also said Bush and Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, "have been in touch on this subject for a while now.""Saudi Arabia does not live on the moon. When the world economy gets hurt, we get hurt also," Bandar said.The ambassador, a longtime friend of the Bush family, was asked by King Monday if he wanted to see Bush re-elected."We always want any president who is in office to be re-elected, Larry, but that is the American choice. This is not our call. This is the American people's call," Bandar said.Woodward's suggestion in an interview Sunday on CBS's "60 Minutes" that the Saudis might be trying to tinker with oil prices to help Bush politically raised a firestorm Monday, with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry leading the charge."If, as Bob Woodward reports, it is true that gas supplies and prices in America are tied to the American election, then tied to a secret White House deal, that is outrageous and unacceptable to the American people," he said during a campaign stop in Florida."It is fundamentally wrong," he said. "It's my prayer that Americans are not being held hostage to a secret deal."Asked by King about Kerry's reaction, Woodward said, "Kerry has taken this to the next level. This always gets caught in the political crossfire, and I'm trying to stick with what my reporting showed."The three top Democrats in the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Democratic Caucus Chair Bob Menendez of New Jersey, sent a letter to the White House demanding that Bush "fully explain the agreement that you or your administration reached with the Saudis to boost oil production and disclose any promises or commitments that have been made to the Saudis on behalf of the U.S."In his book, "Plan of Attack," Woodward reported that prior to the invasion of Iraq, Bandar was briefed on top-secret U.S. war plans in order to enlist Saudi support. He also met with Bush at the White House.White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett told CNN's "Inside Politics" that Bush and Bandar discussed the possibility that military conflict in Iraq would lead to "a major disruption of oil supplies across the globe, particularly hurting Americans here at home.""What we were reassured by was the fact that Saudi Arabia was not going to allow that to happen, was going to work with other OPEC members to make sure there was not an emergency spike in prices," he said.Asked whether Woodward's reporting was wrong, Bartlett said, "I'm saying what Prince Bandar said was the long-term oil strategy for Saudi Arabia is the same that they've been publicly stating. There would be an oil price per barrel of $22 to $28. There was no secret deal."Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Medical helicopters collide, killing at least 6Story Highlights NEW: Six killed includes one patient; one critically injured Collision sets fire to 10-acre area near Arizona's Flagstaff Medical Center "We've got lots of heaps of metal to go through," fire captain says Next Article in U.S. » (CNN) -- At least six people were dead and one critically injured Sunday after a midair crash between two medical helicopters near a hospital in Arizona, authorities said. Rescue workers sift through wreckage from two medical helicopters that collided midair Sunday afternoon. The collision, at Flagstaff Medical Center in Flagstaff, Arizona, set fire to a 10-acre area, according to fire officials, and another two rescue workers were injured by a secondary explosion after the crash. The helicopters collided at roughly 3:45 p.m. local time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. "As you can imagine, we've got lots of heaps of metal to go through," said Capt. Mark Johnson of the Flagstaff Fire Department. "It's just difficult right now." He said a landing pad on the roof of the hospital is used by medical helicopters. Federal Aviation Authority officials originally had reported at least seven deaths and three critical injuries, but they revised those numbers after investigators spent more time on the scene. Flagstaff Police Department Sgt. Tom Boughner said the two rescue workers were not immediately believed to be seriously injured. He said the helicopters crashed into a wooded area near a neighborhood and that no one on the ground was believed to have been injured or killed in the crash. He said the fire had been contained by Sunday evening. FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said at least one of those killed in the collision was a patient. He said three of those killed, including the patient, were aboard a Bell 407 helicopter operated by Air Methods Corporation, an air medical service provider. The other helicopter, operated by Classic Helicopter Service of Utah, also was a Bell 407. The other four victims, including the one critically injured, were on that helicopter. Both helicopters were headed to the hospital at the time of the crash, Gregor said. FAA safety inspectors from Phoenix, Arizona, were en route to the scene Sunday, and additional inspectors from Washington were expected to arrive Monday morning. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead a probe into the crash, Gregor said.

Putin on retiring: 'Don't count on that'By Maxim Tkachenko, CNN Putin ponders his futureSTORY HIGHLIGHTSRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dismisses notion of retiring at town hall forumPutin: "Common principles" let him, President Dmitry Medvedev work well togetherPutin calls George W. Bush a "very honest and nice person"Putin says it will take time to overcome global financial crisis

Moscow Kremlin
Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent a strong signal Thursday that he has full hands-on control of his country. As part of his annual town hall forum, Putin spoke for four hours and fielded 80 questions out of 2 million-plus submitted on a live call-in program, "Conversation With Vladimir Putin -- Continued." Responding to a question on whether he had any plans to retire and enjoy the life of an ordinary citizen, Putin tersely replied, "Don't count on that." And when asked whether he plans to run for the presidency again in 2012, he said, "I will think about it. There is plenty of time for that." Speaking of his "tandem" with President Dmitry Medvedev, Putin said he had "known him for many years, graduated from the same universities, having been taught by the same professors." "Those common principles allow us to effectively work together," he said, responding to the never-ending speculation about which one of the duo is more important and whether a rift between them is possible. Putin juggled a myriad of facts and statistics, giving instructions to subordinates along the way to fix problems, as he responded to questions mostly on Russia's domestic issues. These covered pensions, medication prices, the overhauling of entire industries and Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, Amur tigers and hip-hop music, and everything in between. The program was broadcast live on government television and radio. It marked Putin's eighth annual year-end "town meeting," first launched in 2001 when he was president. This year's forum was his second as prime minister. Representatives from all Russian industries as well as university students packed the auditorium in Gostiny Dvor, a large conference hall next door to the Kremlin, where Putin appeared. Putin took questions from the hall's floor, with live cameras positioned in towns and cities across Russia, and he also responded to phone calls, e-mails and mobile SMS messages. He started off by addressing the issue of terrorism, coming nearly a week after the derailment of a luxury Moscow-St.Petersburg express train, which left 26 people dead and more than 100 injured. Russia's Federal Security Service said an improvised explosive device, which unknown bombers placed beneath the railroad bed, caused Friday's derailment. It was the biggest terror act outside Russia's troubled North Caucasus region since 2004. "We did a lot [in recent years] to break the backbone of terrorism, but the threat has not been eliminated yet," Putin said. "The entire society, each of us, should be conscious of this threat and be vigilant." Addressing the economy, Putin said the peak of the global economic crisis has passed, "although turbulent trends in the global and, as a result, the Russian economy, are still in place." "It will take time and effort to overcome the crisis," he said. The past year has been "one of the most difficult" for Russia in this decade, Putin added, saying the 2009 gross domestic product will shrink by 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent. The slump in the country's industry will be even bigger, he said, around 13 percent, but the projected inflation for 2009 will be lower than in the past year, about 9 percent. The prime minister also cited what he called "positive developments" in the Russian economy. He said some industries, such as military hardware production and agriculture, are even growing. In the arena of international politics, Putin told a questioner that he and former President George W. Bush had a good relationship but have not been in touch. The prime minister described Bush as a "very honest and nice person," saying that if the ex-U.S. leader wanted to continue their relationship, he would be glad to do so. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the wide range of issues on which Russians posed questions "provides an excellent instrument for sociological study, and all questions that are being raised, are carefully studied. That [call-in show] gives a very reliable sociological survey." Putin's popularity ratings at home demonstrates his political dominance in Russia. Confidence in the prime minister stood at 70 percent, as opposed to 59 percent for Medvedev, according to a recently published opinion poll conducted by Russia's Public Opinion Foundation. While Putin had his town hall forum, Medvedev was holding meetings in Italy with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Pope Benedict XVI.

Hundreds protest immigration law in ArizonaBy the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSHundreds gather to denounce bill signed Friday by Gov. Jan BrewerNew law requires police to determine whether a person is in U.S. legallyIt also requires immigrants to carry alien registration documents at all timesKearny Police Chief Joe Martinez called critics' concerns unfounded Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Hundreds of people gathered outside Arizona's Capitol building on Sunday in a largely peaceful protest against the state's tough new immigration law. Chanting "Yes we can," waving American flags and holding signs reading "We have rights" and "We are human," demonstrators kept up a festive spirit as they denounced the bill signed Friday by Gov. Jan Brewer. The new law requires police to determine whether a person is in the United States legally. It also requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. Protesters worry that the law will foster racial profiling. "What is 'reasonable suspicion?' " protester Jose Acosta asked Sunday. "Are we going to get pulled over just because of a broken taillight or because of the color of our skin? ... If so, is everybody going to be pulled over?" Kearny Police Chief Joe Martinez called critics' concerns unfounded, saying the Arizona law enforcement community includes a large number of Hispanics. Video: Arizona cops: We won't profile

"We've never had a policy of racial profiling," Martinez said Saturday night at a town hall meeting in Casa Grande. "In fact, quite the contrary, it's been outlawed." Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon appeared at the rally in support of the protest, calling the law unconstitutional and "just plain wrong." "America is a country that is compassionate and that welcomes everyone," he said. "This is not what this country and this state was founded upon." Gordon vowed to take the fight through the state's judicial system. "We'll go to the state courts and we'll go to the federal courts and we'll go all the way to the Supreme Court," he told the cheering crowd. "I promise you." Gordon told CNN on Saturday that he will bring up an item calling for legal action against the law at Tuesday's City Council session. Others were also vowing this weekend to legally challenge the law. The Rev. Al Sharpton, along with leaders from the National Action Network and the Hispanic Federation, announced Sunday that he will legally challenge the law. The law "is an affront to the civil rights of all Americans and an attempt to legalize racial profiling," Sharpton said in a statement after the bill's signing Friday. "As one who helped to make racial profiling a national issue and who has in the last year visited Arizona several times to rally against these draconian immigration policies, I am calling for a coalition of civil rights organizations to work with those in Arizona to resist and overturn this state law." The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders, a group that represents 30,000 Latino churches worldwide, also said Saturday it plans to file a lawsuit against the bill. "In addition to this law being illegal, if this law goes into effect, we expect it to have a dramatic affect on the state with U.S. citizens, legal residents and others moving out of the state out of fear of being singled out," William Sanchez, an immigration attorney representing the coalition, said in a statement. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.

'Green Nobel' winner fights to save Africa's rainforests From Diane McCarthy, CNN
updated 9:35 AM EDT, Wed March 14, 2012
Kongou Falls, located in the heart of Gabon's Ivindo National Park, are some of the most impressive cataracts in the African continent. Marc Ona Essangui is a Gabonese activist and internationally-recognized environmentalist. In 2009, he won the 2009 Goldman Prize, a coveted award that honors grassroots environmental heroes from across the globe.
Ona has campaigned tirelessly for the protection of the Congo Basin rainforest, the world's second largest rainforest after the Amazon.
Ona has faced great personal risk because of his activism. He has been imprisoned, evicted from his home and refused an exit visa more than once.
Childhood polio left Ona confined to a wheelchair since the age of six. Here, he is pictured at his house with his children.
About 80 per cent of Gabon is covered by forests, sheltering a rich variery of wildlife. The west African country recently branded itself "Green Gabon" as part of plans to create the so-called "green oil" that the country's ecosystem provides.
Gabon is one of the few countries in the world where the rainforest meets the coastline.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Ona has fought to save Gabon's Ivindo National Park from a mining project The Congo Basin rainforest in Central Africa is under the threat of over-exploitation (CNN) -- The majestic Kongou Falls has some of the most spectacular cataracts in Africa, which are located in the heart of Gabon's Ivindo National Park.
The 3,000-square-kilometer park is one of the most significant African sites for biodiversity conservation, sheltering a rich variety of wildlife and vegetation species.
It is this scenic beauty and environmental importance of Gabon's vast rainforests that first prompted Gabonese activist and renowned environmentalist Marc Ona Essangui to campaign for the protection and preservation of the Congo Basin rainforest.
"It's fantastic the forest, fantastic," says Ona, a winner of the coveted environmental award Goldman Prize for his efforts to save Ivindo from a mining project. "There is peace, tranquility, one breathes in the freshness -- no pollution and it's magnificent," he adds.

The world's second largest rainforest after the Amazon, the Congo Basin rainforest in Central Africa is under constant threat of destruction and exploitation.
A large swath of this dense rainforest is located in Gabon -- about 80 per cent of the equatorial country is covered by pristine forests, home to numerous gorillas, elephants, antelopes and tropical birds.
In 1998, Ona, a survivor of childhood polio, co-founded Brainforest, a non-governmental organization working to preserve Gabon's natural resources.
The wheelchair-bound activist says he is fighting for the rights of his people, the indigenous tribes who call the forest home but have no legal rights over their lands.
"In the beginning, one of the objectives of the Brainforest was about conserving and protecting the Ivindo forest," he says. "But today we have seen that it is also necessary to talk about the laws that govern forestry rights, looking at illegal activities in the forest, such as corruption and all that is related to forestry. We are looking at the rights of those living in the forest and defending and protecting their rights."
Located in the western part of Central Africa, oil-rich Gabon is one of Africa's wealthiest countries -- the land beneath Gabon is richly seamed with minerals and is being mined successfully.
In the early 2000s, the Gabonese government entered into an agreement with a Chinese mining and engineering company, offering them a huge mining concession within the Ivindo National Park.
According to Brainforest, negotiations were conducted in secret and the government did not consult with affected communities nor assess the project's environmental impact.
The future generations will not benefit from this beautiful nature scene if we don't preserve it.Marc Ona Essangui, Brainforest
Ona obtained a leaked copy of the agreement and made it public, applying enormous pressure and forcing the state to renegotiate the terms of the contract.
The campaigner's efforts were key in the fight to save the park but Ona has paid a high price for his activism.
In 2008, he was arrested and detained for 13 days. He has also been evicted from his home and has been refused an exit visa more than once.

However, his efforts have given him international acclaim and renown; in 2009 he was awarded the Goldman Prize, a "Green Nobel" prize that honors grassroots environmental heroes across the globe.
"It's an honor because it is the equivalent of a Noble Peace prize-- it is recognition of the work we do from the public," says Ona.
"When I obtained it and was congratulated for receiving this award, I saw it as appreciation and acknowledgment of the work we have always done and will continue doing to protect the interests of this population and the entire forestry environment," he adds.
A champion of social justice, Ona has also been fighting tirelessly for the rights of the disabled -- suffering from polio since the age of six, he refuses to let his condition prevent him from living a full life.
"I am married, my wife is able-bodied, I have children who are not handicapped, I do everything normally," says Ona, who in 1994 founded an NGO called Handicap sans Frontiers. "Even if I am disabled, I don't have that mindset -- I see what I can contribute to my community, my family or my country, that for me is the fundamental thing."

A born fighter, Ona says he is determined to keep working to save Gabon's forests and ensure a better future for coming generations.
"The message is simple," he says, "we are not going to be blinded by material things as our leaders. The future generations will not benefit from this beautiful nature scene if we don't preserve it and we will be known as a continent where resources can be exploited but not to be nourished and cared for.
"We Africans have to ensure our own well-being."

Report: Armstrong tried to donate $250,000 to anti-doping agency
By Steve Almasy and Lateef Mungin, CNN
updated 2:48 PM EST, Wed January 9, 2013
New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez was suspended in August 2013 after he was accused of having ties to Biogenesis, a now-defunct anti-aging clinic, and taking performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension covers 211 regular-season games through the 2014 season. Rodriguez denied the accusations and said he intends to appeal. Twelve other Major League Baseball players received 50-game suspensions without pay in the Biogenesis probe, and In July, Milwaukee Brewers star outfielder Ryan Braun was suspended for the rest of the season for violating the league's drug policy.
Lance Armstong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from professional cycling in October 2012 after being accused of using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong confessed in January 2013 to doping during his cycling career. Barry Bonds is baseball's all-time home run leader, but some commentators say there should be an asterisk by his record. Though he's said he never knowingly used steroids, two San Francisco reporters wrote a book alleging he used performance-enhancing drugs. He was indicted on charges of perjury and obstructing justice for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating steroids, and convicted of obstruction of justice.
Lyle Alzado was known as one of the most vicious lineman to ever play the game, and he chalked up more than 100 sacks and almost 1,000 tackles. Before his death from brain cancer at age 43, he told Sports Illustrated he began using steroids in 1969 and that, "On some teams between 75 and 90% of all athletes use steroids."
Known as "Rocket" for his aggressive pitching style, Roger Clemens played pro ball for more than two decades, racking up seven Cy Youngs. He left Major League Baseball under a cloud of steroid allegations, despite a court finding him not guilty of perjury when he told Congress he never used the drugs.
At 6-foot-5 and 260 pounds, Alistair Overeem is known for putting mixed martial arts star Brock Lesnar into early retirement. Ahead of a heavyweight title match against UFC champion Junior dos Santos in May, Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone and was yanked from the card.
An early and chief accuser of Armstrong, Floyd Landis was himself stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. He admitted doping in 2010, the same year he accused many other riders of doping as well.
As the most decorated Olympian ever, with 22 medals, Michael Phelps is known as a fish in human's clothing, but for a brief period in 2009, after a photo of him smoking a bong was made public, he also was known as a pothead. Despite losing sponsors, he quickly became known for swimming again, securing six medals in the 2012 Games.
Marion Jones was a world champion track and field athlete who won several titles in the 1990s and five medals during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. After admitting in 2007 that she had taken performance-enhancing drugs, she was stripped of the gold medals and other honors won after the 2000 Games.
Known as "Lights Out" after knocking out four players in a high school game, Shawne Merriman entered the NFL with fanfare, earning 2005 Rookie of the Year honors. His 2006 suspension for steroid use prompted the "Merriman Rule," prohibiting any player who tests positive for steroids from going to the Pro Bowl that year.
After his former Texas Rangers teammate Jose Canseco accused him of using steroids, Rafael Palmeiro appeared before Congress to deny the allegations. Later that year, he was suspended from baseball for testing positive for steroids. He maintains to this day he has never knowingly taken performance enhancers.
Few NBA players have tested positive for steroids, not only because the sport relies less on raw strength and speed than other sports but also because the league didn't begin testing until 1999. Miami Heat forward Don MacLean became the first to fail a test in 2000, and he was suspended for five games. After racking up awards in college football, Ricky Williams was picked in the first round of the pro football draft in 1999. After testing positive for marijuana in 2004 as a Miami Dolphin, Williams retired and studied holistic medicine in California. He returned to the Dolphins the following year, only to have more run-ins with the NFL drug policy. He retired again in 2011.
Bill Romanowski was known for hard hits on the gridiron, but he also violently attacked teammate Marcus Williams during a scrimmage while playing for the Oakland Raiders. In a lawsuit, Williams blamed the attack on Romanowski's "roid rage." Romanowski settled the suit and in 2005 admitted to "60 Minutes" that he used steroids.
Sprinter Tim Montgomery set the world record in the 100-meter dash in 2002, but the time was scratched after he was found to have used performance-enhancing drugs. Since his retirement, he has had other legal troubles including arrests for money laundering and heroin offenses. He was sentenced to jail time for both.
An Olympian and renowned longball hitter, Mark McGwire spent his entire career with the Oakland A's and St. Louis Cardinals, breaking the single-season home run record in 1998. In 2010, he admitted using steroids over the course of a decade but told Bob Costas in an interview he took them only for health reasons.
Ross Rebagliati won a gold medal during the first year of snowboarding at the 1988 Olympics. He was stripped of the medal after testing positive for the active ingredient in marijuana. It became fodder for late-night talk show jokes, but Rebagliati eventually got his medal back after it was determined marijuana was not a banned substance.
A winner of eight Grand Slam events, Andre Agassi was considered one of the most dominant tennis players of the 1990s. In 2009, the tennis pro acknowledged in his autobiography that he had failed a drug test for methamphetamine in 1997 but skirted punishment by blaming an assistant.
Regarded as the best soccer player after Pele, Diego Maradona was known for his deft footwork and knack for finding the net. In 1991, he was suspended for 15 months after testing positive for cocaine. He would later admit he was addicted to the drug for about 20 years and began using when he was playing for Barcelona in the 1980s.
A prolific sprinter in the 1980s, Canadian Ben Johnson routinely bested American Carl Lewis in the 100-meter dash. After winning the gold at Seoul in 1988, Johnson tested positive for a steroid. His coach said Johnson took the drugs to keep up with other athletes and later wrote a book saying all top athletes were using in those days.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Armstrong's attorney says the cyclist never tried to make such a donation
USADA chief says donation offer was a conflict of interest
Lance Armstrong has agreed to 90-minute interview, Oprah Winfrey's network announces
Release says Armstrong is expected to talk about doping allegations (CNN) -- A Lance Armstrong representative tried to make a donation of about $250,000 to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency before the agency launched the investigation that led to the cyclist being stripped of his Tour de France titles, the chief of the USADA said.
"I was stunned," Travis Tygart, the head of the anti-doping agency told "60 Minutes Sports'' about the alleged 2004 offer. ''It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA. We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.''
Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said there's no truth to the story.
"He never made any such contribution or suggestion," Herman said in a statement e-mailed to CNN Wednesday.
Annie Skinner, a spokeswoman for the USADA, told CNN that Tygart's quotes, released by "60 Minutes Sports,'' were accurate.
The new accusation is another chapter in the twisting tale of Armstrong, a one-time hero to many who has now fallen in disgrace.

Photos: Lance Armstrong over the years
New York Times: Armstrong might confess
Journalist's crusade to expose Armstrong
Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday.
A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute "no-holds-barred" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com.
Winfrey will ask the cyclist to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's report, which said there was overwhelming evidence Armstrong was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said.
The International Cycling Union, which chose not to appeal the USADA's lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October.
Armstrong's lawyer: No talks with anti-doping agencies
The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code.
Before the ban, he was competing in Ironman triathlons and had won two of the five events he had entered. Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events.
According to his Twitter feed, Armstrong has been biking, running and swimming in Hawaii. The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas.
The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility.
One of his attorneys denied Armstrong was in discussion with the two anti-doping agencies.
Dan Wuori, a writer at cycling publication Velo Magazine, said Armstrong may reveal a lot during the Oprah interview.
"I think what we are seeing here is the beginning of Lance's effort at redemption," Wuori said. "More and more continues to come out about Armstrong. This seems like an effort of Armstrong to get ahead of the story and control the narrative."
The gain game: Why do sports stars cheat?
Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career.
Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States.
He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow "LiveSTRONG" wristbands that helped bring in the money.
But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011.
Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation.
In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong.
It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs.

Stars of '42' talk Jackie Robinson's legacy
From Topher Gauk-Roger, CNN
updated 4:12 PM EDT, Tue April 2, 2013
Chadwick Boseman stars as Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play for a Major League Baseball team, in Brian Helgeland's "42." Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers' general manager who made history signing Robinson, in the biographical film.
Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill star in "Moneyball," a sports drama about Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane. The film, based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, looks at how Beane put his team together given severe financial constraints.
Robert Redford stars in "The Natural," based on Bernard Malamud's book of the same name. The film, about Roy Hobbs' (Redford) unexpected, natural ability to hit the ball, was nominated for four Academy Awards and a Golden Globe.
"Bull Durham," one of Kevin Costner's many baseball films, features the actor as minor league catcher "Crash" Davis. Davis, center, works to prepare a rookie pitcher (Tim Robbins), while Susan Sarandon's character falls for the pair of them.
No longer a minor league catcher, Costner, who plays an Iowa corn farmer in "Field of Dreams," hears a voice urging him to build a baseball diamond. "If you build it, he will come," the voice says, though it's often misquoted as "If you build it, they will come."
Before he was #winning, Charlie Sheen was losing with a team of misfit ball players on the Cleveland Indians in "Major League." "There's no crying in baseball," Tom Hanks, center, famously said as manager Jimmy Dugan in 1992's "A League of Their Own." The World War II-set baseball dramedy, also starring Geena Davis, right, follows the rise of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.
In "The Sandlot," when Smalls hits his stepfather's baseball, autographed by Babe Ruth, into The Beast's yard, he and his new friends pull out all the stops to recover the irreplaceable ball.
Costner hit the pitcher's mound as 40-year-old Billy Chapel in "For the Love of the Game." The Detroit Tiger attempts to pitch a perfect game despite possibly losing the love of his life for good.
Dennis Quaid stars in "The Rookie," a film based on the life of Texan Jim Morris, known for his brief stint in the major leagues.
In 2005's "Fever Pitch," Ben (Jimmy Fallon), left, is forced to decide who he loves more -- the Boston Red Sox or his girlfriend Lindsey (Drew Barrymore). The Red Sox won the World Series in 2004. It had been 86 years since their last title. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"42" chronicles Jackie Robinson's groundbreaking career
It also highlights his bond with Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey
Harrison Ford had to persuade the creative team to let him play Rickey
Casting selected Chadwick Boseman to play the baseball great
(CNN) -- The larger-than-life story of baseball great Jackie Robinson will open on the big screen this month along with the beginning of the new baseball season. "42" is slated to open on April 12, just three days before the 66th anniversary of Robinson's debut game that broke baseball's color barrier.
The film follows Robinson, the first African-American to play Major League Baseball, as he plays for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and highlights the bond that formed between Robinson and Dodgers general manager and president, Branch Rickey.
Rickey is played by Harrison Ford, who was not originally on the shortlist for the part.
"The filmmakers didn't send (the script) to me, I just happened upon it," Ford recently told CNN.
"I came through backdoor channels and I read it and I thought this is a great opportunity to play this character if anybody's interested in seeing me about it."
Except no one was. "They would not have known about my ambition to play this kind of character in a faithful way ... to approach it as a character actor and be willing and ready to let loose of my former career as a leading man."
After some persuasion, Ford landed the role of Rickey -- although, true to his intent to get lost in the character, you might not even recognize him in the part. When it came to casting Robinson, writer/director Brian Helgeland, who has previously written screenplays for "Man on Fire" and "A Knight's Tale," knew upon meeting Chadwick Boseman that he wanted him to fill the uniform.
The actor, who's previously appeared on TV in shows like "Lincoln Heights" and "Persons Unknown," was directing an off-Broadway play at the time of his audition, but just so happened to be in Los Angeles when his agent called about "42."
But though Helgeland knew right away, "I definitely didn't know right away," Boseman told CNN.
After reading for Helgeland the first time, "I came in the next week and read for him again, and realized that he already made his decision and he was trying to prove it to somebody else. I did a baseball tryout, and the rest is history."
Helgeland "said I was the person who showed the most courage, and that's why I got it," Boseman said.
Boseman played some Little League baseball as a kid and describes himself as an athlete. "So it wasn't like I couldn't walk and chew gum at the same time," he joked.
But he obviously needed practice in order to emulate one of the best in the history of baseball.
"We did spring training from the middle of January to May," he said.
"We prepared as if we were going to play a game."
In order to see how he was shaping up in his attempt to accurately bring Robinson's skills to life, Boseman would watch a split-screen of his own practices next to some of Robinson's Hall of Fame footage -- so he could see "how bad I was" compared to Robinson.
Like Boseman, Ford logged hours extensively researching his character, working to understand the ins and outs of the sport, though he's not a huge sports fan generally.
"I researched the character and the history, and I know the history. I know the circumstances that took place and the character of our nation at the time, but I didn't know much about the man: Branch Rickey," Ford said. "There was a lot of research material and I took advantage of all of it, and studied it."
As for the reason we haven't seen more Jackie Robinson biopics flood cineplexes, Ford muses that it might be because Robinson's wife, Rachel, has been careful with her husband's legacy.
"Until Brian Helgeland produced the script, I don't think she'd been satisfied with the telling of the story," Ford said. "And not so much because it glorifies her husband, but because it embraces the fulsome understanding of the circumstances, and so she's responsible for allowing us to tell the story."

The most unequal place in America
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 5:42 PM EDT, Wed October 30, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, has the nation's highest level of income inequality
The parish is more economically split than any other parish or county, Census Bureau says
John Sutter: The community should try to mend its divisions to move forward
He says the real problem with income inequality is that it creates gaps in empathy

Lake Providence, Louisiana (CNN) -- Delores Gilmore used to have a dream.
The 44-year-old overnight prison guard grew up on the south side of Lake Providence, the crescent moon-shaped body of water that generally divides the haves from have-nots here in the northeast corner of Louisiana. It's a place where the air is so soupy-hot your shins sweat; where bugs are such a looping, whirring presence that it can feel like you're trapped in hell's version of a snow globe; and where the level of income inequality, as persistent as the bugs and humidity, is higher than any other parish or county in America.
It's not a place where dreams live long.
Not south of the lake, at least.
North of Lake Providence, on a side of town Gilmore rarely sees, there are tennis courts and ski boats, swimming pools and manicured estates. The lake is less than a mile wide, but the north side might as well be a world away from Gilmore, who earns $8.50 per hour working 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. and still is two months behind on some of her bills.
John D. Sutter
"The first of the month, I pay the rent," she said. "The next check, I pay my light bills. Sometimes I won't pay my rent and I pay the light bill from last month -- if they cut if it off. Then I pay the rent the end of the month. ...
"I get it done. By the grace of God, I get it done."
A dozen or so family members rely on her for financial support. Her daughter, who has three children, lives across the street in a trailer so leaky that, despite her efforts to tar the roof to prevent rain from seeping through, it has mushrooms growing from the ceiling, like something out of "Alice in Wonderland." Stray dogs hound her door.
Gilmore's life is consumed with the needs of her family.
"I'm not fooling anybody," she told me. "I don't have any friends. And that's sad. ... I go to work, come home, take them where they gotta go, if they gotta go somewhere, come back home, lay down, go to work.
"That's what I do. All day, that's what I do."
It's the most unequal place in America
In her recurring dream, though, Gilmore got a peek at another life.
She was in a big house -- a nice house, nicer than any she'd ever seen.
"It was beautiful," she said. "It had upstairs, downstairs. Four bedrooms upstairs, four bedrooms downstairs. It had a guesthouse in the back. It had four bathrooms. There was a living room and a sitting room. It was just beautiful."
Gilmore, a stern but funny lady who answers the door saying, "What now?!" and carries a switch to church in case her kids act up, never wore shoes in the imagined house, only socks. Her real living room floor is made of splintered plywood. But the floors in the dream home were smooth as a skating rink. In the dream, Gilmore ran through the halls and slid across the floor in her socks -- just like Tom Cruise in "Risky Business."
In that moment, she felt free.
Gilmore told me about her dream while we were driving along the south side of Lake Providence in her 2005 maroon Ford Taurus, a pair of fuzzy dice and four air fresheners hanging from the rearview mirror. Cypress trees zipped by the car. The rich side of the lake was blurry as we drove parallel to the southern shore, but I knew it was there. I'd already met some of the wealthier northsiders and seen their lakefront homes. I'd also looked at the statistics: This place has a wider gap between rich and poor than Manhattan, with its Bentleys and billionaires -- or than any country on Earth.
I'd learned that, whatever we tell ourselves about America being the land of opportunity, our country's rules are designed to make it likely Gilmore will stay here on the south side of the lake, in the modest white trailer where she raised eight kids, including a stepson and a nephew whom, she said, her sister abandoned on a street corner in town.
Personal choice, including her decision to have so many children, plays a role in it, of course, but the choices in front of her are limited by a host of factors, including an income that won't support her family.
She doesn't blame anyone for that -- doesn't bemoan the wealth here.
She absolutely loves her job.
But, to use a popular metaphor, the middle rungs of the economic ladder have vanished in Lake Providence. There's almost no middle class.
How could a person climb up?
As I listened to Gilmore recount her dream, however, anything seemed possible.
Pirates and Providence
My journey to Lake Providence started with a poll.
Readers of this column voted for me to cover income inequality as part of my Change the List project, which focuses on pushing for social change in places that fall at the bottom of an index or ranking. With 32,000 votes tallied, America's rich-poor gap was the top pick.
In your eyes, it's the No. 1 social justice issue of our time -- a continuation of the civil rights movement, which included a push for jobs and economic justice as well as racial equality.
Since the late 1970s, the gap between rich and poor has widened to Grand Canyon proportions -- pushing America toward a two-class society. People have a harder time getting ahead now than at any time since the Great Depression.
The nation is more economically split, according to the CIA, than Iran or Nigeria.
East Carroll Parish, population 7,500 and home to Lake Providence, is worse off still.
A Gini index score of 0 means everyone earns the same income; 100 means one person earns all income.
Lake Providence is a place of incredible natural wealth. It was named by people who floated down the Mississippi, past throat-slitting pirates, and found refuge at the beautiful, cypress-lined lake. "If a crew was fortunate enough to get safely past the pirates to the trading post at the lake below, they thanked Providence for sparing them," according to one local history.
"Thus, the lake and settlement acquired the name of Providence."
They were the chosen people -- the ones God had spared a nasty fate on the river and led to the fertile land of the Mississippi Delta.
Now, Lake Providence is at the confluence of the river and two highways.
It's well situated for economic development.
Yet divisions hold it back.
The rich largely live north of the lake and the poor on the south. They go to different churches and attend different schools. They have different friends and work different jobs.
Many of the richer people in town own land and run farms that produce corn, cotton and soybeans. Poorer people used to work on those farms, but they've largely been replaced by the Transformer-size machines you see driving along the road during harvest.
There are few nonfarm businesses in town.
RELATED: 'Cross the gap' on income inequality
On the main strip, you'll find The Banner-Democrat, the local newspaper with half of the letters missing from its sign; a "Price Cutter Discount Center," which advertises balloons and party supplies in a community that seems to have need for neither; and a corner store called Unique Fashion, which is where I found Michael Owens on a summer afternoon, sitting in a metal chair in front of an industrial-strength circular fan.
"How's business?" I asked.
"DEAD!" he said, without pause. "I ain't seen a customer all day."
The best a non-land-owning person can hope for here is a job at the prison (the sheriff's department is the largest employer), a bank, the schools or one of several restaurants, including The Dock, which sits on the lake and has a giant crawfish on its roof.
There's also Uncle Darrell's, a convenience store on Second Street, on the south side of the lake. Everybody knows that, outside, that's where you're likely to find the drug dealers.
Race is part of the divide, to be sure. Land was given to white families in the 1800s, not to blacks. The town resisted integration in the 1960s and '70s, and at least one voting rights activist was shot in the parish during that struggle.
The history of slavery and discrimination is still present.
But class has become the new barrier -- one that is both persistent and legal.
The richest 5% in the parish earns $611,000 per year on average.
That's 90 times what the bottom fifth makes per year: $6,800.
And 16% of parish residents are unemployed.
East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, has almost no middle class.
Despite the divide or maybe because of it, I was hard pressed to find people in Lake Providence who think income inequality, specifically, is a problem.
This is the way things are, they say.
Always will be.
The gap is so big they no longer can see across.
'Used to it'
Delores Gilmore's mother learned to sleep with the sound of wolves clawing at the walls of the family's two-room, wooden home on a cotton plantation.
She used an outhouse instead of a toilet and pumped water from a spigot. In the middle of the night, instead of going outside to fend with wolves, she relieved herself in a "slop jar," a small container with a lid they kept next to the bed. For food, the family tended a garden, and her father hunted deer. But Dorothy Jones recalls living for a day or two at a time on nothing but water. "It was rough on the stomach," she said. "I know that."
Jones, now 60, started working the cotton fields at 10. At 12, she became pregnant. She left school and kept working in the fields, strapping the infant to her back and walking up and down the rows of cotton, the white-hot sun breathing down on her.
Her starting wage: $3 per day.
But, like so many others here, she's not one to complain.
"I guess I just had to get used to it," she said.
Gilmore, her third child, was born in June 1969, six years after the March on Washington and six months before the federal government forced local public schools to integrate.
She came into this world at a time of great hope -- when it seemed like Lake Providence, a place that always had been segregated by race, might be entering a new era.
Her mother staked her dreams on Delores.
She was the resourceful one. She had a quick temper but also an infectious laugh. When the family ran out of food, she went looking for help from relatives.
She rolled with the punches.
It seemed like she might be the one to break free.

The Bootstrap Ethic
One street in Lake Providence connects south to north.
Heading north, the road curves past a furniture store with windows covered in American flags and massive images of Marilyn Monroe, the 1950s movie star who spent part of her early life in foster care -- a symbol of the idea that anyone can make it in this country.
The road continues into neighborhoods with towering trees and well-trimmed lawns. Not all the houses on the north are massive. Some have the feel of a 1960s retirement community -- stone birdbaths, lawn trinkets. A few trailer homes are in the mix. A quick drive-by could leave you with the impression there's not much wealth here. But squint past the trees and you'll see wrap-around porches, columns, a private tennis court, pools and manicured shrubs. The billionaire Sam Wyly grew up in town, and his cousin, according to his book "1,000 Dollars and an Idea," lives in an antebellum home north of the lake.
"I grew up with the American idea that you pull yourself up by your bootstraps -- that you work hard and you do the best job you can ... and you make a living."
That's Thomas Terral, 71, who's said to be one of the richer men in the parish.
His family name is on a seed storage tower on the south side of town. The Terrals owned and operated several farm-related businesses for decades.
Terral and other northsiders live by what I'll call the Bootstrap Ethic -- that you can work hard, get a good education and get ahead. It's the American Dream, really.
No complaints.
The ethos has served Terral well, although it would be hard to argue he's needed it much. The son of a doctor, Terral told me he took over a part-family-owned seed business with a loan his father financed and, after he had made some payments, partially forgave.
Terral Seed became the largest business of its kind in Louisiana under his watch. He sold it in 2010 to DuPont, the international chemical company, according to news reports.
He's a great businessman, sure.
But it seems his bootstraps were pretty well pulled.
He lives a life of relative luxury -- nothing that would seem outlandish by national standards, but it is a far cry from life south of the lake. His living room has the vibe of an upscale ski lodge, with the heads of various animals -- one is a bighorn sheep, I think -- staring at you from elevated angles. In the office, a bear rug has its mouth open, fangs showing. Terral shot it with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip in British Columbia.
On the coffee table is a copy of Forbes magazine. Cover story: "Peace Through Profits."
That title embodies his thinking.
"I felt like my mission was to supply as many jobs as I could," he said. "Of course, we were a small company, and I think the most employees we had was a little under 70 -- 68 or so. What we did was probably the best thing we could do to help the situation."
By "the situation," he means the poverty south of the lake.
Some wealthy people north of Lake Providence won't speak of it -- nor do they know much about the situation. Several declined my interview requests.
I have a feeling Terral was gracious enough to talk with me because he's seen the south side of the lake -- and he has a genuine sense of service to the people there. He has volunteered on the south side, working on homes. And he met many people there as a young boy when he followed his dad on house calls. Terral would chat with families while his father, the doctor, tended to the sick and delivered babies.
One of them was Delores Gilmore.
He brought her into the world free of charge.
South of the lake
Delores Gilmore was baptized in Lake Providence.
It was 1979. She was 9. The only time she'd been in the water before that, she nearly drowned.
She hasn't been in the lake since the baptism, she told me.
On summer days, when the sun heats the gooey air to what feels like a boiling point, you'll see white families zipping up and down Lake Providence in pointy-nosed sport boats, dragging their children behind them on inner tubes and water skis.
Occasionally the boaters wave to a stranger on shore.
But it's almost unthinkable Gilmore could afford to join.
By 16, Gilmore got pregnant and dropped out of school, just as her mother had. She went to work in the sweet potato fields west of town. And by the early 1990s, Gilmore had five children and was raising a stepson and a nephew.
She didn't really have room for the extra kids in her crowded home. Nor did she have the money. She already was having trouble affording underwear for her own children.

But they were family. She had to help.
RELATED: How to help Lake Providence
Gilmore's nephew, then 11 months old, was abandoned by her sister on a street corner downtown, she and other family members said. Gilmore suspects her sister has an undiagnosed mental illness. She later would try to burn her mom's trailer down in a fit of rage -- and would stab her mom, the family said, only to say she didn't remember the incidents afterward. She currently is serving a prison term, online records show.
Gilmore isn't angry with her sister. She had problems no one here could seem to address.
Gilmore kept striving for a sense of normalcy. For years, she had a boyfriend who helped.
He was the father of four of her children, and he gave Gilmore a financial cushion and moral support. When they first met, she found him arrogant. But her friends convinced her to give him a chance. She eventually was drawn to a softer side he usually kept hidden.
Then, in 1994, only three years after the birth of her fifth child, Gilmore got a phone call that would change her life. Her boyfriend had been shot in the head.
Two weeks later, his family pulled him off life support. His mother didn't want to pursue an investigation, Gilmore said, so the circumstances of his death remain unclear.
The results were all that mattered to Gilmore.
She lost her protector, and the kids lost theirs.
'If we could get some jobs'
You could blame Gilmore's hardship on bad luck, but huge income gaps also are associated with gaps in empathy and trust, and that eventually morphs into hopelessness.
Surprising links have emerged between income inequality and a host of social problems, including mental illness, substance abuse, incarceration, educational failure, teenage pregnancy, lower life expectancy, violence and infant mortality.
Such links don't exist when you look just at average income.
The inequality itself is to blame.
This is well documented in a book called "The Spirit Level" by epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett. Drawing on decades of work, the researchers found, essentially, that people who live in economically unequal places -- such as Louisiana or the United States as a whole -- tend to live harder lives.
Not just poor people. All people.
When the researchers plotted income inequality against an index of social problems that included infant mortality, mental health and others, they got the chart below, which shows that more unequal places tend to have more of these issues. The United States, the most unequal of the developed countries, for example, also has the world's highest incarceration rate and a higher infant mortality rate than comparable nations. Sweden, meanwhile, has a low level of income inequality and fares much better on these social measures.
Social ills are associated with societies that have high income inequality, research shows.
When the researchers plotted the same data according to average income, the correlation dissolved -- the poorer societies were not more likely to suffer the social ills:
No clear relationship exists between per capital income and social problems, research shows.
The researchers suspect gaps in trust and empathy likely contribute to these gaps in health and social cohesion. More unequal societies also tend to have lower levels of trust, they found.
In Louisiana, for example, only slightly more than a third of the population says it trusts most people, according to "The Spirit Level." In more-equal North Dakota, that number jumps to 67%.
Inequality in America has grown in tandem with a host of factors. And things weren't always this way. In the 1950s and '60s, the U.S. was remarkably egalitarian. The economist and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich says he's often asked what society the United States should emulate if it wants to address income inequality.
His answer: the United States.
The '50s, '60s version.
Back then, things were markedly different.
Labor unions gave workers a voice. The minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was higher than now. College was affordable. And the super-rich were taxed at a higher rate.
Now all of that's changed.
The price of college, one way out of poverty, has skyrocketed, as CNNMoney reports.
College, one route out of poverty, is more expensive than it once was.
The minimum wage is worth less now than it was in the 1960s.
The U.S. minimum wage is worth less now than it was in the 1960s.
And the tax rate on the richest Americans, as the documentary "Inequality for All" noted, has dropped considerably.
The top marginal tax rate has dropped considerably since the late 1970s, according to the Tax Policy Center.
Meanwhile, the country's now famous 1% continues to coast through the wake of the economic recession.
They're faring better than anyone else.
The U.S. 1% has fared better in the recession than others.
These issues are national, but they affect the dynamics of life in Lake Providence, and of every other community in America, in ways that are both common and unique.
In New York, where the mayor is a multibillionaire and the race for his successor has largely focused on this topic, inequality has skyrocketed as Wall Street traders and CEOs receive otherworldly compensation. In the Rust Belt, the decline of manufacturing jobs has helped hollow out the middle class, striking a serious blow to the idea that anyone who works hard, regardless of family background, can live an economically stable life.
And in the Deep South, economic justice is an extension of civil rights.
"It'd be a better town if we could get some jobs," Delores Gilmore said. "I do believe that. I believe that from my heart."
'If I can get this job ...'
Every mother wants a better life for her children.
That's why Gilmore agreed to send two of her sons away.
Her middle children, Stanley and Liray Jones, were going to drop out of high school in Lake Providence, she said. Rarely a week went by that fights didn't break out at the school, she said. She didn't think it was safe -- or an environment for learning.
So, with their OK, she sent her only two sons to Texas to live with a relative. She misses them constantly. But they graduated, she said. They found a better life.
Gilmore's kids who stayed in Inequality USA have not.
Samantha Jones is 28 years old. Her boyfriend, family members said, was shot in April 2010 when an altercation broke out near a convenience store in downtown Lake Providence.
He was hit by a stray bullet, according to a news report.
Valtakia Jones, 22, has been looking for work for four years. She left school four months shy of graduation to care for her second child. For about a year, she gave up on the job search completely. She felt like she was unemployable -- like something was wrong with her.
Recently, she's gotten a second wind. There's still some fight left in her, but talk to her about the job search and you can hear the life start to drain from her voice.
Not long ago, she got an interview at McDonald's in Oak Grove, Louisiana, about a 20-minute drive west of Lake Providence, in the next parish over.
If she were offered the job, she'd take it. But she doesn't know how she would get there. Her mom is the only one in the family with a car. Jones says she's hoping to walk to work, but that seems nearly impossible considering the job is more than 15 miles away.
Maybe she could pay someone to drive her?
Jones said she would do anything to make it work.
For one, she wants to provide a safer place for her kids to live.
The mother of three now lives in a sunken trailer across from her mom. Family members paid for the structure, which bows in the center, like a caterpillar inching forward. She's fixing it up the best she can. She painted half of the exterior blue before she ran out of paint; a friend helped her build a plywood cabinet to hold the sink.
"If I can get this job, it's gonna be the bomb," she said of the trailer.
Last I heard, McDonald's hadn't called back.

Rebels and Panthers
Many people in Lake Providence never will climb out of poverty.
The tools simply aren't available.
Only 9% of kids from the bottom fifth of the earners in Lake Providence will make it into the top fifth, according to research from Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.
America has tried to create systems that are designed to ferry people from one side of the lake to the other, or to at least stop them from sinking further. Government programs help pay for health insurance and day care. Food stamps have kept families from going hungry.
And public schools have proven one of the best routes out of poverty.
In Lake Providence, however, the education system seems to underscore class divisions.
Kids from the north side of the lake go to Briarfield Academy.
Mascot: the Rebels.
Graduation rate: 100%.
It has no formal scholarship program, its principal said.
On the south, there's only one public high school.
Mascot: the Panthers.
Graduation rate: 72.5%.
I toured both high schools and met both of their principals. They genuinely want what's best for their students. But neither has the full support of the Lake Providence community. Neither can truly succeed without that.
Nationally, a 2011 study from Sean Reardon at Stanford University shows students from poor families test the equivalent of three to six years behind their rich peers.
Three to six years behind.
Middle-class jobs are another way for people to climb out of poverty. But those are scarce. Most jobs that do exist don't pay well enough for a person to meet his or her basic needs.
That, too, starts to look more sinister when you look at the big picture.
Across the country, workers are making just about what they did 30 years ago. But they're also more productive than ever -- producing far more stuff per hour now.
If you're making more stuff and getting paid the same, where are most of those gains in productivity going? If you guessed to the wealthiest Americans, you'd be correct.
That affects how a person like Gilmore is paid.
If her wages had kept pace with productivity, she would make $31,300 per year, instead of about $18,000, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute.
That's a wage that might actually be livable.
'I'll give you whatever I've got'
I first met Gilmore at a birthday party for her grandchildren.
Kids were orbiting her mother's trailer like fireflies. There were candles and cake. Above the kitchen sink hung a dirt-caked banner that said, "Rejoice!"
I was amazed with how lighthearted the mood was, especially when I learned that Gilmore's mother and partner were going to be evicted from their home imminently.
They fell behind on their payments when Willie Pullins Jr., 63, lost his job on one of the larger farms in the parish, they said. Pullins showed me a stub indicating he was paid $6 per hour. He told me he fell off the back of a truck on the job, and instead of getting sufficient medical assistance, he got the can. And now, an eviction notice.
Gilmore is trying to find $3,500 to buy them a new place.
"You have to help one another if you want to survive around here," she said. "You ain't got nothin'. I ain't got nothin', but I'll give you whatever I've got."
She's given so much that she's had to mortgage dreams of her own. Gilmore, who once worked as a certified nursing assistant, would like to go back to school to become a registered nurse. She's heard the pay is better, and she likes helping in times of need -- doesn't like to see people suffer, especially children and older folks.
But every month she has to take out a payday loan to get by.
Such lenders are known to charge the equivalent of 300% interest.
How could she possibly leave work, much less pay for school?
Sheriff Wydette Williams, Gilmore's employer, told me he would like to pay his employees more but that the parish is bouncing back from financial crisis.
"That is my whole goal -- to provide the best for my employees," he told me. "This is not a political phrase. This is where I come from. I want to provide everyone with a decent wage and better working conditions. .."
During his tenure, he said, he brought health insurance to all of his full-time employees.

'Income guarantee'
Looking across Lake Providence from the north can warp a person's vision.
Find a modicum of success and it becomes all too natural to judge those who haven't. There must be something wrong with them, right? I made it, so why can't they?
It's not intentional or evil.
It's the product of an unjust system.
When the gap between rich and poor is as wide as it is in Lake Providence, it becomes almost impossible for people to imagine themselves on the other side.
It becomes all too easy, as many do, to argue that "entitlement" programs such as food stamps are holding back people on the south side of the lake. They don't have enough incentive to work hard and get ahead. They become lazy, complacent, dependent.
A closer look at how these programs work reveals another picture.
Forty-five percent of the parish's residents receive food stamps, or SNAP benefits. The average payout is $1,492 per person per year.
This is a top gripe of the northsiders.
What you don't hear discussed as much is that they get help, too.
Both the rich and poor are subsidized by government programs.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $12.3 million in 2012 subsidizing farming in East Carroll Parish through direct payments, insurance breaks and other subsidies, according to data compiled by the Environmental Working Group, which tracks government farm subsidies.
The average farmer who gets a commodity subsidy in the parish received $20,554 in 2010, according to the group. The most highly subsidized farmer that year in East Carroll Parish got more than $655,000 from that one subsidy program.
Look at that number again.
$655,000.
Farmworkers I spoke to made about $7.25 to $10 an hour, even after decades of work. Even in East Carroll Parish, where the cost of living is certainly nothing compared with major U.S. cities, those wages won't support a family. Business owners and farmers here are fond of saying they can't pay higher wages.
That's hard for me to believe after looking at the subsidies.
"It's really just an unprecedented income guarantee program," said Scott Faber, the Environment Working Group's vice president for government affairs. "It's absurd."
The farm subsidy programs grew out of a desire to provide a stable source of food during the Great Depression. Some are still needed, but there is no cap, Faber said, on the income a farmer earns while still receiving government help. And some of the subsidies in East Carroll Parish go to the production of corn, some of which, local farmers told me, is shipped up the Mississippi River for processing into ethanol for fuel, not food.
Lake Providence Mayor Robert Amacker, who farms 10,000 acres with his brother, told me some farmers would go out of business without the payments. They're needed, he said, because profits are tied to weather, which is completely unpredictable. But he didn't go so far as defending the full six-figure sums as always justified. "If you take 'em away it's probably gonna hurt us, but I'm not saying we won't survive," he said. "We have in the past."
The U.S. House voted in September to cut $40 billion from the SNAP program over the next 10 years. If that cut becomes law, it would make 4 million to 6 million low-income Americans ineligible for assistance, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that studies how public policy affects lower-income people. Other reductions are expected to take effect in November.
It's Robin Hood in reverse.
'Yes pastor!'
On a recent Sunday, Gilmore was up by 11 a.m., only four hours after she'd gotten off work at the prison, to get her family ready for church at New Hope Baptist. She awoke to a wild scene: Grandma yelling at kids, kids running around looking for shoes.
It was nearly noon by the time everyone was running out the door, which sticks so hard you have to pull it with two hands and all of your body weight.
One of Gilmore's grandsons was last out of the trailer. As he ran toward the car his wide-brimmed hat flew off his head.
"Hey!" he yelled at the wind.
He mashed it on his head and it flew off not one but two more times.
"My hat!"
Gilmore's Ford Taurus, filled with seven people, pulled up to the church about 30 minutes after the two-hour service started. There are a few dozen churches in the parish. That's no coincidence, especially south of the lake. Folks turn to God when the world around them becomes too much to bear. For Gilmore, it's a place of solace.
The family piled into pews in the back and watched as the Rev. Michael Owens, the storeowner who rarely sees customers, delivered a sermon about the economy.
It was far more than a sermon, really. Owens pressed his mouth up against a microphone and ran all over the front of the sanctuary as he half-yelled, half-sang a series of parables and proverbs about getting by in the modern world.
"I wonder if I have a WITNESS in here!?"
"Yes pastor!" said Gilmore.
They went back and forth like that seven times.
"We got people that are desperate for jobs," Owens shouted, eventually becoming so worked up that he wiped his head with a towel. Sweat seeped through his pink tuxedo vest.
"The Lord said, 'I will supply all of your needs according to my riches and gold.' He did NOT SAY he would supply your wants for ya."
"All right pastor!" Gilmore said.
"If this town's gonna ever progress, we're going to have to come together!"
The more time passed, the more worked up Owens became. He walked out in front of the podium and stood on one foot, shaking violently. One of the amplifiers in the small, wooden church was misfiring, and the speaker system occasionally let out deafening squeals.
"I said, 'He'll do it!' " the reverend said.
"Yes, he will!" Gilmore said.
"He'll comfort ya!"
'Poorest place'
You can't leave Lake Providence thinking it's a bad town.
Doing so would miss the point, entirely.
It's a beautiful place that, since 1994, when Time magazine named it the "poorest place in America," has been trying to define itself in opposition to that title.
Genuine progress has been made.
Myriant, a chemical manufacturing company, recently opened a place in Lake Providence with a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy.
The company says it's created 50 new jobs.
A woman from the south side of the lake opened a bustling restaurant called My Dream Eatery, which aims to pay its employees a living wage, not just the minimum.
I met several local public school graduates who were headed off to college this fall. Williams, the sheriff, is trying to rid the town of its drug problems. He's the first black sheriff in the parish's history, and he's respected by nearly everyone in town, including members of the white community. And a host of people has moved to Lake Providence to try to help the community move past its divisions.
An Irish-Catholic nun, Bernadette Barrett, or Sister Bernie as everyone calls her, said she moved here after her employer decided it would be more useful to send a mission of nuns to this part of Louisiana than to Haiti, which had been the plan.
And on a recent Saturday, Lake Providence held an annual Soul Food Festival. People from both sides of the lake came together for corn bread, crawfish and chitlins.
"We've got a long way to go, but, you know, for the last 38 years we've been going down, down, down, down. At some point, you have to hit bottom," Amacker, the mayor, told me. "When you hit bottom, the only place to go is up. I think we're almost there."

'I don't know ...'
"You never dream about a big ol' house?"
That's Gilmore talking to me in her maroon Ford Taurus.
I wasn't sure how to respond.
The reality is I don't dream about big houses and never have.
I grew up in a two-story house with four bedrooms and 3½ baths. We had linoleum and then tile in the kitchen.
I'm pretty sure I've slid across it in socks a time or two.
I had it easy. Gilmore and others should, too.
The problem with 2013 America is we don't believe that anymore.
We believe in the rich and the rest.
It seems obvious to us -- or immutable -- that some should have a better shot at financial success than others. That, in and of itself, is heartbreaking. We've lowered our expectations -- resigned ourselves to a country where class determines worth.
The rich fund political campaigns, and politicians cow to their interests. Raising the minimum wage to the point that it's livable and increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans would help narrow the rich-poor gap, according to some economists.
But politicians don't have incentive to pass those reforms.
Many of the rich don't want them.
It's remarkable to me that Gilmore and other poorer residents of Lake Providence are not more resentful. "They got money and I don't," she told me. "I don't feel bad. I guess I just wanna be blessed to be one of the ones that has money."
For the most part, richer people I met in Lake Providence want to help, too.
Terral, the doctor's son and man of industry, has helped rebuild homes south of the lake.
"I can't imagine that we in America would allow this to happen to so much of our people," said Tom Gattle, Terral's son-in-law, who runs a major river transportation service company in town.
Those attitudes tell me there's room for reconciliation -- and shared empathy -- in this place of haves and have-nots. There's room in America, too. If more of us saw how the other side of the lake lives, and if we really worked to understand the systems -- the schools, the taxes, the wages, the history -- that create and maintain economic injustice, I've got to think we'd work together to build a sturdier bridge to the other side.
Those bridges need to start going up soon.
The longer hard-working people such as Gilmore spin their wheels, the more likely they will become cold and resentful or, worse, give up.
Gilmore puts her hopes in her youngest daughter, Shinya.
Maybe the 9-year-old will be the first in her family to go to college?
Gilmore has been tutoring Shinya, writing math problems on the walls in a back room in the trailer, where the family has a computer but no Internet. Shinya reads to her nieces and nephews, too, and makes them flash cards. That makes Gilmore think she'd make a good teacher. Or maybe a doctor.
"I'm hoping for the doctor," she said, laughing. "I want her to be somewhere so she can be comfortable."
Gilmore's own dreams, though, are fading.
She'd like to go back to school to become a nurse, but she doesn't see how that is possible, financially or logistically. Too many people depend on her.
And she hasn't dreamed about that big house in years.
Hasn't glided across those slick floors in her socks.
"I don't know what I dream about now, I be so tired when I lay down, I be so frustrated," she told me as we drove to work. "I don't even have a dream I guess."
That may be the most frightening thing about the staggering economic inequality that plagues Lake Providence and modern America.
It changes the way we see each other.
And the way we see ourselves.
