(CNN) -- A jury recommended the death penalty Monday for Scott Peterson, convicted a month ago of murdering his wife and unborn son.CNN correspondent Ted Rowlands has been covering the case from day one and had an early interview with Peterson. He spoke with CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the mood inside the courtroom when the verdict was read.ROWLANDS: Well, Wolf, it was very somber, as you can imagine. Both sides [were] feeling the weight of what was going on. The security was very tight. There were bailiffs along both sides of the walls, there were police officers that had been part of this investigation on the side, near the prosecution seating.The families had a much different type of seating. The Rocha family was there, and then in force were friends and supporters of the Rocha family, people that have known Laci all of her life. On the other side it was just the Petersons and it was only Jackie, Lee and Janie Peterson. There were three empty rows behind them.And the Petersons seemed resigned from the minute they walked in that they knew what was coming and there was no visible reaction when the verdict of death was read. In fact, the jurors were most likely the most emotional people in the courtroom as far as showing their emotions. But you could feel the emotion, obviously, before, during and after.Very somber, when the verdict was read, that there was no, as you might imagine, cheering or not even a reaction at all from the prosecution side. And like I say, it looked like the Petersons were resigned to what was coming. They knew it was coming given the evidence that was asked for earlier today.Mark Geragos talked to the Peterson family just before the verdict was read. And then after the verdict was read he talked to them as well. Jurors filed in. A couple apparently looked at Scott Peterson, I did not see that, but for the most part they looked away, and then they filed out and looked away.BLITZER: Ted, was there any reaction that you could discern whatsoever from Scott Peterson, body reaction, facial reaction?ROWLANDS: No. When he walked in he does the same thing most times. Walking into court, he gives a little bit of a quirky smile as he gets in, to his family. He did that again, but this time he took a deep breath when he sat down. It was an obvious sigh. And then when the verdict was read there was no reaction.However, when they were polling the jurors he was intent on trying to make eye contact with each and every juror as that individual juror got up. It didn't appear as though [he] made eye contact with any of the jurors as they acknowledged their verdict in the case.But he didn't show any outward emotion. Obviously, he, too, was prepared, if you will, by Mark Geragos because of the evidence that was asked for from this jury. He most likely told Peterson, get ready for it, it's probably coming. We're still on your side and we're still going to fight this.And then you talk to family members, that's their feeling, is that this isn't over. They feel like that they're going to find the person who was really responsible for this. In their mind they truly still believe that their son is innocent. So that is what got them through the reading of this verdict.BLITZER: Was he wearing his suit as usual? What was he dressed up in?ROWLANDS: He was wearing one of his normal suits that he wears. He's got a half-dozen suits that he wears. And for all practical purposes he looked the same as he does walking in every day: He's well-dressed, walks in and he doesn't appear down. He never really shows any negative emotion. If there's any emotion at all coming from him, it's positive reinforcement with his family. His family is always in the front row when he walks in and he usually gives them a little nod and a quirky smile.And again, he did it today even though he most likely knew what this jury had come up with. I think that this verdict was much different than the guilt phase verdict in that it didn't seem to be as much of a question of what this jury was going to do. And for the Peterson family, quite frankly, you talk to them, they say they've been beaten down so much, it really didn't matter what this jury came back with. When they came back with guilt that's what really hurt this family and that was when the emotions were just off the charts in terms of inside that courtroom.BLITZER: So there was no visible emotion, no visible reaction from Scott Peterson, and you say there was no visible emotion, no crying, no screaming, no sort of expressions of concern even from his family, is that what you're saying?ROWLANDS: Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. Not even a shake of the head or anger. It was just like they had been told you're going to have to go through this exercise. It was as if they had prepared for this exact scenario. They came in stone-faced, sat there. Jackie Peterson held hands with Janie. Janie Peterson, Scott's sister-in-law. And Lee Peterson just sort of scanned the room. He looked at some of the detectives that investigated the disappearance of Laci, that first fingered his son in this early on.He didn't say anything and there was no outward expression, but obviously he was looking at everybody and internally he was most likely going through a lot of emotions, because these were the players that he hadn't seen in a long time, the folks that were first on-scene. They came up from Modesto to witness the reading of this verdict and they all were standing along the back wall of the courtroom. They were not sitting, so they were visible.In fact during those sort of awkward three to four minutes before the jury came in it was dead silent and I noticed that Lee Peterson was scanning this group, this group including the police chief that investigated his son.But otherwise, it was really difficult to see any outward emotion that wasn't coming from jurors. One juror wiped away a tear at one point. Obviously, this jury had a very, very difficult decision to come to, and I think they are the ones that felt the most emotion coming to this decision and then announcing it.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Poll: Majority of Democrats prefer ObamaStory Highlights CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll finds enthusiasm for Obama's candidacy 52% of registered Democrats say they'd like to see Obama get the nomination About a quarter of Democrats say they would be dissatisfied if Clinton won Poll also examines superdelegates, Michigan and Florida primaries Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO From Paul Steinhauser CNN Washington Bureau	(CNN) -- A majority of Democrats would like to see Barack Obama rather than Hillary Clinton win their party's presidential nomination, according to a national poll out Monday. A new poll out Monday shows Democrats prefer Sen. Obama over Sen. Clinton to win the nomination. Fifty-two percent of registered Democrats questioned in a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey say the senator from Illinois is their choice for president, with 45 percent supporting Clinton. The poll also suggests Democrats are more enthusiastic about an Obama victory (45 percent) than for a victory by the senator from New York (38 percent). The two remaining major candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination are locked in a fierce battle for their party's presidential nomination, with Obama holding a slight lead both in delegates and the overall popular vote in the primaries and caucuses to date. "The same patterns that we have been seeing in recent exit polls are holding true for Democrats nationwide as well. Obama's biggest support comes from men, younger voters and independents who lean Democratic," CNN polling director Keating Holland said. "Clinton does best among women, older voters and whites. One interesting difference, unlike the exit polls in many states, there is no difference in the national poll between college-educated Democrats and those who never attended college." The nomination could hinge on two major matters: superdelegates and the possibility of do-over primaries for Florida and Michigan. The two states broke national Democratic Party rules by moving up the dates of their primaries to January. None of the major Democratic candidates campaigned in the two states, and Obama's name wasn't even on the ballot in Michigan. Don't Miss Poll: Three-quarters think U.S. in recession

Election Center 2008
The national Democratic Party also banned Florida and Michigan's delegates from attending the party's national convention this summer. But with the fight for the nomination nearly deadlocked and the reality that winning both Florida and Michigan is crucial for the Democrats to take back the White House in November, there's now a movement toward letting both states vote again. Watch more on the Florida, Michigan primaries » Sixty-three percent of Democrats said the two states should hold new primaries, with 19 percent saying delegates from Florida and Michigan should be seated at the national convention based on the results of the January primaries, and 15 percent saying no delegates should be seated at all. If Clinton and Obama finish the primary season with close to an equal number of pledged delegates, then superdelegates could decide which candidate wins the nomination. There are nearly 800 superdelegates, mostly Democratic members of Congress, top elected state officials and leading members of the Democratic Party. Fifty percent of those polled say that it's a bad idea for the party to have superdelegates, with 42 percent supporting the system. Since the party is not going to scrap the superdelegates, the big question is how they should base their vote for the nomination. Democrats appear split on this question -- 49 percent say that superdelegates should base their votes on their view of who would be the best candidate; 46 percent say that superdelegates should base their votes on the results of the primaries and caucuses. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone March 14-16, with 1, 019 Americans questioned, including 463 registered voters who identify themselves as Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. The survey has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. E-mail to a friend All About U.S. Presidential Election • Elections and Voting

Republican senator says no more military cuts
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 10:22 AM EDT, Sun September 25, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sen. Graham will try to soften the impact of the budget cut "trigger"
Failure to pass a deficit deal means more than $1 trillion in automatic cuts
Graham says he will propose legislation protecting the military from more cuts
(CNN) -- If Congress can't come up with a deficit reduction deal this year, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that he'll try to prevent further required cuts in the military budget.
The comment showed that contingency plans already are in place to avoid some of the more than $1 trillion in mandated spending cuts under a "trigger" mechanism intended to motivate Congress to reach a deficit deal.
A special joint committee set up under last months debt ceiling agreement has until November 23 to work out such an agreement, which must then pass Congress by December 23. Otherwise, the required cuts of the trigger mechanism kick in.
The debt ceiling deal included $900 billion in spending cuts, including $400 billion from the military. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said any further cuts under a trigger mechanism would harm military capabilities.
"I will introduce legislation that will protect the defense department from devastating cuts," Graham told "Fox News Sunday. "If it fails, let's don't destroy the defense department."
However, a new budget showdown in Congress that threatens to partially shut down the government as soon as Saturday has raised concern that bipartisan agreement on a much larger deficit reduction plan won't happen in the current political climate.
The latest budget impasse involves a short-term measure to fund the government for seven weeks after the current fiscal year ends on September 30. It includes increased emergency disaster funding after Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee, wildfires and tornadoes so far this year.
House Republicans have passed a bill that cuts spending elsewhere to offset some of the increased disaster relief aid.
Democrats oppose offsets for emergency aid, saying disaster relief for Americans in need should be unencumbered. The Democratic-led Senate rejected the House measure on Friday.
Graham, whose home state of South Carolina absorbed some of the brunt of Hurricane Irene, called the House bill "reasonable."
"We can't borrow money every time something goes wrong in America," he said.

AQAP claims responsibility for Yemen attacks
By Hakim Almasmari, For CNN
updated 9:31 PM EST, Wed March 7, 2012
Yemeni General Ali Salah, deputy chief of staff for military operations, visits soldiers in Yemen's restive Abayan province on March 6.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula issues a statement claiming responsibility The attacks in the state of Abyan killed 187, security officials say
An investigation is under way into how al Qaeda was able to be so successful (CNN) -- Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has taken responsibility for a series of attacks on Yemeni security forces in recent days that killed more than 180 troops.
The militant group issued a statement -- which CNN received a copy of Wednesday -- describing the attacks.
"The mujahedeen held a series of 'the cutting of the tail' military operations on the forces of Sanaa's government on the outskirts of the city of Zunjubar in Abyan state," the statement said.
The attacks were considered the bloodiest launched against Yemeni forces in recent days in which an estimated 200 troops were killed in three provinces.
The statement said the militant group's fighters succeeded in seizing large cache of weapons including heavy artillery and tanks.
A delegation from the Yemen Military Committee, the highest security authority in the country, reached Abyan on Wednesday as part of the investigation into how al Qaeda has able to score constant victories over the past week in the province.
"We told the committee that we were tricked by our superiors and the government did not help us while we were surrounded and being killed," one of the injured troops told the fact-finding committee. "We were left to die and seek the mercy of the terrorist militants."
The attacks in Abyan, which started Saturday, resulted in the deaths of 187 troops and injuries to at least 135, two security officials in the province told CNN.
The statement also claimed responsibility for an airplane explosion inside Yemen's air force headquarters in Sanaa.
"The mujahedeen detonated a military airplane of the Yemeni Air Force in Al-Dailamy military base which was carrying weapons for Adan and Hadramout. The detonation has been made after infiltrating into the base and planting an IED inside the plane," the statement read.
President Abdurabu Hadi vowed on Tuesday to fight al Qaeda and retake areas of Abyan that have been taken over by the militants.
"We expected obstacles, but the president will do all in his power to uproot the terror militants from the country. This is a promise he gave the people," said Yahya al-Arassi, the president's spokesman.

After Diana: How can intimate royal snaps be published in France?
By Dave Gilbert, CNN
updated 11:00 AM EDT, Fri September 14, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Legal expert Claire de Than: French law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection
But she adds that average fines for infringement have dropped in France in recent decades
Media lawyer Jennifer Agate says preventing publication across the world would be very difficult
She said the case highlights the inconsistencies in the approaches to privacy taken in different countries
London (CNN) -- Fifteen years after Diana, Princess of Wales died in a Paris car crash while being chased by the paparazzi, a French edition of the magazine Closer has angered the British royal family by publishing topless pictures of her son's wife Catherine.
The pictures were taken while Diana's oldest son Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were staying at a private chateau in Provence, France, according to Closer magazine.
A palace spokesman said their privacy had been invaded in a "grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner" adding: "The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so."
France is famous for its strict attitude to privacy -- the nation only found out about former President Francois Mitterrand's second family just before he died -- so why have the images appeared in France? CNN examines some of the key questions about privacy.
Doesn't France have some of the strictest privacy laws in the world?
Topless photos prompt royal privacy row
"Indeed it does," says Claire de Than, senior lecturer at London's City University Law School. She explains that there is comprehensive protection for privacy, potential civil and criminal liability, and human rights protection under the European Convention on Human Rights.
"Photographs of private events and individuals cannot legally be published without their consent," she said.
"The French Civil Code states that 'everyone has the right to privacy' and the courts have generally been strict in enforcing that right. The photographs should only have been published if they are in the public interest, or with consent. There is criminal liability for taking and transmitting photographs of private events without consent."
So how come the photos have been published there?
De Than says some organizations are willing to face the potential penalties, presumably hoping that fines will be lower than the massive increases in sales. "It is true that average fines have dropped in France in recent decades but image rights have been strengthening and there is a significant risk of this case reversing that trend," she said.
Can France handle the truth on sex lives of rich and powerful?
How does French law differ from that in the UK?
Again, de Than explains that French law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection.
"The media have generally been more reluctant to publish private information (including photographs) than in the UK.
"However, once photographs have been published then the harm has been done and it is much more difficult to obtain an injunction, so when media are willing to break the law and face the consequences it simply does not matter how strong the legal protection is for citizens' rights."
Does European law play a part?
Yes. The European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into French law, just as it is in UK law. Article 8 says that everyone has the right to respect for private and family life, but article 10 protects the right of freedom of expression, although it also adds that the exercise of this freedom carries "duties and responsibilities."
In making a judgment about privacy infringements the European Court of Human Rights has to balance the two, with neither right taking automatic precedence.The interpretations of the convention's provisions evolve through case law in each member state.
Earlier this year, key rulings in the European Court were welcomed by press freedom campaigners in the UK as tipping the balance towards the right to free speech.
Can the royal family start proceedings under the ECHR and if so how would they go about it?
Yes it can, but as privacy expert Jennifer Agate at London law firm Wiggin LLP explains, it would first have to issue proceedings in the French courts, where the breach of privacy has taken place.
"The national courts have a duty to enforce Article 8, so if proceedings there did not provide an adequate remedy, and having exhausted the French appeal process, the Palace would then be able to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights who would rule on whether France had failed in its Article 8 obligation," she said.
"This was the approach taken by former F1 racing chief Max Mosley when he felt that the UK courts had failed to protect his Article 8 rights by not imposing a duty to notify the subjects of tabloid stories before publication."
(Mosley won a privacy case against the now-defunct News of the World after it published a story falsely alleging that he took part in a Nazi-themed orgy.)
Mosley: Can the press be free but responsible?
Has anything changed since the death of Diana in 1997?
Christopher Meyer, the former chairman of the UK Press Complaints Commission, told CNN he thought much had changed in the UK.
"I don't think the paparazzi are coming back with a vengeance," he said. "In the UK there are pretty strict rules about what is private... but it doesn't stop the paparazzi from selling to other markets. It's difficult to police but that isn't an argument for not having some rules."
Only last month, Prince William's brother Harry was snapped naked at a party and the pictures were published in the American magazine TMZ. Only one British tabloid, The Sun newspaper, chose to publish the images. Meyer rejected a comparison saying: "That's a different case with different arguments."
What's the likelihood of the photos being published by newspapers elsewhere in the UK or around the world?
Jennifer Agate said prevention would be very difficult.
"In the UK they would be able to get an injunction against publication, but realistically they won't be able to stop publication elsewhere, particularly in the United States where the First Amendment is sacrosanct," she said. "The photographs are also likely to become available online, which presents an enforcement nightmare."
She adds: "The photographs are so obviously private and indefensible; it seems unimaginable that the major publishers in the UK will decide to publish. The British press have typically shown a respect for the royal couple's privacy, agreeing not to publish photographs taken on their honeymoon. Unfortunately that won't stop the photos becoming available online.
"This is a blatant breach which won't change the law, but it does highlight the inconsistencies in the approaches to privacy taken in different countries. What makes this so staggering is that publication has taken place in France, a country renowned for its strict privacy laws."
It is a view echoed by Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University, London, and a former tabloid editor. He told the BBC he doubted any British newspaper or British-based magazine would dare to publish the images.
"They quite clearly will be in breach of the editors' code of practice which says you are not to photograph individuals in private places without their consent, and you would need to have a public interest reason for overcoming that and I can't see that there would be one."
He also said the British press risked a backlash from the public if they published them. "I have a feeling that there might be a bad reader reaction to obviously intrusive pictures. I may be misreading the public view here, but I think she's quite a popular figure and the idea they might intrude in this fashion might lead to a boycott by readers," he said.
How has the royal family responded?
There is no doubting the anger within the British royal family. A statement from St James's Palace said the couple have been "hugely saddened" by publication of the pictures. It added: "Their Royal Highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them.
"Officials acting on behalf of Their Royal Highnesses are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to The Duke and Duchess."
How has the magazine Closer reacted?
A statement on behalf of Closer Magazine UK says the UK publication is published by Bauer Consumer Media but the French edition is published under a license by a different Italian business called Mondadori.
It adds: "Closer magazine UK was not offered any pictures of this nature and certainly has no intention of publishing the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge which have been published in France this morning.
"Closer magazine UK takes its obligations under the PCC [Press Complaints Commission] Code extremely seriously and would never publish topless images of a member of the Royal family on its cover or otherwise."

Report: Unemployment to rise again in 2013
By Madison Park, CNN
updated 3:11 AM EST, Tue January 22, 2013
European countries like Spain struggle with unemployment. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A total of 197 million people were without a job in 2012, says ILO report
Report: Global unemployment numbers will rise once again in 2013
Youth unemployment remains persistent problem
(CNN) -- A total of 197 million people were without jobs in 2012, with youth being particularly hard hit, and those unemployment figures will increase again this year, according to an International Labor Organization report released Monday.
The bulk of the 4 million newly unemployed in 2012 came from developing economies in East Asia, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Global Employment Trends 2013 report.
The International Labor Organization, which is a United Nations agency responsible for overseeing international labor standards, made bleak projections of another increase in unemployment worldwide by 5.1 million in 2013 -- which would push the total to 202 million.
EU jobs crisis worsens

Jobs crisis takes toll on Greece
Unemployment woes continue in Italy
In 2012, 73.8 million young people were unemployed globally.
"Many young people now experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labor market entry," said Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General, during a presentation of the report's findings. "When this occurs early on in a person's career, it can do significant damage to their long-term employment prospects."
Although new jobs may open up, they may require different skills than those that match the unemployed workers, according to the report.
"Governments should step up efforts to support skills and retraining activities in order to address such mismatches which particularly affect young people," Ryder said.
The report advised that the governments should step up efforts to retrain and support job skills to address the differences in work qualifications, with a focus on young people.
Youth unemployment is expected to rise in emerging economies in Eastern Europe, East and South-East Asia and the Middle East, according to the report.
In developed economies in Europe, firms are reluctant to hire because of uncertainty, the report said. Youth unemployment tops 50% in some European countries.
In Latin America, the region's unemployment was at 6.6% in 2012, with a more rapid recovery from the economic crisis.
In East Asia, employment expanded only 0.5%. In South Asia, female labor force participation remains low.
In the Middle East, unemployment is on the rise again after a decline in the 2000s. But vast differences remain in the region, as oil-producing countries tend to have low unemployment rates.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, 77% of workers have what is called "vulnerable employment."
The report made several recommendations on stemming unemployment globally. Leaders should formulate more "coherent and predictable" policy, to address economic uncertainty, it stated.

White House officials get earful from Democrats on Obamacare
By Dana Bash, CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent
updated 8:46 PM EST, Wed November 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Democrats vent frustrations over Obamacare to White House officials at weekly caucus meeting
NEW: California says more than 1 million people get insurance cancellation notices
NEW: White House officials will go to Capitol on Thursday to meet with Senate Democrats
House to vote on Friday on proposal that would let people keep their health care plans
Washington (CNN) -- A private meeting on Capitol Hill with House Democrats and White House officials on Wednesday became heated when rank-and-file members expressed frustration about continued Obamacare problems, according to multiple sources in the room.
One congressional Democrat who attended the meeting said senior Obama administration officials Mike Hash and David Simas really "got hit" by House Democrats about everything from the troubled website to the broken presidential promise that people can keep the insurance plans they like.
The most pressing political challenge for House Democrats will come this Friday when they will have to vote on a House Republican plan by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan that allows people to keep their policies if they want to.

Obamacare: What White House needs to do now
Obamacare adviser reacts to enrollment
Cantor on constituents who like Obamacare Insurance companies have begun canceling certain individual plans mainly due to Obamacare, creating an unexpected hardship for many who could soon find themselves without coverage or wind up facing higher costs for new plans they may not want.
In California alone, more than 1 million people have received policy termination notices from several insurers because their plans do not meet minimum requirements under the Affordable Care Act, the state's insurance commissioner said this week. Insurers have, in a large number of cases, temporarily extended the time frame for ending those agreements.
Several lawmakers -- even liberals who adamantly support Obamacare -- stood and warned the officials that the White House must come up with a solution before the vote.
As CNN first reported on Tuesday, many House Democrats are feeling so much pressure from constituents on this issue that they may feel compelled to vote yes for political reasons.
"Members want to keep their promises to their constituents, which is that they would have affordable insurance -- if they want to keep the plan they have -- they would keep it," said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio. "We would offer broader insurance alternatives so that people would have more competitive pricing."
Democratic congressional sources have told CNN that Friday is a de facto deadline for the administration to come up with a fix.
The preference would be an administrative remedy that circumvents the polarized Congress. But if that is not possible, Democrats are demanding the White House offer a legislative solution that they can offer as an alternative to the GOP plan.
Administration officials came to the meeting to try to convince House Democrats not to vote for the Upton bill, saying it would gum up the system and result in higher premiums for most Americans, sources told CNN.
"They were talking about the ultimate impact of voting for it. That, in fact, it would allow plans that had high deductibles, very poor coverage -- which of course we want to get rid of," said Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois.
Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York told reporters he thinks something will "develop over the next 24 hours."
White House spokesman Jay Carney said "you can expect" the Obama administration to announce plans for addressing health policy cancellations under Obamacare "sooner rather than later."
Carney said President Barack Obama has asked "his team" to come up with policy options, suggesting they were moving quickly.
He again rejected the Upton bill as "not an effective fix" because it opens up the plans to anyone, not just the people who's plans are being canceled.
Lawmakers also expressed frustration with the HealthCare.gov website, the chief portal for people who want to sign up for Obamacare through the federal government. It's October 1 launch was a debacle and the administration is scrambling to get it running up to speed.

Bill Clinton weighs in on Obamacare Democrats frustrated with Obamacare woes Democrats open to changes to Obamacare
Rep. Anna Eschoo of California asked administration officials to stop using "red lines" they may have to cross and make the public relations problems worse for Democrats.
For example, sources in the meeting said she is worried that if the the website is not running smoothly by November 30 as the administration has promised, the political problems for Democrats will be worse.
Though, the focus is chiefly on the House bill over cancellations.
It would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the Affordable Care Act by allowing anyone to purchase them, even though the existing policies don't meet the tougher requirements of the Obamacare initiative.
Can Congress really save insurance plans lost under Obamacare?
Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage.
Cancellations drive concern
Although the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website and low enrollment figures through Wednesday -- just over 100,000 -- are embarrassments for the President and Democrats in Congress who rammed through the health law in 2010 without Republican support, it is the policy cancellations that are really driving Democrats to put more pressure the White House.
Obama has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his Obamacare woes, according to the latest polling.
His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust.
Pressure to come up with a fix
Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, told reporters on Tuesday that Obama needs to come up with a solution "sooner rather than later."
New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the House GOP plan, saying he believed it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections.
"We should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and doesn't make the problem worse." Israel told reporters Tuesday, saying it would be helpful if the White House came out with a proposal before Friday's House vote.
But Rep. John Larsen of Connecticut, a loyal liberal and former House Democratic leader, said he hasn't seen details of the House GOP bill, but said he thought it could "make sense" and that there "could be support" depending on the approach.
Hoyer said earlier he hadn't ruled out being open to Upton's bill, but his spokeswoman says he's now opposed since Upton has said he won't make changes and Democratic leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it.
More pressure on Obama
Boosting pressure further on Obama was former President Bill Clinton, who said on Tuesday that the President should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies.
Clinton: Obama should 'honor commitment' on keeping health plans
A growing number of Democrats have called for changes or delays to the program as many face tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents.
Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves
Although he didn't go nearly as far as Clinton, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said he is open to changes as well and noted that Obama should have been more careful with his words in the first place.
Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats.
She noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance, which she says makes up about 5% of the market, to keep their coverage. Insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met.
A Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that White House officials will go to Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet with Senate Democrats about looking for a fix.
