(CNN) -- Scientists in Spain announced Thursday that they've unearthed a 13 million-year-old fossilized skeleton of an ape that is possibly a common ancestor of humans and great apes, including orangutans, bonobos, chimps and gorillas.The find could add a yet another branch to the human family tree and fill in a gap in our knowledge of hominoid evolution."It's very special," said Frans de Waal of the Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University in Atlanta. "It's almost as if we will have to redraw the (evolutionary) tree if these discoveries keep coming out." Salvador Moya-Sola of the Miguel Crusafont Institute of Paleontology in Barcelona, Spain, and his colleagues describe the species, which they have named Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, in the November 19 issue of the journal Science."The importance of this new fossil is that for the first time all the key areas that define modern great apes are well-preserved," Moya-Sola said in a statement. Fossils of apes are extremely rare and do not fossilize well because they are often in forests, where bones tend to decay.Yet de Waal cautioned against making conclusions about whether this new fossil is a route on the road to human evolution."It's spectacular to have new information on this," he said. "But (human evolution) is not a straight line, it's has an enormous number of side branches."Researchers think great apes diverged from lesser apes, which are gibbons and siamangs, about 11 million to 16 million years ago. Fossils from that geological epoch, called the middle Miocene, are fairly rare. Scientists believe humans diverged from the living great apes about 6 million years ago. The searchers say it could be that Pierolapithecus is not itself the last common ancestor of the great apes, but rather a close relative of that animal.Study of the fossilized bones suggest Pierolapithecus was a tree climber, with a stiff lower spine, and a specially adapted rib cage and wrist bones. However, its short fingers suggest it did not do a lot of hanging from branches.The bones were found near Barcelona after a bulldozer clearing land at a dig site turned up a tooth. Study of the fossils suggests the ape was male, weighed about 75 pounds, and ate fruit.And while the bones were found in Spain, Moya-Sola suspects the species also lived in Africa. Only four species of great apes -- orangutans, bonobos, gorillas and chimpanzees -- exist today. All of them are endangered due to hunting and habitat loss.CNN's Michael Coren contributed to this report.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Truth Squad: Do most Americans say less spending is only solution?
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 3:03 AM EDT, Wed October 12, 2011
(CNN) -- At Tuesday night's GOP Presidential Debate in Hanover, New Hampshire, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney said Americans agree that cutting spending and balancing the budget is the answer to fixing the economy, not raising taxes.
The Statement: "The American people want to see growth and jobs, and they believe that the right way to do it is by cutting back on the scale of government. And they're right." -- Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney
The Facts: According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted in August, 63 percent of Americans favored increases in taxes on businesses and higher-income Americans, while 36 percent were opposed. The poll showed only 12 percent favored increases in taxes on middle class and lower-income Americans, while 87 percent were opposed. As for spending cuts, 57 percent favored major cuts in domestic government programs, while 40 percent were opposed.
Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) said taxes on wealthy people should be kept high so the government can use their money for programs to help lower-income people. About one-third (34 percent) of the people polled said taxes on wealthy people should be kept low because they invest their money in the private sector and that helps the economy and creates jobs.
Other polls have shown similar results, with a majority favoring a mix of spending cuts and tax increases to reduce America's debt and lower the deficit.
The Verdict: True, but incomplete
CNN's Julie In contributed to this report.

Can coaching kick-start your career?
By Susanne Gargiulo, for CNN
updated 8:49 AM EDT, Fri November 2, 2012
Even the best need some advice now and then.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Coaching of managers and executives becoming more common
Recession has not diminished the popularity of coaching to companies
Seen as a benefit to both businesses and individuals
(CNN) -- Bill Clinton had a coach, Oprah Winfrey used one to help her get to the top of her career and, of course, top sports stars have them.
But the chances are you might have one, too, as according to a recent study by the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM), coaches in the office are becoming almost common place.
In the survey of 250 UK companies, 80% said they were using or had used coaching, and another 9% were planning to do so.
"We were surprised that it was so widespread," says David Pardey, of ILM, "particularly because we did the survey in the middle of a recession."
If you train people, it will pay off year after year, and then you have people working continuously to help others perform better.David Pardey
A 2009 study by the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development confirmed that even during the economic downturn coaching remained buoyant; 7 out 10 companies surveyed reported increasing or maintaining their commitment to coaching.
According to Pardey, coaching is a tool that enables people to perform to their full capability.
"It's the difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it in practice," he says.
"So from an organizational point of view it can maximize your potential and take you from average to excellent. If everyone in the company were performing as the best person, the difference would be extraordinary."
For individuals like David Fitzgerald, executive vice president and partner at CB Richard Ellis New England, coaching elevates his game.
"I like to win, and coaching helps me to win even more," he says.
Coaching has been finding favor among companies for over a decade, according to Ginger Jenks, an executive coach, founder and president of Magellan Enterprises in Colorado.
"Five years ago, coaching was in about 75 countries, now it is in about 110," says Jenks who is certified with the International Coach Federation, where she has also served on the board.
Jenks believes that coaching is going where music and sports have always been.
"If you want to get to the top, you need a coach. In the past, I was a leader's secret weapon. Now, a coach is accepted as a must-have for people in the top of their field," says Jenks.
The reason for its growing popularity could be its win-win effect. The ILM study found that 95% of companies who used coaching said it has benefited the individual as well as the organization.
There are a couple of hitches, however. One is assuring that a coach is fully qualified and a current lack of standardization means anyone can call themselves a coach. The second is cost. Coaching is not inexpensive, but that is a fact experts believe is pushing another growing trend in the industry; companies training and keeping their own coaches on staff.
"This is where we are seeing the real growth happening in terms of business coaching," says Suzanna Prout, managing director of Xenonex Limited, an executive coaching and leadership development company.
Pardey agrees: "If you train people, it will pay off year after year, and then you have people working continuously to help others perform better. It will be a significant feature of successful organizations."
That is what happened at Doncaster College in the UK, where principal and CEO George Trow, says coaching and management development has transformed the school from a poorly functioning one to a success story.
"When I came here, the college had had seven principals in five years," says Trow, adding that both the student and financial performance of the school were inadequate.
To turn things around, Trow put 70 managers through a coaching program and trained ten internal managers as coaches. He wanted to install a coaching culture and this made the program financially sustainable.
Almost three years after the introduction of the coaching program, Trow says the student success rate has increased dramatically and the school is in a healthy financial state.
"What has happened is that we are seeing a more effective performance from people, better conflict resolution, better communication, and we have been able to deal with a lot of thorny issues that had been parked for a while," he says.
According to Prout, what coaching does is help show "an organization's blind spots."
"It is about having that discipline to be asking yourself the tough, challenging and open questions that people often have a tough time asking themselves," she says.

Suspect sought in fatal Phoenix office shooting
By CNN Staff
updated 11:20 AM EST, Thu January 31, 2013
One victim was killed, and two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries after a shooting in Phoenix, police said. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
One of three shooting victims dies of injuries, Phoenix police say
Other two victims have non-life-threatening injuries, police say
Police identify suspect as Arthur Douglas Harmon, 70, last seen in a white Kia
Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Phoenix police were searching Wednesday for a 70-year-old man suspected in the shooting of three people, one of whom died, in an office building.
Arthur Douglas Harmon had gone to the building to discuss "some type of litigation," Phoenix Police Public Information Officer Tommy Thompson told CNN affiliate KTVK.
After the meeting, at about 10:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), Harmon shot Steven Singer, 48; a 43-year-old man who was in critical condition, and a 32-year-old woman, Thompson said.
The law firm of Osborn Maledon identified one of its attorneys, Mark Hummels, as one of the victims. He was involved in a client mediation when he was shot, the Phoenix firm said.
"We believe the two men were his targets," Thompson said. The woman, whose injury was not life-threatening, "just happened to be in the way when the shooting occurred."
Harmon then fled in a 2013 Kia Optima, Arizona license plate AVS-2052, he said. Harmon shot at a witness who was following him, Thompson said. "Anybody who contacts him needs to be aware that he is armed and dangerous," he said.
Two other people who were not shot were also taken to a hospital, one for "some other type of injury not related to gunfire," and the other "may have been related to stress," Thompson said.
Former astronaut Mark Kelly referred to the shooting during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington on gun violence. "There's 50 or so police cars on the scene," he said.
Kelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, this month launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, which seeks to raise money to counter the influence of the gun lobby.
Two years ago, Giffords was shot in the head by a gunman in a parking lot in Tucson.
CNN's Deanna Hackney in Atlanta and Casey Wian in Phoenix contributed to this report.

Parents of Boston bombing suspect share phone call with son
By CNN Staff
updated 9:52 PM EDT, Wed June 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's parents play parts of a phone call with him on ITN's Channel 4
The parents insist their sons, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are innocent Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout and was run over by his brother
(CNN) -- Inside their dark, barren home in Dagestan, Zubeidat and Anzor Tsarnaev finally hear the voice they've been longing to hear for weeks.
It's the voice of their only surviving son, Dzhokhar. To the outside world, he's suspected of helping to launch a gruesome attack at the Boston Marathon that killed three people and maimed dozens more.
But to the Tsarnaevs, Dzhokhar is an innocent teen who has been victimized by the American justice system.
In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate ITN, Zubeidat Tsarnaev plays a recorded phone call with her 19-year-old son. It's their first conversation since Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shot and arrested in April.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his own words
Zubeidat Tsarnaev asks her son whether he's in pain.
Video shows suspects at gym days before attack
"No, of course not. I'm already eating and have been for a long time," Dzhokhar responds in the call from a prison hospital recorded last week. "They are giving me rice and chicken now. Everything's fine."
Dzhokhar's apparent calm surprises his mother.
"I felt like he would scream, you know, like, 'What's going on?'" Zubeidat Tsarnaev tells ITN's Channel 4. "Instead, he was just calming me down."
The parents insist their sons, Dzhokhar and 26-year-old Tamerlan, weren't responsible for the Boston bombings on April 15.
Dzhokhar: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims
"It is terrible what happened, you know, but I know that my kids did not do it," Zubeidat Tsarnaev says.
After a wild police chase, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police. He was also run over by his fleeing brother.
The family says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was supposed to visit Dagestan the same week as the bombing.
"We were waiting for you on the 18th at home," Anzor Tsarnaev tells his son in the phone call. "Not in our worst nightmares did we imagine this."

The father says he doesn't think his son understands what has happened to him.
"I understand. I'm just someone in shock because justice has vanished," Anzor Tsarnaev says. "There is no justice. It's impossible to understand what happened."
Anzor Tsarnaev tells his son they will meet again in heaven.
"We're going to be together," he says.

Mideast peace talks resume in Jerusalem
By Matt Smith and Samira Said, CNN updated 9:03 PM EDT, Wed August 14, 2013
Every president in the past 50 years has tried to broker peace in the Middle East, including when President Jimmy Carter ushered the historic Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on March 26, 1979. Here's a look at other recent attempts for peace:
President Barack Obama walks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, at the White House on September 1, 2010.
Then-President George W. Bush walks with then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, left, and Palestinian President Abbas on November 27, 2007, during the Annapolis Conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland. The peace conference was attended by 16 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Syria, Israel and the Palestinians. A joint statement was the only thing agreed upon under heavy American pressure and by avoiding specific reference to any of the core issues. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, left, with the then-President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat pose for a photograph on July 21, 2000, at Camp David, in Maryland. The Camp David Summit was an effort to resolve the issues of the 52-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict including the status of Jerusalem, the borders and nature of a Palestinian state, and the future of Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees. The Summit ended without an agreement.
President Clinton stands between then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzahk Rabin, left, and Yasser Arafat at the White House on September 13, 1993. Rabin and Arafat shook hands for the first time after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a historic agreement on Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. The peace process faltered after Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist on November 4, 1995.
Then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, left, shakes hands with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, in the garden of Camp David on September 6, 1978. With the help of then-President Jimmy Carter, the Camp David Accords became the groundbreaking first-ever peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Talks resumed Wednesday evening, senior Palestinian official says
Israel releases Palestinian prisoners ahead of new peace talks
But Palestinians are angered by Israeli plans for new construction in East Jerusalem
The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010
(CNN) -- The long-awaited peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians resumed Wednesday evening in Jerusalem, a senior Palestinian official told CNN -- three years after the last direct negotiations stalled over the issue of settlements in disputed territory.
As a gesture of goodwill, Israel began releasing more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners late Tuesday on the eve of new peace talks that have been complicated by Israeli plans for new housing in East Jerusalem.
Some of the Palestinians had been held for more than 20 years. But as the vans rolled away, a group of demonstrators waved signs condemning the release, complaining that the prisoners had Israeli blood on their hands.

The prisoner release came after Israel said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope will be the capital of their future state.
Opinion: Why Netanyahu's dark world view clouds peace prospects
The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010, and critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks.
"Netanyahu has to decide which government he is heading: a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement, or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement," said Shelly Yachimovich, head of the Labor Party and the Israeli opposition.
In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to "creeping annexation" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a "heavy toll" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians.
And in Washington, where American leaders have pushed both sides to return to the table, the State Department said it had "serious concerns" with the new announcement.
"We've encouraged both sides broadly speaking to refrain from taking steps that could undermine trust. We said that from the beginning," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. "We've also been clear that these are complicated issues, and there will be bumps in the road."
Daoud Kuttab, a columnist for the online Middle Eastern news site Al-Monitor, said the released prisoners are a bargaining chip to make sure the Palestinians don't back out of the talks despite their anger over new settlements.
Opinion: Five ways to tell is peace talks are serious
"They're trapped, and Mahmoud Abbas has egg on his face today because he can't get out of the talks," Kuttab told CNN.
Both sides agreed to resume talks for nine months under American mediation, said Rami Khoury, a veteran Middle East analyst at the American University of Beirut.
"This is a significant gesture, so therefore you're going to hear a lot of noise from both sides -- complaints, grievances," Khoury said. "But you can pretty much discount most of what you hear in public, because they're both clearly committed to doing this for nine months. And we really need to give it time to see what's going to happen."
Abbas and Netanyahu are "hemmed in by domestic constraints," leaving neither side likely to make significant changes on its own, Khoury said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that "many difficult choices" lie ahead for both sides, but held out hope that "reasonable compromises" could be reached.
Khoury called that a "weak statement" that downplayed expectations for the talks.
As a result, most observers have little hope that the talks will produce a breakthrough in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he said the U.S. role in the talks is a "wild card" that could defy those expectations.
"What is the United States going to do?" he asked. "Will it push both sides? Will it pressure them? Will it cajole them? Will it entice them, and will it make serious bridging and endgame proposals? We have no idea about any of that."

DA to appeal court's decision to overturn conviction of Catholic priest
By Luisa Navarro, CNN
updated 5:03 PM EST, Mon December 30, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Court overturns Monsignor William Lynn's child endangerment conviction
DA says judges showed disregard for child victims of pedophile priests
Lynn's bail has been posted
(CNN) -- Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Monday he will appeal a Superior Court's decision to reverse Monsignor William Lynn's conviction for covering up crimes of offending priests.
A three-judge panel ruled Thursday that Lynn -- who had been the first Roman Catholic priest in the United States to be convicted of covering up the abuses of others -- should be released, reversing his 2012 conviction for one count of child endangerment. He originally was sentenced to three to six years.
"There is something wrong with this Superior Court panel," Williams said.
Lynn's conviction was for not removing a defrocked priest, Edward Avery, from active ministry in the 1990s after learning Avery had molested a teen. Avery pleaded guilty in March 2012 to sexually assaulting the 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-99 school year and remains in prison.
Williams adamantly expressed his disapproval of the Superior Court's decision.
"I am disgusted by the Superior Court's cavalier, disregard for the child victims of pedophile priests and Monsignor Lynn's role," Williams told reporters. "Monsignor William Lynn knew Father Avery had sexually molested children."
Lynn's attorneys had convinced the Superior Court panel that the laws at the time only applied to people who directly supervised children.
"Certainly, he (Williams) has a prerogative to appeal. I don't think his appeal will be successful, but he certainly has the right," Lynn's attorney, Thomas Bergstrom said.
A spokesman for the State Correctional Institution at Waymart, Pennsylvania, told CNN that Lynn's bail had been posted, but he hadn't been released, because of pending paperwork.
Lynn's bail was $250,000, Bergstrom said.
Williams said it is undeniable Lynn, now 62, was responsible for endangering the child.
"We will charge everyone that we believe we have sufficient evidence within the statute of limitations to prosecute," Williams said, "No one is protected or untouchable -- wherever the evidence leads us we will go."
Lynn, now 62, made no statement after last week's ruling. After he was convicted 18 months ago, he said: "I've tried to serve God as best I could. My best was not good enough."

ATLANTA (CNN) -- As native sons go, only a few leave legacies that reach far beyond the native city -- encompassing an era, a time of profound change in a nation. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of those few. In Atlanta, the streets of the neighborhood that nurtured King on his way to adulthood -- and comforted the adult King through years of struggle -- are open for walking and, in some cases, look much as they might have when King and his family lived on Auburn Avenue.
