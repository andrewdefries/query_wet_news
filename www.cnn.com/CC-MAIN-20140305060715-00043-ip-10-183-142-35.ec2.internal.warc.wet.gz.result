Autism ruling fails to convince many vaccine-link believersStory Highlights Families dealing with autism have mixed response to Thursday's ruling Scientific community says no credible research supports autism-vaccine link Advocacy groups question credibility of the vaccine court Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO EXPLAINER By Madison Park CNN A special court's Thursday ruling that no proven link exists between autism and certain early childhood vaccines seems to have done little to change the sometimes-passionate opinion fueling the debate. Thousands of parents have sought compensation saying, early childhood vaccinations triggered their children's autism. Amanda Guyton, a mother of a 6-year-old boy with autism, was "incredibly happy" with the decision and said it reaffirmed her belief that her son's autism has nothing to do with vaccines. "We're ready for them to get on real research like educational strategies and help for kids," she said. "An awful lot of money and effort and time were spent on vaccines when three or four studies said no, there isn't a link." Meanwhile, John Best, the father of a 12-year-old boy with autism, said: "The whole thing stinks." Guyton and Best were not involved in the cases, but were following the news because of their interest in autism. Three families -- the Cedillos, the Hazlehursts and the Snyders -- had sought damage awards from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for their children who have autism, a disorder that the parents contend was triggered by the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella combined with vaccines containing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. Watch Campbell Brown's take on the controversy » The panel of "special masters" ruled that these petitioners had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that the childhood vaccines caused autism in their children. A vocal segment of autism parents has contended that childhood vaccinations recommended by the government cause the disorder. Health agencies and the scientific community have disputed that notion. In defending its conclusion that no link exists, the Institute of Medicine cited five large studies that have failed to prove any connection between autism and thimerosal and 14 large studies finding no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

"As the scientific community has been saying for a long time, there is no good, credible, reproducible research that supports the hypothesis that MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine causes autism," said Dr. Max Wiznitzer, an autism expert at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Wiznitzer testified in two of these three lawsuits brought against the government's National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. "What the decision tells us is that these vaccinations are safe," he said. "The medical evidence tells us there is no association between vaccines and autism. This is one more piece that helps confirm that conclusion." The defendant, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, released a statement Thursday: "Hopefully, the determination by the Special Masters will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism." Meanwhile, some autism advocacy groups such as SafeMinds also criticized the HHS saying the "deck is stacked against families when they enter 'vaccine court.'" National Autism Association president Wendy Fournier agreed. "If you have a vaccine injury, you're forced to sue Health and Human Services instead of suing the manufacturers. It's the government that oversees these court cases," said Fournier, who is the mother of a 9-year-old girl with autism. "The conflict of interest is so huge in so many levels by having the government responsible for not only promoting vaccine program, but also responsible for overseeing the safety." Fournier said her daughter was a happy, healthy toddler who developed autism after receiving shots. She said she's heard countless similar stories from other parents. The special court denied Mike and Theresa Cedillo's claim that vaccines caused autism in their daughter, Michelle, 14, who can't walk without help and receives nourishment from a feeding tube. "We're obviously really disappointed," Theresa Cedillo said. Health Library

Tom Powers is an attorney for a litigation steering committee representing thousands of families that fall into three categories: those that claim that MMR vaccines and thimerosal-containing vaccines can combine to cause autism; those who claim thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism; and those who claim that MMR vaccines, without any link to thimerosal, can cause autism. "We're disappointed in the outcome of the court's decision," he said. "However, these decisions are the first step in a long process. The whole process was designed to raise every possible issue in these cases -- hear all the evidence in these cases, knowing that ultimately appeals courts will be making the final decisions." This week's ruling brought a different outcome from the Hannah Poling case. In November 2007, the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation concluded that the Georgia girl's illness that had predisposed her to symptoms of autism was "significantly aggravated" by the vaccinations she received as a toddler and that her family should therefore be compensated. But Thursday, Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. wrote in his ruling in the Cedillos case, "The evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen far short of demonstrating such a link" between autism and vaccinations. Wiznitzer said the ruling sent a message. "Instead of spending resources investigating ideas that are hypothetical and have no proven value, we need to invest our time and resources into projects that will better determine the reasons for autism and the interventions that are best needed," he said.

Carrie Underwood album 'Blown Away' debuts at No. 1
By Grady Smith, EW.com
updated 4:44 PM EDT, Wed May 9, 2012
Carrie Underwood's fourth album, "Blown Away" is her third straight number one album.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Carrie Underwood's fourth album "Blown Away" is the number one album
Since its release this week it has sold 267,000 copies
Her current single "Good Girl" has climbed up to No. 8 on the country songs chart
(EW.com) -- Carrie Underwood blew away the competition on the Billboard 200 this week, scoring her third straight number one album with her fourth release, "Blown Away," and moving 267,000 copies.
Other Top 10 newcomers included Norah Jones, with her Danger Mouse-produced "Little Broken Hearts," B.O.B., Marilyn Manson, and the first-ever soundtrack from NBC's "Smash."
Check out the full Top 10 below:
1. Carrie Underwood, "Blown Away" -- 267,000
This is Underwood's third straight number one after 2009′s "Play On," which debuted with 318,000, and 2007′s "Carnival Ride," which started with 527,000. Underwood's 2005 debut "Some Hearts" is her only album to not reach the summit of the chart — it debuted at No. 2 with 315,000 (behind Madonna's "Confessions on a Dance Floor") and eventually sold 7.2 million copies. Her current single "Good Girl" has climbed up to No. 8 on the country songs chart, and follow-up "Blown Away," which she performed on the Idol stage last week, kicks off its run at No. 22 on the Hot Digital Songs chart.
2. Norah Jones, "Little Broken Hearts" -- 110,000
Norah Jones could have stayed the course and made lovely, jazz-tinged, perhaps slightly snoozy records and gone platinum for the rest of her career (her Grammy-winning debut "Come Away With Me" sold over 10 million copies, and her three subsequent records have all reached platinum status), but the chanteuse took a risk with her darker, Danger Mouse-produced fifth album. As such, "Little Broken Hearts" opened to Jones' lowest sales ever — but somehow, we doubt she's too worried about it.
3. Various Artists, "Now 42" -- 95,000
The last five editions of the popular compilation albums have debuted in third place. It's the hits, kids: Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)," Flo Rida's "Good Feeling," Karmin's "Brokenhearted" and more.
4. Adele, "21" -- 77,000
At this point, what's left say? Last week, it had sold roughly 8.9 million copies; now, it's rounding out on 9 million. Adele's world domination continues.
5. B.o.B., "Strange Clouds" -- 76,000
The Atlanta rapper's sophomore album sold slightly fewer copies than his 2010 debut "B.o.B Presents: The Adventures Of Bobby Ray," which started at number one with sales of 84,000 and ended up selling about 597,000 copies total. Still, after a handful of singles that didn't exactly burn up the chart ("Strange Clouds" and "Play the Guitar" both failed to make much of an impact on radio), B.o.B. should be happy with these results. It seems his late-in-the-game pop-oriented material, like Ryan Tedder tune "So Good" and Taylor Swift collaboration "Both of Us" (which debuts at number 8 on this week's Hot Digital Songs chart), helped lift the album's fortunes in the weeks leading to its release.
6. Lionel Richie, "Tuskegee" -- 64,000
The soft-rock star's country comeback record has sold 679,000 copies in six weeks. Say you, say him, say platinum: It was also just certified for shipments of 1 million copies to stores.
7. Jack White, "Blunderbuss" -- 56,000
The onetime White Stripes frontman, who earned his first chart-topping week ever last week, dropped by 59 percent after last week's debut, still giving him 194,000 total in two weeks.
8. One Direction, "Up All Night" -- 45,000
After eight weeks, the UK boy band has sold a whopping 586,000 units of their debut effort. That's what makes them beautiful (at least to Simon Cowell).
9. Soundtrack, "The Music Of SMASH" -- 40,000
The first collection of songs sfrom NBC's inside-Broadway musical drama "Smash" started slower than the first "Glee" soundtrack, which debuted at number 4 in November 2009, but that's to be expected given "Smash's" smaller audience and general proportion of pop covers to originals.
10. Marilyn Manson, "Born Villain" -- 38,000
He may have been born to his lowest numbers yet — but it's still the Prince of Darkness' seventh top 10 album.

Solemia dashes Japanese hopes in thrilling Arc finish
By Alysen Miller, CNN
updated 6:23 AM EDT, Mon October 8, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Outsider Solemia wins Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Runs down Japanese favorite Orfevre in final strides Epsom Derby winner Camelot finishes seventh Last year's winner Danedream unable to defend the crown
(CNN) -- Japanese raider Orfevre failed in his bid to become the first non-European trained winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe when he was denied by home-grown outsider Solemia at Longchamp Sunday.
After a huge last-to-first move, Orfevre was dramatically run down in the final strides by Solemia to give jockey Olivier Peslier his fourth win in the race, breaking thousands of Japanese hearts in the process.
Orfevre, already a Triple Crown winner in his home country, looked to be pulling clear of the field as they entered the home straight.
But four-year-old filly Solemia responded to her jockey to run down Orfevre, ridden by four-time champion jockey Christophe Soumillon, winning by a head.
Japan's hopes pinned on Orfevre
French hopes rest on Shareta
Although not considered among the favorites heading in to the Longchamp showpiece, Solemia's victory maintains the successful recent record of fillies in this race.
Last year's winner, Danedream, was also a filly.
Thousands of Japanese fans and more than 100 accredited journalists from the country had descended on Paris to witness arguably their best chance at capturing the Arc since Deep Impact in 2006.
Racing-mad Japan has long had designs on Europe's most prestigious race, having sent their first runner to Longchamp in 1969.
Japanese Horse of the Year Orfevre was widely considered among the favorites for this year's edition, despite being drawn in the unfavorable stall 18 -- the widest possible berth.
Widely considered Europe's most prestigious all-age race, this year's running was notable for its high-profile absentees.
First Ed Dunlop's tough filly Snow Fairy, third in this race in 2011, was ruled out after suffering a slight injury in training.
Then defending champion Danedream was sensationally scratched after an outbreak of swamp fever at her training center in Germany.
Although Danedream herself is completely healthy, German veterinary authorities immediately slapped a travel ban on all horses entering or leaving the facility, meaning she was unable to make the trip to Paris.
With Frankel, rated the best horse in the world, also opting to sit this one out, it appeared to leave the field wide open for Orfevre, who had previously demonstrated form over the mile-and-a-half distance, as well as a devastating turn of foot.
Outside of the duel for first place, Masterstroke, ridden by French jockey Mikael Barzalona, finished third.
The Aiden O'Brien-trained Camelot, ridden by Godolphin jockey Frankie Dettori, never factored and finished down the field in seventh place.

FAA to pilots: Turn off those electronic devices
By Mike M. Ahlers, CNN
updated 4:10 PM EST, Tue January 15, 2013
A new FAA proposal would limit airline pilots' use of personal electronics during a flight. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Proposed rule would bar use of personal electronics throughout flight
Plan stems partly from incident involving airline pilots who overflew destination
Current rules bar use of electronics during takeoff and landing periods
Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government is aggressively trying to curb distracted driving and is now launching an effort aimed at distracted flying.
Airline pilots would be prohibited from using personal electronics at any time during a flight, except if it directly relates to the operation of the plane, according to a new Federal Aviation Administration proposal.
A longstanding "sterile cockpit" rule currently bars the use of any personal gadgets during critical phases of flight. This usually means operations related to takeoff and landing.
The new plan ordered by Congress last year is a direct result of an infamous 2009 incident involving a Northwest Airlines crew who overflew Minneapolis by 150 miles.
The pilots later said they were distracted as they reviewed a work schedule on a personal computer.
The FAA also cited the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407, a commuter plane that slammed into a house near Buffalo, also in 2009. A pilot aboard the ill-fated flight sent a text message on her personal cell phone just before takeoff.
While it was unrelated to the cause of the crash, transportation safety investigators used the example of crew texting in recommending regulators ban all personal electronics during flight.
"These incidents illustrate the potential for such devices to create a hazardous distraction during critical phases of flight," the proposed FAA measure said.
But the new prohibition, if finalized, would represent a near-blanket prohibition of electronic devices.
Pilots would be able to use laptops, tablets and other devices for flying the plane or for safety reasons only.

Syrian government, opposition seek probe of chemical weapons claims By Chelsea J. Carter, Amir Ahmed and Barbara Starr, CNN updated 8:12 AM EDT, Thu March 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The Security Council asks Ban Ki-moon for a "swift, thorough and impartial" investigation
U.N. Security Council calls for investigation to "shed light" on chemical weapons claims
"We have no evidence" to prove chemical weapons use, U.S. ambassador to Syria says
Medical evidence and satellite imagery are a focus of chemical weapons inquiry, sources say
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and the opposition demanded independent investigations Wednesday into countering accusations of the use of chemical weapons, allegations that prompted most members of the U.N. Security Council to call for a probe. The demands, made in writing to the United Nations, came a day after the government and the rebels accused one another of using chemical weapons in fighting in the flashpoint province of Aleppo and a rural suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus.
Even as both sides accused the other of using such weapons, the U.S. ambassador to Syria and other officials said there was no evidence to substantiate the reports.
"So far, we have no evidence to substantiate the reports that chemical weapons were used yesterday," Ambassador Robert Ford told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
"But I want to underline that we're looking very carefully at these reports. We are consulting with partners in the region and in the international community."
In this photo provided by the anti-government activist group Aleppo Media Center, Syrian men help survivors out of a building in Aleppo after it was bombed, allegedly by a Syrian regime warplane on Saturday, February 8.

Syrian civil war in photos
Experts unsure Syria used chemical arms
Livni: Chemical weapons used in Syria
Syria chemical weapons a 'game-changer'
Chemical weapons in Syrian civil war?
Ford, who was pulled from Syria when the United States closed its embassy in Damascus more than a year ago, said he was "skeptical" of Russian reports that the rebel Free Syrian Army had used chemical weapons.
Competing calls for investigations
Throughout the civil war, which began in 2011, it has been difficult for the international community to determine the validity of claims by both sides of violence and casualties because access to the country has been severely restricted by the Syrian government.
Even so, the United Nations confirmed Wednesday it was studying a written request received from Syrian government officials, who were calling for a neutral party to investigate their claim.
A majority of the members of the U.N. Security Council plan to send a letter to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to request an inquiry to "shed light" over the reports, said Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United Nations. He made the comments after Wednesday's closed-door meeting of the Security Council.
The letter asks Ban to conduct a "swift, thorough and impartial" investigation, Philip Parham, the UK's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said.
Parham described the Syrian government's demand as a request for a narrow investigation, looking into only one alleged incident.
"The way in which they have framed the request prejudges the outcome of the investigation by alleging it's the opposition that is responsible for that case of use of chemical weapons," he said.
The Security Council is calling for a broader investigation.
The rebels' coalition government, meanwhile, demanded an international investigation and called for a delegation to visit the sites of the alleged attacks.
Military analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation.
The use of chemical and biological weapons are banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention, which bans the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall.
As a result, the United States has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons stockpile should al-Assad be forced from office.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday reiterated his warning to Syria's government that it would be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons "or their transfer to terrorists."
"We intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened," Obama told reporters during a joint news conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The president said he was "deeply skeptical" of Syrian government claims that the opposition used chemical weapons.
Obama has previously said Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a "red line."
"We have been very clear to the Assad regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized," he told reporters. "That would change my calculus; that would change my equation."

Intelligence agencies pore over the evidence
Intelligence officials around the world were investigating the accusations, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday.
Investigators were talking to rebels and defectors, poring over medical intelligence regarding symptoms reported by doctors and looking at satellite imagery used to track missiles launched and chemical weapons movements, the officials said on condition of anonymity. They were not authorized to release details to the media.
A spokesman for Netanyahu, Mark Regev, told CNN that Israeli officials had no confirmation that chemical weapons had been used.
But Regev's comments did not square with those of Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni.
"It is clear for us here in Israel" that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, and an international response should be on the table, Livni told CNN in an exclusive interview from her home in Tel Aviv.
Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence the Syrian government has directed the use of any chemical weapons.
But she said the development would pose a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria.
Their concerns centered on an attack Tuesday in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo. State-run media blamed rebels for the attack, which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others.
Rebels say they have no chemical weapons
On Wednesday, Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, said the Syrian government has asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to open an investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons by "terrorist groups," which is how the government refers to rebels.
But the opposition Free Syrian Army said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons and blamed the casualties on a government missile.
Separately, an opposition group said the government attacked the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh with "chemical rockets," causing an unspecified number of deaths along with cases of suffocation, nausea and hysteria. There was no immediate government response.
The reports ignited a firestorm of reactions, with Russia slamming the rebels and some U.S. lawmakers saying that Washington might need to take action against the Syrian government.
Observers: Images are not consistent with a chemical weapons attack
But images posted by Syrian state-run media of the aftermath of the Aleppo incident, which the government blamed on rebels, are not consistent with a chemical weapon attack, some observers said.
"There are no images of the site of the attack; just of some affected people. These people do not show outward symptoms of a CW (chemical weapon) attack. Definitely not mustard; definitely not a nerve agent," wrote Jean Pascal Zanders, senior research fellow at the European Union Institute for Security Studies.
"There are far too many people, including non-medical staff, around the affected persons. Apart from a surgical mask, nobody wears any protective garment or gas masks. If there would have been a CW attack with one of the agents known (or believed) to be in Syria's arsenal, then most of the people present would have been fatally or seriously contaminated."
He added that, during the Arab uprisings, witness reports cited chemical attacks, but none had been confirmed. "People are exposed to a wide range of toxicants in today's battlefield," he said in an e-mail. "Furthermore, once a rumor gets around, people are more likely to think that they suffer from symptoms similar to the ones being rumored."
Q&A: What's Syria's chemical weapon potential, and what are the health risks?
Not the first round of claims
U.S. officials pointed to previous claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons, which were found to be false after extensive investigation.
The Syrian government did not use chemical weapons against residents of Homs in a December attack, a U.S. State Department investigation showed, but did apparently misuse a riot-control gas in the incident, according to senior U.S. officials.
The officials said the State Department launched a probe from its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, after reports from doctors and activists that dozens of people suffered nervous system, respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments after inhaling the gas in Homs on December 23.
The civil war -- which began two years ago after a government crackdown on Syrian protesters -- has left around 70,000 people dead and uprooted more than 1 million others, the United Nations has said.

Partisan views of IRS targeting: Political conspiracy or overzealous scrutiny
By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 3:46 PM EDT, Tue June 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Legislators clash at a House hearing where victims of targeting appeared
As Congress probes IRS targeting, the two parties offer varying takes on what happened
Congress, the IRS, the inspector general and the Justice Department are investigating
The GOP House Appropriations chairman evokes Nixon in warning of an enemies list
Washington (CNN) -- Like a partisan version of the proverbial blind men touching the elephant, members of Congress have starkly differing views of the scope and magnitude of the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status that dominates headlines and committee hearings.
Depending on their party, legislators offer particular takes on the controversy based on which part of the IRS elephant they are describing.
Republicans portray the controversy uncovered by an inspector general's report last month as another example of big government gone wild under President Barack Obama.
"It is his administration, it is the Obama IRS, and we intend to try and get to truth here as to what exactly happened and get to the facts," House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, told reporters on Tuesday.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said after a hearing on Tuesday with victims of the targeting that the scope of the problem was larger than first thought.
"This is a nationwide, systematic approach targeting people and groups of conservative beliefs," Camp declared.

Analysis: IRS controversy turns ugly
As part of their messaging for next year's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote, some Republicans try to draw parallels to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s that led to GOP President Richard Nixon's resignation.
"We will not tolerate another political enemies list," House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said Monday in a clear reference to the Nixon administration.
"We've been there before. Having an enemies list harkens back to a dark page in our past, and the arrogance of power that we've seen from those involved in this instance is deeply, deeply disconcerting," Rogers said.
Democrats say they are equally outraged that the IRS unit based in Cincinnati that handles requests for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status used a list of criteria including group names that included "tea party" and other conservative labels to assess the level of scrutiny applied.
However, they argue, no evidence of an administration-wide conspiracy has emerged so far, with the inspector general's report that revealed the problem blaming poor management and stating there was no known political motivation.
"There is no smoking gun," said Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York at Tuesday's hearing, while his party colleague Rep. John Lewis of Georgia added that similar targeting of liberal groups occurred under GOP President George W. Bush.
"Where was the outrage then?" Lewis asked.
Some Democrats said tougher scrutiny of groups seeking tax-exempt status was warranted after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case that removed limits on some campaign spending by corporations and unions.
Rep. Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat, told the panel of witnesses representing conservative groups who underwent greater IRS scrutiny that the issue involved a gray area of potentially political organizations seeking tax-exempt status.
"Each of your groups is highly political," McDermott told the panel that included organizations opposed to gay marriage and abortion. "You all are entrenched in some of the most controversial political issues in the country."
By applying for tax-exempt status, "you're asking the government to help fund that," he added.
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan took exception to McDermott's point, telling the panelists "welcome to Washington" after his Democratic colleague completed his comments.
"You're to blame, I guess is the message here," Ryan said, noting that there was no evidence presented to the committee that liberal groups received the same extra scrutiny and delayed responses as the conservative organizations.
On Monday, the new head of the embattled IRS was asked how he would restore public trust in the agency after the targeting scandal and a new report on Tuesday that described wasteful spending.
"It is going to be a difficult process," acknowledged Daniel Werfel, a career public servant appointed by Obama last month to clean up the mess dominating the early months of his second term.
Werfel described a process of identifying what happened, who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what Republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused the constitutional rights of conservative groups.
'Liar' charge a step too far for some Republicans
At Tuesday's hearing, the fifth so far on the controversy with another scheduled for later this week, witnesses from conservative groups targeted by the IRS described themselves as shocked by what happened and fearful over what it meant.
Becky Gerritson of the Wetumpka Tea Party in Alabama declared that additional questioning and other IRS delays over her organization's application "was a willful act of intimidation to discourage our little group."
"They think they are our master, and they are mistaken," she said, her voice quavering with emotion. "I want to protect and preserve the America that I grew up in. I am terrified it is slipping away."
John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, accused the IRS of leaking this organization's confidential donor list in violation of felony law.
He took issue with a statement by a Democratic panel member that the IRS targeting was inadvertent, saying the agency "deliberately provided our donor list to a political adversary who had been seeking it for a long time."
Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon argued that Eastman's description of the Human Rights Campaign as a political foe raised questions about whether his group was devoted to social welfare, as required for tax-exempt status.
That prompted another witness, Kevin Kookogey of Linchpins of Liberty, which describes itself as a conservative education group for young people, to criticize Blumenauer for political bias.
"Some of the Democrats on the committee implied that what's social welfare to them is social welfare, but what's social welfare to us is negotiable," he said to applause from the public gallery in the hearing room.
On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee will examine the wasteful IRS spending reported by a separate inspector general's report made public on Tuesday.
It showed that the IRS spent about $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012. One of those, an August 2010 meeting for 2,600 employees in Anaheim, California, cost more than $4 million for everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos.
The audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $3.2 million - came from unused funds allocated for hiring. This was in the same year that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax-exempt status, in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle increased applications that year.
In response, the IRS said it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87% since 2010.
"The expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the IRS or the spending that has occurred over the past several years," wrote Pamela LaRue, the agency's chief financial officer.
At the same time, LaRue defended the need for large-scale conferences at the time, noting that nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced, and the agency faced added concerns about security after a Texas man crashed his plane into the IRS office in Austin, killing himself and two other people.
"Although the average cost per employee was reasonable, the IRS recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources," LaRue wrote.
IRS faces new battle on overspending
Meanwhile, the IRS targeting also is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Treasury inspector general's office and Werfel in his new capacity.

Republicans at Tuesday's hearing expressed frustration with what they called a lack of government accountability so far, as well as the need for more information on who was responsible for the targeting.
"For anyone to suggest that these individuals' rights should be limited because of political differences is discrimination," said GOP Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, adding that there would be no question of wrongdoing if the bias involved "white versus black" or "Jews versus Christians."
Democrats sought a legislative solution, saying the lack of clarity over what constitutes political activity left IRS bureaucrats in the position of having to make that assessment.

By the Numbers: Internal Revenue Service
The IRS controversy has provoked an increasingly bitter dispute between the White House and congressional Republicans that included harsh accusations by both sides last weekend.
White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment directly Monday on the accusation by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa that he was a "paid liar."
On Tuesday, Cantor dodged questions about whether he agreed with Issa's insult.
IRS investigation takes nasty turn
When asked by reporters about Issa's comments, Cantor instead deflected the issue back to the White House, saying "there's been an abuse of trust on the part of this administration towards the American people. We're going to remain committed to getting to the bottom of this and let the truth come out."
Meanwhile, Cantor's Democratic counterpart blasted Issa, calling the comment about Carney "outrageous" and saying an apology was in order.
"He ought to retract that statement unless he has specific evidence which I don't believe he does," said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. "I think it was a reckless statement and undermines his presentation as someone as a judicious leader of oversight."
Hoyer added that such "wild accusations" indicated "real political bias" on the part of Issa, making it difficult to trust him to conduct an investigation of the IRS targeting and other issues.
Other Democrats have accused Issa of dirty tactics in previous investigations, including one into the botched "Fast and Furious" gun-walking operation that led to House Republicans citing Democratic Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in a dispute over access to documents.

Regular marijuana use on the rise, survey says
By Jen Christensen, CNN
updated 4:05 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2013
There appears to be a shift in the United States in favor of relaxing marijuana laws, a topic that has dipped in and out of the national conversation for decades. Public perceptions about pot have come a long way, from the dire warnings of "Reefer Madness" to growing acceptance of medical marijuana.
Sean Azzariti, an Iraq war veteran and marijuana activist, speaks to the media Wednesday, January 1, after becoming the first person to legally purchase recreational marijuana in Colorado. Colorado is the first state in the nation to allow retail pot shops. "It's huge," Azzariti said. "It hasn't even sunk in how big this is yet."

Marijuana cigarettes are hidden in a book circa 1940. Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, effectively criminalizing the drug.
A poster advertises the 1936 scare film "Reefer Madness," which described marijuana as a "violent narcotic" that first renders "sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter" on its users before "dangerous hallucinations" and then "acts of shocking violence ... ending often in incurable insanity."
Harry Anslinger was named commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics when it was established in 1930. While arguing for marijuana prohibition, he played on Americans' fear of crime and foreigners. He spun tales of people driven to insanity or murder after ingesting the drug and spoke of the 2 to 3 tons of grass being produced in Mexico. "This, the Mexicans make into cigarettes, which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white high school students," Anslinger told Congress.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
About 7.3% of Americans age 12 or older used marijuana regularly in 2012, survey finds
Marijuana is legal in two states, while 20 more allow medical use
Heroin use is up 70% since 2007, according to the survey
(CNN) -- As laws across the country become less restrictive, more Americans are reporting using marijuana regularly than ever before, according to a new survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health -- the largest of its kind -- is done annually. Results from the past five years have shown a steady increase in weed use. Last year was no exception.
In 2012, about 7.3% of Americans ages 12 or older reported regularly using marijuana. That's up from 7% of Americans in 2011. Although it's only a slight increase, the real contrast exists between 2012 and 2007, when 5.8% of Americans said they regularly used weed.
These numbers could represent an increase in use among Americans, or simply an increase in the number of people who felt OK reporting use of the drug on a national survey.
Gupta: Feds didn't address everything
Gupta: I was wrong about marijuana
There has been a lot of attention given to marijuana in the last few years. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the federal government would no longer prosecute people who used the drug in states where it was legal -- as long as there were state laws in place to keep the drug away from children.
Until that announcement, people could be brought up on federal charges even if they were within the law in their state.
How to regulate pot when it's legal
Washington and Colorado have both legalized recreational marijuana use. Some 20 other states allow people to purchase it for medical reasons.
The survey, which looks at all drug and alcohol use, showed some other interesting trends as well.
Prescription drug abuse, which has been increasing in the past few years, has leveled off. But heroin use is on the rise; the number of people using heroin is up some 80% since 2007.
Nearly 24 million Americans -- that's 9.2% of the population -- say they use illicit drugs, according to the survey.
Are American opinions on weed reaching the tipping point?

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Denver mayor says pot shops, buyers behaved "responsibly and with great accountability"
Pot buyers at one shop come from Canada, Australia, Italy, Hawaii, Alaska 700 people in line take numbers at another pot shop, but can it serve so many?
"What's going on?" a curious passenger asks; "Legal pot sale!" a man in line replies
Denver (CNN) -- Iraq war veteran Sean Azzariti described his purchase of recreational marijuana -- legally -- as a historic moment Wednesday.
"It's huge," he said at a marijuana store along a light industrial corridor outside downtown Denver. "It hasn't even sunk in how big this is yet."
Indeed, before the 3D Cannabis Center opened at 8 a.m. MT, more than 100 people were waiting in snowfall and cold under gray skies to be the next buyers of recreational pot under a landmark law voters approved in 2012. The dispensary was one of a handful that opened to lines of waiting people on New Year's Day, with scores more expected statewide in coming months.
Do you smoke pot? Tell us about it
Azzariti was selected to be the first buyer at the 3D Cannabis Center because he was a Marine from 2000 to 2006 who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder after two tours in Iraq. He can't obtain medical marijuana in Colorado because PTSD isn't a qualifying condition for that treatment, he said.
There appears to be a shift in the United States in favor of relaxing marijuana laws, a topic that has dipped in and out of the national conversation for decades. Public perceptions about pot have come a long way, from the dire warnings of "Reefer Madness" to growing acceptance of medical marijuana.

Even after Congress cracked down on marijuana in 1937, farmers were encouraged to grow the crop for rope, sails and parachutes during World War II. The "Hemp for Victory" film was released in 1942 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Marijuana cigarettes are hidden in a book circa 1940. Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, effectively criminalizing the drug.
A poster advertises the 1936 scare film "Reefer Madness," which described marijuana as a "violent narcotic" that first renders "sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter" on its users before "dangerous hallucinations" and then "acts of shocking violence ... ending often in incurable insanity."
Harry Anslinger was named commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics when it was established in 1930. While arguing for marijuana prohibition, he played on Americans' fear of crime and foreigners. He spun tales of people driven to insanity or murder after ingesting the drug and spoke of the 2 to 3 tons of grass being produced in Mexico. "This, the Mexicans make into cigarettes, which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white high school students," Anslinger told Congress.

Crowds gather to buy recreational pot Colorado prepares for legal pot
"This is what we worked so hard for the last few years," he said of the voter-approved constitutional amendment that led Colorado to become the first state in the nation to open recreational pot stores to anyone age 21 and older. "It's mind-blowing."
Azzariti, 32, bought an eighth of an ounce of pot, plus chocolate truffles laced with marijuana. Those treats are called "edibles" at the store.
The price: $59.50.
The marijuana alleviates the anxiety and stress that come from PTSD, he said, adding that he'll smoke the pot Wednesday evening.
At several recreational weed stores, buyers waited in line for three or four hours to be a part of opening-day history. Despite the hundreds of people queuing on public sidewalks, no significant problems emerged Wednesday, Denver officials said.
"I want to thank the businesses and consumers alike for acting responsibly and with great accountability today," Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock said in a statement. "Denver is a progressive city, a vibrant city, and it's incumbent on all of us to continue getting this right."
Long lines
Even three hours after the stores opened, one downtown Denver dispensary had a line of about 100 people outside the front door to the corner. The snow had stopped falling by then, and the gray skies were clearing to blue.
While patrons -- young and the old, men and women -- waited patiently in line, the demographic at the downtown dispensary tilted more toward 20- and 30-somethings.
When many buyers emerged from the store and nudged through the line, they raised their bags of newly purchased pot above their heads.
People waiting on the sidewalk cheered them.
Even though recreational weed is now legal, some purchasers declined to disclose their last names.
One woman, Dee, who didn't want to use her surname, said she waited in line for almost three hours to buy her cannabis. She and a male companion bought a small amount, she said, just to commemorate the occasion.
"We voted for it, and now it's here," Dee said of the recreational marijuana law. "We just went in and celebrated the new law. It's a new day."
She didn't mind the long wait at the LoDo's Dispensary. "Everybody is cool and mellow and nice. So it's all good," she said.
Some motorists passing the pot shop honked and cheered the queue of buyers, who whooped in return.
One motorist, however, shouted a disparaging remark about the "potheads," and the crowd muttered raspberries in response.
Buyers whiled away the hours in line by talking aloud about the benefits of marijuana as a remedy for hangovers, headaches, sleeplessness and low appetite.
Then a young woman in a passing SUV slowed and interrupted them by asking, "What's going on, guys?"
"Legal pot sale!" a man in line shouted.
"Oh, I need an eighth!" the young woman shouted back excitedly. The car drove on.
In fact, around 11:30 a.m. MT, Don Andrews, whose family owns and runs the dispensary, announced to the waiting people on the sidewalk that he was being forced to limit sales to an eighth of an ounce to each person, though under the new state law, a resident can buy up to an ounce.
The dispensary will close at 7 p.m. MT, but Andrews said he may have to start turning people away at 4 p.m. The line had gone out the front door, down the street and around the corner by 2 p.m. MT, when more than 400 people had made purchases.
In all, Andrews counted buyers from several states and countries. Buyers showed IDs from Vermont, Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, Wyoming, Louisiana -- and even Alaska and Hawaii. Other prospective weed buyers came from Canada, Australia and Italy, though the Italian man, 21, walked away because he had to catch a bus for his tour of America.
South of downtown, the Evergreen Apothecary was encountering the same phenomenon: 700 people in line took numbers, but employees said they might not be able to serve all of them by the close of business.
The atmosphere at the dispensaries was clearly celebratory and cheerful. For example, about 10 miles outside of downtown, one man said he had waited in the snow since 2:30 a.m. for the Medicine Man dispensary to open at 8 a.m.
When asked how he felt after making the first sale there, he responded: "I'll feel better in an hour."
Applauding, criticizing the new law
Even before the weed went on sale, enthusiasts were anticipating the end of an era.
"Prohibition is over," blared a flier for New Year's Eve festivities at Casselman's Bar in Denver. "Celebrate Cannabis freedom in style."
As many as 30 stores throughout Colorado will sell recreational weed. Of the estimated 30 stores, 18 are in Denver.
"With Washington state next to implement marijuana legalization and other states strongly considering enacting similar laws, we believe this marks the beginning of the end of the nation's decades-long war on marijuana and its harmful human and fiscal toll," Ezekiel Edwards, a director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a prepared statement.
But not everyone was applauding.
"Legalization -- with all of the American-style promotion that will accompany it -- is the last thing people in recovery, parents, communities -- and even our nation -- need right now," Smart Approaches to Marijuana said on its website.
A total of 136 stores received state licenses last week, but most apparently had not obtained approval yet from their local governments to open on January 1.
In 2012, Colorado voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana, as did voters in Washington state. But Colorado is the first to have the pot shops up and running under regulations recently established by state and local governments. Colorado voters' approval in effect amended the state's constitution to allow for the retail sale of recreational pot. The state already allows medical marijuana.
Limits to marijuana consumption
Not all of the state is participating in the new law. A community can decide not to allow the shops, and in fact, most of the state geographically hasn't, including communities such as Greeley and Colorado Springs.
Proponents of the new law were dealt a setback last week when Denver and state officials threatened to shut down a private party at a dance club scheduled for January 1 celebrating the end of the prohibition against cannabis -- an event billed as "Cannabition." The organizers canceled the party because officials said it would violate a Denver ordinance prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana.
Cannabis can only be smoked on private property with the owner's permission.
Under the new state law, residents are now able to buy marijuana like alcohol. The cannabis purchase is limited to an ounce, which is substantial enough to cost about $200 or more. People from out of state can buy up to a quarter-ounce.
In a vivid example of how recreational pot is a new reality for the state, Denver officials posted public signs in the tourist-populated corridor known as the 16th Street Mall. The street signs read, "Know the Law about Marijuana Use in Denver."
"You must be 21 or older to have or use retail marijuana," says one bulletin on the sign. But further below it, the sign warns readers that "it is illegal to use, display or transfer marijuana on the 16th Street Mall."
One of Colorado's main media outlets, The Denver Post, has even devoted a website to the history-making moment and its ongoing impact.
"The culture of cannabis, that's what we're here to talk about," says the newspaper's "The Cannabist" page. "As marijuana's coming-out continues, we'll report journalistically from our homebase in Denver, Colo. -- the site of recreational marijuana's first legal sale in the modern world on Jan. 1, 2014."
This week, Denver International Airport authorities banned all marijuana on the airport grounds. Medical marijuana had been legal to bring to the airport as long as it didn't go through security checkpoints, said airport spokeswoman Stacey Stegman.
But a total ban was implemented to avoid confusion as the recreational pot law rolls out, she said. Officials are concerned that a large influx of people may take marijuana to the airport and transport it across state lines.
So if a visitor brings marijuana to the airport and leaves it in the car to pick up a relative at the terminal, that visitor will be breaking the law and could face a fine of up to $999, Stegman said.
Colorado becomes the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale. Pot is the third most popular recreational drug in America, after alcohol and tobacco, according to the marijuana reform group NORML.

Funnyman Sid Caesar dead at 91
By Todd Leopold, CNN
updated 10:26 AM EST, Thu February 13, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
He was known for "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour"
Movie credits include "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World," "Airport 1975," "Grease"
He was part of a pioneering group of personalities who helped establish television
The funnyman also had a successful personal life, married for 67 years
(CNN) -- Sid Caesar, whose clever, anarchic comedy on such programs as "Your Show of Shows" and "Caesar's Hour" helped define the 1950s "Golden Age of Television," has died. He was 91.
A friend of the family, actor Rudy De Luca, did not know the exact cause of death, but said Caesar had respiratory problems and other health problems for several years.
Caesar became famous for "Your Show of Shows," which went on the air in 1950. It lasted four years and was followed by "Caesar's Hour," which combined sketches, musical revues and situation comedy.
Both shows featured writers who became famous in their own right, including Neil Simon, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Mel Tolkin, Lucille Kallen and Larry Gelbart. Woody Allen also contributed to Caesar's comedy as a writer for one of his specials.
Brooks visited Caesar last night to say goodbye, De Luca told CNN.
"Sid Caesar was a giant-maybe the best comedian who ever practiced the trade & I was privileged to be one of his writers & one of his friends," Brooks tweeted Wednesday.

Caesar, born Isaac Sidney Caesar in 1922, was part of a pioneering group of personalities who helped establish television in its early days. However, while comedians such as Jack Benny and Fred Allen more or less transferred their radio shows to the new medium and Milton Berle's "Texaco Star Theater" was essentially vaudeville on the small screen, Caesar's "Show of Shows" presented movie parodies, wordless pantomimes and brisk routines between the host and co-star Imogene Coca.
"Sid Caesar was a giant. If it weren't for Sid Caesar there might not be television as we know it. He and his co-stars and writers revolutionized television comedy, and really comedy in general," said biographer Eddy Friedfeld, a close friend of Caesar.
It was comedy pitched at a high (or, just as often, low) level -- and it was done live, every Saturday night at 9.
The versatile Caesar was game for whatever the writers came up with. "Caesar could take on many roles," wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in the reference "The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows," calling him a "comic genius." "He was the double-talking foreigner (he was a master of dialects), the henpecked husband or the greasy-haired cad."
The words and comedy of Sid Caesar
Among the regular routines were a skit with Coca, "The Hickenloopers," and Caesar as a gibberish-singing opera singer. Reiner and Howard Morris -- later Ernest T. Bass on "The Andy Griffith Show" -- were frequent supporting players.
"We've lost the greatest, monologist, pantomimic, sketch comedian TV has ever known! Word GENIUS is oft misused but not so here. HAIL CAESAR," tweeted Reiner.
The high-pressure hijinks of the writers' room inspired a number of other works, including "The Dick Van Dyke Show," created by Reiner; the 1982 film "My Favorite Year," produced by Brooks; and the 1993 play "Laughter on the 23rd Floor," by Simon.
"When we came in, we didn't have the slightest idea of what we were going to do. We christened the beginning of the week 'Bloody Monday' because we walked into the room with no material. We had three days to pitch lines and ideas and create six complete sketches," Caesar recalled in a 2011 interview.
The high pressure also led to a drinking and drug problem for Caesar. It took him years to kick the habit, until finally he went blank one day while performing on stage in 1977. He checked into a hospital soon after and got clean.
"I couldn't stand me," he said in 2011. "That's why I drank and took pills. I couldn't stand to be around me."
"Your Show of Shows" lasted just four years, but its impact was such that a best-of selection was turned into a 1973 movie, "Ten From Your Show of Shows."
Caesar followed "Your Show of Shows" with "Caesar's Hour," which included Reiner and Morris but not Coca. Among the show's recurring sketches was one in which the trio played "The Three Haircuts," a rock 'n' roll group.
Other regulars on "Caesar's Hour" included Nanette Fabray and Bea Arthur.
"Caesar's Hour" left the air in 1957. In the following decades, Caesar appeared in a handful of films, most notably the comic extravaganza "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World," in which he played dentist Melville Crump. He did a number of his own stunt gags and hurt his back in the process.
He appeared in films by his former writer Brooks, including 1976's "Silent Movie" and 1981's "History of the World Part I," and popped up in films such as "Grease" and "Grease 2" (as Coach Calhoun) and "Cannonball Run II."
He hosted "Saturday Night Live" in 1983 and was named an honorary member of the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players" at the conclusion of the show -- the only non-"SNL" cast member to earn the tribute.
Among his honors were two Emmys, a lifetime achievement award from the Television Critics Association and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He was married to Florence Levy for 67 years until her death in 2010. The couple had three children.
Asked by the Archive of American Television how he'd like to be remembered, he responded with six words.
"I brought laughter to the world," he said.

(IDG) -- WARNING: This video-game preview contains foul
language, PC favoritism, and references to Chef's
Chocolatey Balls. Continued reading can lead to
ill-mannered behavior and bad temperaments.
Proceed with caution. What could possibly be more fun than cuddling
up with Chef beside the fireplace for some good
old-fashioned ~#!@%? Well, how about Acclaim's
South Park game for the PC? Yep, Games.net
now believes that playing this upcoming shooter
will be a lot more fun than getting buck-wild with
Chef--no matter how tasty his Chocolatey Balls
are. MORE COMPUTING INTELLIGENCE

In coming to the PC, the South Park game will
gain new options and control schemes not
available in the Nintendo 64 version. Multiplayer
games over a LAN or the Internet will allow
individual players to have their own screen rather
than a dinky quarter-screen, making
deathmatches more immersive. And, of course,
you'll get to aim with a mouse instead of that
nasty little analog stick. South Park: The Game's story takes place in the
show's all-too-familiar Colorado town. Like some
twisted version of Deep Impact, the townsfolk,
mutant turkeys, and space aliens go crazy upon
hearing news of a giant meteor heading straight
for Earth. Playing one of the four South Park
youngsters, you must somehow save the world,
the town, and yes, even Mr. Garrison. As you go, you'll nab a variety of
weapons--though they're not exactly standard
Half-Life-issue. Think snowballs, dodgeballs, a
Toilet Plunger Launcher, a Sponge Dart Gun, a
Super Sniper Chicken, Hey! #!@%?
Dr. Mephisto's Warpo
Ray, a Cow Launcher, and a top-secret weapon
based on alien technology known only as the
Dancing Gizmo! And it gets better: Each weapon
has an alternative firing feature that does more
damage, affects more enemies, or basically just
looks funny. For example, instead of just throwing
a snowball, you can have one of the children
urinate on it first--creating one very yellow
snowball. South Park PC is basically the N64 version
(available in stores now) on crack! We're talking
higher resolution, quicker frame-rates, and
Internet multiplayer capabilities. Though it won't
be available until late January/early February, the
PC version is looking really good. Related stories:

JONESBORO, Arkansas (CNN) -- As Jonesboro buried two of the four girls killed in a Tuesday schoolyard shooting, U.S. Justice Department officials said they will not attempt to prosecute the two boys believed responsible the deaths.
Senior Justice Department sources told CNN that government attorneys concluded that federal firearm statutes -- under which Mitchell Johnson, 13, and Andrew Golden, 11, might be charged -- would not have resulted in longer prison
terms than are provided for in Arkansas law.
"In fact, the five-year sentence for firearms violations is shorter than is possible under existing Arkansas law," one source said.
Prosecutor Brent Davis had asked federal officials to determine if there were any federal charges that might result in longer prison terms than Arkansas law provides. Arkansas law forbids trying children age 13 and under as adults; federal law allows adult trials for defendants as young as 13.
Davis said that if the boys were found "delinquent" by a juvenile judge under Arkansas law, that both would probably be released on their 18th birthdays.
But prosecutors determined after studying the pertinent
statutes that Johnson could not be tried as an adult given the facts of the case. Golden, they said, was clearly too young to qualify for prosecution as an adult.
Clinton promises review of shootings Four girls and a teacher were killed and 10 were wounded at Westside Middle School Tuesday during a false fire alarm by heavy gunfire from nearby woods.

Message Boards: Are our schools safe?
Johnson and Golden, who were captured shortly after the shooting about 200 yards from the school, are being held on five counts of murder and 10 counts of battery.
President Clinton, who has expressed particular interest in the shootings and who spoke with school principal Karen Curtner Thursday for about 10 minutes, promised Friday that there would be a federal review of the shooting.
Speaking in Cape Town, South Africa, Clinton said the review would begin after the Jonesboro community has had "a chance to grieve." "Then," he said, "after a decent period, after I return home, the attorney general, I and others have got to compare this incident with the other two that have occurred in the last few months...to try and determine what they have in common and whether there are other things we should do to prevent this kind of thing."
Clinton is expected to return to Washington on April 2.
Guns, ammunition, camping gear Sadler
At an afternoon news briefing, a fact sheet about the shooting was distributed to the media despite the objections of the boys' attorneys.
Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said the sheet was released only after Juvenile Court Judge Ralph Wilson declined a defense request to prohibit the release of the fact sheet.
Reading from the sheet, which is a summation of facts about the case, Deputy Prosecutor Mike Walden said police seized three high-powered rifles and seven handguns, some of them semi-automatics, when they arrested the boys. Walden said 22 empty shell casings were found in the woods where the shots were fired. Two more empty shells were found in one of the handguns.
Police also found a significant amount of ammunition, food and camping gear in a gray van parked nearby. The van belonged to Johnson's mother and stepfather. The guns and other items have been sent to the state police crime lab in Little Rock for testing. Walden said it would be some time before the results are known, but that he assumed they would be done in time for the next scheduled hearing for the boys on April 29. Responding to rumors about the case, there were no additional suspects and there was no evidence that any specific student was targeted. No facilities for 18 to 21-year-olds Federal juvenile law allows detention up to age 21 if the
sentence lasts that long, which was Davis' reason for inquiring about federal charges.
But federal officials had said privately that it was unlikely any charges would be brought. Only 250 federal cases a year are brought against juveniles, and more than half of them involve crimes on Native American land where federal law is the only law.
Although Arkansas law allows youths convicted under state juvenile law to be held up to the age of 21, no one has ever been held past age 18, the state's legal age of adulthood. The reason: Arkansas law requires that 18 to 21-year-olds convicted as juveniles cannot be housed in juvenile facilities. And, in adult prisons, juveniles must be separated from adult inmates. Arkansas has no adult prison with such separate facilities.
Bill Howard, a Craighead County public defender who is representing Mitchell Johnson, said Friday his client is "very upset," and probably will require "a forensic evaluation." "I'm not sure all of this has sunken in on him at this point," Howard said. "I'm sure as the days progress, it will. That may be the subject that a professional will speak to." 'None of this fits into place' Howard said that "some people have volunteered their services" and "that's generally something we would do in any kid of case, whether it be adult or juvenile, of anything of this nature."
Howard also said that while meeting Johnson and his family he had the feeling that "none of this fits into place here -- that none of this is really happening to him and his family."
