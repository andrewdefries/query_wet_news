McCain campaign out to protect Palin's imageStory Highlights Sen. John McCain's campaign launches what it calls "Palin Truth Squad" Campaign fights Internet rumors, media coverage on Sarah Palin's record, family McCain camp also sends staff to Alaska to form rapid response team Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- In the nearly two weeks since Sen. John McCain announced his vice presidential nominee to the world, the Internet rumors about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have been flying. The McCain campaign is taking these seriously, and it's fighting back as well as rebutting charges in the mainstream media. The campaign this week hit back over a newspaper report that highlighted some of her travel expense claims as governor and announced the launch of what it calls the "Palin Truth Squad" to fight attacks on the GOP vice presidential nominee. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Alaska governor had billed the state a per diem for 312 days she spent at home and requested reimbursement for plane rides and hotel rooms for her husband and children, including a $707 room when her daughter accompanied her on a trip to New York for a Newsweek forum. The newspaper noted that officials said the claims were justified under existing state regulations. The McCain campaign said that Palin had reduced yearly travel expenses by roughly 80 percent of the amount spent by predecessor Frank Murkowski, in part by selling the governor's private jet. Roughly half the $93,000 spent went to cover expenses incurred by her family. In a post on the campaign's Web site, adviser Michael Goldfarb told supporters that Alaskans were paying "pennies on the dollar" and accused The Washington Post of "hunting for 'scandal.'"

"As governor of the state, Palin is expected to travel across Alaska to meet her constituents and attend community events. As a mother of five, she occasionally brought her children with her," Goldfarb wrote. "Her travel-related activities have been appropriately documented, are completely transparent, and entirely legal. She also saved Alaskan taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the budgeting process and hundreds of thousands in cutting waste from her own office." The McCain-Palin team has made the governor's record on cost-cutting a central element of her vice presidential bid. But McCain's advisers know that Palin's record isn't what's making her a sensation -- it's her persona -- and they're scrambling to protect it. The campaign, which has been sending "fight the smears" e-mails, also said staff and major campaign surrogates at the state and national level were forming a rapid response team to respond to rumors about the VP nominee with alerts and campaign statements to voters and reporters. "We will not allow those on the left and in the media to smear a woman who has always served her constituents with honor," the campaign said in a statement. "We know the truth and are committed to ensuring it as well." One Internet rumor alleges that Palin tried to ban a list of books from the public library when she was mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, including Harry Potter and several classics. According to the Anchorage Daily News, Palin asked Wasilla's city librarian in 1996 if she would be OK with removing certain books as part of a larger discussion on policy. The librarian said no, and there's no evidence supporting a book ban. In fact, some of the books cited on this list weren't even published 12 years ago -- namely the Harry Potter series, which first appeared in July 1997. Another false claim churning in the rumor mill: that Palin slashed Alaska's special-needs education budget by more than 60 percent. According to a recent Education Week article, Palin tripled the amount of money each student will get during the next three years. But some rumors do have a bit of truth. It's been rumored that Palin wants to teach creationism in schools. While she vowed not to add it to Alaska's curriculum, she has spoken in favor of classroom discussion of both creationism and evolution. "I don't think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class. it doesn't have to be part of the curriculum," Palin told the Anchorage Daily News in a 2006 interview. The McCain-Palin team so far has campaigned on media coverage that it describes as excessive or unfair. Part of protecting Palin's image is aimed at trying to sully Obama's. In a new ad, the narrator says, "Obama airdropped a mini-army of 30 lawyers, investigators and opposition researchers into Alaska to dig dirt on Gov. Palin. As Obama drops in the polls, he'll try to destroy her." Obama's campaign denies deploying anyone to dig up dirt. Watch Obama fight back against the accusations » Palin is not the only victim of Internet hoaxes. False rumors have been circulating for months that Obama is a Muslim, took his Senate oath on the Koran and even refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance. CNN has reported repeatedly that these statements are false.

Ayatollah: U.S., UK not meddling in IranStory Highlights Supreme leader: Foreign influences not to blame for Iran's post-election violence Hundreds of thousands protested after disputed June 12 election results Iranian officials have said foreign nations have meddled in Iranian affairs since thenNext Article in World » TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Foreign influences are not to blame for Iran's post-election violence, the nation's supreme leader has said, according to state-run media. Ayatollah Khamenei warned that courts should not use "rumors" to prosecute alleged post-election detainees. "I don't accuse the leaders of the recent incidents of being affiliated with foreign countries, including the United States and Britain, since the issue has not been proven for me," Ayatollah Khamenei told a group of university students on Wednesday, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported. "But there is no doubt that the events were planned, no matter whether their leaders knew it or not." Iranian officials, including hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have previously claimed that nations such as the United States and Britain have meddled in Iranian affairs since elections in June, without offering proof. Ahmadinejad has has warned of repercussions over the alleged meddling. Gholam-Hosein Mohseni Ejei, Iran's intelligence minister, on Sunday blamed Western powers for stirring up protests. The British Embassy in Tehran "played a heavy role in the recent disturbances," he said, adding that the United States led the effort. "The fact that Iran is stable, calm and secure, they're upset with this," Ejei told Iran's Press TV in late June. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets for more than two weeks to protest the June 12 election results, calling them fraudulent after Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. More than 1,000 people were arrested in a government crackdown, and Iran said at least 30 people were killed in post-election violence. More than 100 Iranians are going through mass trials this month. Top military officials have called for faster prosecutions and demanded "swift retribution" for post-election detainees, Iranian media have reported. Don't Miss Iran military wants 'swift retribution'
Khamenei warned Wednesday that the judiciary should not use "rumors" as the basis for their prosecution, and should try them on strong evidence. Two opposition leaders unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term in early August. Brig. Gen. Yadollah Javani, head of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps -- a branch of the armed forces -- has blamed candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who called the election fraudulent, for the violence that plagued the protests. The government has gone after the protesters themselves in mass trials that have been denounced internationally. Among those appearing in court are two French and British embassy employees and a French citizen. Iran has said that many of the defendants have confessed to helping Britain and the United States instigate the unrest.

What you should know about Facebook's changesBy John Sutter, CNN Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg explains the big leap forward Facebook is making in its Internet presence. STORY HIGHLIGHTSBefore, "like" buttons only were on Facebook.com; Now, they'll be all over the placeWeb sites will be able to add new Facebook toolbars to the bottom of their pagesNew features will show whether or not you enter a user name and password on a siteFacebookers, tell us what you think: As you try new features, add comments below
RELATED TOPICS
Facebook Inc.
Internet
San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Facebook announced some changes on Wednesday that are intended to make the Internet more social. Essentially, Facebook is stretching out into the rest of the Web. But what do these new features actually mean for everyday people who use the Internet? And when you see these Facebook-looking features popping up on other Web sites, how do you know what to do with them? Here's a quick guide, based on a comments by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, and interviews with developers who create applications for the massively popular social-networking site: "Like" buttons Buttons with the word "like" and a thumbs-up icon on them are going to start popping up all over the Internet. By clicking one, you indicate that you find the content interesting, relevant or helpful. Basically, you would recommend it to a friend. Before Wednesday, "like" buttons only were on Facebook. Now, they'll be all over the place, including on this site. When you click one, you post the item -- whether it's a blog post, photo or celebrity web page -- to your Facebook news feed. Read about how the feature will work on CNN.com. The "liked" content may also become part of your Facebook profile, and visible to your friends or to everyone, depending on how your privacy settings are configured on Facebook. Hey Facebook: What about a 'dislike' button? Friends' faces A consequence of these "like" buttons will be that your friends' Facebook profile photos will start showing up all over the web. If you see your friends' smiling faces online, it's an indication that they have clicked a "like" button on the Web site you're visiting. In a way, they're recommending it to you. Facebook users will be able to share interests across the web Facebook says these recommendations and social connections are the basis for the future of the Internet. Boring old hyperlinks are becoming something of the past, the company says. No log-ins These new Facebook features will show up regardless of whether or not you have entered a user name and password on a particular Web site. So, say you go to Pandora to listen to music. If you have logged in to Facebook recently, you won't have to do anything on Pandora to see suggestions about music. Recommendations from your Facebook friends will automatically show up. Toolbars Facebook announced new toolbars that other Web sites can add to the bottom of their pages. The toolbar lets you "like" a particular web page or item, and gives you information about what your friends think of the page you're viewing. You can also chat with friends who are currently logged in to Facebook without visiting the site. Privacy issues Some Internet users might worry about the fact that their Facebook profile photos, as well as their likes and dislikes, are going to show up all over the web. At least for now, a person's likes and dislikes are only as visible as they want them to be. But, if nothing else, that means you should probably double-check your privacy settings. Go to Facebook, look at the top right of the screen and click the "Account" tab. Choose "Privacy settings" and then navigate to "Profile information." Check the "likes and interests" setting. If you have that set to "everyone," then anyone on the Internet could see which Web pages you have liked. Some users might only want their Facebook friends to see that information. Facebook everywhere One overarching thing you might notice is that Facebook is going to be all over the Internet with these changes. This puts the social network at odds with Google, which also is trying to organize the world's information by interests and preferences. Another potential side effect: The web you see is the web your friends like. Without some effort, you might end up browsing based on your friends preferences, rather than exploring new territory. Your activity can influence them, too. As you navigate the web and start to play around with these new features, let us know what you think by posting a comment below. Do you think this will make Facebook the dominant player on the Internet? Do you find the features and recommendations useful, or do they clutter up your online experience?

For poor children, trying hard is not enough
By Trina R. Shanks, Special to CNN
updated 8:11 AM EDT, Thu July 12, 2012
An installation representing the number of hourly school dropouts nationwide is seen on display in Washington.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Upward mobility is much less likely today for working-class children, says Trina R. Shanks
Income level and educational opportunity are linked, and effects begin early, she says
Even children with proven academic ability fall behind if they are poor, says Shanks
Shanks: Our nation must help develop children's potential rather than let it go to waste
Editor's note: Trina R. Shanks is an associate professor of social work at the University of Michigan and a Rhodes Scholar. She was appointed to serve as a member of Michigan's Commission on Community Action and Economic Opportunity from 2010 to 2012. This essay was written in association with The Op-ed Project.
(CNN) -- I am the granddaughter of an elementary school cook and a woman who cleaned other people's homes. Both my grandmothers worked hard and didn't earn much money, but they encouraged their children to get an education.
Although starting from limited economic circumstances, my parents both earned a college education and were able to attain a middle-class lifestyle to raise me and my siblings. I, their daughter, went on to receive a Ph.D. Unfortunately, this type of upward mobility is much less likely for the children of maids and school cooks today.
A decent job and a decent life should be a possibility for anyone who makes an effort. As a nation, this was more likely in our past than in the present. A college education should be affordable to anyone who is willing to do the work, but that is no longer our reality. As the likelihood of a college degree and economic security becomes less attainable for a significant portion of the population, the future of the United States will be in jeopardy.
Late last month, Congress passed a bill that will keep student-loan interest rates from doubling, just days before the deadline. It's an important step in keeping college affordable, but student-loan interest rates are only one piece in a complex puzzle that shapes how income level and educational opportunity are linked -- and the effects begin years before a student might apply for loans.
Trina Shanks
Even children with proven academic ability fall behind if they grow up in families that are poor. By the age of 3, one study showed, poor children already have half the vocabulary of higher-income children. Another study showed that children in high-risk social and economic environments can start in the top 25% academically at the age of 4 but fall to the bottom by the time they are in high school.
In a similar example, only 29% of the highest-achieving eighth-graders complete college if they come from low-income families.
In contrast, 30% of the lowest-achieving eighth-graders and 74% of the highest-achieving eighth-graders complete college if they come from high-income families. Until we get to a point where ability and effort predictably lead to greater educational attainment and improved outcomes, many kids will stop trying because the obstacles become too daunting.
As a social work researcher, I've shown that race greatly influences economic standing, with children of color being the most likely to be poor and have no assets. Children start out very similarly up until about 2. Then economic circumstances start to influence outcomes, and children begin to diverge in achievement before they even enter school. These disparities continue even once formal education begins. My research also shows that children with limited economic resources are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods and face toxic stress that can lead to permanent lowered brain functioning, further limiting educational achievement.
Even middle-class families are now concerned that their children will not be able to succeed. Until we provide a pathway of success for all children, regardless of economic standing, it will be hard to sustain a strong and vibrant society and economy.
There are proven tools to increase opportunity for children if we have the political will to implement them, things such as universal high-quality preschool and child savings accounts that provide resources to reach long-term goals.
Some might think that a child's educational future is the responsibility of that child's parents alone. Others believe that enough government money already goes to help poor people. Only 32% of entitlement benefits and 2.8% of tax expenditure benefits go to the lowest-income earners. And many programs, such as rental assistance and child care, don't reach everyone who is eligible.
But regardless of what you think about the current mix of government programs, educational outcomes are too tightly linked to parents' economic status. Many children start out school eager to learn and wanting to achieve. But as it seems that no one cares about their efforts and their basic needs are not being met with each passing grade, they start to become less engaged in school and search for other ways to survive. This is tragic and unacceptable.
Others predict that charter schools will reduce achievement gaps. While charter and independent schools do well for some low-income children, their record is still mixed. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to find a low-income area where all schools perform well, whether charter, public or private.
Unless we want a "Waiting for Superman" society of lotteries and waiting lists for parents seeking a decent education for their child, the ultimate goal is to ensure all schools, no matter how they are organized, provide a quality education.
My parents, even as poor black children, could pursue their dreams growing up in the 1960s, when opportunity was expanding for all. Times have changed.
As we better understand the way economic circumstances dictate life options, perhaps we will get outraged and demand a nation that helps develop potential rather than allow it to go to waste.

9/11 family group decries banning politicians from commemoration
By Pauline Kim, CNN
updated 4:56 PM EDT, Mon July 16, 2012
A flower sits on one of the panels containing names of the victims of the terrorist attacks from September 11, 2001, at the 9/11 Memorial.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
9/11 Memorial officials are barring politicians from speaking at this year's N.Y. ceremony
A group representing about 50 families objects to the decision
Other family members of victims support the move
Family members will read the names of lost loved ones during the commemoration
New York (CNN) -- A small group of 9/11 victims' families is contesting the 9/11 memorial's decision to bar politicians from speaking at this year's commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks.
The group, led by retired Fire Department of New York Deputy Chief Jim Riches, called the National September 11 Memorial and Museum "totally hypocritical because banning the governors (of New York and New Jersey) from speaking is the ultimate political decision."
"No one individual or group should unilaterally make this decision not allowing Gov. (Andrew) Cuomo and Gov. (Chris) Christie to speak on 9/11," it added.
But the statements didn't seem to reflect the general opinion of most family members.
"They speak for themselves, and certainly not for me. And not for any of the family members I've spoken to," Charles Wolf, who lost his wife in the attacks, said in response to the family group's statements.
Riches, who lost his son on 9/11, said his group represents about 50 families.
Another 9/11 victim's family member, Debra Burlingame, said, "Families never wanted the deaths of 3,000 people politicized. I doubt very seriously that these few people out of thousands will get support for what they're saying."
Officials representing the memorial declined to comment Monday.
Joe Daniels, president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, said last week the foundation "is focused on honoring the victims and their families in a way free of politics, and this ensures that continues."
In a letter sent to victims' families Wednesday, Daniels said that the reading of victims' names by family members will be "the exclusive focus of the program" during this year's ceremony.
"Ground zero" has a history of politicians speaking at anniversary ceremonies, with speakers such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg is chairman of the memorial foundation's board of directors. Christie and Cuomo are among politicians who are honorary trustees.
"The decision is the memorial's to make and we are supportive of it," said Cuomo's spokesman, Josh Vlato.
At last year's ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the attacks that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center, President Barack Obama read a psalm.
It's been a tradition for victims' family members to lead a solemn reading of the names of their lost ones during commemorations at the memorial site.
The reading of the names "individualizes the masses of people who were killed. Those people were individuals who had individual lives," said Wolf, whose wife, Katherine, was working at the World Trade Center that day.
But Bloomberg had publicly considered ending the tradition.
"Some people have said change is good, and the subject's come up a couple times, and I think we've said the foundation board will talk about this," he said during a radio show in August 2011.
His comments brought much heat from some of the victims' families, who have blamed politicians for delays in construction of the memorial museum.
The museum was originally scheduled to open this year, marking the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, but has been held up because of "disagreements" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bloomberg said in a news conference last year.
More than 3 million people have visited the memorial since its opening on September 11 of last year.
"We're still dealing with this. Eleven years later, and we're still talking about it," Wolf said.
The ceremony includes six moments of silence, representing crucial moments during the attacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, and the crash of United Flight 93 in rural Pennsylvania.

War vets find solace in four-legged friends
By Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN
updated 8:36 AM EST, Mon November 12, 2012
Many U.S. veterans are struggling with invisible wounds such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. But some of them are finding peace at home thanks to their canine companions. Click through the gallery to meet a few veterans and the service dogs who help them get through their daily lives.
Lobo helps Jeff Wilson keep cool in public places. Wilson doesn't like being startled, so with a simple "watch my back" command, the border collie-German shepherd mix watches Wilson's 6 o'clock and gives him a little nudge if anyone walks up behind him at the grocery story or other public setting. If Wilson's anxiety kicks in, Lobo will jump and put his paws on Wilson's chest to give him something else to focus on.
Before she met Vito, Ana Sarver would average about two hours of sleep a night. Like many veterans with PTSD, she would struggle with restlessness, nightmares and hypervigilance. With Vito, "as soon as he feels me restless, he wakes up and he wakes me up and brings me out of it. ... He keeps me from getting up in the middle of the night and pacing every which way." Vito also gives Sarver the ability to function during the day. With the dog at her side, Sarver feels more comfortable in social settings such as restaurants.
David Angel Leos returned from his second tour in Iraq and found his life falling apart: "I was drinking, family life was really tough. Nightmares, constantly. Flashbacks." He had lost many of his close friends in the war, and he was struggling with extreme PTSD. But after being matched up with Shadow, he has been able to find some peace. "Having him is like having a battle buddy with you, somebody who is going to watch your back -- knowing if you don't see it, he will."
A trip to the grocery store used to send James McQuoid into a panic. When the Iraq War veteran heard a child crying, he remembered kids screaming in Falluja. Coins jingling in the register reminded him of ammunition carried around a soldier's neck. But Iggie calms McQuoid in public places, creating space between McQuoid and others. He also wakes McQuoid from nightmares and keeps his overall anxiety level down. "Without Iggie, I would still be in my house ... probably divorced from my wife and very estranged from my son," McQuoid said.
When Jeremiah Gaches came back to the United States, he isolated himself a lot. But after he met Rocky, Gaches found it much easier to get out of the house. Rocky watches Gaches' surroundings so the veteran doesn't always have to be at high alert, and if Gaches is feeling uncomfortable, Rocky will calm him down. Now, Gaches said, he's comfortable talking to people in public, and he's helping to train other veterans and their service dogs.
Shadow is the only reason Jennifer Haeffner goes out in public these days. Before she and the Labrador-Burmese mountain dog teamed up, she essentially had been housebound for five years, considering herself lucky if she got out once a month for grocery shopping. Now, she and Shadow go out several times a week, and he wakes her up from nightmares and picks things up so she doesn't stress her bad back and hips.
When Nick Udall returned from Vietnam, he found it very difficult to be in a crowd. He was always on alert, looking for exit strategies "if something happens." Annie is vigilant so he doesn't always have to be. She also helps remind him to take his medicine, running up to his chest and sticking her nose in his face. "I take anti-anxiety medicine, but I get the same effect by holding her," he said. "The reason I hold her up here like this is as soon as I do just -- whoosh -- I can feel the stress go away. It's amazing."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Many Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
Some are finding it easier to cope with their symptoms thanks to service dogs
The dogs help them with their anxiety and give them the confidence to socialize again
Top 10 CNN Hero Mary Cortani helps veterans in California train their own service dogs
(CNN) -- He was antisocial and difficult to work with at first. He'd clearly been abused by his father as evidenced by the deep, round scab near his shoulder. He hadn't been eating well.
And he was so skittish that the slightest noise or motion set him off. But Army veteran Jeff Wilson needed a new dog, and this pound puppy -- a border collie-German shepherd mix -- was it.
He named him Lobo, and it wasn't long before Wilson, 44, realized they had the same issues.
"We were kind of kindred spirits," he said. "I think it really helped deepen our connection because he wasn't just helping me; I was helping him. I was helping him get past the same obstacles that I had. I had to recognize it in myself and get past that to help him."
Wilson is a former tank commander and flight engineer who isn't at liberty to speak about his time in Iraq other than to say he manned a machine gun while hanging out of the door of a helicopter. He can also say that he was often "exposed to very dangerous situations" during his 14 years in the service.
He has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety from post-traumatic stress disorder, and he's not alone. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 11% to 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are suffering from PTSD.
Wilson said his depression turned him into a hermit. He would "curl up and not talk to anybody," and his anxiety made it difficult to go into public.
If he did leave the house, he was hypervigilant. If someone walked up behind him or dropped something that emitted a clatter, it triggered the "fight or flight" mechanism he'd groomed in the military.
Inside the mind of an Iraq combat vet Top 10 CNN Hero: Mary Cortani Pushpa Basnet was shocked to learn that children in Nepal were living in prisons with their parents. In 2005, she started a children's center that has provided housing, education and medical care to more than 140 children of incarcerated parents. "I always had a dream to build our own home for these children, and I want to rescue more children who are still in prisons," Basnet said. See more photos of Pushpa Basnet, who was voted CNN Hero of the Year for 2012.
Wanda Butts lost her son in a drowning accident six years ago. In his memory, she started the Josh Project, a nonprofit that taught nearly 1,200 children -- most of them minorities -- how to swim. "I started the Josh Project to keep other mothers from having to suffer such unforgettable loss," she said. See more photos of Wanda Butts
Mary Cortani is a former Army dog trainer who started Operation Freedom Paws, a nonprofit that helps war veterans train their own service dogs. Since 2010, she has worked with more than 80 veterans who have invisible wounds such as post-traumatic stress disorder. "I'm hoping this brings awareness to the world that PTSD is real and that we will be able to reach more veterans who so desperately need help," Cortani said. See more photos of Mary Cortani
Catalina Escobar is helping young moms in Colombia, where one in five girls age 15-19 is or has been pregnant. Since 2002, her foundation has provided counseling, education and job training to more than 2,000 teenage mothers. "Teenage pregnancy is a world poverty problem, and we have developed models of intervention that break the cycle," Escobar said. "I want to share it with people around the world." See more photos of Catalina Escobar
Razia Jan is fighting to educate girls in rural Afghanistan, where terrorists will stop at nothing to keep them from learning. She and her team at the Zabuli Education Center are providing a free education to about 350 girls, many of whom wouldn't normally have access to school. "This honor is a God-given gift that will make it possible for me to continue to give a ray of hope to these girls," Jan said. "My goal is to break the cycle of violence." See more photos of Razia Jan
Thulani Madondo struggled as a child growing up in the slums of Kliptown, South Africa. Today, his Kliptown Youth Program provides school uniforms, tutoring, meals and activities to 400 children in the community. "We're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible," he said. See more photos of Thulani Madondo
In memory of his daughter who was killed by a drunken driver in 2007, Leo McCarthy started Mariah's Challenge. The nonprofit gives college scholarships to teenagers who pledge not to drink while they're underage. Nearly $150,000 in scholarship money has been awarded. "We can change an apathetic culture of teenage drinking and driving," McCarthy said. "Hopefully one day soon we will not need Mariah's Challenge." See more photos of Leo McCarthy
Connie Siskowski is helping young people who have to take care of an ill, disabled or aging family member. Since 2006, her nonprofit has provided assistance to more than 550 young caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. "I can only believe that when more people understand about this precious population, they, too, will want to recognize and support them," Siskowski said. "These children suffer silently behind closed doors." See more photos of Connie Siskowski
After beating his addiction to drugs and alcohol, Scott Strode found support through sports. Since 2007, his nonprofit, Phoenix Multisport, has provided free athletic activities and a sober support community to more than 6,000 participants in Colorado. "This is an opportunity to shine a light on individual stories of recovery and sobriety in a way that will help remove the shame and stigma that surrounds dependency and addiction," he said. See more photos of Scott Strode
Malya Villard-Appolon is a rape survivor dedicated to supporting victims of sexual violence in Haiti. In 2004, she co-founded KOFAVIV, an organization that has helped more than 4,000 rape survivors find safety, psychological support and/or legal aid. "This encourages me to continue to fight on behalf of women and girls who are victims," she said. "I hope it brings about a change for my country." See more photos of Malya Villard-Appolon

The top 10 Heroes: In their own words
The anxiety was so bad that before he was diagnosed with PTSD, he went to the emergency room four times because he thought he was having a heart attack. He "self-medicated" so heavily with booze that it strained the relationship between him and his now-wife of two years.
"I was having to drink to numb all my senses and be quasi-normal," he said.
But today, with Lobo by his side, Wilson is finding it easier to cope.
The two have been working with Operation Freedom Paws, a nonprofit in Gilroy, California, that helps veterans train their own service dogs. It is run by Mary Cortani, a veteran and one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012.
Veterans in Focus: Celebrating, honoring veterans
When veterans train "their own service dog, there are immediate benefits right off the bat," Cortani said. "They have a mission and a purpose again. It gives them something to focus on and to complete. It gives them a sense of security and safety. ... They know they're not alone. They've always got their buddy at the end of the leash."
Now Wilson tells Lobo, "Watch my back," and his four-legged friend stands behind him and gives him a nudge if anyone approaches. When something stokes Wilson's anxiety, Lobo senses it, jumps up and puts his paws on Wilson's chest so he can redirect his focus.
"Knowing he's there makes me comfortable," Wilson said. "I'm not worried about the attacks. I still think about them, but I'm not hampered by them. I can go to the movies."
A study on hold
The Veterans Affairs Department recently put a study on hold that would determine the effectiveness of canine therapy for troops suffering from PTSD. Until that study is complete, the VA will continue providing dogs for a variety of ailments, but not PTSD.
Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, co-sponsored the 2009 legislation that kicked off the study. He was inspired by the strides that dogs helped his mother make from 1995 to 1998 after she was stricken with Alzheimer's.
"She wasn't very fond of dogs at all, but when she developed Alzheimer's, they became a key part of her therapy," the senator said. "She was unable to really communicate at that time, but you could easily tell, emotionally, the calming effect the service dogs had."

Service dogs help war veterans recover Dogs: A medicine for mental health problems?
Isakson said the VA is rewriting the parameters of the study to take into account the dogs' temperaments and the importance of matching the trainers, not just the dogs, with the patients.
Yet not everyone is convinced "the VA has the right stuff" to conduct the necessary experiments, said Corey Hudson, CEO of Canine Companions for Independence and president of the North American chapter of the umbrella organization, Assistance Dogs International.
Hudson said he hopes the study will be large enough to consider the broad gamut of symptoms associated with PTSD, as well as the anecdotal evidence suggesting canine companions can help tug the disorder's sufferers from their shells.
"There's something mystical and magical about dogs and people and placing them together," said Hudson, who has "worked with and against the VA" during his 22 years of experience with assistance dogs. Canine Companions for Independence has more than 900 puppy raisers and works to pair veterans with dogs regardless of whether the VA shells out for it.
Hudson doesn't cite scientific studies, such as the one that says canine interaction increases a human's level of oxytocin, a hormone that reduces anxiety and blood pressure.
Instead, he speaks about how dogs love unconditionally and don't judge. He explains how they naturally spark social interaction -- "Cool dog; can I pet her?" -- and how ownership precludes people from locking themselves in their homes, away from society.
"You can also use them as an excuse to get out of things or leave early," Hudson said.
Case in point
Shadow is one pooch accustomed to being used for such occasions.
The 2-year-old Labrador-Bernese mountain dog mix is the inseparable pal of Jennifer Haeffner, a seven-year Army veteran who had been housebound for about five years before meeting Shadow in the summer.
"He's a very active dog. It makes me do things. I don't have the option of hiding in the house. I have to go out," said the 41-year-old Ripon, California, resident.

During Operation Desert Storm, where she served for about nine months between 1991 and 1992, she was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by other service members, she said. It's a fairly common occurrence that befalls about one in four women in the military, according to the VA.
He's a very active dog. ... I don't have the option of hiding in the house. I have to go out.Jennifer Haeffner, on her dog, Shadow
It left her feeling alone in the world. She wanted to disappear. She forgot how to deal with people and eventually became a recluse, considering it a "good month" if she got out just once to shop for groceries.
She didn't attend any of her large family's gatherings. Too many people and too much noise, she said. It terrified her.
"For years after that, I would go out and wander the streets late at night, just hoping someone would kill me because I wasn't brave enough to kill myself," she said.
About five months ago, her therapist recommended that she meet Cortani.
Cortani recalls Haeffner wouldn't look her in the eye when they met. Her leg bounced when she spoke, and she pressed her fingernails into her arm. Her boyfriend was constantly by her side.
"You could just tell the pain and the anguish that even meeting me for the first time was causing," said Cortani, an Army veteran herself.

Operation Freedom Paws teaches participants to train their own dogs, to customize their behavior. First, the dogs learn to sit, then heel -- the basic stuff.
Shadow now knows how to pick things up for Haeffner so she doesn't put stress on her bad back and hips. He acts as a barrier, physically putting himself between her and any new people she meets.
When she wakes up feeling gloomy, he lets her stay in bed and pet him until she's ready to face the day. If she hears a sound during the night, he stays by her side as she checks it out, and Shadow is quick to snap her out of nightmares.
"He'll breathe on me or lay his head across mine to wake me up," she said of her 55-pound companion. "If I'm in a bad mood, he'll come over and insist I play with his toy or lay his lead in my lap or lick my feet -- cheer me up."
Cortani said the difference between the Haeffner of five months ago and the Haeffner of today is like "night and day."
She builds friendships. She's been to the aquarium. She's gone horseback riding. She goes places without her boyfriend.
"She's creating her own new normal," Cortani said.
Added Haeffner: "I'm much better now. I'm happier."

Hey, big spender: Nigerians shop til they drop in London
From Nima Elbagir, CNN
updated 12:24 PM EST, Fri January 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Wealthy Nigerians traveling to London to spend big money Their spending power is prompting UK retailers to tailor products to African customers
Selfridges: Nigeria is coming through 'very strongly' in the last 12-18 months
Yet, most people in Nigeria country live on less than $1 a day
London (CNN) -- Shopping is a serious business in London whatever the season -- but it doesn't get much more serious than this time of year.
The UK capital's January sales sees throngs of dedicated shopaholics cram its countless department stores, quirky boutiques and market stalls, keen to get their hands on the latest fashion trends and product offers.
But it's not just domestic spend that's keeping the tills ringing in London. While the vibrant city's high-end stores are no strangers to overseas visitors, with those from the Middle East typically spending the most, a surprising new contender has emerged in recent times as a big spender in the international market -- Nigeria.
"Africa is growing from strength to strength and particularly in the last 12 to 18 months we've seen Nigeria come through incredibly strongly," explains Sue West, director of operations at up-market London department store Selfridges.

"It is a very broad base so we still very much have a strong Chinese base, a strong Middle East base, Russia is there, the BRICs nations as you imagine, but Nigeria seems to be coming through very strongly at the moment as well," she adds.

The former British colony is Africa's most populous nation as well as the continent's top oil producer. According to African Economic Outlook (AEO), Nigeria's economic growth has averaged about 7.4% annually over the past decade, creating a wealthier Nigerian elite with a large spending power. At the same time, however, AEO says that robust economic growth has not reduced poverty in the country, with about two thirds of its population living on less than $1 per day.
Home to a large African diaspora, the UK is a popular travel destination for Nigerians visiting friends and relatives, going on holidays or conducting business.
Daily flights between Nigeria and the UK have increased in recent years, with airlines such as British Airways allowing Nigerian customers an additional 23kg of baggage free of charge.

According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, some 142,000 Nigerians visited the UK in 2011, spending an average £107 ($172) per day. From January to September last year, Nigeria's tax-free spend in the UK grew by 11% year on year, according to tourism services provider Global Blue.
The trend has not gone unnoticed by UK retailers, some of which have responded by tailoring their offerings to their growing Nigerian customer base.
"More recently we're starting to introduce a lot more niche brands," says West. "We've worked in collaboration with some very popular Nigerian brands," she adds. "I think it's not only important to demonstrate we can bring the big brands such as Louis Vuiton and Chanel, but we can also really appeal to more of a niche market too."

One such collaboration helping Selfridges further engage with its growing number of Nigerian customers is its recent team-up with Style House Files.
The Lagos-based fashion company has just opened an installation inside Selfridges, giving Nigerian designers a chance to widen their market and showcase their creations outside the West African country.
Omoyemi Akerele, director of Style House Files, says that Nigeria is an emerging market, with Nigerians are among the five biggest spenders at the department store.
Akerele argues the collaboration is a win-win situation for both parties.
"This will give our designers a platform, an opportunity for their pieces to be in Selfridges, that's a dream come true," says Akerele. "For Selfridges, on the other hand, it would endear their Nigerian customers -- and not just Nigerian customers, African in general -- more to the brand."
Read: African CEOs look to bright future
Akerele says that although the reality in Nigeria is that most people live in poverty, the rise of sectors such as telecommunications and the diversification of the Nigerian economy beyond oil and gas has created an emerging middle class with bigger spending power.
"Their earning capacity is increasing and they're spending on more things and not just the basic food and clothing," she explains. "They're getting on a plane and coming to London to buy things they cannot immediately find in Nigeria."

Obama dares Congress to get the job done
By Anne-Marie Slaughter, Special to CNN updated 9:20 AM EST, Wed February 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Anne-Marie Slaughter: 2013 State of the Union address was about progressive pragmatism Slaughter: Time and again, President Obama said we can "get that done" On immigration, foreign policy, jobs, tax reform, Obama urged concrete steps and progress
Slaughter: Obama was daring Congress, and the country, to get to work and get things done
Editor's note: Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning in the U.S. State Department (2009-2011), is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. She curates foreign policy on Twitter at @slaughteram. (CNN) -- The hallmark of the 2013 State of the Union address was progressive pragmatism.
Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together."
When he proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress "to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America," he added: "We can get that done."
Anne-Marie Slaughter
When he described his new "Fix-It First" program and a Partnership to Rebuild America to put people to work on our most urgent infrastructure repairs and to attract private capital to the cause, he said, "Let's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's start right away. We can get this done."
When he proposed "working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America," he added, "That's something we should be able to do." And when he called for raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, he said: "We should be able to get that done."

In other places, such as his appeal for comprehensive immigration reform, the president exhorted the nation: "let's get it done."
But his repeated insistence on what we can get done bespoke a step-by-step approach to solving the nation's most critical problems, a list not of grand initiatives but of pragmatic steps to make concrete progress.
At the same time, he was holding a mirror to Congress, reminding them of the disgrace they bring upon themselves in the eyes of the nation and the world when they fail to get these eminently reasonable and doable things done.
Obama's approach to foreign policy was much in the same vein. Instead of calling for the completion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, which has been stalled for decades, he announced his intent to complete negotiations on a "Trans-Pacific partnership" with a limited number of North American and Asian nations and to "launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union."
Opinion: This time, a president in full
Focus group's highs, lows on SOTU Obama: Harvest immigrants' talents
GOP responds to the State of the Union
He justified both initiatives in terms of creating "good-paying American jobs." The focus on the Atlantic was actually the most novel and striking of his foreign policy proposals, given the administration's widely heralded "pivot to Asia." But he chose to play down any fanfare and instead present the clear pragmatic case for expanding trade in both directions.
Similarly, instead of talking about his commitment to "Global Zero," a vision of a world without nuclear weapons that he committed to in his first inaugural address and his Prague speech in April 2010, he again focused on a set of smaller steps.
"We'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands." He also reiterated his administration's commitment to prevent Iran from "getting a nuclear weapon," but focused on achieving a "diplomatic solution." No grand doctrines, no global visions, just a list of concrete, doable steps.
That is the context in which we should understand the most powerful and passionate part of his speech: His insistence that all the victims of gun violence, from Gabrielle Giffords to the children of Newtown to the moviegoers of Aurora, "deserve a vote." His point was to cut out the political grandstanding, the filibustering, the huffing and puffing and bluffing. Bring it to the floor. Stand up and be counted. Vote it up or down.
Opinion: In 2013, democracy talks back about State of the Union
That is how government is supposed to work. Make a proposal. Assemble a coalition. Put it before the country's elected representatives. And vote.
President Obama was daring Congress, and the country, to get to work and get it done.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
World No. 1 Serena Williams beats Maria Sharapova in final to retain Madrid title
American notches up 50th win of her career, becoming the 10th woman to do so
Williams is hoping to win the French Open for the first time since 2002
Rafael Nadal wins the Madrid men's title for the third time
(CNN) -- Serena Williams is looking forward to the "ultimate challenge" of trying to win the French Open after again proving her dominance over biggest rival Maria Sharapova and defending her Madrid title on Sunday.
The American triumphed 6-1 6-4 to retain her No. 1 ranking and claim the 50th WTA Tour crown of her career, becoming only the 10th player to do so.
The 31-year-old is the only player to have won on three different colors of clay -- and she is confident that the Madrid surface's reversion to red after the blue of 2012 will help her bid to end an 11-year wait for her second grand slam success at Roland Garros.
"This court is definitely different from last year," Williams said. "It definitely plays more like Roland Garros, so I think that's a plus. It's a little slower than it was last year and plays more like a true clay court. So I think it's great preparation. It's a good start in the right direction."
Read: Sharapova in love and in the final
World No. 2 Maria Sharapova won through to the final of the Madrid Masters after beating Serbia's Ana Ivanovic 6-4 6-3 in the semis.
Ivanovic, a former world No. 1 now ranked 16th, was unable to repeat the form of her quarterfinal victory over German sixth seed Angelique Kerber. Defending champion Serena Williams will seek to retain her No. 1 ranking by beating Sharapova for the 12th consecutive time in the final. The American became the first women's player to reach 30 wins this season as she defeated Italian seventh seed Sara Errani 7-5 6-2 to set up a chance of her 50th career title.
Rafael Nadal reached the men's final in Madrid for the fourth time, beating fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar -- who made it to the semis after being given a wild-card entry into the tournament.
Nadal will next face Swiss 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka, who upset world No. 6 Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in three sets in the second semifinal at the Caja Magica.

Sharapova faces Serena in Madrid final
Maria Sharapova has capitalized on her on-court success by becoming one of tennis' most successful brands. Her partnership with longtime agent Max Eisenbud has made her the highest-paid female athlete on the planet. They met 15 years ago when Sharapova was training at the IMG Academy in Florida. "There was so much going on and so many kids, so many parents to take care of, so it was actually fun to see him juggle all those different things and maintain a very clear vision of what he wanted to do," Sharapova recalls.
Pictured here during a shoot for CNN's tennis show Open Court, they are already plotting her future after tennis -- but she plans to play for several more years yet.
Sharapova with two of the most important men in her life -- hugging her father Yuri after winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004, while Eisenbud looks on. That success allowed Eisenbud to court major sponsors, and helped Sharapova launch her own perfume among other non-tennis sidelines. Sharapova has long been associated with Nike, and signed a reported eight-year deal with the sportswear giant in 2010 that could be worth up to $70 million.
Part of that sum includes royalties from her fashion collection with Nike subsidiary Cole Haan. Sharapova is pictured here at a promotional event in Tokyo in 2009.
Sharapova's "Sugarpova" candy collection is her first independent venture. "Everyone loves a treat and everyone loves candy. When I was young and I would finish a practice, what would I ask for? I would ask for little lollipops," she told Open Court.
Her portfolio of endorsements keeps growing -- in April 2013 she was named as a brand ambassador for German car manufacturer Porsche. She has now won the tournament it sponsors two years in a row.

Maria Sharapova won the French Open last year to become the 10th woman to claim all four grand slams. But she plans on playing for several years before pursuing her business interests. At Roland Garros, Sharapova won her first major after undergoing shoulder surgery in 2008. Some thought she would never triumph at a grand slam following the injury. After a win in Montreal in July 2008, an MRI revealed that Sharapova had two tears in the tendon of her serving shoulder. Sharapova attempted a comeback in 2009 when she played doubles in Indian Wells. But she still wasn't ready to return. Once self described as a "cow on ice" on clay, Sharapova began her clay-court campaign last year by beating Victoria Azarenka in the Stuttgart final. Sharapova defeated Li Na in last year's final of the Italian Open, the perfect buildup to the French Open. Sharapova and Li are the two highest-paid female athletes in the world and share the same agent. Sharapova launched her own premium candy line, Sugarpova, with individual bags selling for $5.99. She has plans to expand to more markets, including Asia. Max Eisenbud, Sharapova's agent, first met the player when she was 12 at the renowned IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Sharapova still lives nearby.

Tennis still Sharapova's top priority Last year Williams fell at the first hurdle in Paris -- a tournament she won back in 2002 -- before going on to triumph at Wimbledon, the Olympics, the U.S. Open and the season-ending WTA Championships.
"It is the ultimate challenge," Williams said. "Whether I reach it, I don't know. I'm not going to put that pressure on myself.
"I wanted to do it last year and I didn't get it. So this year I'm just looking forward to Rome, and then after that Roland Garros."
Williams has now beaten second-ranked Sharapova in their past 12 meetings, and was in control for most of the match despite trailing 3-1 in the second set.
"I don't know if her start was shaky, but I felt I played well in the first few games -- playing such a great athlete and great tennis player like Maria, you have to come out and play well. I had no choice," she said.
"She definitely started playing better in that second set -- I think she came out with a different game plan. I missed a very crucial point in that first game, but after that I just had to refocus."
Read: The man behind Maria's millions
Williams is now three wins behind Monica Seles on the WTA list, but a long way behind Martina Navratilova's record 167.
"I don't know how many more I can win. Like I say every day, 'Who knows if I'll ever win another title?' I just want to live in the moment," said Williams, who returned to action in 2011 after a long injury break that caused life-threatening blood clots on her lungs.
"I feel like every moment I play -- I don't know if it's because of what I went through -- I feel like I'm so fortunate to be out there and healthy and to have an opportunity to play a sport and be really good at it.
The story behind Sharapova's success
Can 'Baby Federer' become a champion?
"Hopefully I can just keep it going."
Sharapova arrived in Rome having retained her Stuttgart title, but the Russian was once again unable to stand up to Williams' power.
"Obviously it's tough losing in the final today, but I think my preparation so far has been decent, winning a title in Stuttgart and getting to the final in this tournament for the first time," the 26-year-old said.
"One more tune-up to go before Roland Garros, and everything seems to be going well."
Rafael Nadal is in fine shape to defend his French Open title after winning a record-extending 23rd Masters level tournament in Madrid on Sunday.
The Spaniard crushed Swiss 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka 6-2 6-4 in the final to claim his fifth crown since returning from longterm knee problems in February.
The 26-year-old joined Thomas Muster in equal second on the Open Era clay titles list with his 40th success on the surface. They are six behind Guillermo Vilas.
Wawrinka can take some consolation in that he will return to the top-10 rankings for the first time since 2008.
It was Nadal's third title in Madrid, where he has been runner-up twice.

Kentucky hospital settles lawsuit over pediatric program
By Elizabeth Cohen, Senior Medical Correspondent
updated 1:05 PM EDT, Thu September 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
University of Kentucky settles case over release of safety data
Kentucky's attorney general asked hospital to release program's mortality rate
Hospital declined, saying that doing so would violate privacy laws
Mortality data has since been released, but not documents relating to evaluation of program
(CNN) -- The University of Kentucky has settled its case with the state over the release of safety data for its embattled pediatric heart surgery program, which was closed last year following patient deaths.
The dispute stems from a request last year by a local radio reporter for information about the program. The university declined to give that information, citing patient privacy laws, but then released it August 9 when a CNN investigation caused an uproar among parents of children with congenital heart disease.
"We are pleased that the litigation has been resolved," said university spokesman Jay Blanton. "The university was not put in the position of having to disclose patient and family information that would violate either peer review or privacy laws -- both of which are protected by federal laws."
The Kentucky attorney general got involved in December when the university declined to provide the safety data requested by Brenna Angel, then a radio reporter for WUKY. The attorney general asked the university to make the information public, but the university declined, and sued Angel in order to keep it private.
After the CNN report, the university revealed that the pediatric heart program had a higher mortality rate than the national average.
The university still hasn't released all the information Angel had asked for under the state's open records law, but she issued a statement last week saying she had agreed to a dismissal of the case.
"UK's release of its mortality rates in the pediatric cardiothoracic surgery program has achieved in large part my purpose for filing the open records request," wrote Angel, who now works in the Lexington mayor's office. "Families who are entrusting their children to UK Healthcare now have access to this type of information."
Among the pieces of information Angel asked for that still have not been released are documents relating to the evaluation and accreditation of the pediatric heart program and the date of the last surgery completed by the university's chief heart surgeon, who has since resigned.
"The University is not required to disclose any documents, remaining mortality statistics (which are protected by federal law), or any dates," William Thro, University of Kentucky general counsel, wrote to the board of trustees on August 16, adding, "We could see further litigation involving other media outlets."
The university is planning to reopen its pediatric heart surgery program after conducting a review, which it anticipates will be completed in the next few weeks, according to Blanton, the UK spokesman.
"When the review is completed, we will release as much of the final report as federal and state law allow," he said, adding that the report will be "focused most intently on how best to move forward than as a retrospective examination."
Tabitha Rainey, whose infant son, Waylon, went into heart failure after having surgery at UK, said she's concerned the university will keep crucial parts of the review a secret.
"They've used federal and state laws before when they didn't want to give statistics, so what's to say they won't do that again?" she said.

Philippines delegate refuses to eat until action on climate change 'madness'
By Matt Smith and Susannah Cullinane, CNN
updated 6:23 PM EST, Tue November 12, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "How many lives do we want to lose?" hunger-striking official asks
NEW: Sano says his brother is safe, but other relatives remain unaccounted for
Philippines climate conference delegate fasts to demand action Scientists believe warmer climate will fuel more powerful storms
(CNN) -- With his country grappling with the damage from "hell-storm" Haiyan, a Philippines official launched a hunger strike Tuesday to pressure a U.N. climate change conference for concrete steps to fight global warming.
Naderev Sano, a member of the Philippines Climate Change Commission, said he was fasting "in solidarity with my countrymen who are now struggling for food back home" -- including his own brother, whom Sano said "has been gathering bodies of the dead with his own two hands."
"What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness. The climate crisis is madness," he said. "Mr. President, we can stop this madness, right here in Warsaw."
Sano leads the Philippines delegation to the 19th Conference of the Parties in Poland's capital. He got a standing ovation after he spoke, four days after Super Typhoon Haiyan struck his island nation with estimated winds of 315 kph (195 mph). The storm has left nearly 1,800 people at the latest count.
"Despite the massive efforts that my country had exerted in preparing for the onslaught of this storm, it was just a force too powerful, and even as a nation familiar with storms, Haiyan was nothing we have ever experienced before," Sano said. But he said the Philippines refuses to accept that "running away from storms, evacuating our families, suffering the devastation and misery, counting our dead, (will) become a way of life."

Sano said he will refrain from eating during the 12-day conference "until a meaningful outcome is in sight." He called for "concrete pledges" to the Green Climate Fund -- a U.N. fund aimed at helping developing nations reduce their climate change emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change -- and said he will continue to fast "until we see real ambition on climate action in accordance with the principles of the convention."
He told CNN's Connect the World that while the complete picture of climate change is still being studied, the highest increase in measured sea levels over the past seven decades "has been in the waters just east of the Philippines."
"The precautionary principle tells you you shouldn't wait for full scientific certainty before doing something or taking action," he said. "How many lives do we want to lose, not just in the Philippines but in communities that have other climate impacts?"

The idea of long-term climate change driven largely by the use of fossil fuels, which release heat-trapping carbon emissions into the atmosphere, is controversial politically but accepted as fact by most researchers. Scientists say they can't pin any particular storm on the process, but that the warming of the air and oceans "loads the dice" in favor of more extreme weather.
"When it's a very rare event, we have a challenge scientifically in distinguishing between the rare chance event and the possible effects of global warming. So for these individual storms, that's a particular challenge," said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University in California.
But Diffenbaugh added, "Even though that's challenging science, we do know that global warming is occurring, we do know that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of that global warming, and we do know that a number of extreme events have increased in likelihood as a result of that."
James Elsner, a climate and statistics expert at Florida State University, said that doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes or typhoons.
"We could see fewer storms, but the ones that do form could be stronger," Elsner said. That appears to be the trend over the past 30 years, he said.
An October study in the scientific journal Nature noted that more than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050, and the countries that will first see its effects are the ones least capable of responding. And a June report by the World Bank noted that the Philippines is already seeing the effects of a warming climate, ranking 16 of its provinces among the most vulnerable regions in southeast Asia.
Watch the opening session of the 19th COP
The Philippines has launched efforts to better prepare for the impact of climate change, President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. But he said addressing the issue is a global problem.
"We all live on one planet," Aquino said. "Either we come up with a solution that everybody adheres to and cooperates with, or let us be prepared to meet disasters."
On the table in Warsaw is the issue of compensating countries that suffer from the effects of climate change and can't afford to adapt on their own.
"The poorest people of the world are at greater risk because of our vulnerability and decades of maldevelopment, which I also must assert is connected to the kind of pursuit of economic growth that has led to an altered climate system," Sano said.
In his remarks to the conference, Sano challenged climate change skeptics to "get off their ivory towers and away from the comfort of their armchairs" to see the communities battling flooding, hurricanes and fires. "And if that is not enough, they may want to see what has happened to Philippines now," he said.
This year's Warsaw conference brings together countries that have signed onto the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The annual meetings review the parties' progress in limiting global temperature increases.
Sano said that at the last conference, held in Qatar less than a year ago, he appealed to the world to open its eyes as the Philippines had confronted another catastrophic storm -- Typhoon Bopha, then the costliest in its history.

"Less than a year hence, we cannot imagine that a disaster much bigger would come. With an apparent cruel twist of fate, my country is being tested by this hell-storm called Super Typhoon Haiyan," he said.
He said he spoke on behalf of his delegation as well as "the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm."
Sano's protest prompted Twitter users to begin using the hashtag #fastfortheclimate in support.
The Climate Action Network -- a body of 850 nongovernmental organizations -- later announced that members of "civil society" were joining Sano in fasting, in a move it said is "unprecedented within the history of the climate movement."
Climate Action Network spokeswoman Ria Voorhaar said the protest is spreading "far and wide," with at least 100 people in Warsaw for the conference also fasting.
"A lot of climate-focused youth groups have jumped on it immediately to show solidarity," she said.
Voorhaar said the hunger strikers want the Warsaw conference to take "concrete steps" toward reducing carbon emissions before 2020, enacting an international mechanism for damages and financing efforts to adapt to a warming world.
