How golf balls took on the oil spill and lostBy Matthew Weiner for CNN BP have tried (and failed) to use golf balls to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. STORY HIGHLIGHTS'Junk shot' using golf balls, rope and tires to plug holes in oil well fails.Golf balls selected because of small size and ability to withstand pressure.BP's next plan is to send in underwater robot to cut pipe and cap it.

London (CNN) -- They can fly 300 yards through the air and have helped turn the likes of Tiger Woods into multi-millionaires, but it seems the powers of the golf ball don't end there. For the last few days, BP have been using golf balls in an audacious attempt to plug the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which has been described by the Obama administration as probably "the biggest environmental disaster" the country has ever faced. BP press officer Sheila Williams told CNN that the balls had been used part of a "junk shot" including shredded tires and knotted rope that were pumped into the well at high pressure to plug the leak. Mud and cement was then injected into the well to keep the junk in place. Williams revealed that this process was carried out "a number of times" in conjunction with the U.S. coast guard before the oil giant admitted that the experiment had failed. Golf balls were selected as part of the 'junk shot' because they are small enough to plug gaps between the rope and tires and strong enough to withstand the pressure of the oil which is gushing out with significant force. Whether Titleist, Callaway or any other make (BP were unable to confirm either the brand or numbers used) golf balls are designed to withstand 2,000 pounds of force from a club making them a good candidate to withstand the high pressure oil leak. Engineers first used the 'junk shot' to quell the 1991 Kuwait oil fires but never at such depths. The fact that the Deepwater Horizon leak is 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean is thought to be the reason the technique did not succeed. "I don't think we'll be using golf balls again," commented Williams. US President Barack Obama said the failure of the earlier "top kill" plan was "heartbreaking". I don't think we'll be using golf balls again--BP press officer Sheila Williams
The spill started over a month ago when the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and exploded, killing 11 workers. Over 40 days on and BP have still to stop the leak. BP has spent more than £600m trying to stem the estimated 5,000 barrels of oil per day flowing out from the wellhead. Previous failed attempts have included a coffer dam, a tube to suck the oil up to the surface and top kill. BP will next try to cap the well using an underwater robot that will try to cut the leaking pipe and place a cap over it -- a process known as deploying the Lower Marine Riser Package Cap Containment System. BP said that the cost of tackling the spill had increased to $930 million. The final cost, including legal damages arising from the accident, is still uncertain. The US Government recently released data showing that the oil was leaking at up to 19,000 barrels per day, nearly four times higher than BP's previous estimate of 5,000 barrels. The oil giant initially claimed after the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 that just 1,000 barrels per day were leaking from the well. The latest figures indicate that between 18.6 million gallons and 29.5 million gallons of crude oil have leaked into the sea, outstripping the 11 million gallons spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster.

Father accused of decapitating son unfit for trial, judge rules
By Rick Martin, CNN
updated 7:58 PM EDT, Tue October 18, 2011
Jeremiah Lee Wright, the 30-year-old father who police say decapitated his son, was ruled unfit for trial on Tuesday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Police say Jeremiah Lee Wright confessed that he beheaded his son
Wright is being sent to a mental health facility for evaluation, his attorney says
A hearing is set for January 31 to see if his status has changed
(CNN) -- A 30-year-old father who police say decapitated his 7-year-old disabled son is unfit for trial, a Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, judge ruled Tuesday.
Jeremiah Lee Wright is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Jori Lirette. The second-grade boy was killed on August 14 in the town of Thibodaux. The killing was an act horrific enough to shock the community and grab national attention. Police have said Wright confessed that he decapitated the boy.
District Judge John E. LeBlanc found Wright "was not competent to stand trial," Court Clerk Pam Cheriamie said.
"Two psychiatrists appointed by the court to examine Wright were subpoenaed to testify," she said.
But Wright's defense attorney, Kerry Cuccia, said the psychiatrists didn't testify, but their reports were submitted.
Cuccia said he could not say why his client was found not fit to stand trial. "The judge sealed the records with specifics on the mental evaluation," he said. But he added, "The judge announced my client lacks the mental capacity to proceed and stand trial. This means he has to appropriately understand the nature of the proceedings before him and be able to assist his lawyer with his own defense."
He said Wright was sent to a state mental health facility in Jackson for further evaluation.
A status hearing was scheduled for January 31 "to see if he's been rehabilitated and (is) competent enough for trial," Cheriamie said.
Thibodaux police were called to Wright's house on August 14 by a person who said a severed head was sitting on the side of a city street.
Investigators found a white garbage bag nearby with the child's body inside, police said.
"The child had cerebral palsy and was bound to a wheelchair (and also had) additional disabilities," Thibodaux Police Chief Scott Silverii said in August. "He also required a feeding tube and he wasn't able to speak verbally."
The chief said Wright confessed he decapitated the child. Investigators recovered a hacksaw that they believe was the murder weapon.
"During the interview, Wright said he was taking care of (the child) for so many years and he just started to look at him as no longer his son, just an inanimate object," Silverii said. "He and the child's mother had some issues. And he purposely put the child's head in a position for her to see it."

Ban swearing? No way
By John McWhorter, Special to CNN
updated 8:33 AM EDT, Thu June 14, 2012
U2's The Edge and Bono at the Golden Globe awards in 2003 when Bono famously dropped the F-bomb on air.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
John McWhorter: A town's recent ban on public swearing is a hopeless cause
McWhorter asks: Where do you draw the line? Is hell a swear word? How do police enforce it?
Profanity is part of the cultural discourse; even mild-mannered people curse, he says
McWhorter: We need to rethink what is considered profanity in 2012 and just accept reality Editor's note: John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies and Western civilization at Columbia University, is contributing editor for The New Republic and a columnist for The New York Daily News. His latest book is "What Language Is (What It Isn't and What it Couldn't Be)."
(CNN) -- It's not surprising that at a town meeting this week, Middleborough, Massachusetts, voted 183-50 to impose a $20 fine for swearing in public. Who's not for civic virtue? Enough is enough. And so on. Plus the ban doesn't apply to what people do "in private."
But it's an empty, hopeless move. Not to mention plain backward.
For one, it's like trying put out a fire with an eyedropper. The police cannot monitor most public activities. Say they pass out some fines to teens waiting in line for a concert. Still, those offended by their language will be endlessly assaulted with it when passing the same teens as they walk down unpatrolled streets, or chat before a movie starts, or, basically, just exist.
John McWhorter
Overheard on CNN.com: What the $%#;!? Choice words for town's profanity fine
Besides, the fines will only create the kind of resentment that makes it feel sexy to rebel. Nothing will feel more authentic to the Middleborough teen than to haul off with a few epithets when no police are in view -- but plenty of other citizens are.
And all we have to do is wait for the cleverer ones to claim that certain uses of the words aren't really profanity, which will mean messy cases of where-do-you-draw-the-line. Is hell in "It was so from hell that he called me" a curse word? Or, if someone says something is "f------ awesome," is that profanity? Remember how at one point even the Federal Communications Commission, based on that reasoning, let Bono get by with saying that winning an award was "really, really f---- brilliant" at the Golden Globes ceremony in 2003?
Swearing will cost you $20 in Mass. town
Americans need to rethink what is considered profanity in 2012. We are taught that a certain collection of words is profane, but this no longer makes sense given the readiness with which even the most mild-mannered of Americans use such words.
Sure, there are an especially careful few among us who rarely use them. But they are exceptions. Most of us chuckle that it was considered a big deal for Clark Gable to say "damn" in "Gone With the Wind" -- or that a newspaper wouldn't have allowed me to use that word in print.
Or take a sentence like "We've got to get all of this stuff out of the garage." How many of us can honestly say that there isn't an alternate word we would quite possibly use for "stuff"? And a lot?
What our great-grandparents considered profanity is, for us, merely colorful. We teach our kids not to use it -- but are hardly surprised that they start doing so later. The characters on HBO's "Girls" curse like sailors, and yet we can assume that their parents were telling them in the '90s not to use bad words -- while using them themselves, as we have heard the mother of the show's lead, Hannah, do already.
We are an informal society. We dress scantily compared with earlier Americans. We talk openly about sex and excretion in a way that still shocks our grandparents. We cherish the "real." Our sense of profanity lags behind our reality.
Now, don't get me wrong -- we do have genuine profanity. The N-word and the one beginning with C that refers to a female body part are the main curses today. These are truly taboo, in the sense an anthropologist studying us would recognize. To haul off with these words is to leave one's moral legitimacy in question.
Note, however, that one cannot even shield one's children from the N-word. It decorates their favorite music, rap, and not just the raunchier strains. Kanye West's eternally infectious "Golddigger" hit enshrines it in its very chorus, for example. Or, a friend of mine, white, recently told me that her boys are attending a mostly black public school and making a lot of friends -- but also picking up their way of using the N-word as a marker of fellowship. So, let's fine them $20 for embracing diversity?
It's hard to see what the benefits of an ordinance such as Middleborough's will be. The smidgen less that people will hear profanity on Main Street will transform the linguistic environment about as much as a cold drink makes you think it isn't actually hot.
Or is the idea that the ordinance will nevertheless get an idea in the air, in the way that smoking gradually became uncool and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hopes will happen with massive sugary drinks? Unlikely. Young people don't model their language usage on what they hear at the shoe store. They will pick up the lingo from music, YouTube, Facebook and texting -- not to mention their own parents talking about that, um, stuff in the garage.
Our job is to teach children that certain words are not to be used until a certain age, and even then, with care. That has worked pretty well for a long time after all.
As for the fact that we hear the words in public more than we used to, I suggest we bring our sense of "dirty" into line with the rest of our modern come-as-you-are American spirits. Or if we can't see it that way, we might just accept teens' potty mouths the way we do cracks in the pavement and overripe trash cans -- inevitable dings in this thing called life.
Let's face it: In 2012, an ordinance against public profanity is like fining people for burping. What kind of priority is this in an age when so many more urgent issues face us all?

Coming soon: Iran's response to 'Argo'
By Jethro Mullen, CNN
updated 5:28 AM EST, Mon January 14, 2013
(File photo) Argo tells the story of a rescue of U.S. diplomats from revolutionary Iran.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ben Affleck's "Argo" tells the story of a dramatic rescue of U.S. diplomats from revolutionary Iran
Iranian state media criticize the movie as "replete with historical inaccuracies and distortions"
Iran's Art Bureau says it will fund its own film about the handing over of 20 U.S. hostages
(CNN) -- Ben Affleck has more than just a couple of Golden Globes to add to his resume.
His movie "Argo," about the suspenseful rescue of U.S. diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis, has also achieved the unusual honor of prompting Tehran to produce its own cinematic response.
Opinion: Latino should have played lead in 'Argo'
"Argo" was named best drama movie during the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday night in Los Angeles, and Affleck won the award for best director, a category for which he was passed over in the recent Oscar nominations.

But his efforts to recreate on screen the drama of the secret operation by the CIA and Canada to extract six U.S. embassy workers from revolutionary Iran in 1980 haven't been overlooked by Tehran's Art Bureau.
'Argo' recognizes forgotten heroes of Iran hostage saga
It plans to fund a movie entitled "The General Staff," about 20 American hostages who were handed over to the United States by Iranian revolutionaries, according to a report last week by Mehr News, the official Iranian agency.
"This film, which will be a big production, should be an appropriate response to the ahistoric film 'Argo,'" said Ataollah Salmanian, the director of the Iranian film, according to Mehr.
"Argo" claims to be based on a true story rather than to constitute a scrupulous retelling of exactly what took place, and its deviations from reality have been documented.
But Iranian authorities have taken offense at the film's portrayal of the country and its people. "Argo" was officially viewed as "anti-Iranian" following its U.S. release last year, Mehr reported.
Iran's state-run broadcaster Press TV detailed its objections to the film in an online article on Sunday.
"The Iranophobic American movie attempts to describe Iranians as overemotional, irrational, insane, and diabolical while at the same, the CIA agents are represented as heroically patriotic," it complained.
In the movie, in which Affleck plays the lead role, the CIA operation is shown outwitting Iranian authorities through an elaborate plan based on pretending that the U.S. diplomats fleeing the country were part of team scouting locations for an outlandish science-fiction film.
But according to Press TV, the film is "a far cry from a balanced narration" and is "replete with historical inaccuracies and distortions."
On the other hand, "The General Staff," set to begin shooting next year, will be based on eyewitness accounts, Salmanian said.
The Art Bureau, which is to provide the financing, is affiliated with the Islamic Ideology Dissemination Organization, according to Mehr.
Press TV cited Salmanian as saying that his film would depict "the historical event unlike the American version which lacks a proper view of the story."
CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.

Opinion: Daily Mail endangers press freedom
By Alastair Campbell, special for CNN
updated 6:05 AM EDT, Mon October 7, 2013
The Daily Mail's personal attack on Ed Miliband's late father has prompted protests outside the newpaper's offices.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
This week regulation of Britain's newspaper industry is back in the spotlight
Alastair Campbell says in wake of hacking scandal, papers should be on good behavior
Daily Mail's attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband's father threatens freedoms - Campbell
He says Mail itself is worst polluter of standards and debaser in public life
Editor's note: Alastair Campbell was former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, press secretary and director of communications and strategy. He is now a writer, strategist and ambassador for the Time to Change mental health campaign, and Alcohol Concern charity. His latest novel, "My Name Is..." was published last week. He had a confrontational relationship with journalists, and was often at odds with the right-of-center Daily Mail. That newspaper sparked criticism last week by publishing an editorial criticizing opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband's late father Ralph under the headline: "The Man Who Hated Britain." London (CNN) -- Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder once said to me, in the margins of a European summit: "There must be something weird about Britain that you have the press you have." There is.
Also, as I said to the Leveson Inquiry into the practices and standards of the British press set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, one of Rupert Murdoch's Australian editors once said to me: "The British papers are the best in the world, and the worst in the world, sometimes in the same edition." That was an astute observation too.
Rupert Murdoch's titles drew most of the fire in the Leveson Inquiry, which also heard outrageous examples of how certain sections of the British newspaper industry treated both the powerful and the weak with contempt, and there are several court cases outstanding as a result of allegations of criminal activity.
Alastair Campbell
In the wake of the inquiry many commentators -- and newspaper owners -- argued that any regulation that came out of it would have terrible implications for free speech in Britain. Despite concern among ordinary readers that much of Fleet Street is out of control, the government has yet to introduce formally the independent self-regulation of the newspaper industry recommended by Leveson. This week the Privy Council meets to decide on a course of action.
You'd have thought on that basis the press, if only for its own tactical reasons, might at least curb its worst excesses while that process reaches its conclusion, if not even learn the lessons of the public revulsion that accompanied what emerged at the inquiry.
But you'd be wrong. Two years ago it was Murdoch's News International that was up to no good. Now the Daily Mail is at the center of a storm as a debate rages following its publication of an article about Labour leader Ed Miliband's father headlined "The Man Who Hated Britain." The story was accompanied on the website by a picture -- later removed -- of Miliband Senior's burial plot captioned "grave socialist."
The Mail is certainly commercially successful, one of the few papers still to be selling in good numbers, and now with the most visited newspaper website in the world.
But many people in public life -- along with campaigners who protested outside the Mail's offices in West London -- now view the Mail Group itself as the worst polluter of standards and debaser of public life, something I have argued for many years.
One or two people -- though far fewer than those who have supported my attacks on him -- feel I have gone over the top in describing editor-in-chief Paul Dacre as the biggest poison in British public life, a bully, a hypocrite and a coward who won't even defend his actions in public. He is all of those things.
Even in his ludicrous attempts to get lackeys and minions out on TV justifying the attack on Miliband's dead father, he has claimed the Labour leader wants "state control" of the press and "politicians to decide what goes in newspapers." That is the opposite of what Miliband said to the Leveson Inquiry.
Other editors are furious at Dacre's tactical ineptitude, fearing that one possible consequence of the Mail's vicious attack on Miliband may be to bring about tougher regulation of Britain's press. In fact I think the politicians have sufficient commitment to freedom of the press not to allow this vicious row to sidetrack them from seeking to implement the kind of system both press and public can support. But what is clear is that it cannot have the bellowing voice of Dacre's papers setting the agenda.
Many people in public life ... now view the Mail Group itself as the worst polluter of standards and debaser of public life.Alastair Campbell
I last spoke to Dacre in the last century, when I realised there was no point even trying to have reasonable or rational debate with him. As Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg pointed out last week, it is not just Labour that Dacre hates, he hates anyone and anything that does not fit with his narrow, twisted and in my view sociopathic view of the world.
The forefathers of the Daily Mail's owner, Jonathan Harmsworth, supported Adolf Hitler, and congratulated the Nazi leader on his annexation of Czechoslovakia. Today's Mail says this is irrelevant. Yet the basis on which they wrote a piece headlined "the man who hated Britain" was something Miliband's dad wrote in his diary when he was 17. Yet again, one rule for them, another for everyone else. Like when they complained on Wednesday that TV reporters were doorstepping their staff. Irony does not do this justice. On Sunday, it was also alleged the paper is owned through off-shore funds based in tax havens. So much for backing Britain!
When the Mail on Sunday was forced to issue an apology for their gate-crashing of a private memorial event for Ed Miliband's uncle this week, the editor said it was totally at odds with the values and practices of the paper. On the contrary it is totally consistent. They have operated like this for years.
As for Dacre, his career and his reputation are ending where I always knew basic British decency would ensure they would -- in the gutter to which he has dragged British journalism.
Paul Dacre and the Daily Mail have not replied to CNN's request for comment.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alastair Campbell.
