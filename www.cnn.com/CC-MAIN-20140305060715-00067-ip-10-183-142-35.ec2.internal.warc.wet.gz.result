Los Angeles County
(CNN) -- The death of Marie Osmond's 18-year-old son has been classified as a suicide, police said Sunday. A family spokesman on Saturday said that Michael Blosil had died. Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Karen Rayner told CNN she could not release further information because the death is a Los Angeles County coroner's case. The coroner's office said the case was on "security hold" and nothing further would be released Sunday. In a statement issued Saturday through a spokesman, Osmond said: "My family and I are devastated and in deep shock by the tragic loss of our dear Michael and ask that everyone respect our privacy during this difficult time." Osmond's Web site describes her as "the proud mother of eight beautiful children who are always her greatest treasures." Marie Osmond and her brother Donny hosted the national television variety show "The Donny & Marie Show" from 1976 to 1981. Afterward, she had acting and singing careers. She recently competed in a season of "Dancing With the Stars." In 2001, she wrote "Behind the Smile," about her experience with postpartum depression.CNN's Lynn Lamanivong contributed to this report.

Actress Geena Davis talks media, empowerment of women at U.N.By Liz Yaslik, Brooke Elliott and Richard Roth, CNN Geena Davis promotes gender equalitySTORY HIGHLIGHTSGeena Davis speaks at U.N. to promote empowerment of women in children's mediaDavis: We should "work towards improving the status of women" Davis says stereotyping and hyper-sexualization of female characters "disturbing"

United Nations (CNN) -- As an actress, Geena Davis played the first female president on TV and a baseball player in a popular movie, but as a media consumer she concluded long ago that there was something wrong in the way women were portrayed. Davis, a best-actress Oscar winner who is trying to change the portrayal of women in media, appeared at the United Nations Monday promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women in children's media. After watching cartoons with her then-2-year-old daughter, Davis said she was bothered by the "disturbing" stereotyping and hyper-sexualization of female characters on television. "I was stunned to notice what seemed to be a very significant gender disparity in these entertainments that were made for young children. And it occurred to me that this wasn't a healthy message that we were sending to kids," Davis, who attended a U.N. meeting on gender equality, told reporters. She said the media is an important tool for empowering women and achieving the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals, designed to improve global living standards. "As we work towards improving the status of women and the respect that women deserve, we should also think about the messages that the media that we consume is sending about women and girls," she said. In 2004, Davis launched the largest content analysis ever done on G-rated movies and children's television. In the hundreds of films analyzed, the results showed there is only one female character to every three male characters -- one to five in large group scenes, she said. Female characters that were portrayed tended to be over-sexualized with a narrow scope of character traits, Davis said. Davis said that needs to be changed. She gave examples of female characters in G-rated media dressed in as sexually revealing clothing as they are in R-rated films. "If we have such devaluing and disempowering images from the first media that children consume, it sets the table and enculturates another generation of children into seeing women and children of a lesser status than boys and men," Davis said. Davis went to the Writers Guild and to entertainment content creators and said the two groups were largely "unaware of this gender discrepancy." Davis said she advised creators to include more female characters that represent a larger spectrum of women. She said characters don't need to have the hourglass figure that tends to be shown on TV. "If there was a wealth of female characters of all different stripes, then you could make them whatever you want. You don't have to limit yourself to this crazy ideal," she added. Davis is known for starring in films "A League of Their Own," and "Thelma & Louise," as well as the television show "Commander in Chief."

Hollywood publicist's killing raises fear and speculation By Alan Duke, CNN Publicist Ronni Chasen was shot to death in a posh Sunset Boulevard residential area. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Police chief warns against "erroneous information, theories or speculation"NEW: Beverly Hills mayor backs away from comments the attack appeared to be "targeted"Police say they've not ruled out road rage or a targeted attackRonni Chasen was shot to death on the way home from a movie premiere

Beverly Hills (California)
Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Beverly Hills Police Chief David Snowden asked journalists to keep "erroneous information, theories or speculation" out of their stories about the killing of a Hollywood publicist, but his appeal appeared to be a reaction to reports quoting his own mayor. Beverly Hills Mayor Jimmy Delshad told reporters Thursday night that the shooting death of Ronni Chasen in a posh residential area early Tuesday appeared to be a planned attack from an SUV. The 64-year-old public relations veteran died from shots fired into her Mercedes-Benz as she turned off Sunset Boulevard on her way home from a star-studded premiere celebration for the movie "Burlesque." "The most indication is that it was targeted," Delshad told a Los Angeles TV station Thursday night. "A random killing will not happen like this, five shots in a chest area, and it seems like it wasn't just a random killing." The mayor, who said he had gotten his information from the police chief, backed away from his comments Friday morning, after a call from the chief. Deputy City Manager Cheryl Friedling, the mayor's spokeswoman, told CNN "it would be wise not to go with the mayor's speculation." "This type of media coverage can only jeopardize the integrity of the investigation," Snowden said. He urged the news media to be patient while the investigation goes on. The lack of official information about the case has fueled fear and speculation among wealthy residents. "I would like to assure the public that this was a rare, isolated incident and that the Beverly Hills community remains one of the safest in the nation," the chief said Friday. There is no prevailing theory on if the attack was road rage or a planned hit, a police official said. Detectives are still trying to determine exactly where the shots were fired, Beverly Hills Police Sgt. Lincoln Hoshino said. Several 911 calls reporting gunfire were placed from homes along a four-block stretch of Sunset Boulevard, he said. The first call came from near the Beverly Hills Hotel, while later calls reporting gunfire came from three or four blocks down the street. Chasen's car turned off of Sunset Boulevard onto Whittier Drive and came to a stop against a light pole about two blocks away, he said. Investigators canvassed the neighborhood of expensive homes for video of her car or the attacker, Hoshino said. "Quite a few residents" along the way have security cameras, Hoshino said. The shots that struck Chasen were apparently fired through the passenger door window, he said. She was the lone occupant of the car. Chasen left a voice mail at her office just minutes before the shooting, police said, an indication that she was not aware of anything out of the ordinary. Chasen had been on the red carpet at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, walking with songwriter Diane Warren as she and "Burlesque" star Cher were interviewed about the music in the film. Warren, who contributed the song "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me" to the movie's soundtrack, said Chasen also went with her to the after-party at Hollywood's W Hotel.

Actor Matt Damon rallies teachers in Washington By the CNN Wire Staff Damon said the things he values "came from the way that I was parented and taught," and that these qualities can't be tested. STORY HIGHLIGHTSDamon speaks out against standardized testingTeachers say focus takes them away from educating studentsDamon attributes his success to his teachers not being forced to do "silly test prep" (CNN) -- Actor Matt Damon rallied teachers Saturday at a march in Washington decrying the widespread use of standardized testing to judge how well teachers, students and schools are performing. A group of teachers and education advocates organized the Save Our Schools March in an effort to inspire change in standardized testing policies, according to founder Anthony Cody. Critics say standardized testing takes teachers' focus off their core mission of educating students. Teachers marched to the White House, chanting "Save our schools" and other slogans and carrying signs. One read, "Children are more important than test scores." Another read, "I am not the problem." Damon, whose mother is an educator, said he achieved his successes in large part because teachers at the public schools he attended were not forced to focus on "silly test prep" and instead could work to educate. "As I look at my life today, the things that I value about myself, my imagination, my love of acting, my passion for writing, my love of learning, my curiosity, came from the way that I was parented and taught," Damon told the teachers. "And none of these qualities that I just mentioned, none of these qualities that I prize so deeply, none of these qualities that have brought me so much joy, that have made me so successful professionally, none of these qualities that make me who I am can be tested," he said.

Secretariat's '73 Preakness time is a record, racing commission rules
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 1:38 PM EDT, Thu June 21, 2012
Secretariat, left, races toward a record win in the Kentucky Derby on May 5, 1973, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Officials rule that 1973 winner is Preakness record-holder
The official time of 1:54 2/5 was disputed by independent timers Using video evidence commission revises time to 1:53 flat
Triple Crown winner now owns the official record time in all three races
(CNN) -- In 1973, Secretariat won horse racing's Triple Crown and set records that still stand today at the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes. Now, 39 years later, the legend has been recognized as having also set a still-standing record at the Preakness Stakes.
The Maryland Racing Commission unanimously agreed Tuesday that evidence shows Secretariat's Preakness time was faster than originally recorded, said the commission's executive director, Mike Hopkins.
Penny Chenery, who owned Secretariat, and Thomas Chuckas, the president of the Maryland Jockey Club, made the request for the commission to review the evidence.
The hearing lasted three hours and involved watching digital tapes and video overlays as well as listening to expert testimonies, Hopkins said.
Billy Turner: Horses run too hard
The controversy over Secretariat's time goes back to the 1973 race day.
Secretariat's 1973 Preakness time reviewed
The electronic timer at the Preakness recorded a winning time of 1:55 (one minute, 55 seconds). However, two independent clockers from the Daily Racing Form individually timed the race at 1:53 2/5.
Officials at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, where the race is held, admitted that there were "extenuating circumstances" with the electronic timer's recording and changed Secretariat's official time to 1:54 2/5.
If Secretariat had indeed run the 1 3/16-mile (9.5-furlong) race in 1:53 2/5, as the Daily Racing Form timed it, it would have meant a record at the time, and one that has been matched but not beaten since.
But the commission changed the official time to 1:53 flat, meaning the then-3-year-old set an unmatched best in the race, the second leg of the Triple Crown.
"For me, revisiting this dispute on a new day is matter of resolution -- for historians, for sportswriters and for racing fans," Chenery said. "Their voices are supported by sound evidence, and they deserve to be heard."
Modern video technology can be used to settle the controversy, Chuckas said.
"During the last 40 years, video technology has been accepted in other professional sports as a supportive mechanism for officials to ensure fairness and accuracy in their decisions," he said. "It is important for horse racing and the record books to confirm the correct time in this historical race. It is the appropriate thing to do."

Senate Democrats hold key to passage of gun legislation
By Dana Bash, CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent
updated 5:13 PM EST, Wed January 16, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Vulnerable Democrats from conservative states might resist much of what president wants
Democratic sources: Tougher background checks most likely to pass, still face uphill climb Senate Democratic leaders say House Republicans will not act on anything until Senate does
Senate Democrats aim to recruit red-state Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans
Washington (CNN) -- Unlike most issues these days that divide along party lines, the immediate fate of President Obama's new gun proposals will depend not as much on Republicans as his fellow Democrats in the Senate.
Senate Democratic leadership sources tell CNN that passing any new legislation will be extremely difficult because more than a dozen vulnerable Democrats from conservative states will probably resist much of what the president is pushing.
These Democratic sources say the most likely legislation to pass will be strengthening background checks, since it is the least overt form of gun control and it also appeals to gun rights advocates' emphasis on keeping guns away from people with mental health and criminal problems.
Obama announces 23 executive actions, asks Congress to pass gun laws
Although Senate Democrats like Dianne Feinstein will still make a high-profile push to renew the assault weapons ban and limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, senior Democratic sources say it is hard to see those measures getting enough support to pass the Democratic-led Senate.

The focus is on the Senate because Senate Democratic leaders know that House Republicans will not act on anything until the Senate does.
Democratic leadership sources say they intend to spend next week -- the first week the Senate is in session -- canvassing red-state Democrats to see what, if anything, is doable. Democratic senators who advocate various gun control measures will be lobbying their colleagues as well.

At a certain point, Democratic leaders will decide the best course of action, if any. Democratic leadership sources emphasize what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a PBS interview in recent days: They will not vote on any legislation unless they have 60 votes, enough to break a filibuster.
Democratic leadership sources say they have no intention of putting their members in a politically vulnerable position on a gun measure unless they are sure it can reach the president's desk.
In the short term, that would mean not only getting red-state Democrats on board, but at least a handful of Senate Republicans as well.
There is some hope that Democrats may be able to persuade GOP Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, a moderate, to help shape bipartisan legislation that can pass.

Where's the evidence that data mining saves lives?
By Shane Harris, Special to CNN
updated 3:43 PM EDT, Fri June 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Should you care that the government is collecting telephone and Internet data?
Shane Harris says attitudes to privacy have changed
Massive quantity of data is unlikely to yield evidence of terrorist plots, he says
Harris: We need hard evidence that trading off privacy for security actually works
Editor's note: Shane Harris is the author of "The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State." (CNN) -- Since it was revealed this week that the National Security Agency is collecting the telephone and Internet data of millions of people, this is the question most people have asked me more than any other: "Why should I care that the government has all this information?"
On Thursday, as we were learning that the NSA has been storing the so-called metadata of millions of Verizon customers, a woman told me that she was less concerned about the intelligence agency knowing her phone number than she was the local CVS, which has been calling her at inconvenient times and pressuring her to renew prescriptions she was filling at another pharmacy.
Maybe it's because we don't feel the surveillance state bearing down on us the way we do pushy marketers that many people aren't that concerned about the government compiling enormous databases on our digital activities.
Shane Harris
Indeed, we already knew that intelligence agencies have been doing this for years. In 2006, shortly after the revelation that the NSA was monitoring some Americans' phone conversations without warrants, a poll showed the public was evenly divided on whether it was a good or a bad practice. If it helped catch terrorists or prevent attacks, roughly half of the people responding were willing to give up some measure of privacy.
Inherent to that calculation is our understanding that the definition of "privacy" has changed. It doesn't have remotely the same context as it did in the late 1970s when the law restricting the government's authorities to monitor Americans -- authorities that had been scandalously abused -- was enacted.
Back then, our expectation of privacy extended to our relationships with our family and friends. To things like phone calls or the mail. Today, these personal connections, and the information we willingly share about ourselves, are the foundations of our increasingly public social networks. We know that complete strangers are looking at our Facebook pages. Should we be surprised that the government is too?
Probably not. But you might be surprised to find out that all this information the NSA and other agencies are collecting is not very useful for stopping terrorists, which is why it's being collected in the first place.
To date, there have been practically no examples of a terrorist plot being pre-emptively thwarted by data mining these huge electronic caches. (Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that the metadatabase has helped thwart a terrorist attack "in the last few years," but the details have not been disclosed.)
When I was writing my book, "The Watchers," about the rise of these big surveillance systems, I met analyst after analyst who said that data mining tends to produce big, unwieldy masses of potential bad actors and threats, but rarely does it produce a solid lead on a terrorist plot.
Those leads tend to come from more pedestrian investigative techniques, such as interviews and interrogations of detainees, or follow-ups on lists of phone numbers or e-mail addresses found in terrorists' laptops. That shoe-leather detective work is how the United States has tracked down so many terrorists. In fact, it's exactly how we found Osama bin Laden.
Now, electronic data does play a crucial role in those investigations. But only when it is narrowly searched, with specific criteria at hand -- a name, say, or a phone number. Officials have said that this is how that metadatabase is used. Analysts can only look at it when they have the number of a suspected bad actor, and they want to search for his connections. That may offer some reassurance, however slim, that there are at least some controls on how that information is being searched.
But we've also learned about a separate collection program, known as PRISM, that reportedly lets analysts tap directly into the central servers of top U.S. Internet companies, and then siphon off e-mails, photographs and audio and video files.
We're told that U.S. individuals' information is routinely swept up in these searches, and that it's subsequently segregated from information about foreigners. But according to training manuals for PRISM examined by The Washington Post, analysts are told that when Americans get caught in the net, they should just file a quarterly report about the incident, and that "it's nothing to worry about."
This looks a lot like that big data mining that analysts have told me doesn't produce solid leads. What it does do is implicate potentially innocent Americans in a vast sweep of some of the most ostensibly private information there is, particularly your e-mails.
Reasonable people can come to different conclusions about how comfortable they are with the government building all these databases. But we shouldn't accept officials' broad claims that these searches, and the information they're based on, are protecting the nation's security. If we're going to hand over so much information about our once-private lives, we should have some assurance that the trade is worth it.

10 things to know about visiting Detroit
By Aaron Foley, Special to CNN
updated 1:22 PM EST, Fri November 8, 2013
Detroit was home to 2 million residents at its peak, but now the city is down to roughly 700,000. That's still 700,000 people living their lives in this city.
The great migration out of the rural South that began before World War I coupled with opportunities within the automotive industry made Detroit an enduring stronghold of African-American culture. The city of Detroit is home to the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History.
The Avenue of Fashion along the Northern portion of Livernois Avenue features pockets of mostly black-owned boutiques, galleries and eateries on the city's northwest side.
The scenic and historic Elmwood Cemetery provides a peaceful place to explore Detroit's past.
Navigate Detroit as you would any other city: Don't make assumptions, and use the same common sense that you would anywhere else.
Abandoned homes and buildings are part of the landscape in Detroit. The city has an estimated 78,000 abandoned buildings across its 139 square miles of land.
Instead of venturing into the city's dangerous abandoned buildings, check out some of the surviving architectural treasures. The 1928 Art Deco Fisher Building in the city's New Center area is home to the Fisher Theatre. This sign in a store selling Detroit merchandise was photographed on July 19, 2013, a day after the city's bankruptcy filing. Detroit is well known for Coney Island hot dogs, but the city has other delicacies worth a taste. Look for the pop-up Two Dollar Tacos stand and Asian Corned Beef, with one location on the west side and one on the east side.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Despite a shrinking population, Detroiters are still making their lives in the city
African-American art and culture are thriving in Detroit
Pop-up restaurants and a unique local sport keep things interesting
Detroit (CNN) -- Detroit is a place whose story is often told by the numbers. It was home to 2 million residents at its peak, but now the city is down to roughly 700,000. And all of those residents live in a 139-square-mile city grappling with millions of dollars in debt that led the city to file for bankruptcy.
But 700,000 people still make their home here. There are square miles of the city that are empty, yes. But the rest of Detroit still has to live somewhere. And where they're living, they're really living. They're operating barber shops and beauty salons, they're working to build Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant, they're going to see the Detroit City Football Club soccer team play at Cass Technical High School.
Beyond the abandoned train station and empty Packard Plant is a city slowly making its way back from the brink. What Detroit will look like in the years to come is anyone's guess, but it doesn't mean things have ground to a halt in the meantime.
So what do you do in Detroit?

Know that you haven't left civilization. Relax. You're in Detroit. It's a city, an American city. It's going through a tough time, sure. Detroit's problems show themselves more than other cities. But assess: Why are you in Detroit? For business? For pleasure? For curiosity? Regardless of why you're here, there will be something here you'll never forget. Welcome, and open your mind.
Savor African and African-American art. The great migration out of the rural South that began before World War I coupled with opportunities within the automotive industry made Detroit an enduring stronghold of African-American culture. The city of Detroit is home to one of the largest collectives of black artists, and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History houses one of the world's best-curated collections of art from the African diaspora.
Also consider checking out the African Bead Museum, the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore and cultural center and pockets of mostly black-owned boutiques, galleries and eateries on the Avenue of Fashion along the northern portion of Livernois Avenue on the city's northwest side.
Tour Elmwood Cemetery. There are no more calming places anywhere than cemeteries, but Elmwood is special because of the haunting, Gothic monuments among lush, tree-lined paths. The founding fathers of Detroit -- and Michigan -- are buried here. And while you're on this side of town, head over to Indian Village, the city's premier historic district that once served as home to some of the area's wealthiest auto barons where houses still are maintained and occupied by many of the city's power brokers. Or stop for some coffee at one of the cafes in nearby West Village.
Walk Pallister Avenue. Even in a city built around the auto industry, there are hidden gems where your own two feet remain the best mode of transportation. Stroll down the brick-laid, American Foursquare-lined Pallister -- where no cars are allowed. While this residential pedestrian avenue takes you to a quieter, simpler time, it was developed by none other than the workhorses at General Motors.
The automaker had its headquarters nearby on West Grand Boulevard and sought to redevelop the area after a slow decline in the 1960s. While the plan didn't quite work out -- GM moved its headquarters downtown in the 1990s -- the residents there have maintained the original vision. And if you're feeling hungry, stop by New Center Eatery nearby for the best chicken and waffles in town.
Get hip to the latest pop-ups. The barrier of entry to entrepreneurship is lower in Detroit, and many budding business owners are taking advantage of the pop-up model to establish themselves. And other local talent finds them. Take The Taco Lady, for one: Wherever Detroit native Erica Class' traveling stand Two Dollar Tacos pops up, there's sure to be a good time. Class has connections with nearly all of Detroit's up-and-coming artists and musicians displaying their talents citywide. Look for @TwoDollarTacos on Twitter.
Sample culinary creations beyond the coney dog. Get some Asian Corned Beef. There are plenty of nooks and crannies hiding delicacies unique to Detroit that contribute to the city's flavor, and these handmade corned beef concoctions wrapped in egg rolls are hidden gems. True to many locally owned joints, Asian Corned Beef has one place on the west side (13660 Wyoming) and one on the east side (2847 E. Seven Mile).
Try our local sport. Football + bowling = Fowling. Got that? The story behind that portmanteau is this: The proprietor of Fowling Warehouse and his family invented a summer game based on horseshoes, except instead of ringing horseshoes around a metal rod, you knock down bowling pins with a football. Sounds easy enough, but veterans of the Detroit-bred sport know better. All the activity at Fowling Warehouse is spur-of-the-moment, so it's not uncommon for one-on-one matches to morph into an all-out dodgeball-style tournament with more footballs and pins. They're in two locations: Sundays at Eastern Market and a new location at a factory -- yes, a factory -- at 3901 Christopher in Hamtramck, a small city surrounded by Detroit.
Don't go urban exploring. Why would you want to go into an abandoned building? They're old, they're dangerous, they're full of asbestos. The street cred associated with going through these places is long gone. And most Detroiters are offended if that's the only reason you visit. Lastly, it's illegal -- and with more police on the streets thanks to donated patrol cars and a shift in internal structure, you're running a greater risk. If you'd like to explore a beautiful building, try the Albert Kahn-designed 1928 Fisher Building in New Center, a commercial district north of downtown, or the 1928 Redford Theatre on Lahser Road.
Don't ask stupid questions. Yes, 8 Mile is a real place. No, 8 Mile isn't exactly like the movie "8 Mile." Don't make assumptions, and use the same common sense in Detroit that you would anywhere else.
Remember that people are people. Detroiters are not meant to be ogled like exhibits in a museum. They're not to be talked down to, pitied, shamed or treated with kid gloves. The so-called "grit," "never-say-die spirit" and "determination" is not unique to Detroiters, either. It's in all of us, everywhere. Say hello. Smile. Shake hands. Be courteous. Be polite. Be normal. Welcome to Detroit.

Sara Bareilles on her supposed rivalry with Katy Perry
By Kyle Anderson, EW
updated 5:37 PM EST, Fri January 24, 2014
Sara Bareilles says she and Katy Perry don't have any issues between them.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fans have noted the similarities between "Brave" and "Roar"
Bareilles says she and Perry are friends
The pair both have songs nominated for best pop solo Grammy
(EW.com) -- One of the more intriguing pop controversies of 2013 was the friendly fire exchanged over the perceived similarities between Katy Perry's "Roar" and Sara Bareilles' "Brave."
This Sunday's Grammy Awards just might bring some resolution to that argument — or at least declare a "winner": Both tracks are nominated for best pop solo performance, alongside Bruno Mars' "When I Was Your Man," Justin Timberlake's "Mirrors," and Lorde's "Royals."
If Sunday represents an end to the controversy, that will suit Bareilles just fine.
"I was surprised and to be honest disappointed at how vicious people were," Bareilles tells EW. "It's not my nature, and it's not reflective of what I feel I hope to incite in people. People really felt like Katy was ripping me off, and I disagree."
Bareilles was most frustrated by the fact that she was apparently supposed to be rivals with Perry.
"Katy and I have known each other a really long time, she's a friend of mine, and it seemed like there was this infusion of people wanting to create conflict and drama. I find that to be really fatiguing," she said. "It's an old paradigm of pitting people against each other based on the idea that there's not enough—not enough fans, not enough music lovers, not enough space for both of you, so you have to hate each other. I don't believe in that. I was disappointed. I feel it was misguided. There's better s— to do than worry about that stuff."
Like, for example, whether or not she should be preparing notes for a possible pair of victory speeches (she's also up for Album of the Year). "I haven't written anything down," she admitted. "I would want [an acceptance speech] to be authentic, so if it happened I would want to speak from my heart. But I do worry about being so nervous."
Find out whether Bareilles wins (and gets nervous) this Sunday at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (8pm on CBS), which you can follow in all its bombastic glory here on the Music Mix.

Marines, mothers and a magician united by fires
I've covered every major firestorm in Southern California for the last 13 years, but these fires are unprecedented. What has impressed me the most is the upbeat spirit of the evacuees at Qualcomm Stadium.Most had escaped the firestorm with just the clothes on their backs, but each person -- from Tammy McCall, a young mother with three small children, to the Stoddards who have been married for 62 years to the Villanuevas, a family of five who ran from the flames -- considered themselves lucky. They got out alive.And they told us, as awful as the situation was, they realized there were people in far worse circumstances and they wanted to reach out to them. We walked the corridors of a stadium that seats more than 70,000. It was surreal to watch people sitting in the stands looking out to an empty football field, gazing at the TV monitors watching local news reports wondering if their neighborhoods had burned.Walking into the bathroom watching women wrapped in blankets, brushing their teeth and putting on makeup. Walking the corridors near the concession area, seeing cots, blankets, exhausted evacuees laying on the floor. It touched me to see so many mothers wandering around with a look of fear in their eyes, looking for ways to comfort their small children. II've covered many fires, but have never been so touched by the massive human effort I saw at Qualcomm. Magicians like Tony Bradley who showed up early in the morning and stayed into their night blowing balloon hats for kids and making them smile, a ventriloquist who had kids laughing up a storm. Countless students who gave up their day to volunteer because they say they couldn't just sit around and watch TV and feel helpless. Even Marine reservists who had served in Iraq showed up in the wee hours in the morning with a truck full of diapers and formula, saying it was time to help their fellow Americans.It was quite a sight to behold.-- By Thelma Gutierrez, CNN Correspondent
Posted By CNN: 8:06 AM ET 6 Comments I watched in horror last night, as the Planet In Peril team revealed the extent to which WE are allowing species to be decimated by. This included, not only a whole mass of humanity still clinging to 2000 year old medical superstitions, but our own dear citizens of the US - the second largest market for exotic species. This has to stop friends. We need to find out who these folks are and out them. This calls for tactics as dirty as any we use in Iraq or at least some intelligence, and yes - the spy kind as well. Three things were blatantly obvious:1) Complaisance by government agents - it was obvious that the teams of police at the street market and stalking the poachers were not serious. Anyone that has done any hunting could tell you that you don't send a bunch of guys crunching through the jungle announcing that you're coming and expect to catch anything. YOu don't come, lights flashing, with a gang of reporters to "sneek up on some merchants". COME ON! Any high school kid from Nebraska could have caught those merchants and poachers red handed - it's called stalking - you set up a blind, you set up a sting - it's kid stuff. 2) Need for stronger penaltiesSame rationale as above - only it would be good if the poachers had their personal goods impounded and their families displaced. That might get their attention. NO more Lexus, mountaintop villa or penthouse in Bankok for you guys!3) Pressure from world governments to reverse stupid laws like those that forbade the opening of shops (they need to learn "probable cause"). We need to boycott, protest and intervene in the commerce of countries aiding and abetting these perpetrators.The thing that is missing there is "willingness and intent". Those governments are making such a killing (literally) from the poachers and merchants - why should they stop it?Start with your congressman, representative and write letters to companies that support these governments. Your action can make a difference. Thanks to organizations like Trout Unlimited we are now replenishing previously lost habitat for native species through community action, educating the ignorant, sometimes even the unwilling, and teaching our kids that we have a responsibility to this planet. Your action counts. So does your inaction.Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Rob Thomas, Past President Trout Unlimited,Richmond Capital ChapterRichmond, VA

Hello, I'm from the New Orleans area and lived through Hurricane Katrina. I have noticed a great difference in the news coverage between Katrina and the California wildfires. First of all, I'm not hearing anybody crying about FEMA and their actions, or lack of action. I am not hearing any stupid questions such as "where's George Bush?" and "why isn't the President doing anything about this?" I haven't heard anybody make any unbelievably stupid and ignorant statements such as "this is all George Bush's fault", "he (George Bush) hates 'rich' people", "George Bush hates white people" or "Goerge Bush planned this whole situation to get rid of those pesty southern Californians" I have not seen any coverage of the 'global warming' crowd either. Why are they not being shown fighting the fires and rescueing pets and other animals? Why has Al Gore not stepped up and directed us in what we, as a country, can do to make our 'carbon footprint' less of an impact because of this extremely dire and unfortunate situation? I've also noticed the difference in the way the people have acted and reacted to the situations. The people in California seemed to have heeded the warnings and directions of their local officials. They seem to have had enough common sense to process the idea that their lives were in danger, and reacted in a proper manner. I am not seeing people layed out on the side of the road, pointing their finger at the U.S. government while crying for someone to come to save them. The folks in California have not turned into "animals" and shot at helicopters, looted and tore up "Charger Stadium" and the such. These are just a few of my initial thoughts about the differences in the coverage of these situations. Maybe you (the media) might offer a comparison of your coverages in these devastating situations. Maybe you can highlight the way that the people in Mississippi and California reacted in an emergency situation and the way the New Orleans folks acted, and the way you covered the situations.

13 years of experience means the writer wasn't around during Oakland Hills, and let me tell you, THAT was a fire. 3000 homes gone, $1.7 bil. in claims, which is like $3 bil. today. All estimates I see today are under a billion, with thw IIN saying $500 mil.

IT'S ALL ABOUT LEADERSHIP!!!The difference between Katrina and the Southern California fires is Leadership. Not race, not income,not politics. Just plain ol' leadership. Watching California'sDepartment of Emergency Management get in gear is amazing! From local to state to federal agencies working together is what NIMS is all about. Good Luck to everyone, our hearts here in Navarro County Texas are with you! DFlanagan, FCRoane VFD

This city, county and state learned some hard lessons about how to manage major wildfires and evacuations during the horrible fires 4 years ago and, as bad as this is, it is very good to know that the lessons were learned well. The conditions that drove this year's fires were much worse than before but the response has been much better coordinated -- both by officials and the ordinary citizens.Wherever you are, and whatever the specific risks in your area, be they wildfire, tornado or hurricane:1. be prepared and knowledgeable about your own responsibilities in an emergency, (prevention, preparation, evacuation -- whatever is needed and appropriate. Don't wait around for someone to take care of you2. get involved in your local government and make sure that the officials are actually planning for problems, not just playing politics3. get involved in your community to know your neighbors and be ready to help -- it's is much easier to cope with a disaster if you are focussed on helping others instead of worrying about yourself
Posted By Anne, San Diego, CA : 5:38 PM ET
The response to these fires and the evacuees shows the benefit of a good plan and good organization and really good leadership. I hope more cities and states will look at California's plan and put one in place for their localities that work as well as this one seems to work. Unfortunately, we're probably going to need it.Annie KateBirmingham AL
