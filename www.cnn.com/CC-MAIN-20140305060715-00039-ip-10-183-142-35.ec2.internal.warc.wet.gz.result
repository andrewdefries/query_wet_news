(CNN) -- CNN.com asked readers affected by the attacks in the Middle East to send us their stories. Here is a sampling of the responses, some of which have been edited:I am alive. We are in a cellar hiding from Israeli fire, but we are alive. We lack water, electricity and bread but we are alive. Our country is in ruins; all bridges and infrastructure are down, but we are alive. My 6-year-old wants the electricity to come on so that he can charge his PSP; to him that's a major issue. To me, we are alive, and that's enough. Moustafa Assad, Sidon, LebanonI live in Haifa, the north sea port of Israel. Today, I lost a good friend, who was killed by the rocket that hit the city. Today, at 9 a.m. the sirens went off, and all of us, scared, went to find shelter. Then, we heard the noise of the rocket hitting its target, not knowing the location and the outcome. I tried to call my friend, who works in the Israeli railway workshop, with no answer. At that moment I felt that something happened to him. I tried a few more times to contact him and his family. I felt anxious and did not know what to do. Then, I got the call from another friend of ours. His voice was crying ... our friend was killed today, among the eight people killed in Haifa. May God bless him. He was so honest, so nice, so young! God, stop this bloodshed! Nir, Haifa, Israel I was in Lebanon two weeks ago visiting my family, along with my kids. I returned the end of June but both my boys are still there and were scheduled to return with their grandparents the 24th of July. They are 6 and 9 years of age. I am worried sick and praying for their safe return. No word from the embassy yet on a date for evacuation. I am working on a ticket to Cyprus to meet them there as soon as I know when they will be arriving. They are in Beirut currently and are acting braver than I ever was growing up in the war in Lebanon. Rana Jaafar, Tulsa, Oklahoma I am a Canadian living in Israel for nothing to do with political reasons (I met my Israeli husband while traveling in India 5 years ago). I have been living here for the past 3 years (although our permanent plans include settling in Canada). I used to live in Haifa, now I live in the same area (the North) but in a little town called Tivon (30 min south-east of Haifa). I was in Haifa when the bus got blown up and when the U.S. attacked Iraq. It was scary to be here when the bus was blown up and when we had to carry gas masks and there was the threat of biological warfare and scud missiles being launched on Israel. But it was new then. Now it's different. First off, I have a new baby, a 6 month old girl, my first child. Secondly, for the last while the rules of the game were the same. It was Israelis vs. the Palestinians. You sort of knew what to expect and you trusted that the Israeli security forces knew how to handle it and how to protect you, if you obeyed a few basic rules, like making sure you went to public places only if there was a security guard. As well as which, with the building of the separation fence, attacks in the North decreased and we all felt safer. Now, everything has changed and I am very anxious. Suddenly the rules of the war game are completely different. It's not the Palestinians and the Israelis anymore, it's also Lebanon. And through Lebanon it could get worse to include Syria and Iran. The entire region is completely unstable, which has always been the case, but for a while, it was stable in it's instability, everything is being reshuffled now. This sends me to panic at times. It could ignite so terribly fast with all the hot tempers and military strength around here in an area where force is the most frequently used way to get your point across. On the other hand, whatever I think of Israel's politics, it does do a fabulous job of protecting it's citizens. Israel is a strong military with the support of the U.S. Most likely we will be safe. The risk of a car accident is still greater than the risk of a rocket falling on you. And even though I can understand the average Israeli's take of the situation, for me, being a peacefully brought up Canadian, this experience vacillates between being terrifying (when I want to flee) and surreal (if I consider staying). In addition, the area where we are living is very close to an army base and we hear jets flying over at least every quarter hour. This doesn't help my emotions, as it is a constant reminder of the state of war which the region is in. Previously, we only heard the jets once or twice a week! Ania Taller Tivon. IsraelI am an American Lebanese who lives in Lebanon; my husband lives in the States. We have three children who live with me in Lebanon... Now I'm here in Florida on vacation with my husband. I was supposed to go back to Lebanon at the end of July, but now I cannot. That is not the problem, the problem is that my three children who are only a 6-year-old girl (Millennia), a 5-year-old girl (Aya), and a 4-year-old boy (Jacob) are stranded alone in Lebanon. I and their dad are stuck here, no way to get there to bring them to the U.S. Carolina Kmaid, Daytona Beach, Florida I am an Israeli citizen and my parents are currently in the U.S. My mother is very worried and she calls me every day with much anxiety, as things seem even worse when you are far away from the events, especially if you are hooked up so closely to the Internet for a few hours each day. On the one hand I don't want to worry her, on the other, I myself am worried like everyone else, but I try to soften my reports. My mother is considering returning back home from a long-term trip. I work in a basement in Tel-Aviv, which suffers from bad air or lack of air more often than not, but no doubt it is the best place to be if a rocket hits here, like [Hassan] Nasrallah threatens. It's horrible that innocent people are hurt on both sides, but the world must know and understand that people like Nasrallah, [Osama] Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, cannot be reasoned with in a normal manner. Shlomit Coen Maoz, Tel Aviv, IsraelI am a Lebanese-American who is visiting Lebanon for the summer. I was due to return on the 28th of July but now I am stuck and waiting for the evacuation. Lebanon is an amazing country and it is very sad that it is being destroyed this way. We are all hoping and praying that everyone stops bombing and people will quit dying. I have been lucky to be far away from any of the bombings, but it is sad to hear the jets fly over and to hear the bombs exploding in the distance. I can see Beirut from my balcony and even through the smoke I have faith we will rebuild and we will live again and Beirut will be beautiful again. Ziad Chihane, Deek El Mehdi, LebanonI am 17 years old and I just arrived in Turkey. I escaped Beirut two days ago and it was the hardest decision I have ever made. I decided at 6 p.m. that I was going to leave Beirut via the only road left to Syria and then drive till the borders of Turkey. I stayed 20 hours in a bus full of people worried that we could get bombed at any moment. I feel so bad because I left all the people I love there and they are stuck now! This was supposed to be a very good summer with a lot of musical gigs and a lot of tourists, which was very good for Lebanon. I have no idea what's going to happen, I only hope that all of this madness is going to stop as soon as possible. This can't go on this way! This is the 21st century. How can people still think about war? Janane, Beirut, LebanonOn the verge of one of the most successful tourist seasons Lebanon has ever had, this conflict broke out to further burden a population already suffering from poverty and stagnation. It's a shame for a country that could -- and still can -- be a beacon for true democracy in the region to suffer such a setback. As a Lebanese citizen, I lived through all my life among war, death and destruction -- it grieves me now to see my children living in the same conditions I swore I would never let them see. Iyad Abdelnour, Beirut, LebanonI have a 15-year-old child in Israel. He was sent there for five weeks with other children to see and visit the country. We, like many others, are helpless in making arrangements for his return. Denise Kalt, Franklin, MichiganI am 16, and I am in Lebanon with my two younger brothers. My parents are frantic with worry, but there is no way out. All major roads in the country have been destroyed. We are stuck, and our embassy is not even answering the phone anymore. We have no idea what is going on. All we want now is to go home. Jenna, Chemstar, LebanonI live in the area that has just been threatened. The situation here is serious because the area a missile may strike is not clear. I feel safe though because we are in a city due east of Tel Aviv, and hopefully it is safer here. For now it is relatively calm. I do volunteer at the police station, and if anything happens in my area I need to go and help. ... I have been living in Israel for a year; I was living in the States my whole life before this. This is my first experience being so close to a war, and it is much different than hearing about it on the news. Eric, Hod Hashron, IsraelI'm an American citizen vacationing with my father in Lebanon. We were set to leave the 14th of July, but since the bombings are stuck in Lebanon. We find ourselves like the Lebanese people: hostages, terrorized by Israeli bombs, with nobody to defend us. We are frantically awaiting relief from the U.S. Embassy. Kellee, Los Angeles, CaliforniaI came to live in Israel 15 years ago from the United States. At the time I genuinely believed that there was a great opportunity for peace. But now, as I sit here in my home, not far from Haifa, I realize how things have gone terribly wrong and how much things have changed. I used to be a "leftie." Now I am no longer sure how I would define myself. The only thing that comes to mind is "tired and scared." I ask myself, how did this happen? Where did we go wrong? Why are there rockets and missiles attacking all of us? But one thing is for sure, hatred and anger are seeping into my heart. The sympathy and understanding are flowing out. With each Katyusha that lands here, the flow speeds up. Cheryl, Zichron, IsraelI am a 17-year-old student living in Dubai but am a British citizen. I am currently residing on the American University of Beirut campus for a program that allows international students like myself to learn about the culture and history of Lebanon, as well as the language. Throughout the last few days, I have been witnessing the escalating conflicts between Israel and Lebanon, and what started off as a fun and educational holiday turned into a chaotic nightmare. All we can do is sit and wait for help, completely powerless ... We had no idea that this kind of terrifying warfare would happen, and now that it has, we are trapped inside and can't get out. Dima Hamati, Beirut, LebanonEveryone where I live and study is in a heightened state of worry and danger. We're praying that the crisis ends soon, that the loss of life ends. We just finished a fast, praying for the safety and safe return of the captured soldiers. We've stopped listening to music, stopped shaving and entered a period of mourning. Danny, JerusalemI am sitting in my kitchen eating a falafel, hearing the rockets whizzing overhead. Out in the blue sea I can see the Israeli warships block our port. My six children are terrified, and they are not able to go to school. We are all brothers and sisters in this world. May this war end soon. Mohammed Abu Sheikh, Beirut, LebanonMy daughter was studying at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and is a student at Boston College. [The students] have escaped to Byblos with the clothes on their back. She called today in total desperation. The adjoining town of Junieh has been bombed, cell phone towers are down and the Christian enclave they were told would be a safe haven is now under attack. Her plea -- and that of all the students in her group -- was, "Please, mommy, don't let us die here. Everyone is now terrified and desperate. This Christian area of safety is under attack. When are we going to be evacuated?" Jean Kluck, Farmingdale, New YorkI am one of 6 students from Teaneck, New Jersey, who came to Israel for a three-week program from the UJA Federation of Bergen County to work in Nahariya in a day camp for Israelis, teaching them English. We were in Nahariya when the missiles started, and we heard the noises, and even witnessed a field that had been hit by a missile. We spent a total of about eight hours in a bomb shelter, four at night (Wednesday), and four again in the morning (Thursday), and were only then taken out when the roads were "safe enough" for a cab to take us. Where we are now is somewhat of a safer place, but we're still in the relative north. We constantly still hear the missiles hitting, and we see and hear the military planes and helicopters flying above. Initially we were going to be moved in Nazareth, but due to the escalating circumstances, our program has now been cancelled. Personally, I will still be staying in Israel until August 7 as previously planned, but I believe the rest of the kids on the program are being sent home. We're all hoping that the situation improves fast and that Israel and its people will no longer be in danger. Gavi Lewy-Neuman, Shcania, IsraelI'm Lebanese and I live in the U.S., but I came to Kuwait to visit my parents, and we were all planning on going back home to Lebanon to spend a wonderful summer, as we do every year. But the attacks happened. They destroyed the airports and destroyed every means of transportation for people in the southern villages and towns to leave.I'm from a small village in the south called Ain-ebel. We do not support Hezbollah, but 15 Israeli missiles hit and destroyed my beautiful village. We are devastated. My relatives are there: my aunt, my cousins and my uncle -- not to mention those Lebanese who were supposed to spend two weeks in Ain-ebel for the summer and leave. Now these people are stuck, in constant fear, under attack. Hezbollah missiles were planted in our village, and they're firing from Ain-ebel's territory without the consent of the people who live there.The roads that lead to Beirut are destroyed, the bridges that lead to Beirut are destroyed, and everyone is stuck there with no food, no electricity and no water. The people from that village are trying to help our families there by spreading the word that we, those people and towns that do not support Hezbollah or their actions, are innocent. People are hiding in the church, which was renovated not too long ago. It is a big church, but can it take Israeli missiles?My relatives are scared of dying, are scared of ending up homeless again; we don't not want history to repeat itself. We have had enough. I call on the Lebanese all over the world and the U.N.: Please help my village survive this dreadful act of Hezbollah. I feel betrayed, that nobody is mentioning those people back in my village. Those who have no voice to be heard, I refuse to let them die in vain. Hezbollah is getting out of control to the point of declaring war against Israel, without the consent of the Lebanese government. They are destroying what Lebanon had been trying to rebuild for the past 10 years just for the lives of three prisoners, is it worth it?I'm not there right now, but I can be their voice. Lebanon will live on. They are fighting each other on Lebanese soil, and this is immoral. Dana K., Tempe, ArizonaI am of Armenian descent. I have all my relatives in Lebanon. My entire family, including my son and my little nephew, went to visit our relatives. I have been constantly calling them to make sure they are safe. I was frightened when I heard the port in Junieh was hit, because they were at the chalet in Junieh. I went crazy when I couldn't get ahold of them. When I finally got through, they told me they had escaped into a basement. My son was crying for me to help him. He's only 13. My nephews are 5 and 2. I also have a newborn niece. Can you please help us to find a quick escape? I heard Italy and other countries have been successful in taking their citizens. Rose, Sarasota, FloridaMy daughter Lana is going to be 14 on August 1. She went to Los Angeles to visit her father for part of the summer and then after one week got an invitation to go visit her father's relatives and cousins. I felt a bit hesitant, though she has been going to Beirut ever since she was a baby. This time she went with relatives of her grandparents, leaving to Beirut via Paris. I didn't want to disappoint her and say no, so I agreed when her father told me of the trip. I am now very concerned for her safety as well as the safety of the family she is with. They are wonderful people, and I know they are doing everything possible to comfort her. I myself used to go every summer and found Lebanon beautiful and its people full of life despite the past civil war and all of the hardship these people have suffered. As a mother, I feel so helpless and as a human being feel so sad that Lebanon must once again face possible ruin of its sovereignty and the strength it took so long to rebuild. Mr. Rafik Hariri would be so sad to see this country he loved and worked so hard to rebuild return to such a horrible past. May God help everyone reach peace and may God return my beautiful daughter safe and unharmed soon. Sincerely, a mother wishing to hug her daughter and tell her how much she loves her. Linda Hageali, Miami, FloridaMy wife just spoke to her aunt in Carmiel, northern Israel. Her aunt just came back with her family from vacation only to find her new house hit with a Katyusha, which landed in her daughters' room. Had they not gone on vacation, her teenage daughters would have been dead. Alex, Staten Island, New YorkPeople are desperate. The telephone number posted only says the lines are full, call back later, and then clicks off. My beautiful daughter and family are trapped in southern Lebanon, in Sidon, now without even cell phone contact. Last news was Israel was bombing randomly in the region. This is unacceptable. Brenda Rose, Montreal, QuebecI am a Lebanese American currently staying at my family's country residence in Shemlan, Lebanon, located in the mountains above Beirut. My fiance and I came here with the intentions of writing our graduate school dissertations and enjoying the vibrant city life, beautiful beaches and natural beauty of Lebanon. We now find ourselves watching in disbelief as the bombs fall and smoke billows in the city below us. As I write this I am sitting in the garden, amidst three dozen olive trees, a symbol of peace that now seems so distant. We pray for a resolution and anxiously await news of evacuation. Patricia Karjian, Shemlan, LebanonI am studying at a university in Jerusalem, but I live in Toronto. I want to say that the situation appears to be surprisingly normal here in Jerusalem. People are going about their daily routines as normal, and I am continuing my research and studies at the hospital. I also have a younger sister who is in Tel Aviv doing volunteer work for another week before returning to Toronto. She also hasn't noticed anything unusual there, but we are both keeping up-to-date with the situation. The current situation is in stark contrast to six years ago in Jerusalem, when I was also here during my first degree, during the initial phase of the Second Intifada. At that time, people here were much more affected by the suicide bombings in the city occurring on a near-daily basis. The fear of terror is nothing new to the people here, and I guess it shows in the way people are handling the current situation. Benji Matta, Toronto, Ontario Story Tools

The storyWith the number of uncontained fires down to nine in Southern California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger turned his attention Saturday to what he called "the ugly side of human behavior" during and after the disaster.At least two of the fires were started intentionally and two more have suspicious origins, he said during a news conference, issuing a warning for the arsonists."We will hunt down the people that are responsible for that," he said."If I were one of the people who started the fires, I would not sleep soundly right now, because we're right behind you," Schwarzenegger said, urging the culprits to turn themselves in. Watch the governor's tough messageAuthorities said Saturday they were following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F-150 pickup that may be a lead in determining who set the sprawling Santiago Fire in Orange County.

Prison was 'a turning point,' quarterback Vick saysStory Highlights Philadelphia Eagles introduce Michael Vick at news conference Eagles head coach Andy Reid: I know some fans won't accept Vick NFL suspended Vick in 2007 after he pleaded guilty in dogfighting case Vick won't be able to play in regular season games until October Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- The Philadelphia Eagles welcomed Michael Vick back into the National Football League on Friday after the quarterback spent almost two years in federal prison on a felony dogfighting conviction. Michael Vick speaks at a Philadelphia Eagles news conference on Friday. Vick, formerly with the Atlanta Falcons, has signed a two-year deal with the Eagles. "I think everybody deserves a second chance," Vick said at a news conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Friday. "Now I want to be part of the solution and not the problem." The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to his Virginia home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. iReport.com: Is this a good move? "Everything that happened at that point in my life was wrong," Vick said of his involvement with the dogfighting ring. Watch bloggers discuss Vick's return to the NFL » "I had to reach a turning point. Prison definitely did it for me," he said. Flanked by Eagles coach Andy Reid and former NFL coach Tony Dungy, who acted as a mentor to Vick after he was imprisoned, the newest Eagle vowed "to do all the right things." "I want to be an ambassador to the NFL and the community," he said. "I'm glad I got ... a second chance. I won't disappoint." Dungy said that he thinks Vick can revive his career and turn his life around in Philadelphia but that the quarterback will be tested by fickle Eagles fans. "He is gonna have a lot of people who do not think he should be playing. He's got to prove them wrong on the field and off the field," Dungy said. Watch why Dungy thinks Vick will be a positive force » Earlier reaction to Vick's signing was mixed. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday night in a statement that it was "incredibly disappointed" at the news. Don't Miss Philly fans love, hate Vick news
NFL reinstates Michael Vick on conditional basis
"Philadelphia is a city of dog lovers and, most particularly, pit bull lovers," said Susan Cosby, the organization's chief executive officer. "To root for someone who participated in the hanging, drowning, electrocution and shooting of dogs will be impossible for many, no matter how much we would all like to see the Eagles go all the way." However, Ed Sayres, president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said in a statement that "[NFL] Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Philadelphia Eagles have granted Michael Vick a second chance, and the ASPCA expects Mr. Vick to express remorse for his actions, as well as display more compassion and sound judgment this time around than he did during his previous tenure with the NFL. "We hope that Mr. Vick uses his stature for the betterment of the community and the advancement of the issue of animal cruelty," Sayres said. Reid said he knows that there are some fans who will not accept Vick. "I understand how that works," he said. "But there's enough of them that will, and then it's up to Michael to prove that that change has taken place. I think he's there. That's what he wants to do." He said Vick "seems very focused, and he wants to get his career back on track." It is unclear what role Vick will play in the Eagles' offense. But it was clear that the move had the blessing of Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb. "I pretty much lobbied to get him here," McNabb said. "Because everybody deserves a second chance." The NFL reinstated Vick on a conditional basis last month. Vick "will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan," the league said in a statement last month. Week 6 of the NFL season is in October. Vick may participate in practices, workouts and meetings and may play in his club's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement, the league said last month. "I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for [the] opportunity I have been given," Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement. Goodell said last month that Vick underwent tests, including a psychiatric evaluation, after requests from animal rights groups. Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At a hearing in that case, he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison. Court documents released in Vick's case showed that two of his co-defendants, who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal, said that Vick helped kill dogs that didn't fight well and that all three men "executed approximately eight dogs" in ways that included hanging and drowning. The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in "testing" sessions held at Vick's property. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns. Wayne Pacelle, the organization's president, has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have been involved. In November, Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence. The Eagles are scheduled to play Vick's former team, the Falcons, in Atlanta on December 6. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

North Korea demands apology, reparations from Japan over colonizationBy the CNN Wire Staff A photo from 1937 shows Koreans working in a gold mine under the watchful eye of Japanese soldiers. STORY HIGHLIGHTSJapan apologized to the South, but not the North, for colonizationJapan colonized the Korean peninsula for 35 yearsThe apology is not the first to SeoulJapan says it will also return cultural artifacts

(CNN) -- North Korea is demanding reparations from Japan for colonizing the Korean peninsula for more than three decades in the early 1900s, after Tokyo once again apologized to South Korea earlier this month. "The Japanese imperialists enforced the harshest colonial rule in history over Korea, bringing unspeakably horrible misfortune and sufferings and disasters to the Korean nation," said a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea, according to the the state-run Korean Central News Agency. "Japan should make a sincere apology and make full reparation to the Korean nation for its aggression and crimes against humanity," KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. There was no immediate reaction from the Japanese government. Japan's August 10 apology to South Korea wasn't its first to Seoul, but it coincided with the 100th anniversary this month of the annexation of the Korean peninsula. In his statement, Prime Minister Naoto Kan expressed "deep regret over the suffering inflicted" during Japan's rule. Cabinet members endorsed the statement, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Kan also said Japan will hand over precious cultural artifacts that South Korea has been demanding. Among them are records of an ancient Korean royal dynasty. Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945. During that time, Japan's military is accused of forcing about 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves. They were known as "comfort women" for soldiers in Japan's Imperial Army. In the past, there have been street protests and lawsuits in South Korea over the sufferings of the comfort women. South Korea's ruling Grand National Party said earlier this month the statement was "a step forward" from past statements, but "not enough to allay" Korean anger, the country's Yonhap news agency said. The statement "has no mention of illegitimacy of the forced annexation and Koreans forced to work as sex slaves or manual laborers by the Japanese army," Ahn Hyoung-hwan, a spokesman of the party, said, according to Yonhap.

Muslim leaders boycott breakfast over surveillance program By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 2:27 PM EST, Fri December 30, 2011
Muslim leaders upset with the New York Police Department plan to skip Mayor Michael Bloomberg's interfaith breakfast.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Muslim leaders boycott interfaith breakfast in New York
CAIR says profiling is unconstitutional and must be investigated Group protesting a controversial surveillance program with alleged CIA ties Mayor Michael Bloomberg defend law enforcement efforts New York (CNN) -- A prominent group of Muslim leaders on Friday made good on a pledge to boycott New York City's annual interfaith breakfast with Mayor Michael Bloomberg in protest of a controversial surveillance program.
The move stemmed from a series of news reports that raised questions about the nature of a Central Intelligence Agency partnership with the New York Police Department, pointing to the alleged surveillance of Muslim communities in New York.
The Associated Press reported that following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the city, the CIA helped the NYPD build intelligence programs used to spy on Muslims, adding that a CIA officer was involved in intelligence collection in Muslim communities.
The reports said police have used informers to monitor sermons during religious services, while gathering intelligence on taxi cab drivers and food-cart vendors, who often are Muslim, in New York.
"These tactics, without due process, without evidence of crime, we believe (are) unconstitutional and unlawful. That's where the shock comes from," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
In a letter to the mayor on Thursday, the group said that "during times when a community's rights are being flagrantly violated its leaders cannot in good conscience appear at a public gathering with the government official who is ultimately responsible and smile for the cameras as if all is well, when we know full well that it is not."
Bloomberg, who had earned the group's support in his defense of a controversial Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, did not directly address the boycott during Friday's event.
He told reporters Thursday that the leaders are "going to miss a chance to have a great breakfast."
"It always a wonderful event to see all cultures and religions come together," he said about an event meant to highlight diversity and religious tolerance in New York.
But the mayor also reiterated his support of law enforcement efforts to thwart future terrorist attacks, telling reporters that "we obey the law" and that authorities "don't target anybody," but instead focus on investigative leads.
Last week, the CIA announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with the NYPD following an investigation into the matter.
The NYPD, meanwhile, has blasted the news agencies findings as "fictional."
New York police spokesman Paul Browne said the "use of NYPD undercover officers was grossly exaggerated in the AP series."
"There have been at least 14 terrorist plots against New York City since the 9/11 attacks, and the NYPD is actively engaged in making certain we are not attacked again," added Browne. "A recent analysis shows that 44 terrorists who have been captured or killed since 2002 resided in the five boroughs (the city's political subdivisions) or immediate metropolitan area."
The CIA has also previously said that suggestions that it engaged in domestic spying were "simply wrong."
The spy agency said the published report "mischaracterized the nature and scope" of the CIA's support for New York police.
An agency officer observing police efforts "would not be involved in law enforcement activities," said an official with knowledge of the proceedings.
But New York-area Muslims and civil liberties advocates have called for investigations and hearings after the series was published in August.

Like it or not, China and Europe's economies intertwined By Jim Boulden, CNN
updated 8:03 PM EST, Wed November 14, 2012
A Chinese consumer browses the Burberry flagship store in Beijing. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN's Jim Boulden writes he hardly hears positive stories about China's influence in Europe
Europe's and China's economies are intertwined
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe
London (CNN) -- When I was driving through Poland last year, all the talk was about a Chinese company's failure to complete a major motorway project. The contract was wrestled away from the Chinese and the Poles finished it themselves.
The details, denials and counter-claims aren't important for this article; far more interesting is the impact of any China-led project in Europe. Any news on such projects -- good or bad -- makes headlines. But the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about Chinese influence.
What China does in Europe matters greatly, though rarely do I hear or read a positive story about China's influence.
When a Chinese company bought Volvo, it was the transfer of technology that made the headlines, along with the end of the era for a venerable European brand. When an Indian company bought Land Rover and Jaguar, Tata was hailed as the savior of two venerable European brands.
China taking hit from euro crisis?
Bigger threat: China or Europe?
Inside China's Communist Party Congress
China to maintain economic momentum?
Why is that?
The answer appears clear. We are equally fascinated and frightened by the rise of China's economic and military prowess.
The Chinese government's recent trip to central Europe revealed that the hiccup in Poland has not slowed China's plan to invest heavily in the former communist states. A $10 billion credit line will be used for infrastructure projects in Poland, Hungary and other countries. It was reported that the leaders of 16 central European countries met with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao while in Poland.
China's tech giant Huawei is a growing power in the telecoms world. But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder. Rightly so, governments fret over a "foreign" firm controlling the hardware that is the backbone of modern society. In Huawei's case, as the Economist recently pointed out in a front cover story, the fear is China illegally tapping into western communications, both government and private.
Of course Huawei will say it's a private company with no state control and simply wants to compete on a level playing field with the likes of Nokia-Siemens, Cisco and Ericsson.
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe. There is no reason to believe big changes will come from the top.
Instead, change appears to be coming from the bottom. Rising wages and increased worker benefits might raise the prices of goods exported to Europe.
It also helps to expand China's middle class which appears to love European and American products.
I recall growing up in America with worries about the rising power of Japan. All the products we desired were designed there or manufactured there, from video games players to VCRs and automobiles to the Walkman. With the wealth created, the Japanese were buying up property in California and buildings in New York.
It was feared the rise of Japan's economic prowess would never abate. But it did.
Europe can't assume the same will happen with China. But the economies now are so interlinked that stingy European consumers quickly translates into weaker manufacturing output in China. That slowdown is dissected by European economists and, on any given day, it can cause stocks to fall, leading to the similar stock tumbles a few hours later on Wall Street.
Recently Burberry noted a slowdown in sales in Asia, particularly in China -- its shares promptly fell 20%. Perhaps it was an overreaction, but it shows investors are quite happy to plow money into companies with "an Asian strategy" and then ignore it -- until there is a profit warning blamed on that same market.
That goes to show Europe has to get comfortable with the growing influence of China on its shores. It cannot expect its companies to grow in the Chinese market, then be surprised when enriched Chinese companies come shopping for European companies to buy.
China needs to understand that it will take time for Europe to get comfortable with China's investments. China has to make sure its investments and intentions are transparent. Oh, then there is that small matter of reciprocity.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Lori Haas: The magnitude of the Newtown shooting shocked me
Haas: It reminds me of when my daughter was injured in the Virginia Tech shooting
She says our elected leaders have abandoned all sense of right and wrong
Haas: How many victims would be alive today if leaders took their responsibilities to heart?
Editor's note: Lori Haas lives in Richmond, Virginia. After her daughter Emily was shot and injured at the Virginia Tech massacre, she became involved in gun violence prevention efforts, working for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Mayors Against Illegal Guns.
(CNN) -- Sitting in front of the TV on Friday, I watched in horror as the death toll climbed with each news report coming in on the mass shooting in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. The magnitude of the shooting shocked me.
It also took me back to five years ago, when I received a phone call on a blustery April morning that changed my life forever. I was out shopping, and my cell phone had rung several times, but I had chosen to ignore the calls. Luckily, I answered the third call, which came in at 10:38 a.m. My daughter Emily, then a sophomore at Virginia Tech, was on the phone. She said, "Mommy, I've been shot."
Clutching the phone, my knees buckling, I tried to make sense of what I was hearing. Emily quickly handed the phone to the EMT who had triaged her and was waiting with her for an ambulance. The EMT assured me that Emily was going to be fine, that there were very seriously wounded students that needed to be transported immediately and she was waiting with Emily for the next ambulance. She also shared that the situation on campus was "very bad."
Lori Haas The world soon knew how bad it was. The incident at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, remains the worst mass shooting in U.S. history in terms of casualties. Thirty-two students and school staff were killed that morning by a dangerously mentally ill student with guns, including high-capacity magazines. The killer should have been prevented from purchasing firearms, but when he purchased his weapons, his mental health records were not in the FBI database against which background checks are run. He used 30-round magazines, which had been outlawed up until 2004, when Congress let the Assault Weapons Ban expire.
Shooting triggers 'mind battle' for Columbine survivors
We were one of the lucky families -- our daughter survived, when so many others did not. Eleven of the 17 students in her classroom were killed, along with her professor. A classmate dialed 911 when they first heard the shooter, but dropped his cell phone when almost immediately, the killer burst into the classroom and began spraying bullets at everyone. Emily reached over and picked up the phone and kept the dispatcher on the phone during the entire ordeal by hiding the phone. Law enforcement repeatedly told me how brave Emily was to keep them on the line.

Law enforcement has also told me that the single most effective thing we can do to prevent gun violence would be to require all purchasers for all gun sales to undergo a background check. Then-Gov. Tim Kaine appointed a panel of experts to investigate all aspects of the massacre and report back their recommendations. Recommendation VI-2 stated, "Virginia should require background checks for all firearms sales." Sadly, that hasn't happened, and gun deaths now outpace motor vehicle deaths in my state.
Community coping with shooting tragedy
'The Voice' pays tribute to Newtown
Carney: Hard to forget Newtown rawness
America has witnessed mass shooting tragedies grow in frequency in the last five years to the point that, according to one report, there have been 16 mass shootings between February 22, 2012, and December 14, 2012, leaving over 80 dead and many injured. I can't help but ache with sorrow, anguish and concern for all those families suffering the sheer agony that I saw the families of the 32 killed at Virginia Tech suffer.
And I can't help but be angered at the cowardly behavior from our elected leaders. They have abandoned all sense of right and wrong, despite epidemic deaths from guns, and ignored their duty not only to keep our communities safe from gun violence, but to keep our children safe as well.
When I think of those killed -- over 60,000 Americans have been murdered with guns since the shooting at Virginia Tech -- I have to wonder how many might be alive today if our elected leaders had taken to heart their responsibilities.
Why is it that our elected leaders have not only ignored the pleas of survivors and family members of victims of gun violence, but those of our public safety officials -- police and law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line day in and day out -- only to listen to the gun lobby when determining public safety policy? What sense can that make when the gun lobby's sole purpose is to sell as many firearms as possible to make as much money as possible?
Do you own a gun that fell under the now-expired federal weapons ban?
We have come to a time when many say the unimaginable has happened again -- the mass shooting in the Newtown school where 26 people were killed, including 20 children. It is sheer senselessness. My heart goes out with the utmost compassion to the families suffering so terribly from Friday's massacre.
For those whose loved ones have been killed, there is no real closure; there are permanent holes in their hearts. Time may lend a helping hand to healing, but their lives have been changed irrevocably. As my friend Lynnette, whose son was murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting, laments, "There is no ending to the heartache." I am brought to tears thinking of all we have seen, all we have not done and all we have let die.

America's most luxurious hotel suites
By Stephanie Orma, for CNN
updated 9:18 PM EDT, Sun June 9, 2013
One of the few places in Hawaii that makes you want to stay inside. This 4,490-square-foot, $30,000-a-night suite was inspired by Louis XV's royal court ... and his love of hemorrhaging cash.
Checking into the Provocateur Suite means you're not just fooling around. Actually, it sort of does. Features include mirrored ceilings and an interactive video wall that projects figures "writhing wantonly" on the bed while erotic themes rotate behind the headboard.
Yep, that's a full-sized basketball court behind those doors. For a mere $25,000 a night, hoop dreams do come true. Oh, relax, that's still less than LeBron James makes in a single quarter of play.
Vintage champagne? Monogrammed golf balls? 7-Eleven burrito? Your personal staff is on call to fetch whatever you need. Why go all the way to the Mediterranean to visit your rich relatives when you can simulate the effect in SoCal?
This Penthouse comes with a formal dining room seating 60 people, but everyone needs a secret refuge from the hoi polloi now and then.
Trump this view.
At Casa Five suite, you get your own outdoor pool, private tennis court, five bedrooms, five and a half baths and multi-level outdoor patio with hot tub. Don't worry, you'll get used to living like a sheik quickly enough.

The man with no memory: Navy vet wakes up, speaks only Swedish
By Elizabeth Cohen, Senior Medical Correspondent
updated 10:24 AM EDT, Tue July 16, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The man doesn't recognize himself
He doesn't speak English
A social worker tries to help him figure out his past
Doctors say he is in a 'fugue state'
(CNN) -- When police found the unconscious man in a Southern California Motel 6, the IDs on him said he was Michael Thomas Boatwright from Florida.
But when the man awoke at Desert Regional Medical Center a few days later, he said he'd never heard of Boatwright.
He didn't recall serving in the U.S. Navy. Or of being born in Florida.
Michael Boatwright
When doctors told him he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room, he couldn't say why.
When they showed him photos of himself with others, he didn't recognize them, or himself.
And he didn't speak a word of English.
The man said his name was Johan Ek.
And he said it in Swedish.
That was back in February.
Today, the 61-year-old man says he has come to terms with the name "Michael Boatwright," but only because doctors told him he should.
He still feels like Johan Ek from Sweden.
And he can't explain why.
The case was first reported by the Desert Sun.
Car crash leaves Australian woman with French accent
Digging in the past
Before she became a social worker at Desert Regional Medical Center, Lisa Hunt-Vasquez was an archeologist.
Those digging skills came in handy the day she met Johan Ek/Michael Boatwright.
Her mission: Help Boatwright figure out who he is.
She first contacted the military.
Among the IDs police discovered on him was one from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
He'd served from 1971 to 1973 in the Navy as an aviation mechanic.
Hunt-Vasquez dug deeper.
The Asia connection
She found a website for the TRP English school in China.
Turns out Boatwright taught English there for four years, until May.
In an essay he wrote for the site, he mentioned he worked as an English instructor in Japan for 10 years, and that he was married to a Japanese woman. They have a 12-year-old son together, he wrote.
The leads looked promising.
But there was one hitch.
Photos found with Boatwright in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a European city, not Asia.
Hunt-Vasquez kept searching.
She came across several websites dedicated to graphic designs. Boatwright often used the screen name 'korstemplar' and listed himself as a Swede living and teaching in China.
The pieces were falling into place.
A roadblock
He had lived in Japan, married, became a father. He then moved to China.
The school in China told her he was divorced.
He lived there until May, when his visa expired and he flew to California.
But when she contacted the Japanese and Chinese consulates, neither had next-of-kin information for him, according to the Desert Sun.
Staffers called all the numbers on the phone Boatwright had with him. They either went to voice mail or no one picked up, the newspaper said.
She had hit a dead end.
His life so far
Everything Boatwright knows about his life before February 28 he knows because his social worker told him or because he read it on websites.
He told CNN he learned that in 1987 he operated a consulting company called Kultur Konsult Nykoping.
That is somewhat of a Swedish connection.
He doesn't have any independent knowledge of his life before he woke up in the hospital. He doesn't even know exactly what his consulting company did.
Boatwright told CNN he'd been a good tennis player, and the Tennis Channel had interviewed him years ago.
Perhaps, he said, he'd come to southern California for the tennis tournament season. That would certainly explain the five rackets in his hotel room.
A 'fugue state'
According to the Desert Sun, Boatwright is in a "fugue state."
People in this condition lose their sense of personal identity, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They become confused about past events and often wander far from home.
Fugue states, such as dissociative fugue, are often triggered by trauma, such as the death of a loved one or a serious accident, according to Dr. Aaron Anderson, a neurologist at Emory University School of Medicine.
Patients sometimes assume different personalities, Anderson added.
The relatively rare disorder often goes away on its own, but it can take several months.
What the future holds
Now that Boatwright's story has spread to the Swedish media, several Swedes have come forth to say they knew him in the 1980s.
Late Monday night, the Desert Sun reported it found Boatwright's sister in Louisiana.
"I haven't talked to him in years. He just disappeared," Michelle Brewer told the paper.
Learning about his life hasn't helped him much psychologically.
He still feels isolated in the hospital, so Hunt-Vasquez encouraged him to reach out to members of the local Swedish-American community.
"They said he was getting depressed because he wasn't able to communicate," said Linda Kosvic, chairman of the Vasa Order of America chapter in San Jacinto, California. "We've been trying to provide him support and make him feel more comfortable."
Members visit him in the hospital, bringing him Swedish foods.
The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center.
They can't send him home until they know where home is.
CNN's Per Nyberg, John Bonifield and William Hudson contributed to this report.

Police to be stationed at Everest base camp following mountain 'brawl' last year

Climbers will have the aid of police stationed at Everest to resolve disputes more quickly.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Security officers to be stationed at Everest to resolve disputes
Last year "brawl" took place on mountain between European climbers and Sherpas
Flat rate climbing fee also hoped to improve safety
(CNN) -- The world saw another side of Nepalese mountaineering in April last year when a brawl was reported between European climbers and Sherpas 22,000 feet up Mount Everest.
Now Nepalese authorities plan to station security officials at the base of the world's highest peak from the spring climbing season beginning in March.
Up to nine officers from the police and army will be sent to the mountain to try to resolve conflicts on the spot rather than having to appeal to authorities in Kathmandu.
"The police will be the state's representative at the mountain to verify incidents that have to be reported to the authorities," said Dipendra Poudel, a mountaineering official.
Mount Everest is a journey that challenges human nature on every level. Sandra LeDuc captured this photo as climbers approached the Hillary Step, before the Everest summit. Click through our gallery to see more photos from climbers taken on Everest during 2012.

Jon Kedrowski snapped this photo at 6:30 p.m. on May 19th, 2012, at 26,000 feet as he looked out from his tent. He thought the climbers were beginning their summit attempt, but many clustered at the top were just beginning to come down from the top.
The tents from Camp 1 appear incredibly small against the backdrop of Everest.

"It's [part of] our effort to make mountaineering respectable."
Mount Everest: By the numbers
Confrontation with Sherpas
The Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck and the Italian Simone Moro were ascending Everest by a new route last April when they were reportedly confronted by a group of Sherpas laying ropes for other climbers who accused them of getting in the way.
The Europeans said the Sherpas threatened and then attacked them, including throwing rocks.
Around 300 people attempt to climb Everest every year.
The Sherpas said the climbers had caused ice to drop on them and had ignored requests not to advance until the ropes had been laid.
The issue was resolved after a meeting mediated by a Nepalese army official leading an expedition.
With police at base camp, Nepalese liaison officers -- who accompany expeditions to ensure they abide by local laws -- will no longer have to report incidents at the nearest police station a seven-day trek away, said Gyanendra Shrestha, who has worked as such an officer.
Beginning this year, the Nepalese government will also have a secretariat headed by a civilian at Everest base camp, to which security officials will report.
"We plan to have a meteorologist and communications expert at the secretariat, too," Poudel said.

Some have called for climbing permits to be restricted to experts. Mountain traffic jams While the quarrel between mountaineers and Sherpas made headlines in 2013, Nepalese authorities came under fire in 2012 for allowing "traffic jams" to build up on the mountain, allegedly contributing to accidents.
There have been calls to restrict climbing permits to expert mountaineers, preventing novices from attempting the peak.
"We are looking into the basis for setting [the] criteria [for climbing]," Poudel said.
For the past several years, around 300 foreign climbers have attempted to ascend Everest each spring.
To further regulate traffic, beginning this year the government has revised its royalty fees for climbing the mountain.
Last year the fee went down from $25,000 per climber to $10,000 if there were more than seven in a team.
The result was that climbers who didn't know each other clubbed together in "artificial" teams to pay significantly lower royalties.
But under new regulations, each foreign climber will pay a flat rate of $11,000 irrespective of the number of climbers.
Poudel said it was hoped this would improve safety and make managing teams easier.
