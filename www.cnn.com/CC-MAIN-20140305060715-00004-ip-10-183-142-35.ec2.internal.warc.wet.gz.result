LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf spoke about terrorism, Kashmir, and the controversy over nuclear secrets in an exclusive interview with CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour on Friday. The following is a transcript of the interview:
Amanpour: There are a lot of issues Pakistan is involved in right now. I would like to start with nuclear proliferation. Your government has announced this week it is conducting an inquiry into the issue and it is banning all nuclear scientists from leaving the country. what does that mean in terms of the inquiry?
Musharraf: There are some accusations against some individual scientists in Pakistan for having proliferated for their personal financial gain, but may I say there are equal accusations against a number of personalities internationally -- some Europeans -- so it is not Pakistan alone. But what we are doing is investigating against all names we have got, and more than that trying to ensure there is no such leakage in the future, so we are putting everyone into some kind of investigation, and finally based on the result of investigation we will move against violators because they are enemies of the state.
Amanpour: How long will this process take to complete?
Musharraf: I think it will be completed very shortly. We have gone a long way, it should be in a few weeks in fact.
Amanpour: One of the people questioned has said that the nuclear transfer that took place in the 80s was approved by the then head of the army.
Musharraf: These are absolutely wrong aspersions, throwing the blame away from the individual himself maybe? This is not the case at all, however I wouldn't be able to say anything definite as we are inquiring. But this I know: There is no official of the state or government involved at all. These are individuals we are investigating and we will hold them responsible and move against them. There is no such evidence that any government or military personality was involved in this at all.
Amanpour: The transfer in question is to Iran, and both Iranians have the IAEA that they did receive knowledge and technology and nuclear help from Pakistan, perhaps in the 80s.
Musharraf: Yes, these are the accusations which originated from Iran and they are naming individuals and that list includes Pakistanis and Europeans as well, but as far as Pakistanis are concerned, it is clear it was done by individuals for their own personal financial gain and as I said there is no official involvement yet.
Amanpour: Critics will say how can something so sensitive and secret be transferred without knowledge of government?
Musharraf: This is very much a possibility. Our nuclear program was totally covert in the past. A lot of authority and autonomy had to be given to individuals and scientific organizations to move forward and if some of the irresponsible got involved and misused capabilities that is really a pity and that is what happened. So now that it is overt, there is total custodial control and checks and balances introduced. It is not a possibility any more.
Amanpour: Why has Pakistan changed its tone in the last few months? Previously Pakistan had furiously denied any kind of transfer at any point to any nation.
Musharraf: Obviously facts and figures. It is intelligence. No government in past proliferated. There are individuals we did not know about. Now that someone accused them, we started investigation them. It is not a question of changing stance ... it is just that names have been revealed and we have information and we have investigated and we are coming to certain conclusions now.
Amanpour: Do you know what kind of a conclusion you are going to come to?
Musharraf: I would not like to predict but it appears some individuals were involved for personal financial gain.
Amanpour: The U.S. believes that Pakistan has been involved in the transfer of nuclear technology not only to Iran, which you have mentioned, but also to North Korea and Libya. And specifically to Libya the design technology of the centrifuges that were required for enriching uranium.
Musharraf: I wouldn't like to go into details -- we are investigating. But let the world not imagine that it is Pakistan alone which has done that. There is an underworld which is getting uncovered. An underworld of individuals and maybe some organizations and factories involved in the manufacture of refined items. It is a whole list of underworld elements involved. I would like to say there are European countries and individuals involved so let it not be said that there were only Pakistanis involved.
Amanpour: I do no hear you denying the possibility that nuclear transfer, of design technology, could have taken place between Pakistan and Libya.
Musharraf: I am not denying anything because we are investigating. We have sent teams to Libya and Iran, and we are in contact with the IAEA. We are collecting all the data. The investigation within our own organization is taking place. There is nothing that we want to hide. We want to be very clear about it that we will move against anyone who has proliferated. Any individual we will take very stern action against him. What I get concerned about is there is apparently in the media a perception being created that Pakistan is the only culprit around the world and that is not the case.
Amanpour: In your speech to parliament, which was quite spirited perhaps we could say, on Saturday, you said Pakistan has to do a lot to persuade the world of many things -- including the fact that Pakistan is a responsible nuclear power.
Musharraf: The media plays a very important role. They must understand they must be clear that it is not the government it is individuals who will be taken to task. The IAEA should know that there are great custodial controls and everything is under great check and supervision. There are a number of rings of organizations ensuring the safety and security of all the organizations and all the assets that we own. Let me assure you that in Pakistan even the army gets involved. Even a bullet in a rifle cannot be lost and a person will be court martialed if that happens, leave aside any proliferation of strategic assets. I am very sure our strategic assets are under great control and we need to convince the world of it. The Pakistan government is doing its maximum and everything is in safe hands.
Amanpour: You say even a bolt of a rifle cannot go missing without the highest levels of command knowing about it. So how can nuclear technology transfer take place without the highest levels of government or military command knowing about it?
Musharraf: Nuclear technology is in computers, on paper and in the minds of people. The other thing I said earlier is that individuals who are responsible for developing things themselves are involved and there was a covert plan or covert development going on. This possibility did exist in the past, but now they do not, certainly.
Amanpour: How are you going to deal with the fall-out and opposition resulting from this?
Musharraf: There won't be any problem. They understand I have interacted with most of them myself. But there are some vested quarters who have made it a fashion to say everything happens under U.S. pressure. It is nothing of the sort. There is no U.S. pressure. We are cognizant of everything that has happened. There are vested interests who want to undermine my authority, my position, the government's position and cast us in a bad light -- that we are some kind of rubber stamp of the U.S.. This is not the reality. This is a small group who try to do this.
Amanpour: I want to ask you about India which is a great worry and concern to the region and to the rest of the world. Peace negotiations have basically broken down, and yet you have just had a meeting with the PM of India in which you both pledged to restart peace negotiations, particularly over Kashmir. Can you tell us when these meetings will start and at what level of representation?
Musharraf: We have still to take a decision -- negotiations are going on, talks are going on between the two foreign offices. A decision will be taken at that level. The talks have to take place in February because that is what we decided in our joint statement.
Amanpour: Do you think it will be a very high level representation? Leaders such as yourself, or foreign ministers?
Musharraf: I do not think it will be at a summit level, it has to start at a lower level. I do not really know the level but we are talking about it -- it cannot be at the summit level. Amanpour: Do you have any idea by which you might resolve the Kashmir issue?
Musharraf: It is such a contentious issue ... we need to have a step-wise approach. I envisage four steps, and two steps have already been taken. The first step is to start negotiating. The second step is to accept the reality of Kashmir to be resolved. The third is then through a process of elimination to eliminate anything not acceptable to India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir. The fourth step is then go on out of the remaining solutions and select the one that is acceptable to all three -- India, Pakistan and Kashmir. We are not really discussing the solution yet, we have taken the first two steps.
Amanpour: You know the accusations, certainly from the Indian side, is that Pakistan supports the Indian insurgency in Kashmir. Recently you have said that you have to take massive steps to prove to the world that Pakistan is a country that doesn't support extremism. Does this translate to your actions in Kashmir?
Musharraf: There have been accusations and counter accusations. We have been accused of cross-border terrorism -- we call that a freedom struggle. We accuse India of human rights violations and atrocities against civilians. Let us not talk about these. Let us be looking forward and in looking forward we have reached an agreement, a written statement has been issued, we need to move forward in a composite dialogue which will also address the Kashmir issue. I do not want to look back on accusation and counter accusation.
Amanpour: Let me ask you now about Afghanistan, your other big border issue. There have been many accusations, and those of us who have traveled in Afghanistan recently have seen a very alarming resurgence of the Taliban in areas towards the Pakistan border. Not just the president of Afghanistan but leaders in the U.S. are saying your country is not doing enough still to deny those insurgents access from Pakistan into Afghanistan. Has this reached a serious enough level yet for you to really stamp it out as you have pledged to in the past?
Musharraf: These are unfortunate statements by any leader. I don't think any other leader has said that we are not doing enough and we need to do more. It is unfortunate that these statements come from the Afghan leadership. Let me tell you that we analyzed the number of actions that have taken place in the 50-mile belt in Afghanistan from Pakistan, and beyond 50 miles, let me tell you for the record that only 44 percent of the action that takes place in Afghanistan takes place in the 50-mile belt, and 56 percent takes place beyond 50 miles. So if all the operations within the 50-mile belt are taking place from Pakistan, only 44 percent is taking place. This is a terrible thing to be accusing each other. We are fighting the same enemy. We are fighting al Qaeda, the Taliban and the rebels. If we start throwing blame on each other, we weaken our positions ... These al Qaeda operatives are operating on both sides of the border, less in Pakistan, more in Afghanistan. Let there be no Afghan leader to repeat this accusation that everything is happening from Pakistan, that is not the case. Let everyone to stop bad-mouthing Pakistan ... we are one country that has done the maximum against al Qaeda, the world knows it and everyone should know it.
Amanpour: You have just sent your highest representative to Afghanistan -- your prime minister. What is your solution for what is most definitely a resurgence of Taliban activity there?
Musharraf: I do not think there is a resurgence frankly. This is what is being said by the media. But if you go into the detail and maybe ask the Centcom leader, he will tell you something different altogether. There is a misperception in the media which is not the reality ... The operations on our side of the border, our intelligence network is in place and it is improving by the day. A quick reaction force is in place on the ground and is improving by the day in capability. We have moved against a number of targets and have archived a number of successes. Al Qaeda is on the run and they are hiding. They are leaving the area, let me repeat they are leaving that area, because of our operations and this is known by those who are operating on the Afghan side of the border. let the media know the reality on the ground ... the story is different to what is being told by the media. Attacks are on the wane and they are tactical in nature, they are not strategic in nature, there is no strategic threat.
Amanpour: Do you know who was responsible for the two attacks on your life, and what are your prospects for political survival?
Musharraf: Well on the threat to my life, no political party is involved ... but our investigations, and we have rounded up all the people directly involved, but the people who are behind that, yes we are reasonably sure it is al Qaeda or some al Qaeda operatives. We haven't yet got to the top and identified the person who issued the orders, but we know there are linkages that may be the idea came from al Qaeda, but on the other side, who has executed it or whether there is an organization behind that executors or some individual extremists are involved, that is still to be clarified. But I think we have made a lot of success in unearthing them in the process we have unearthed people who are involved in the other terrorist activities within Pakistan so there has been an optimistic outcome to this unfortunate attack.
Amanpour: I want to ask you one final question, on a humanitarian level, and perhaps in journalistic solidarity, it would mean a lot to the management of CNN if you might perhaps make investigations what is happening to a Pakistani journalist who was accompanying to French journalists who were arrested in the Pakistan-Afghan border area, and the family and colleagues of the Pakistani journalist have not heard from him even though the French journalists were released more than a week ago. I wonder if you know anything about it and if you might ask your people to investigate that?
Musharraf: I will certainly do that but I hold him in the poorest of opinion -- a man contriving with the French journalists and trying to concoct a movie showing Pakistan in a bad light, he's a most unpatriotic man and doesn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever because he is trying to bring harm to my country, and he's the most unpatriotic man. They are trying to fabricate a story within Pakistan and purporting it to be Taliban activity from Pakistan in Afghanistan. I have no sympathy for him whatsoever. However, now you have said he, I don't know where he is, I would like to find out where the hell he is.

Iraq raid kills suspect in kidnap-slaying of GIStory Highlights NEW: U.S. warns Iraq contractors that they will lose immunity from Iraqi law in 2009 Al Qaeda in Iraq militant was believed behind kidnapping of U.S. soldier Matt Maupin Slain militant also was suspected in bombing attack on coalition forces, Iraqi officials Reading of proposed U.S.-Iraq security agreement is disrupted again Next Article in World » BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- An Iraqi slain last week in a raid has been positively identified as a militant suspected in the 2004 kidnapping of a U.S. soldier and the June killings of three U.S. Marines, the U.S. military said Thursday. An undated file photograph of Army Staff Sgt. Matt Maupin, who was kidnapped in 2004 and later slain. The U.S. military says Hajji Hammadi, a top-ranking al Qaeda in Iraq militant, was killed in a November 11 operation in Baghdad. The military said Hammadi's terrorist activities included the abduction and slaying of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Matt Maupin. The soldier's remains were found in Iraq earlier this year, nearly four years after he was captured when his fuel convoy was attacked near Baghdad on April 9, 2004. The military maintains Hammadi also was the mastermind of a June 26, 2008, attack on coalition forces and Iraqi government officials at a sheikhs' meeting in the Anbar province town of Karma. An attacker dressed in a police uniform detonated a suicide vest and killed "three U.S. Marines, two interpreters and more than 20 Iraqis, including the mayor of Karma and several other sheikhs. Hammadi escorted the suicide bomber to the location and videotaped the attack." "The removal of Hajji Hammadi from the AQI network is yet another significant blow to the terrorist organization," said Brig. Gen. David Perkins, spokesman for Multi-National Forces-Iraq. "His death and the detention of his associates is bringing the people of Iraq one step closer to a safer, more peaceful Iraq." The military said Hammadi had been affiliated with al Qaeda in Iraq since it began and became al Qaeda in Iraq emir of the Karma and Abu Ghraib areas west of Baghdad in 2004. He is thought to have had connections with the slain al Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and the group's current leaders. Don't Miss Pentagon: Pact timeline calls for U.S. withdrawal by 2011
Along with the Maupin and Karma incidents, Hammadi planned and conducted many attacks against coalition forces, Iraqi police, Iraqi government officials and citizens, the military said. Among those attacks have been assassinations of members of Sons of Iraq, the U.S.-backed Iraqis assisting the government in security tasks. He also led fighters against coalition troops in the second battle of Falluja four years ago. Coalition troops on November 11 were "led to a residence in Baghdad's Mansour neighborhood where Hammadi was believed to be located." Troops took fire as they entered the building and then returned fire, killing Hammadi and another "armed terrorist." "Soldiers then provided life-saving medical treatment to one of the armed suspects injured during the fight. He and four other suspects believed to be associates of Hammadi were detained during the operation," the military said. Hammadi was also known as Hammadi Awdah Abd Farhan and Abd-al-Salam Ahmad Abdallah al-Janabi. Meanwhile, bickering lawmakers Thursday again failed to carry out the second reading of the proposed U.S.-Iraq security pact. Parliament plans to convene Saturday for the second reading of the measure -- which has been delayed the last two days because of protests from the pact's opponents. The second reading of the proposed security agreement began before parliament on Wednesday. Lawmakers from anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's bloc interrupted the session, Kurdish parliament member Mahmoud Othman said. Sadrist lawmakers continued their objections Thursday, with members banging on tables and shouting at each other. Sunni Arab politicians also have expressed concerns about the measure. At the Thursday session, Parliament speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani read a letter from Sunni parliament members saying they will go along with the agreement if their demands are met for releasing those Sunni detainees who have yet to be convicted of crimes. The security agreement, reached after months of negotiations between Iraqi and U.S. representatives, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq would be December 31, 2011. U.S. government contractors in Iraq also will no longer have criminal and civil immunity under the plan. Senior officials from the Pentagon and State Department said they've warned contractors that, starting January 1, 2009, they will be subject to Iraqi criminal and civil law. Currently, U.S. contractors are exempt from Iraqi law. But a section of the Status of Forces Agreement pertaining to Pentagon contractors says "primary jurisdiction falls to the government of Iraq," the senior Defense department official said. The Pentagon employs about 163 contractors in Iraq, plus several thousand more "private security detail" contractors who protect U.S. diplomats and Iraqi officials. The State Department employs about 5,500 contractors in the country. The status of contractors became an explosive issue after a deadly shooting involving guards from the military contractor Blackwater. Iraqi authorities accused the guards of killing 17 people and wounding nearly 30. But Blackwater has repeatedly said its guards were acting "in response to a hostile threat." Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government has approved the pact and sent it to the Council of Representatives for ratification. Lawmakers hoped to debate the bill after the second reading and then vote on the measure Monday, before a scheduled two-week recess. In a rare move, Thursday's session was broadcast live on Iraqi state television. Parliamentary proceedings are usually aired on a delayed feed and censored. The pact would replace a U.N. resolution, which is set to expire at the end of the year, that authorizes the presence of U.S. and allied troops in Iraq. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

'We can't pay you yet,' California to tell creditorsStory Highlights Facing $42 billion deficit, state delaying crucial payments Tax refunds are among payments to be suspended Lawmakers are deadlocked over balancing budget California has been borrowing from special funds, Wall Street Next Article in U.S. » (CNN) -- The check isn't in the mail, and it's not going to be for at least 30 days, California will start telling some of its creditors in February. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a point on the state budget in November. The state, facing a $42 billion deficit, will delay some crucial payments to stay liquid, state Controller John Chiang announced Friday. Among those who will be left waiting for checks are thousands of businesses that provide services and products to the state; more than 1 million aged and disabled Californians who need to pay for rent, utilities or food; and individuals and businesses awaiting tax refunds to the tune of $1.91 billion. That includes taxpayers such as Mildred Copeland, 84, of Toluca Lake, who lives on a fixed income. She raises a teenage grandson on her Social Security checks and a part-time job waiting tables. Making her bills is always a stretch, so she counts on her tax refund every year. "When they need it, they get it, right?" Copeland said of paying her taxes on time. "So why shouldn't we?" Suspending such payments is meant to preserve cash for education, debt service and other payments that are deemed by the state Constitution, federal law or court rulings as having first claim. But those in education are feeling plenty of pain as well. That includes students such as Amber Ramirez, who is a freshman at Los Angeles Valley College. She just learned that her school is cutting 130 classes. At this rate, "it's going to take me 15 years to finish my Ph.D. instead of what I had planned," said Ramirez, who is studying psychology. Because classes are scarcer, she's forced to take one class at 8 a.m. and another at 5 p.m. That kind of schedule makes it hard for her to work even part-time. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to balance the budget. "For months, I have warned state leaders that our cash flow will be in serious danger this spring," Chiang said. "Without corrective action from the governor and legislature, there is no way to make it through February unscathed." The state has blown through its cash reserves as it has spent more than it has taken in. There's been no money in the state's general fund for the past 17 months, so California has been borrowing internally from special funds and from Wall Street. The controller estimates that money will soon be exhausted and that the state will be at least $346 million short in February. "I take this action with great reluctance," Chiang said in a news release. "I know it will put many California families who rightfully expect their state tax refunds in a desperate position. Individuals who already are vulnerable will be hit hard. Small businesses that don't get paid may have to lay off more workers. Rather than helping stimulate the economy, withholding money from Californians will prolong our pain and delay our economic recovery. "Delaying these payments will get us through the next few months, but it will not solve the problem. Only the governor and the legislature have the power to avoid this drastic and painful path." If Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the legislature don't come up with a solution, the controller might have to extend delays in payments or issue IOUs. On January 6, the governor vetoed an $18 billion package proposed by Democrats who pitched it as "a major down payment" toward addressing the state's budget deficit. The proposal didn't meet Schwarzenegger's demands set out in a special session, which limited the General Assembly to working on economic measures before acting on other bills. "Unfortunately, this package is deeply flawed, and, as promised, I vetoed it the moment it landed on my desk," Schwarzenegger said in a letter Tuesday to senior lawmakers. "The measures you sent me punish people with increased taxes but do not make the serious cuts in spending necessary to balance our budget, do nothing to help keep California families working during this recession and do nothing to help Californians facing foreclosure in this mortgage crisis." The Republican governor, who declared a fiscal emergency in December, has butted heads for months with the Democratic majority over alleviating the state's $11.2 billion revenue shortfall. The Legislative Analyst's Office shows the deficit reaching a staggering $28 billion by mid-2010. "This is the only package that has the votes in the legislature," state Assembly Speaker Karen Bass said in a written statement. "I urge the governor to sign the package to solve the cash crisis and settle the other issues as we go." Schwarzenegger was swept into office in 2003 as then-Gov. Gray Davis was recalled by the voters, largely because of a $23.6 billion budget deficit that he projected would grow to more than $34 billion the following year.

Worker falls to his death at Kennedy Space Center, NASA says By Rich Phillips, CNN Space center worker falls to his deathSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: NASA spokesman: "Nothing major, no hazardous operation (was) taking place"Swing-arm engineer was found on another level of launch pad, his employer saysThe contract worker fell while preparing space shuttle Endeavour for its final flightCounseling and assistance are being provided to workers, NASA says (CNN) -- A space shuttle contract worker fell to his death Monday morning while working at the launch pad, preparing the space shuttle Endeavour for its final flight, according to a NASA official. United Space Alliance, the prime contractor for the U.S. space shuttle program, said in a press release that the victim was one of its employees, James Vanover. "He fell at the pad, and NASA emergency medical personnel responded but were unable to revive him," said Kennedy Space Center spokeswoman Candrea Thomas. Vanover was a swing-arm engineer, United Space Alliance spokeswoman Kari Fluegel said. He supported work on the gaseous oxygen vent hood as well as the orbiter access arm, which is the passageway through which astronauts enter the space shuttle. Relatives told CNN affiliate WKMG that Vanover had worked for 30 years at the Kennedy Space Center and had a new job lined up after he was to be laid off, along with many others affiliated with the space shuttle program, in the coming weeks. Fluegel said the man's body was found on another level of Launch Pad 39A at the space hub in northeast Florida. NASA has not indicated what caused him to fall. "The incident is under investigation," Thomas said. "As of right now, all work at the pad has been suspended for the day while we investigate what happened." Allard Beutell, a NASA spokesman, told WKMG that "other than the fact it is a dangerous environment, there was nothing major, no hazardous operation taking place. It wasn't like they were fueling up the shuttle -- it was nothing like that." Counseling and employee assistance are being provided to Kennedy Space Center workers, NASA said. Virginia Barnes, the CEO of the United Space Alliance, offered her "heartfelt sympathy" to Vanover's family. "Our focus right now is on providing support for his families and for his coworkers," she said in a press release. Endeavour is scheduled to blast off on its final mission April 19.

In northeastern Japan, hope dwindles as death toll mounts By the CNN Wire Staff Tsunami survivors lose hopeSTORY HIGHLIGHTSPolice say they fear at least half of the 12,600 missing are deadSurvivors sift through evacuation center and hospital logs as the tally growsMore than 8,900 are confirmed dead after the March 11 earthquake and tsunamiProblems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant spark concern across the countryTune in to "Piers Morgan Tonight" at 9 ET for the latest on Japan's nuclear plant and "Nance Grace" at 8 ET on HLN for more on the rescue effort in Japan as survivors are still emerging. Kamaishi, Japan (CNN) -- Toyoko Numayama walks from town to town, clutching a photograph of her husband and praying someone recognizes him. "Of course, I have to have hope," she says. Missing-persons notices are like wallpaper at the city office in this quake-ravaged coastal town in northeastern Japan. Signs posted show pictures of mothers, grandmothers and husbands. Survivors sift through evacuation center and hospital logs as the government's tally of the missing grows daily. By 9 a.m. Tuesday, officials said they still had not accounted for 12,664 people, and police say they fear at least half of those are dead. Concern over food, water in Japan
Staying calm in the face of disaster
Trace radiation found in spinach
A glimmer of optimism surged Sunday after rescuers found a grandmother and her teenage grandson, who had been trapped for nine days in their Ishinokmaki home. But happy reunions are increasingly rare. Japan's national police say 8,928 people are confirmed dead after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and devastating tsunami March 11 pulverized entire towns, leaving broken wood beams and massive piles of rubble where organized neighborhoods once stood. All the rooms are empty at the Ishinomaki City Hospital. There are no doctors or nurses or patients. Along the cold, dark hallways, half-eaten food remains on trays. Cell phones and shoes are on the floor. A message written with bright orange tape on the hospital's roof says: "SOS." The tsunami sent water rushing into the first floor. Patients panicked, surgeon Dr. Yashuhiko Yamiyama said, and at least two people died in the lobby. Helicopters arrived four days later, lifting doctors and patients strapped to stretchers to safety. But it is impossible to know how many people perished when the waters rushed in, or how many were swept away. Akihito Yamaguchi doesn't know what happened to his 71-year-old father after the tsunami hit Kamaishi. "I held my father above the water, but the force of the tsunami was too strong. I couldn't hold on," he says. Now, Yamaguchi flips through the pages of a soggy photo album from his childhood, pointing at pictures of his parents. He says he won't leave what's left of his house. He thinks his mother may be buried in the rubble of the first floor. Across the country, some 380,000 people are staying at 2,200 shelters, Kyodo News reported. Many of them are frail and elderly. Officials say that in the hardest hit region, 30 percent of the population is over the age of 65. "There are so many of them, particularly in this area," Dr. Takahiko Naruko said. "The number of young people has been falling for years." Emiko Sato sits in a school gym with her 93-year-old grandmother and her 73-year-old father.

Japan
She says both of them need constant medical care that just isn't available. Ever since the tsunami, her grandmother only responds to questions with moans. "It's really difficult, but when I look around this room, it's the same for everybody," she says. Even in parts of the country that were not directly impacted by the quake, concerns are high -- particularly as workers scramble to cool down fuel rods to prevent a full meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Akira Shioi of Kawasaki said he's changed his daily routine so he can keep up with the latest developments, carrying a radio with him 24 hours a day so he can listen to the news. He said he is following closely updates about radioactive contamination in milk and spinach near the plant, but feels confident that the government is monitoring data to protect the population. "I don't feel risk at this moment. ... I think it's under control," he said. Efforts to cool down reactors at the plant saw a setback Monday as officials evacuated workers after gray smoke spewed from the building housing the plant's No. 3 reactor. Japan's nuclear safety agency said it was still investigating what caused the smoke, and that preliminary readings indicated radiation levels had not spiked. A World Health Organization official said Monday that the detection of high levels of radioactivity in certain foods -- and the nation's subsequent clampdown on their sales -- signals the food safety situation is "more serious" than originally thought. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano urged people "to behave and act calmly" even as officials banned the shipping of some products. But some have said the government's announcements do not reassure them. "I'm afraid of the radiation because it's something I can't see," said Maya Nagase of Tokyo. "And we just can't trust the information that we're getting."CNN's Kyung Lah, Gary Tuchman, Anna Coren and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Guinea-Bissau's acting president, prime minister arrested in military coup
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 6:50 PM EDT, Fri April 13, 2012
Residents walk past parliament in Bissau last month. Military forces are in the streets of the capital Friday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Ban Ki-moon and the White House both "strongly" condemn the coup
A military spokesman says the acting president and prime minister are detained and well
He says no one was hurt or killed, despite witness reports of gunfire and explosions
A coup group says that Guinea-Bissau's government signed secret deal with Angola
(CNN) -- Guinea-Bissau's military has arrested acting President Raimundo Pereira and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr., a military spokesman said, in a coup that has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community.
The men were taken into custody Thursday night, as gunfire and explosions rocked the capital of Bissau.
Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the army's chief of staff, told CNN on Friday night that both Pereira and Gomes were well, and that no one had been killed or wounded in the unrest.
He claimed a group that calls itself "the Military Command" was behind the arrests, though it is not clear who its members are. Afterward, according to Naualna, the actual leaders of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces took control of the situation in an attempt to ensure stability.
"The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis," the spokesman said.
Asserting that it has no desire to "stay in power," the military is asking for members of political parties to send it concrete ideas by Sunday on what to do next, Naualna said. A meeting will take place that day to discuss the proposals.
Such political moves have done little to dull the anger expressed Friday by foreign leaders, some of which highlighted the fact the coup occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29.
African Union Chairman Jean Ping issued a statement expressing his group's "total rejection of any attempt at undermining the constitutional order" and demanding the "immediate and unconditional release" of Pereira and Gomes.
U.N. Security Council members issued a joint statement Friday saying they "strongly condemn the forcible seizure of power" and "firmly denounce this incursion by the military into politics," and urged the "immediate release" of the prime minister, president and other senior officials.
Separately, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned "in the strongest possible terms" and pressed the Guinea-Bissau military to "respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law." The White House used similar language, urging "all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process."
On Saturday, the foreign ministers of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, known as CPLP, will meet in Lisbon to assess the situation and take "concerted measures" regarding Guinea-Bissau's situation, that group said.
The Military Command issued its own statement contending that the revolt was in response to a "secret deal" between the governments of Guinea-Bissau and Angola.
This "deal" was drawn up by the Guinea-Bissau government to allow Angolan troops in the country and mandates "Angola to attack Guinea-Bissau's military," a communique from the group said.
This group says that Pereira and Gomes signed the deal, and it accuses the African Union, whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola, of also supporting intervention by Angolan forces.
The Military Command, like the larger military, does not intend to remain in power and wants to "return" the country to normalcy, according to its statement. The group called for calm and for people in the capital "to refrain from acts of violence and vandalism that could jeopardize the order."
Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.6 million people gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The conflicts have ravaged the West African nation's infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world.
The first round of voting in a presidential election was held March in Guinea-Bissau, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness.
The residence of Gomes, the prime minister and a presidential candidate, was looted, witnesses said, as were the homes of some government ministers, including Interior Minister Fernando Gomes.
The country's public media outlets are under the control of the army and are regularly broadcasting statements from the military, witnesses said Friday.
A number of Angolan troops are present in Guinea-Bissau under a bilateral agreement, on a mission to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said.
Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement earlier this week stating its intention to unilaterally withdraw its troops.
The U.S. Embassy in Senegal said the situation in Guinea-Bissau is unclear, but it is closely monitoring events. It urged U.S. citizens to remain where they are and avoid downtown Bissau.
"We are disheartened by the negative turn of events so soon after the first round of Guinea-Bissau's presidential election," it said. "We are deeply concerned about the safety of all those in Bissau today, and urge all parties to put down their weapons and restore legitimate civilian leadership."
Elisabete Azevedo-Harman, a professor of politics at the Catholic University of Portugal and Mozambique who is currently in Bissau, told CNN that she heard gunfire and explosions Thursday night near the prime minister's residence.
Soldiers and police remained on the streets of the capital Friday, but in smaller numbers than the night before, she said. People were starting to venture out again, she added.
Sanha had become president in September 2009, months after the assassination of his predecessor.
Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership.
To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full, five-year term.
CNN's Umaro Djau, David McKenzie, Laura Perez Maestro and Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva contributed to this report.

Little Senegal in the Big Apple: Harlem's West African heart
From Vladimir Duthiers and Adeline Chen, CNN
updated 7:14 AM EST, Tue February 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New York's Harlem is home to a vibrant Senegalese community
Known as Little Senegal, the area is filled with West African restaurants and shops
Civil rights leaders of the 1960s, including Malcolm X, were active in the area
Harlem, New York (CNN) -- At the heart of West Harlem, West Africa is buzzing.
Nestled inside one of the world's most diverse cities, over the years the thriving neighborhood of Harlem has become the hub of New York's African American community.
At the start of the 20th century, throngs of African Americans migrated from the southern United States into the big city, lured by the jobs and opportunities of urban life.
But in the last 30 years or so, another group of people decided to call Harlem home. Scores of immigrants from several francophone West African countries moved to the borough to start a new life. At the center of it all, a vibrant Senegalese community has created a new home away from home, adding their culture, fashion and tastes to Harlem's diverse mix.

Known as Little Senegal, or Le Petit Senegal, the strip of blocks around West 116th Street is packed with inviting restaurants and colorful shops, powerful reminders of life back in the homeland.
"We're the ones who built Harlem," says El Hadji Fey, vice president of the Senegalese Association of America. "When we got here, all the stores you see over here, it was absolutely nothing. We bought a lot of stores here, a lot of Senegalese businesses right here.
"We were scared in the beginning -- you know how Harlem was 20, 30 years ago. We're the ones who really made Harlem grow up. That's why a lot of people call here Little Senegal because we started making the community grow, we started making people grow."
Along this stretch of blocks, the taste of Senegal is everywhere -- from the tantalizing scents of fish and rice stews emanating from the traditional restaurants dotting the neighborhood, through to the lively Malcolm Shabazz Market, where stall vendors hawk their wares, to the numerous Senegalese-named clothes and haircare shops.

At "Africa Kine," which was one of the first Senegalese restaurants to open in Harlem, some two decades ago, homesick customers find comfort in flavors conjuring up memories of home. Others come here looking for fellow countrymen who can make their new city feel less strange.

Waitress Maritou Djigal says that "thiebou dienn," Senegal's national dish made of Jolof rice with fish, is the meal of choice in the Harlem eatery.
"Most of the time they [diners] say 'it reminds me of Senegal, it reminds me of my family,'" she explains.
Not far from Africa Kine, at the Red Rooster restaurant, chef Marcus Samuelson is busy checking orders. Samuelson, known for introducing African spices to Western dishes, is using the continent's culinary traditions to expose Africa to a wider audience.
"I look at Africa as a great source of information and inspiration," says Samuelson. "And that's how I come up with some of the great dishes here," he adds. "Harlem is a very special and unique community and it always reminds me of Africa and I feel the most at home here. I love it, it's a real community."

Although called Little Senegal, landmarks with great historical significance for native Africans and African Americans stretch along the Harlem neighborhood.
Neal Shoemaker, the energetic president of the Harlem Heritage Tours and Cultural Center, says that some of the most famous African American activists calling for civil rights in the mid-1950s and 1960s were active in the area.
"As you walk through this area here, it's like taking a cultural bath," says Shoemaker, who's been leading tours through Little Senegal for over a decade
"Malcolm X's presence is everywhere in this area," he adds, as he walks through the neighborhood. "That corner right there, on 115th street where the housing project exists, where I was born and raised, is one of the corners where he'd minister to the people and he would offer what he felt was the diagnosis to many of the social problems of the area.
"So when you walk through this area here, you're walking in the steps of many great civil rights leaders."

AC Milan legends give Iranian soccer fans a boost
updated 2:33 PM EST, Thu November 28, 2013
Iranian supporters of AC Milan welcome former players of the Italian soccer club for a charity match at Tehran's Azadi stadium. The Milan Glorie team took on a side made up of former Persepolis FC players in the fundraiser, which also celebrated the career of former Iran captain Mehdi Mahdavikia.
The 36-year-old played more than 100 times for his country and spent eight years at German club Hamburg. He is seen (right) here with Gennaro Gattuso, who won the World Cup with Italy in 2006 and the European Champions League twice with Milan. The star-studded Milan side included legendary defender Paolo Maldini, pictured center with teammate Stefano Eranio and Persepolis' Pejman Jamshidi (right). Maldini spent his entire career at Milan before retiring at the age of 41 in 2009.
The 52-year-old Daniele Massaro -- part of Italy's 1982 World Cup-winning squad -- challenges former Iran international Pejman Jamshidi, who has become the subject of a TV show in his home country since retiring.
Dario Simic, who played at three World Cups for Croatia, tries to block a shot by Behnam Abolghasempour -- who has moved into coaching since retiring and is now an assistant at Persepolis. Former Italy defender Pietro Vierchowod played more than 550 games in Serie A, but had only a brief spell at Milan late in his career. The 54-year-old here contests a header with Payan Rafat, who had two spells with Persepolis -- one of Asia's most popular clubs -- before becoming a coach. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Iranian soccer fans welcome AC Milan to Tehran for charity match against Persepolis
The game is part of a collaboration between the two clubs, giants in Europe and Asia
Persepolis hoping to learn from Milan's highly-regarded youth academy
Milan's team of former stars beat their counterparts 3-1 in front of 65,000 crowd (CNN) -- As Iran's relations with the Western world seem to be thawing following a historic U.S. agreement over its nuclear production, sport is also doing its part to bring Tehran in from the cold.
AC Milan, the world's most successful soccer club in terms of trophies won, sent a team stacked full of its former stars to take part in a charity match against counterparts from Persepolis FC.
Thursday's game, watched by 65,000 fans in Persepolis' Azadi Stadium, was won 3-1 by the seven-time European champion.
But as Iran's nuclear deal will help lift some of the economic sanctions that have hurt its growth, this exhibition has bigger meaning for Persepolis and the development of Iranian football.

It is part of a collaboration that began at the end of last year when Persepolis president Mohammad Rouyanian visited Italy to meet with Milan chief executive and V.P. Adriano Galliani.
Milan's website reports that the "Rossoneri" ("black and reds") will be sharing knowledge of the club's successful youth academy with Persepolis -- which is Iran's most successful team and one of the most popular in Asia.
"Mohammad Rouyanian expressed his admiration for the way that the club and its proprietor made Milan the most decorated in the world," the website said. "The desire to create and develop a form of collaboration between the two clubs came naturally.
"Collaboration is already underway that will see the Milan Academy help to export and replicate the Milan Model with Persepolis, which celebrates its 50-year anniversary this year."
Legendary defender Paolo Maldini headed a star-studded Milan lineup at the 100,000-capacity Azadi Stadium for a match that marked the last Persepolis appearance for former Iran captain Mehdi Mahdavikia.
Mahdavikia, 36, retired this year following a distinguished career in which he appeared at two World Cups -- representing his country 111 times in all -- and spent eight seasons with German club Hamburg.
The Milan team also included another of Italy's defensive greats, Franco Baresi, and his fellow World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso.
Its goals came from Daniele Massaro -- part of Italy's 1982 World Cup-winning squad -- Christian Lantignotti and Stefano Eranio, while Alireza Emamifar scored for Persepolis.
"Thank you to @acmilan glorie for coming to Iran and putting a smile on the Iranian AC Milan fans :)" one supporter wrote on Twitter.
