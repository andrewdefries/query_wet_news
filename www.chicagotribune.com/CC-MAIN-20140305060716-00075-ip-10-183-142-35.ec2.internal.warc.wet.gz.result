Like Cubs, Astros building from bottom up
And Minooka's Foltynewicz is key block who could be on fast track with strong start in high Class A
Phil Rogers
On Baseball

Like his bosses, Mike Foltynewicz is a baseball optimist. He can see the Astros rising out of the ashes they find themselves in at the beginning of the Jim Crane era.
"In three or four years, we're going to be a fun team,'' said Foltynewicz, a 21-year-old right-hander with a 97-mph fastball. "We're going to be competing for the World Series, no doubt. We have some awesome talent.''
Shortstop Carlos Correa, first baseman Jonathan Singleton, center fielder George Springer, second baseman Delino DeShields Jr. and outfielder Domingo Santana are decorated prospects. They should form the core of the Astros' team by 2015 or '16, which could have Stanford's Mark Appel or Indiana State's Sean Manaea in a rotation that includes young guns like Foltynewicz and Lance McCullers Jr.
But in the meantime, can rookie manager Bo Porter avoid this becoming the Astros' third consecutive 100-loss season? Only two clubs since 1964 have suffered that badly for that long, and the trio of 100-loss seasons for the Blue Jays in 1977-79 and Royals in 2004-06 would not prove to be springboards to greatness, at least not in Foltynewicz's time frame.
Like Theo Epstein's Cubs, the Astros have a creative, analytical front-office staff committed to the idea of scouting and player development. It is run by second-year general manager Jeff Luhnow, who is coming off a highly successful tenure as the Cardinals' scouting director. According to Baseball America, he drafted 21 players who were on an opening-day roster, the most of anyone.
But unlike the Cubs, the Astros don't have major-market resources. They have lost thousands of season ticket-holders since going to the 2005 World Series at the end of the Jeff Bagwell/Craig Biggio era and entered 2013 with a big league payroll of $21.1 million, which is just a tick more than the $20 million Luhnow says he is authorized to spend in the draft. The Astros pick first, as they did last year, and based on their season-opening series could have the first pick for a third consecutive season in 2014.
Porter, a 40-year-old workaholic who says he took notes off tape on all of the Astros' 162 games from last season after being hired in October, guided the Astros to victory in the Major League Baseball opener last Sunday. But reality set in when Yu Darvish just missed a perfect game in the second tilt against the Rangers.
Alexi Ogando and four relievers struck out 15 Astros in the third game, giving Rangers pitchers 43 strikeouts in the first three games, a record.
"Just a couple of rough games,'' said Carlos Pena, who had six strikeouts in three games.
Or not. The Astros have had a .343 winning percentage the last two seasons, and it won't be surprising to see losses pile up like beer cans at a Robert Earl Keen show as they make the unpopular move from the National League Central to the American League West.
The Rangers, A's and Angels rule the West, and all won 89-plus games last year. And don't forget the seemingly revived Mariners, who went 38-34 down the stretch last year and split a four-game series with the A's to start this season. The Dallas Morning News' Gerry Fraley suggests that placing such an unproven roster in this division will be a case of "the steamroller and the steamrolled.''
Luhnow, a baseball outsider whose business acumen was identi
