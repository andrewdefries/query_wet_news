CHICAGO’S GREEN EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES LEED PLATINUM CERTIFICATION, PAVING THE WAY FOR BUSINESS COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE
By cassy0, Community Contributor

CHICAGO, IL (MAY 10, 2013) – The nation’s largest green business community, Green Exchange, is proud to announce that they have become LEED Platinum Certified, established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI). Green Exchange is located in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood by Baum Development. The building’s 272,000 sustainable square feet is home to businesses that share the same eco-friendly view. Green Exchange is also a proud recipient of the 2013 Outstanding For-Profit Neighborhood Real Estate Project for evolving their historical building into a revitalized, successful business center. USBGC’s LEED green building certification system is the foremost program for the design, construction, and operation of green buildings. LEED certification of Green Exchange was based on a number of green design and construction features that positively impact the project itself and its broader community. Green Exchange achieved this outstanding certification for energy use, lighting, water, and material use, as well as incorporating a variety of other sustainable strategies. By using less energy and water, LEED-certified buildings save money for families, businesses, and taxpayers; reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and contribute to a healthier environment for residents, workers, and the larger community. “It is such a high honor to be recognized by the USGBC and to become LEED-certified,” s

Jeter's ankle could leave Yankees in shackles
If rehabbing shortstop doesn't come back strong, they won't have leg to stand on
Phil Rogers
On Baseball
3:52 PM CST, February 9, 2013

For 17 seasons, Derek Jeter has been the best reason to keep believing in baseball.
His throwback approach has yielded daily excellence in the middle of the Yankees infield. He has kept life simple off the field, and that never seems to be a bad idea. He's heading into the biggest challenge of his career, and even Red Sox fans will have a hard time rooting against him.
Or not.
One of two things is going to happen this season: Jeter proves himself to be a medical marvel, recovering from a broken/trashed ankle at 38 to be a reasonable facsimile of the guy who hit .316 last season or the Yankees unravel around the shell of their captain.
While Yankees talk has revolved around Alex Rodriguez and supporting actors such as Rafael Soriano and Nick Swisher this offseason, the story that matters the most is Jeter's recovery. The Yankees are vulnerable even with Jeter at his best, but if the Yankees have to give Eduardo Nunez or someone else a lot of time at shortstop, they could do something they haven't since 1990 — finish in last place.
That might sound dramatic but it really isn't, not when you consider the stacked nature of the American League East.
The Blue Jays are a popular choice to win a pennant after adding NL Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey along with Jose Reyes, Melky Cabrera, Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle, among others, and the Orioles are coming off a 93-victory season. The Rays traded James Shields but still have a wealth of pitching, and the Red Sox hope strong clubhouse guys such as Ryan Dempster, David Ross, Jonny Gomes and Mike Napoli can get them turned in the right direction.
It wasn't a coincidence that the Yankees had outscored the Orioles and Tigers 20-15 when Jeter played and then got pounded 14-2 after his ankle fractured in the 12th inning of the ALCS opener. The difference wasn't all Jeter, of course. But the Yankees' success starts with him, and no one bears a closer look this spring than Jeter.
Here are some of the other issues I'm eager to explore this spring:
Is Tyler Flowers ready to catch everyday for a contender? The White Sox let A.J. Pierzynski walk after eight seasons, feeling it w

Baltimore Grand Prix has contingency for rain
Race could run to conclusion, be timed or postponed should rain be too heavy
Don Markus, The Baltimore Sun

Officials for the IZOD IndyCar Series and the Baltimore Grand Prix are praying for sunny, dry weather Sunday, but they are prepared to change the format or schedule should heavy rains hit the city.
While Grand Prix CEO and president Jay Davidson said earlier this week that the race would go on in "anything short of another hurricane," it might take less than that for the highly anticipated race to either be shortened or postponed until Monday.
According to the latest forecasts, there is chance of showers and possibly thunderstorms after noon. The chance of precipitation is 30 percent, and while the forecast is for rainful amounts of less than a tenth of an inch, higher amounts are possible in the event of thunderstorms.
Good weather has followed t
