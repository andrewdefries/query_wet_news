Power rankings: No. 6 Tigers
Leyland not afraid to ride workhorse Verlander
Phil Rogers
On Baseball
5:47 PM CST, February 12, 2012

No. 6 Tigers: 25th in a series counting down to spring training. Next: Diamondbacks.
This not just in: Justin Verlander is a stud.
He makes an in-his-prime Richard Gere look like Don Knotts. If he was a guitarist, Eric Clapton would never go on stage with him. If he was an investor, Warren Buffett would call him for advice.
Thanks to the warm-hearted nature of the Baseball Writers Association of America, Verlander enters 2012 as the American League's reigning Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner. He didn't deserve both honors — teammate Miguel Cabrera was at least as responsible for the Tigers' success — but this isn't an argument about the relative value of pitchers and everyday players.
The point here is to point out the one thing that truly separates Detroit's ace from every other pitcher of his generation. He's not just a workhorse. He's a thoroughbred in an era of quarter horses.
With salaries continuing to soar and managers falling in love with their relievers, it has become rare to see someone leave his starting pitcher in for 120 pitches, as Jim Leyland regularly does Verlander.
Former Cubs managers Jim Riggleman, Don Baylor and Dusty Baker leaned heavily on Kerry Wood, and his arm reacted as if it had been abused. The same held true for Mark Prior, whose career was never the same after Baker let him throw 120-plus pitches in five of his last six starts in 2003, when he led the National League with 114 pitches per starts.
Few modern pitchers can tolerate a heavy workload for long. The Rockies' Jim Tracy leaned on Ubaldo Jimenez in 2010 (eight 120-plus starts), and his ERA jumped from 2.88 to 4.68 last season. It's going to be interesting to see how the Angels' Jered Weaver pitches this season. Mike Scioscia
