'American Horror Story' Q&A with Sarah Paulson
The actress talks about her favorite TV shows and how she could have been playing characters at Disney World

Last fall, FX’s "American Horror Story" burst onto the scene as one of television’s best drama miniseries and was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards. This season, co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk flipped the script by changing characters, plotlines and the show’s setting from the “Murder House” to the dank and chilling Briarcliff Manor mental asylum. Over the next few weeks b will post Q&As with cast members of "American Horror Story." So far, we’ve talked with Chloe Sevigny and Evan Peters. This time we caught up with Sarah Paulson. Paulson spoke to b about her favorite TV shows, the differences between theater and TV, and about the possibility she would be playing Cinderella or Snow White if she hadn’t gone to school in New York.Hi Sarah. Thanks for joining me. Now that shooting of “American Horror Story” is wrapped, I’m sure it’s nice not to be stuck in that asylum.Actually, we’re still shooting. We’re on episode 9.Do you watch the show when it’s on TV?Yeah, I do but only during daylight. [Laughs]You’re a big TV fan. What are some of your other favorite shows on television right now?I’m completely obsessed with "Homeland." Claire Danes, Damian Lewis and that cast is great. I get total anxiety when I watch "Homeland."With "Studio 60" and "American Gothic," you were on shows with a lot of promise that didn’t last as long as you would probably like. Is it weird that with "American Horror Story," you might have a show that has a successful tenure on TV, but you may not get to stay because the backstory and characters change every season?For "American Horror Story," whatever you played the time before, the next season it’s something else. "Studio 60" was a great disappointment. I have a feeling if we were on HBO w

NFL managing image, not addressing reality of hard hits

SEATTLE - Do you know what the Gator truck is?
I didn't. Not until this week, anyway, when the NFL's grammar police came calling after Jerry Gray, the Titans' defensive coordinator, made a reference to the vehicle used to cart an injured player off the field.
"You have to say, 'This is my territory between the numbers,'" Gray said, according to The Tennessean. "And if you throw the football, you better bring the Gator truck. And that's how you have to play. You can't play timid in the NFL."
That's the cue to get indignant. How can he say something like that given the concern about concussions and the emphasis on player safety? How can he reference the possibility of injury as a way to make opponents reluctant to throw down the middle?
It's football - that's why he says something like that.
And when the NFL announced it was looking into Gray's statement, it underscored the hypocrisy in the way that the league and the reporters who cover it are approaching injuries.
There was nothing Gray said this week that hasn't been uttered by football coaches for generations. He didn't advocate playing outside the rules in any way. He simply pointed to the possible consequence of throwing the ball down the middle of the field, referencing the kind of hits that coaches have encouraged and players have
