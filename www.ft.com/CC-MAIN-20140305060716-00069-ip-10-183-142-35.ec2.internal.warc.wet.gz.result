Fast Forward
Review by Edward Luce
Fast Forward: Ethics and Politics in the Age of Global Warming, by William Antholis and Strobe Talbott, Brookings Institution Press, $22.95
“Everyone talks about the weather,” Mark Twain observed, “but nobody does anything about it.” The aphorism rings true today in a way the novelist could never have imagined. For almost 20 years, world leaders have gathered at regular intervals to discuss the threat of global warming – with few concrete results.
MoreIN Books We Are Our Brains, by Dick Swaab Small Talk – Nathan Filer ‘The Power of Currencies and Currencies of Power’ – review Jaipur Literature FestivalAs last December’s climate summit demonstrated, talk is much easier than action. Following the summit, the Danish capital quickly went from being “Hopenhagen” to “Brokenhagen”. Hillary Clinton was perhaps being polite when she described it as the “worst meeting I’ve been to since eighth grade student council”. Strobe Talbott and Bill Antholis – head and senior fellow respectively of the Brookings Institution, and former stalwarts of the Clinton administration – prefer to describe Copenhagen as a “useful disappointment”. In their very timely and fast-paced account of where we are today on the politics of global warming, the authors see Copenhagen as having pointed up the futility of relying on the United Nations as the only vehicle through which to tackle climate change. Instead, they argue, the world’s most important powers, particularly the US, China, India and the European Union, should supplement multilateralism with “minilateralism”, since the number of participants is inversely related to the speed of what a process can deliver. But that still leaves a lot of players. And the domestic politics have, if anything, become even less favourable in Washington and Europe since last December. Indeed, as the authors observe, it was fashionable in the midst of last February’s snowstorm in Washington for Republicans to make jokes about the onset of global warming. Jim DeMint, a famously sceptical senator from South Carolina, even built an impromptu igloo on Capitol Hill to highlight the punchline. The book rightly puts last year’s disastrously timed “Climategate” into context. The leak of cynical e-mails from the University of East Anglia’s climate change unit, and the almost simultaneous revelation that there were problems with one portion of the UN’s latest report on climate change exaggerating the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers, were presented by sceptics as proof of the corruption of the whole process. Given the vast weight of research, that was equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack and then declaring there was no hay to be seen. But the fallout combined with the Great Recession to stop the US legislative process in its tracks. In spite of the launch last week of a much diluted Senate bill to cap carbon emissions in the US power sector, the momentum has yet to show much sign of revival. Any Republican who votes in favour of what has already been dubbed an “energy tax” will almost certainly be signing his political death warrant. Yet the authors are unapologetic in making their case that it is effectively now or never – the scientific consensus says 2015 – for the world to begin to reverse emissions growth. “Our forebears had the excuse of ignorance,” they write. “Our descendants will have the excuse of helplessness. We have no excuse.” In the face of such challenges, the reader is often left wondering whether we can possibly live up to what the authors require of us. Likening the threat of climate change to that of nuclear armageddon during the cold war, they point out that the former would “produce death by a thousand cuts” whereas the latter was a blunter “sword of Damocles”. It is far easier to mobilise opinion to tackle a threat that has the power to bring such instant devastation. In contrast, the slightest flurry of snow is taken by sceptics as proof that climate change is a myth. Contrast Mr DeMint’s approach to politics with the revolution the authors say will be needed to bring meaningful action. Improving the process that has stretched from Rio in 1992 to Copenhagen in 2009 will require “nothing less than a revolution in global civics – our understanding of our duties as citizens of the world”, they argue. This must start with the recognition that “Americans are more responsible than anyone else both for causing the problem and for leading the search for a solution”. The bill enacted in the US lower chamber last year stalled partly because the upper chamber believed the cost would be too high for the average American. That burden was estimated at between $80 and $400 a year. The authors have produced a superbly argued call for action. But people only respond to emergencies when they believe they are in one. Right now, most people clearly do not. The writer is the FT’s Washington bureau chief

Leaving Las Vegas a heritage
By Peter Aspden
The city is now old enough to have a history, and it needs to decide what that is
A sign at Las Vegas’s Neon MuseumVegas Vic is a 40-ft, neon-lit sign of a smiling cowboy with a glint in his eye, and a cocky wave at his permanent disposal. He currently stands in the middle of Las Vegas’s rapidly regenerating downtown area but he was born in an altogether different time. In the early 1950s, Vic was employed to advertise the louche charms of the Pioneer Club, one of the city’s most notable dens of pleasure-seeking. His advocacy was not subtle. “Howdy, Podner!” he welcomed tourists, every 15 minutes of every day. During a stay in a nearby hotel in 1966, the thunderously voiced movie star Lee Marvin took exception to Vic’s salute, and asked that it be silenced. (What a conversation that must have been.) The cowboy became mute. In 1991, he stopped waving, too. MoreOn this topic Fertitta boxing clever to export UFC Caesars bets on online gambling market An inside job in Las VegasJohn Gapper Wynn raises the stakesPeter Aspden It’s not junk. It’s history Social network of the damned From Seeger to self, self, self Ralph FiennesVegas Vic also features in one of the most famous postcards of the heady postwar era in which he was created. In the foreground of a luridly coloured illustration, Vic is smiling, smoking, waving. The signs all around him promise delights: Jackpots! Liquor! Free Parking! But in the distance, a still more spectacular attraction catches the eye. Is it a mushroom? Is it a cloud? Why, it’s a mushroom cloud. During the 1950s, Vegas was the “Up and Atom” city, the perfect vantage point from which to view the nuclear tests that took place in nearby Nye County. Vic has history, all right, and he wears his experience proudly. He is the only man in the world, other than Ronnie Wood, who still thinks it fetching to dangle a cigarette from his parched, and possibly radioactive, lips. Vic and his neon buddies are a part of Vegas that the city’s pioneers never dreamt they would need to pay attention to: its heritage. The gambling paradise famously refuses to put clocks on its walls so that hapless visitors will more easily lose track of time, money and their senses. It is earthed in the fleshy joys of the present, and aims relentlessly towards the future, devising ever more ingenious ways of entertaining the feckless part of the human spirit. But its past is catching up with it. Vegas is now old enough to have a history. And it needs to decide what that history is. Vegas Vic is part of it. Many of the flashy signs that once shared the atomically charged skies with the cowboy are today assembled in the “boneyard” of the city’s refreshed Neon Museum, which offers tours of the spent bulbs that are the only remains of bygone glories. It is an unmissable and strangely moving experience. Here is the sign for the New Frontier Hotel, where Elvis first played (and bombed) in Vegas; around the corner there is one for the Jackpot Motel, which should surely have held back some of the pot to help it survive the ravages of forthcoming years. The museum does its best in the way of restoration but, to be perfectly honest, I wish it only limited success. The romance of decrepitude is keenly felt in the archaeological museums of southern Europe and the Middle East. But there is something yet more touching about seeing recent history falling apart before our eyes. It reminds us that everything moves fast these days, even decay. Not far from the neon boneyard is the Mob Museum. Another part of Vegas’s history, the role of organised crime in its expansion, is treated here with something approaching a spirit of camp. “There are two sides to every story,” warns the cover of the programme, just in case you were leaning unequivocally towards the good guys. You can shoot a tommy gun (sound effects only), sit in the courtroom that housed some of the most dramatic congressional hearings of the time, and see the original wall, rebuilt and splashed with blood, against which the St Valentine’s Day massacre took place. I bow to no one in admiration of Vegas’s relentlessly innovative spirit. It is, along with Venice, the world’s most fantastical city, a towering testament to hyper-capitalism and a triumph of the hedonic impulse. But it needed to come to terms with its past. The Rat Pack shenanigans, the shady dealings of past investments: they cast a shadow over the city. The seeking out and presentation of its heritage has been a catharsis for it. It’s easy to invent the future, given the drive, the imagination and the money. What can be much harder for a city is to define its past. That is where culture comes in. It is why each new megalopolis of the 21st century, whether it is in China, or South America or the Middle East, strives so hard to establish its cultural credentials. Tell a good story about your past, and you can move freely into your future. Wave your troubles away, and step into the unknown. You’ll always find a friend to welcome you, with a jaunty “Howdy, Podner!”
