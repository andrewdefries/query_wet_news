Soapbox: The importance of sustainability
By Stuart Hart
In recent years, business schools have embraced the idea of “corporate social responsibility” and “sustainability”. Centres, institutes, programmes and initiatives have sprung up, websites and brochures trumpet business schools’ dedication to serving society, ethics, managing the environment and social entrepreneurship.
A new breed of MBA student is focused on “doing well by doing good”, demanding that more attention be given to the world’s social and environmental challenges. MoreIN Business EducationTerm of the day ‘Dogecoin’Term of the day ‘decoupling’Term of the day ‘Tobin’s q ratio’Term of the day ‘quantum computing’Yet, despite the apparent surge in activity, little has changed within schools. Core courses continue to be organised along conventional functional lines – finance, accounting, marketing, operations, strategy – with little exposure to emerging challenges such as climate change, global poverty or inequity.
Professors pursue narrowly prescribed research agendas with the aim of publishing their work in a small set of academic “A” journals. Careers are made (or broken) based on publication “hits” in these journals, along with recommendations by peer faculty at other universities, rather than the relevance or impact of the ideas in the real world.
The truth is that the apparent “greening” of business schools is a form of “greenwashing”. Even the most highly ranked of such programmes consist of a few dedicated faculty and support staff. Rather than being integrated into the fabric of the business school, sustainability initiatives “hang off the side” of the existing academic edifice. High-profile donors may draw attention to these programmes, yet few have penetrated the entrenched interests of the function-based senior faculty.
All, however, is not lost. Indeed, courses focused on sustainable enterprise and corporate social responsibility are gaining momentum and are among the largest enrolment electives in many business schools. Core courses can rather easily integrate many of these challenges by simply including sustainability challenges as “contexts” for teaching core material. For example, operations can teach life cycle management as part of supply chain management and finance can teach clean technology innovation through the lens of “real options”.
For nearly 20 years, I have been dedicated to developing programmes on “sustainable enterprise” in US business schools. In the early years, sustainability initiatives were little more than small subcultures that were allowed to exist as long as they did not syphon resources away from more “central” (read functional) areas of focus.
In the past several years, however, there has been a noticeable increase in the demand for this content, not only among MBA students, but also from companies themselves. Mainstream companies have made environment and sustainability core to their corporate and competitive strategies. And serving the 4bn poor at the “base of the pyramid” is seen as one of the most important potential drivers of future growth. “Social responsibility” as corporate obligation is giving way to societal problems as “corporate opportunities”.
By framing the world’s social and environmental challenges as new business opportunities, we have succeeded in attracting the “best and the brightest” MBA students. Indeed, at Cornell’s Johnson School
, our Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise has served as a magnet for some of the best prospective MBA students as well as some of the best companies. As the centre’s profile increases, it garners faculty interest. Indeed, professors from the school and across the university are attracted to the intellectual agenda associated with sustainable enterprise (which cuts across conventional disciplinary lines). If we continue on this path, the world’s social and environmental challenges just might become better integrated into the DNA of business schools. Stuart L Hart is SC Johnson Chair in Sustainable Global Enterprise at the Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University.
The Soapbox column is open to professors, students and others interested in the future of business schools.

Designs on a simpler life
By Tyler Brûlé
A new set of awards honours all those who work tirelessly to remove obstacles, enhance routines and get you moving faster
Just when you thought you were safely out of awards season (have you actually met anyone who’s seen Lincoln yet?), along comes another round of recognition for all those people who go that extra mile to help remove the frustrations that somehow manage to damage daily life. That’s right, gentle reader, the Fast Lane is launching “Lids” – or the Life Improving Design Awards. Due to be announced this time next year, the Lids will honour all those companies, designers, governments and policy folk who work tirelessly to remove obstacles, enhance routines and get you moving faster. MoreTyler Brûlé The weekend starts here A world of good service Let them watch snow Business on the runWhile darting around Asia over the past week I drew up a list of categories and potential nominees who might have made the cut, had the awards been up and running this year. Some quick scribbling came up with the following:
Best innovation for keeping up appearances The skincare industry doesn’t make very much money out of me, as I’m not that convinced by the powers of lotions and potions, but I have to admit that the clever folk at Fujifilm are on to something with their Astalift series of preservation products. Smoothest shuttle for getting around town and catching up on lost sleep Toyota’s Alphard or its Vellfire. Most of the time I’ll opt for a Mercedes or BMW to get around New York or Milan, but when in Hong Kong or Tokyo I’ll opt for an Alphard with business class-style reclining seats to grab naps between appointments. Magazine with the mostest While there are plenty of magazines I look forward to every month, the renewed and hugely improved Popeye is the one title for which I count the days until it next thumps down on my desk.
The people who make my morning My days are always better when they can start with a coffee and a brief chat with Blandford’s Café owner Jessica and her famiglia in Marylebone. I’m now trying to find equivalents in my most frequented ports but it’s proving a challenge. Winning weekender Cloudless days at Bagni Fiore. If you’re also of the opinion that deserted beaches are vastly overrated because they lack basic services (a well-stocked bar, tidy toilets, loungers and cabana boys) and usually involve too much sand, then you’re probably an ideal guest for the Bagni Fiore – one bay over from Portofino. Full of leathery old dears who play cards all day in their jewels while puffing away on dainty cigarettes, it’s not everyone’s idea of life on the Med and I’m absolutely fine with that. Looking ahead to the official launch in 2014, I’ve worked up a series of categories built around the challenges most of us face directly or indirectly as we go about our daily drill. In no specific order, some of the key areas where the judging panel will be looking for innovators: Lighting With no end in sight for shocking, hugely unflattering energy-saving lighting (no amount of Fujifilm products will help), the Lids judges will be looking for someone to develop a personal lighting device that will allow individuals to create their own private ambience in the office, on the plane or at dinner. It could be an app that transforms light settings or a bulb that projects its own attractive glow to fight the cold glare of LEDs. Babies on board The Lids committee noted earlier this week that Japan is a much nicer place to move around by foot because parents tend to carry their children rather than push them in supersize buggies. Judges will be looking to award prizes to governments that introduce congestion charges for jumbo-size buggies or bonuses for parents who carry their offspring rather than wheel them about. Brushing up Why is it that so few hotels have toilet brushes in their rooms? Is it a cost thing? Should it be the job of the housekeeping staff to keep bowls clean? We think not. The Lids judging panel will be looking to award a prize to a chain that puts tidy bowls first. Public undress system The French are supposedly trialling a mass X-ray-style system that will be able to scan thousands of commuters/ travellers/concertgoers at once to see who might be carrying potentially lethal material. This is an invention that can’t hit the market soon enough. Power projection The Lids would like to recommend a Nobel nomination for anyone who will design a projector that always works the second that it is switched on and a laptop is connected. As troublesome projectors are among the most stressful hiccups of daily worklife, we might even lobby the new pope for a possible sainthood for said saviour.

Smartphone shipments surpass PCs
By Joseph Menn in San Francisco
Manufacturers shipped more smartphones than personal computers in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to research, crowning mobile devices as the computing platform of choice earlier than many industry-watchers had expected.
Makers of mobile devices distributed a total of 101m smartphones in the last three months of the year, up 87 per cent from the same period a year earlier, according to International Data Corp, the market researcher.
MoreOn this story Operators hoping Nokia will avoid Android Threat of mobile cybercrime on the increaseFTtechhub Kyocera Echo - Twice as nice? Arm Holdings benefits from smartphone boom Google’s Android overtakes Nokia’s SymbianIN Technology Samsung leads European patent list Silicon Valley’s rust belt in doldrums IBM factory workers strike in China Facebook tightens its rules on gun salesIDC had earlier said that PC shipments reached 92m units in the fourth quarter, up less than 3 per cent.
Analysts had expected smartphones to take the lead at some point in 2011, but the transition happened more quickly as a wide range of manufacturers of mobile devices embraced Android, the malleable open-source operating system from Google. “Android continues to gain [market share] by leaps and bounds, helping to drive the smartphone market” said Ramon Llamas, IDC analyst. “It has become the cornerstone of multiple vendors’ smartphone strategies, and has quickly become a challenger to market leader Symbian.”
Android passed Apple’s phone software and Nokia-backed Symbian as the most widely adopted program for smartphones at the end of last year, according to research group Canalys. Because Google’s software is used in devices made by other groups, Nokia, which makes smartphones as well as the Symbian software, is still in the lead in terms of smartphone shipments. The Finnish company’s unit share widened to 28 per cent from 20 per cent in the quarter, IDC said.
Apple’s iPhone, meanwhile, nearly doubled its share from the final quarter of 2009 to 16 per cent in the final quarter of 2010, passing Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, to gain the number two spot.
In revenue and profit terms, Apple does much better per phone, as many Nokia products are less expensive and offer fewer functions.
The market for PCs continues to grow, setting another shipment record in the quarter just ended. But the increases are much smaller than in past years. That is in part due to their higher average price relative to phones and to slower innovation in the segment. The PC market would be higher if IDC included tablet computers in their figures. Apple alone sold about 15m iPad tablets in 2010 and more than 7m in the fourth quarter, which would have brought the PC category close to level with smartphones. Many more companies are introducing tablets this year and their sales are expected to more than double as a whole in 2011.
The growth in smartphones will continue to surge, analysts said, as the high-end models improve and the middle tier gets more affordable. “IDC expects vendors to provide more mid-range and low-end smartphones at lower prices to reach the mass market” this year, said Mr Llamas. “Even high-end devices will become available at lower prices.”Related TopicsGoogle Inc,Apple Inc
