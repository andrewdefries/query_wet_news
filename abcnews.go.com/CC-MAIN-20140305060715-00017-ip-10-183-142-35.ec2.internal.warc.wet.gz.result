Cindy Ord/Getty ImagesVanessa Williams: Through The YearsSuperstar Vanessa Williams and her mother, Helen Williams, co-wrote a candid memoir called "You Have No Idea," in which the "Desperate Housewives" actress claims she was molested at age 10 by an older girl and had an abortion in high school. Shown here is an undated family portrait, with Vanessa, her brother, Chris, mother Helen and father Milton. Courtesy of Vanessa Williams Vanessa Williams: Through The YearsBorn in Tarrytown, N.Y., Vanessa Williams grew up in New Castle, N.Y., and always loved performing dance and piano.

In high school, she smoked marijuana, got pregnant with her boyfriend Bruce Hanson and had an abortion. "I think I was highly sexualized at 10 years old," Williams told "Nightline," referring to the incident. "I knew that it wasn't right, because I wasn't supposed to tell anybody."Courtesy of Vanessa Williams Vanessa Williams: Through The YearsIn college, Vanessa Williams competed in beauty pageants and was crowned Miss America in 1983. She was the first black woman to win the title. The racist backlash she received over her victory was so intense, Williams told "Nightline," that at times sharpshooters were stationed on buildings she was visiting for her protection. She said she also received numerous death threats.AP PhotoVanessa Williams: Through The YearsAfter nude photos of her surfaced in Penthouse magazine, Vanessa Williams announced she was resigning her Miss America title at a news conference July 23, 1984, in New York City. She was 19. "Miss America -- having a beauty queen title negated everything that I had done up into 20 years," Williams told "Nightline." "I regretted being labeled. It's so easy to be put in a box."Yvonne Hemsey/Getty ImagesVanessa Williams: Through The YearsVanessa Williams married her first husband, Ramon Hervey II, in 1987. This photo was taken on their wedding day. Hervey became her manager when she launched her career as a recording artist in 1988, and then later when she starred on Broadway.

Courtesy of Vanessa Williams Vanessa Williams: Through The YearsVanessa Williams was almost cast to play the role of Jane Toussaint in Spike Lee's "School Daze" (1988).

The former musical theater major made her Broadway debut in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" in 1994.

She was cast alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1996 action-thriller "Eraser." Williams wrote in her memoir that auditioning for the role caused more tension between her and then-husband and manager Ramon Hervey. "As my husband, he should have understood. But as my manager, he was furious," she wrote. The couple divorced in 1997.Warner Bros./Kobal CollectionVanessa Williams: Through The YearsVanessa Williams married former NBA basketball star Rick Fox in 1999 and the couple had their daughter, Sasha, in 2000.

Will Neurocardiogenic Syncope (Vasovagal Spells) Ever Go Away After Lifestyle Changes Have Been Made?
November 24, 2008
Sam Asirvatham, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, Mayo Clinic - Rochester, Minn. Question: I have been diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope. I have reduced the frequency of these spells with lifestyle changes, but will they ever go away?
Answer :First, I should congratulate you on the lifestyle changes that you've made to reduce your neurocardiogenic syncope, including hydration, exercise and increasing your salt intake. Doing all of these things would make it much less likely for you to faint from this condition. However, on a particularly stressful day, you may still be at risk for fainting.
For example, if on a day you had extraordinary physical stress -- standing for a long time, emotional upset and a particularly hot or unpleasant day that you were working in -- the stress might be too much on your neurocardiogenic system. That may result in you fainting all the same. It's important for you to recognize when these situations occur, and be doubly careful with all the measures that you've been doing successfully so far.
