'All My Children' Star Susan Lucci on Life, Career

Copy
They told me the play was called Cindy Ellen and it was going to be a variation of the Cinderella story. Okay, maybe that's why I didn't hear about it. Everyone knows that Cinderella is a beautiful blonde. I was a brunette. Sure, all right. That made sense. I was certain that was why I hadn't been approached. When I was growing up, there were no brunette dolls to play with. There were no brunette angels for the Christmas tree and Cinderella was definitely a blonde! I tried to justify all of this in my mind, and yet I still felt very bad. I wanted to cry but I didn't want the other girls to see how terrible I was feeling. My girlfriend and I walked away. I was still fighting back my tears when we ran into Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Smith, our local Girl Scout troop leaders.
"Susan! We've been looking for you." I could see Mrs. Morrison holding what looked to be a script under her arm. "We want you to play Cindy Ellen in our play." It turned out that I was not only going to be in the play, I got the lead! I had no idea how the troop leaders knew that I wanted to be an actress more than anything else in the world, but I sure was glad they sought me out and that they thought I could do it. It was a wonderful turnaround to go from thinking I had been overlooked to being cast as the lead. I was absolutely thrilled because this was going to be my first legitimate stage appearance.
It was right around this same time that my mother handed me my very first copy of Seventeen magazine and my whole world changed forever.
"I think you will like this," she said.
And she was right; I did.
I believe the day she gave me that magazine, my mother was encouraging me to pursue my dream. The girls within the pages were all beautiful teenagers with such nice hair. I was mesmerized by all the posing and grown-up fashion. I began fantasizing about becoming one of the models I saw on the page. The only problem was, I was very petite and my hair, which is naturally curly, didn't look a thing like their perfectly straight and shiny watching my mother take very good care of her skin and her health, which was a practice she passed on to me as well. The magazine was full of articles that helped me understand how important all of those things were, especially for a young girl. That was the day I realized there was a whole wide world out there to be discovered and it was mine for the taking.
When I was sixteen years old, I entered a competition to become an exchange student. It was sponsored by my high school and our local community. There was a required essay and several interviews involved in the selection process to become a student ambassador living abroad for the summer. After giving it some thought, I decided to focus on the program that was called Experiment in International Living. The program took place over three months during the summer between my junior and senior years of high school. It turned out that I was one of four kids selected from our community to participate. France and Sweden were my first two choices because I wanted to experience living in a place that I had natural ties to. Unfortunately, I didn't get either of those locations, and I was ultimately placed with a Norwegian family.

An Easier Way to Detect Breast Cancer in Young Women
July 13, 2006 By ANDREA CARTER and BHARATHI RADHAKRISHNAN, ABC News Medical Unit When she was 39, Christina Koenig, a single mother, noticed a lump in her breast and went to the doctor.
A mammography didn't show anything, but a biopsy of the lump revealed Koenig had breast cancer.
"It was like, oh my god, I can't believe this didn't show up," said Koenig, a Chicago resident who, five years later, is in remission. "I guess it's just not a perfect science. I was surprised but did not question it."
Koenig falls into a group of women who don't benefit as much from traditional film mammography as others: Women who are either under 50, have not gone through menopause, or tend to have lumpy or dense breasts.
A 2005 study done by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network showed that digital mammography diagnosed 28 percent more cancers in women under 50 with dense breasts, making digital mammography a better option for them. But current digital systems are sometimes too expensive for many hospitals and imaging centers.
Until now. Radiologists hope that the Food and Drug Administration's approval of a new, cheaper digital system will allow more women to benefit from this newer technology.
The Fuji Computer Radiology for Mammography is not the first digital system approved by the FDA, but at half the price of other digital-screening machines, it is more cost effective, and its design works better.
"Ever since we got these results, radiologists have wanted to go digital," said Dr. Etta D. Pisano, director of University of North Carolina Biomedical Research Imaging Center and the lead researcher on the 2005 study. "The Fuji system makes a difference. Because it is cheaper ... you won't need to do a forklift upgrade."
The Fuji system replaces film cassettes with film plates that receive the X-ray data. The processor then uses a laser to read the information on the plate and turns it into a digital signal.
"This will change the face of the mammography business," said Gerald Durney, administrative director of Radiology at the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, which will receive the Fuji system in late summer.
Digital technology has been used for other types of X-rays, like hand X-rays or CAT scans, since the early 1990s. Breast imaging fell behind because it requires higher resolutions, which earlier digital technology could not provide.
The technology will allow rural areas to benefit from radiologists in more specialized and centralized locations, said Cathy Fischer, administrative director of the Norman J. Vinger Center for Breast Care at Gundersen Lutheran in La Crosse, Wis.
For example, Gundersen Lutheran plans to install a Fuji system in a facility in Decorah, Iowa, which is 100 miles from La Crosse. Images can be sent electronically from Iowa to be read by expert radiologists.
The system can also read other digital X-rays, which makes it more cost effective.
"I could take a chest X-ray and bring it to this same system, and it would turn out a good chest image," Durney said. "This is key for smaller hospitals."
Doctors caution, however, that the technology is only as good as its user.
"It is still more important who is interpreting the mammography than whether it is done on film screen or digital," said Dr. James Brenner, chief of breast imaging at the University of California at San Francisco and president of the Society of Breast Imaging.
Pisano also warns that women should not delay or avoid getting a mammogram just because it is not digital.
"By waiting a year something could be missed," she said.
Cancer survivor Koenig appreciates the option this new technology brings. She is now the director of communications at Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, which provides support to those with breast cancer.
"Now, I am still kind of young at age 44, and I would like to be able to have the piece of mind of having a kind of test that maybe is more accurate," said Koenig. "When I have my next oncologist appointment, I am going to ask about it."
A statement from Fuji provided by public relations spokesperson Maureen O'Connell states: "In our assessment, we expect to see a doubling of the current market penetration of digital mammography equipment in the U.S. over the next year now that we introduced this technology."

Attorneys on both sides got their last chances to speak to jurors today in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael Jackson's doctor. After a day of impassioned closing arguments and juror instructions, they turned over the case to the jury who will begin deliberations Friday morning.
The prosecution spoke first and last, with the defense delivering closing arguments in between.
Earlier today, prosecutor David Walgren argued his case with a PowerPoint presentation in which he denounced Murray as a selfish and reckless physician who put his own needs ahead of Jackson's and Jackson's children's.
"The evidence in this case is overwhelmingly, abundantly clear that Conrad Murray acted with criminal negligence, that Conrad Murray caused the death of Michael Jackson, that Conrad Murray left Prince, Paris and Blanket without a father," Walgren said.
Later, defense attorney Edward Chernoff accused the prosecution's key witness, security guard Alberto Alvarez, of lying in order to tell his story.
"Do you honestly believe when you go home to your families that Alberto isn't going to cash in? Honestly?" Chernoff asked.
Alvarez called 911 as Murray tried to receive Jackson and later told police that Murray told him to stash various medicine bottles and a saline bag with a bottle of propofol inside of it.
The prosecution alleged it was evidence Murray knew he was in the wrong and tried to cover up his actions -- but the defense had a different take.
"He tells you it's been so hard, and then you learn Alberto has been offered $500,000 for his story. How did Alberto Alvarez go from a story that's worth $9,000 to a story worth half a million dollars?" Chernoff asked. "His story became monumentally more compelling."
Chernoff further tried to discount Alvarez by saying that his fingerprints were never found on the saline bag that he allegedly stashed and that the list of actions he claimed he performed -- including getting Jackson's children out of the room and following Murray's orders to stash the objects -- would have had to been done in about 30 seconds, according to phone records.
"He said, 'I'm efficient.' It's not efficient," Chernoff said. "It's impossible, because he didn't tell the truth."
When prosecutor Walgren got the chance to rebut the defense assertions, he said, "Alberto Alvarez has no position in this case. This has been nothing but a nightmare for him. He told you the truth."
Walgren added that the fact that Alvarez's fingerprints were not on the saline bag does not discount his testimony. He told jurors that fingerprints are not often found -- pointing out that Jackson's fingerprints were not found on the syringe that the defense alleged he used to self-administer the fatal dose of propofol.
Chernoff said Murray was "painted as a villain for everything he does" by the prosecution.
"They want you to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson," he said. "They just won't tell you that."
"His greatest personality defect is his greatest character strength: He got brought into this situation because he thought he could help," Chernoff said. "He was wrong -- because Dr. Murray had no control over this situation. He was just a little fish in a big, dirty pond."
Chernoff argued that Murray truly cared about his patients, as shown by former patients who served as character witnesses, and painted Murray as a caring, devoted doctor.
"You may think Dr. Murray is a sinner. You may think Dr. Murray is a saint," Chernoff said. "Whatever you think about him, if all he cared about was Michael Jackson and the safety of Michael Jackson, the very first thing he's going to do when he finds him not breathing and potentially dead ... is try to revive him."

Hunter Rescues Deer Trapped in a Lake
When a hunter in Minnesota heard that a deer was trapped in an icy lake, he sprang into action not with his rifle but with his canoe. He cracked the ice with his paddle and hauled the doe into his boat. The deer seemed to understand the hunter was a friend, not a foe. The deer sat motionless, calmly looking toward land the whole time as the hunter told her, “Bambi, I’m just trying to help.” When the two reached land, the deer scampered off back into the woods.
