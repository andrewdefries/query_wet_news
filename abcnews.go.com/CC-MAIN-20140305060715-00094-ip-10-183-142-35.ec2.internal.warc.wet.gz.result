See More Singer susan boil, the shy woman who stunned the world with her soaring voice, tonight revealing that she's been diagnosed with asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, that she struggled with her entire life, but never knew it until now. Here's abc's reena ninan. Reporter: She was the woman with the voice. &#9834; I dreamed of dream of time gone by &#9834; &#9834; I dream of our life together &#9834; Reporter: No one saw coming. Quirky and shy, but susan boyle has become a singing sensation, selling 14 million records around the world. And today, for the first time, revealing her doctor diagnosed her with asperger's syndrome. A mild form of autism. In an interview with "the observ observer," boyle says she was told as a child that she suffered brain damage when she did not receive enough oxygen at birth. But she always thought it was something more. Those suspicions now confirmed by the asperger's diagnosis she received last year, saying, quote, now I have a clearer understanding of what's wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself. Somebody who does have asperger's syndrome likely has social awkwardness, perhaps some quirkiness, social anxiety. Reporter: And more adults are being diagnosed. The 52-year-old singer just releasing her fifth studio album, hopes people will have more compassion for her. The singer saying, quote, i think people will treat me better because they will have a much greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do. And susan boyle is doing very well. There's buzz that meryl streep may play her, david, in a movie about her life. So much awareness because of her. Reena, thank you.
