When Pregnancy and Eating Disorders Mix
March 22, 2011

When a mother has an unhealthy relationship with food, it is easier for the child to pick up the same habits. "Parents can deactivate an eating disorder or make it more apparent," says Dr. Aisenberg, who has witnessed the disastrous cycle: a child adopts the mother's anxiety and obsessive behaviors.
Anorexia can worsen during pregnancy and postpartum for many women. "Pregorexia" has become a popular way to describe pregnant women suffering with anorexia. It is not a clinical term, but does illustrate the devastating merger of pregnancy and anorexia.
For Kate Wicker, giving birth to her first child made it easier to cope with her eating disorder, but only after she had suffered with anorexia during her pregnancy. Raised in Snellville, Ga., Wicker developed anorexia and a purging disorder in college. While she was treated in college and gained more stability after she graduated, she struggled during her first pregnancy and felt a loss of control with her weight.
"When I was really sick and weighed myself four to five times a day," Wicker says, "I put so much energy into fighting my own flesh that I could have spent that time solving world hunger."
As a new mother, she gained a whole new respect for her body. Worrying about the health of her three young girls has helped her become more comfortable with food. Although she does not consider herself fully recovered, she is able to recognize her weaknesses and handle them. "It's like a pebble in your shoe," Wicker says about her eating disorder. "It's always there, but you get better at being able to walk with that pebble there and not letting it control everything."
Struggling With a Changing Self Image
As a public relations manager at an Internet advertising agency in Kalamazoo, Melissa normally wears trendy outfits to work. But lately she's been forced to turn her hip wardrobe into a maternity one. At least the maternity clothes are comfortable, and The Bella Band, a nylon and spandex belt attached to her pre-pregnancy pants, has helped her keep some of the clothes she likes (except the Joe's jeans) in her fashion rotation.
By four months in, some of her pre-pregnancy tops began accentuating her protruding stomach. "People can see now, that I'm pregnant," Melissa says, "I like that."
Still, Melissa's feet have become so sore that she cannot wear her beloved high heels or wedges. The added weight of the baby reshapes her body from head to toe. Even at her heaviest, she had a defined waist and fairly flat stomach. Now, the extra pounds have eliminated all the definition in her stomach.
"This is brand-new territory for me," she says, "it also means my clothes aren't fitting right and prepared for it as I was, that has been a bit difficult for me to grasp." Her chest has also grown, but the added cup-size is something Melissa would gladly hold on to after the pregnancy. "I have boobs!" she wrote on her blog recently. "For the first time in my adult life, I have a chest and some cleavage."
Melissa still keeps track of everything she eats. When she was following the Weight Watchers program, it was about tracking the number of points. Now that she is pregnant, she is trying to be more conscious of what nutrients she needs every day. She records everything at MyDailyPlate.com, which gives her the nutritional breakdown of foods in addition to the number of calories.

Jimmy... See More Tonight a "feed frenzy" for the record after kanye west placed himself at the top of the music hierarchy in a bbc radio one interview. We the real rock stars and I'm the biggest of all of them. Jimmy kimmel responded showing us what those words sound like coming from a far smaller individual. We the rock stars. And I'm the biggest of all of them. Kanye not amused with jimmy's spoof. After all according to kanye that interview was the first piece of honest media in years. Followed was a kanye kimmel social media battle. Finally I am in a rap feud. One that turned vicious. Many tweets too graphic for television. "The new york times" set the record straight on mario luigi from the super mario brothers games. In an obituary for the president, the times misstated the duo's all important professions. Quote, the brothers mario and luigi who appear in this and nintendo games are plumbers not janitors. Oh, no. And a record breaker threw his final pitch at yankees stadium last night. When mariano rivera was taken out not by the manager, his long time teammates. He lost it. We have seen a lot of athletes come and go over the years but this one left many in tears.

'This Week' Transcript: Former Vice President Dick Cheney
Feb. 14, 2010 Page 6 of 9
We never clearly or totally resolved those issues. These are tough questions, no doubt about it. You want my opinion, my view of what ought to happen, I think we have to treat it as a -- as a war. This is a strategic threat to the United States. I think that's why we were successful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack against the United States.
And I do get very nervous and very upset when that's the dominant approach, as it was sometimes in the Bush administration or certainly would appear to be at times in the new Obama administration.
KARL: Did you more often win or lose those battles, especially as you got to the second term?
CHENEY: Well, I suppose it depends on which battle you're talking about. I won some; I lost some. I can't...
(CROSSTALK)
KARL: ... waterboarding, clearly, what was your...
CHENEY: I was a big supporter of waterboarding. I was a big supporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques that...
KARL: And you opposed the administration's actions of doing away with waterboarding?
CHENEY: Yes.
KARL: I'd like to ask you about the big terror case now, which is the KSM trial. The administration very much wants to see the mastermind of 9/11 tried in civilian courts here in the United States. New York has obviously objected.
Do you think that's going to happen? Do you think this will be a civilian trial? Or are they not going to be able to do it?
CHENEY: It looks to me like they're going to have great difficulty doing it in New York. I mean, even the mayor's come out against it now. I think trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York's a big -- big mistake. It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his -- his particular brand of propaganda around the world.
I think he ought to be at Guantanamo. I think he ought to be tried at Guantanamo in front of a military commission. They've got difficulties now, because my guess is they don't want to send him back to Guantanamo, because that would validate, if you will, the value of Guantanamo. They're trying to close it, clearly haven't been able to get it done.
But my guess is, in the end, he'll end up being tried in front of a military commission on a military facility some place.
KARL: So you think Guantanamo will be open when this president leaves office?
CHENEY: I wouldn't be surprised. It's a valuable facility. There's a reason why we set it up. It makes good sense. There's obviously great reluctance on Capitol Hill to appropriate the funds to close it down. I think -- I think Guantanamo is going to be there for quite a while.
KARL: And one other point -- I just want to read also from a previous interview that you gave -- one of your points about Guantanamo is, if you release the hard-core Al Qaida terrorists, you said, that are held at Guantanamo, I think they go back into the business of trying to kill more Americans and mount further mass casualty attacks. If you turn them loose and they go kill more Americans, who's responsible for that?
And it's a real concern. We've heard from the president's homeland security adviser, John Brennan, saying that at minimum 10 percent of the more than 500 that have been released from Guantanamo have gone back into the fight.
But Brennan also wrote this. He said, "I want to underscore the fact that all of these cases relate to detainees released during the previous administration and under the prior detainee review process."
