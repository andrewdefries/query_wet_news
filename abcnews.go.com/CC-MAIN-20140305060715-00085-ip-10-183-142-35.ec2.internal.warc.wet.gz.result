Today's French Open winner Roger Federer was stunned when a man ran onto the Roland Garros tennis court in Paris and tried to place a red hat on his head.
Unphased by the on-court intruder, Federer defeated surprise finalist Robin Soderling of Sweden 6-1, 7-6 (1), 6-4 on to complete a career Grand Slam and win his 14th major title.
"It's maybe my greatest victory, or certainly the one that removes the most pressure off my shoulders," Federer said. "I think that now and until the end of my career, I can really play with my mind at peace, and no longer hear that I've never won Roland Garros."

The Swiss tennis star pushed the intruder aside as the man danced in front of the crowds waving a Barcelona soccer team flag.
The man, who claimed to be a Federer fan, eluded attempts by security guards to subdue him and jumped over the net. A security guard from Soderling's side of the court then ran out and tackled him, and three other guards carried the man off the court.
Intrusions have happened at Grand Slam finals before, at Roland Garros and elsewhere, but what made this episode frightening was that the man actually touched Federer.
Police are holding the intruder for questioning and say he could be charged with illegally entering a sports stadium.
After the man was taken away, a security guard approached Federer to check if he was all right.

The breach of security was reminiscent of the 1993 stabbing of Yugoslavia-born tennis star Monica Seles in full view of a 6,000-strong crowd in Germany.
The No. 1 woman's tennis player at the time, Seles was stabbed in the back with a five-inch knife during a quarter-final match in Hamburg during a rest break in the match against Bulgarian player Maggie Maleeva.
At first, authorities speculated that the attack was politically motivated because of Seles' Serbian roots and previous death threats during the Yugoslav conflict.
Eventually, 39-year-old Gunter Parche, an unemployed lathe operator, was arrested. At the time, he was described as a loner who was obsessed with German tennis star Steffi Graf. He was deemed mentally ill and sentenced to two years in jail.

Doctors rushed the 19-year-old star was rushed to hospital with a half-inch wound in her upper back. The injuries were non-life threatening.
Seles was never able to make a career comeback and said publicly she would never feel safe again on the court.
Later, at the 2001 Hopman Cup in Perth, Australia, Seles was spooked when she was tapped on the back and asked for an autograph while sitting court side in the stands.
During a 2003 news conference in Miami, Seles said, "I don't feel it's sufficient, in a lot of ways. Our accessibility to people, [they can] get to us on site, in matches, after matches, and not just me. I think it's any of the high-profile players."
Seles played her last professional match the same year at the French Open and officially retired in February 2008.
Serena Williams Hires Bodyguard
A decade after the Seles' 1993 stabbing, tennis star Serena Williams hired a bodyguard to protect her because of persistent threats from a German stalker. He was apprehended in 2003 at Wimbledon in England and in New York.
In 2002, top player Martina Hingis testified against a stalker who was sentenced to two years in a Florida jail.
Security breaches don't just happen on the tennis court.

Gates: More Troops to Afghanistan

ABC News’ Luis Martinez, Richard Coolidge and Martha Raddatz Report: Traveling in Afghanistan, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he hopes to send an additional two combat brigades — or 7,000 troops — to that country by next summer. Gates met with the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan today and received an update of U.S. operations there.
In a press conference with reporters, Gates reaffirmed his commitment to get more U.S. troops into Afghanistan, stating, "We are hopeful that we will be able to send an additional two Brigade Combat Teams by late spring." A Brigade Combat Team consists of about 3,500 troops. The United States has 31,000 troops in Afghanistan and NATO has 34,000. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan has asked the Pentagon to send him an additional 20,000 troops — or four combat brigades and their support troops – to improve the security situation in that country in the wake of a resurgent Taliban insurgency. In the meeting, McKiernan also told Gates that the amount of money needed to equip and train the Afghan army, crucial to the U.S. strategy, was "not cheap."
"We’re going to try and get two additional brigade combat teams, in response to his request, into Afghanistan by summertime," Gates told reporters traveling with him. The initial brigade, separate from the two additional ones Gates mentioned, is due to arrive in Afghanistan in January. The 3rd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Divison will set up its base near Kabul, and will deploy its troops near the capital, which until recently has been relatively secure — a sign of how badly the security situation has deteriorated. In parts south of Kabul, the Taliban has taken advantage of a lack of western troops to mount attacks on the capital and surrounding area. Gates said he had not yet signed off on orders to deploy the next two brigades. Sending more troops to Afghanistan still remains dependent on additional drawdowns from Iraq which, though expected, have so far not been indicated by Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. Responding to questions about the length of the mission, Gates explained, "This is a long fight, and I think we’re in it until we are successful," later adding, "I do believe that there will be a requirement for sustained commitment here for some protracted period of time. How many years that is and how many troops that is I think nobody knows at this point."
He also held a town-hall meeting with almost 300 servicemen and told them that the "size and scope" of the mission are going to change in the next few months, detailing that the military is expanding its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in the country.
He affirmed the importance of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, recalling that the same people responsible for 9/11 were still plotting attacks against the U.S. from the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, declaring, "We can succeed, we must succeed, we will succeed."
In late September, Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it would not be until the spring or summer of 2009 that additional troops would become available to meet the request for additional brigades in Afghanistan.	Email
