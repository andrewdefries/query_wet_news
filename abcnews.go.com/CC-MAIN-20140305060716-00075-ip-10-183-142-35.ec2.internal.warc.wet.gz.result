And the leader of the catholic church didn't mind a bit. In fact, he encouraged him to stay right there. Take a look. The occasion was the meeting of the families. Held at the vatican this weekend. Pope francis was about to begin his speech, when a small boy wandered across the stage, coming right up to the pope. What happens next can only be described as something resembling a personal papal play date. Pope francis pats his head and smiles in delight. The boy continues to engage the pope in quiet conversation. Kissing the papal cross. He lifts his ring and points to something in st. Peters square. The boy resists the efforts of a vatican official. And for 20 minutes, stays at the pontiff's side. At times, acting like a host. Watch as he leads a young girl up to meet the pope. Hugging the pontiff's leg. And taking a rest in the papal chair. This photo posted on instagram. We've since learned he is a 6-year-old orphan from colombia. Given the pseudonym carlos to protect his privacy. He was adopted less than a year ago, by an italian family. His parents say none of this was planned. Carlos did it on his own. His mom sending out a message via social media saying, the blessing our son receives goes out to all the abandoned children in this world. Just another display of the pope and his kindness. I love that little boy. Little carlos. Thanks for bringing that to us, lara. Now, we have the good. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Person of the Week: Norman Hatch
The Battle for the island of Tarawa was one of the first American victories in the Pacific in World War II. It was also one of the war's fiercest and bloodiest battles.
On the front lines with the troops was U.S. Marine Staff Sgt. Norman Hatch. But instead of shooting a rifle, Hatch was shooting film.
"The film shot on Tarawa was a first because it showed what combat was really like," Hatch said. "It shows it up close and dirty."
