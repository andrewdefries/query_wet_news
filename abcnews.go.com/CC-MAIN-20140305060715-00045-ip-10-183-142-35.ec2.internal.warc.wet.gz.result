Former Navy SEAL on US Military's Top Secret Unit Coming Out of the Shadows - ABC News
X	Former SEAL on Coming Out of Shadows
By JOHN DONVAN (@johndonvan) Feb 19, 2013, 3:29 PM
It used to be that Navy SEALs didn't just operate in the shadows. They trained in them too. Their whole story stayed shrouded in mystery. Their secret missions stayed secret to the rest of us.
But when they got Osama Bin Laden, snatched back an American cargo ship taken by pirates and rescued two air workers held hostage in Somalia, then suddenly, it seemed that SEALs were headline-makers.
Add to that some SEALs wrote books about SEAL adventures and even acted in a movie about the SEAL experience using live ammunition when they made "Act of Valor." They can't quite be called "the military unit that no one ever talked about" any longer.
Rorke Denver played Lt. Commander Rorke in "Act of Valor," a film that used dozens of SEALs and went on to gross $80 million at the box office. Now, with the help of a writer, Denver is doing some pretty decent storytelling in a new book, "Damn Few: Making the Modern SEAL Warrior."
He agrees that with SEALs like him telling their stories that these guys are out in the open like never before.
"We are, at this moment in our history, when the heat is on, the missions are getting press and coverage," Denver said.
When asked if it was a good thing, he said, "time will tell."
"We are in the public eye and I think that mythology is something that people are hugely, hugely interested in and they have an appetite for it," Denver said. "So for us with the movie and then also with 'Damn Few' I had an opportunity, I feel, to authentically represent and hopefully do it from an honorable point of view and accurately do so."
It's mostly his own story Denver tells in "Damn Few," how he joined the SEALs
