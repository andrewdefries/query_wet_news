Dehorning: 'Standard Practice' on Dairy Farms
Jan. 28, 2010 By ANNA SCHECTER and DREW SANDHOLM A farm hand burns off the horns of a cow, one of the practices that animal rights activists describe as inhumane abuse. ABC News
According to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than nine out of ten dairy farms practice dehorning, meaning the farmers cut or burn the horns off of cows. But while there is serious pressure to end the controversial practice of tail docking, in which farmers remove the ends of cows' tails, there is no sign of similar momentum to stop dehorning.
null
Lyndon Odell, CEO of Willet Dairy, one of New York state's largest dairies, said dehorning is a "standard practice in agriculture" and done to protect both the animals and dairy employees. "Part of the issue with this is cow injury," said Odell, "and also safety for the employees. If you have an animal running around with a sharp horn, they can gore other animals that are in the same group with them or they can injure an employee that's working with the animals."
The video to the left shows the process of dehorning. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.
The procedure, which usually involves burning the horns off with a hot iron, most of the time without anesthesia, has been condemned by animal rights advocates as cruel.
null
Nathan Runkle, director of Mercy for Animals, which provided the undercover footage seen in the video above, says the images show distress. Said Runkle, "You can tell from the footage that these animals are in excruciating pain in the way that they bellow and try to escape this painful procedure."
Runkle also claimed that the animals shown being dehorned in the Mercy for Animals footage were too old for the process. Dehorning of younger animals involves less pain and the removal of less material.
Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, a consultant to the livestock industry and an expert in designing humane livestock handling methods, says that horns need to come off because they're sharp, but that anesthesia is essential.
"Dehorning hurts," said Grandin. "It's a lot of stress and we should be giving them a lot of anesthetics. The research is clear. The dehorning is the single most painful thing we do."
USDA: Most Dairy Farmers Dehorn Cattle
Grandin also said that dehorning should be done when animals are young.
A 2007 USDA report showed that 94 percent of dairy farms dehorned cattle, down slightly from 1996, when the number was almost 99 percent. The report suggested the drop might be due to the fact that more mid-sized operations have the dehorning of calves done off-site.
The report also showed that hot irons had become a more popular dehorning method during the same period. Sixty-four percent of dairy operations that dehorned cattle used hot irons in 2007, compared to 40 percent 11 years earlier. Fewer than 20 percent of dairy operations that dehorned cattle used analgesics or anesthesia during the process.
Paul Shapiro, senior director of the Factory Farming Campaign at the Humane Society of the U.S., said that though his organization disapproves of dehorning, with or without anesthesia, there is no significant, organized political opposition to the practice.
"Success requires focus," said Shapiro. "There is an endless list of cruelty that farm animals are subjected to and the animal rights groups have tried to put a laser focus on a few issues."
"The confinement of animals, detailing, force-feeding for foie gras are really the three main issues that have surrounded the public policy debate for animal welfare," said Shapiro. "Dehorning hasn't been one of them."

Italian Prosecutors Seek Murder Charges Against Knox

Prosecutors in Perugia, Italy, today requested murder indictments for American college student Amanda Knox and two others in the gruesome slaying of Knox's British roommate, Meredith Kercher.
Knox, a 21-year-old University of Washington student, has been held for the past eight months in a maximum security Italian prison after the bloody November 2007 death of Kercher in the home the two girls shared while studying in Italy.
Prosecutors also requested murder indictments against Knox's Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, and Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Hermann Guede.
Now that the indictments have been requested, a preliminary hearing date will be set and is expected to be held in mid-September. The hearing will be held in front of judge Paolo Micheli, who will decide whether adequate evidence exists to have the suspects stand trial. Micheli is the fourth judge to rule on this case.
If the case goes to trial, it will likely begin before the end of the year.
All three suspects have denied having a hand in Kercher's death.
Birthday Behind Bars
Today's news ends a week in which Knox celebrated her milestone 21st birthday Wednesday behind bars in the Italian prison.
Sollecito and Guede have also been detained as suspects. Under Italian law, suspects can be held for one year before being charged with a crime.
Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, told ABC News that Sollecito sent Knox flowers on her birthday — nine yellow anthuriums — along with a note that read: "Happy Birthday. I hope that justice prevails soon."
Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, told ABC News this week that her daughter told her that she received Sollecito's note, but did not mention flowers.
Sollecito and Knox have not been permitted to speak since their November arrests and are currently held in separate prisons. They have written to each other previously, according to Maori.
Mellas and Curt Knox, Amanda's father, alternate stays in Italy for their twice-weekly, one-hour visits with Amanda on Tuesdays and Fridays. Mellas, who is currently in Italy, said she did not see Amanda on her birthday or on Thursday, when Mellas celebrated her own birthday.
"We sang 'Happy Birthday' to each other, hugged, held hands and cried," Mellas said in a sad tone of her Tuesday visit with her daughter. "It was an emotional day — celebrating our birthdays stuck in places we don't want to be, not really celebrating."
Knox told her mother this was not the birthday she envisioned, but she had resigned herself to the fact that she would turn 21 in prison, Mellas said.
"Here we are, the two of us, spending birthdays in Italy a few miles apart. It's not really a birthday." Mellas said.
Missing a Milestone
Ten thousand miles away in Seattle, Curt Knox, Amanda's sister Deanna, 19, and half-sisters, Ashley, 13, and Delaney, 9, also sent birthday cards. Curt expected a 10-minute phone call from Amanda on Thursday, which she is permitted once per week to approved family members.
"For me, it's not her birthday," Curt Knox told ABC News. "I had hoped to have her go out and buy me a cocktail, a privilege she should have earned today at home [in Seattle]. There are certain milestones we hit at certain ages in life — and this is one she missed."
"This is not what I would call a happy birthday, he added. "We will celebrate the happy portion when she is cleared of everything and can come home."
When, or if, Knox might be able to celebrate with her family in Seattle is a huge question that the Italian legal system will ultimately decide. Today, Amanda's birthday wish would probably be freedom.
Brutal Murder Leaves Question Marks
Kercher, a 22-year-old British student, was found stabbed to death last November in a cottage she shared with Knox and two other girls. Kercher and Knox were studying in Italy and had recently arrived in Perugia.
Within days of the killing, Knox and Sollecito were taken into custody. Guede had fled to Germany, but was tracked by police and extradited to Italy.
Guede has admitted to being intimate with Kercher the night of her murder, but he says he was in the bathroom listening to his iPod while Kercher was allegedly stabbed by an Italian man he saw fleeing when he returned to the bedroom. After Guede allegedly tried to unsuccessfully save Kercher, he fled to Germany and did not call police.
Initially, Guede told police Knox and Sollecito were not at the house the night of the murder. He later changed his story and said they were.
Knox and Sollecito say they were together at Sollecito's house that night. But during an initial interrogation, Knox briefly changed her story and said she had a vision that she was in the kitchen and heard Kercher's screams, but covered her ears. Italy's Supreme Court ruled that the statement could not be used against her because there was no lawyer present when she made it.
Murder, Sexual Assault Charges Possible
Prosecutor Guiliano Mignini ended his investigation and deposited evidence on June 19. Included in his deposit were 10,000 pages of autopsy reports, interrogations, evidence and phone taps.
Mignini claims that Kercher was raped, strangled and stabbed in the neck, but forensic experts appointed by the court concluded that sexual assault could not be proven.
Mignini accuses the three suspects of voluntary homicide and sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito are also accused of simulation of a crime for allegedly faking a break-in.
Mignini also accuses all three of stealing Kercher's money and credit cards. Kercher's purse was found near her body, missing 300 euros and two credit cards.
Lawyers for the three defendants had until this week to go over the prosecutor's documents and submit additional evidence or requests.
Maori asked for parking lot surveillance video from midnight through the morning after the murder. He also requested the diagrams from the DNA phenotypes. Knox's and Guede's attorneys made no submissions.

Obama Meets Romney; 'Cliff' Talks Falter

President Obama and Mitt Romney met face to face today for the first time since the election, breaking bread at the White House as talks over the looming "fiscal cliff" appeared to be faltering on Capitol Hill.
"I bet it was and is quite tasty," Obama spokesman Jay Carney said of the lunch as it was underway, "because [the chefs] know how to prepare very fine meals."
The menu included white turkey chili and Southwestern grilled chicken salad, the White House said in a written statement following the meal. The discussion was said to center on "America's leadership in the world and the importance of maintaining that leadership position in the future."
The former rivals concluded their 70-minute encounter with a visit to the Oval Office, the symbolic center of American power to which Romney has long tried to accede, shaking hands before the iconic "Resolute" presidential desk.
"Governor Romney congratulated the President for the success of his campaign and wished him well over the coming four years," the White House said. "They pledged to stay in touch, particularly if opportunities to work together on shared interests arise in the future."
The lunch took place in an elegant private dining room in the West Wing overlooking the manicured gardens of the White House South Lawn. Romney was seen coming and going from a side entrance in a black SUV. The former GOP nominee arrived without fanfare or entourage, opening his own car door both times.
President Obama said during a news conference earlier this month that he was interested in speaking with Romney about his ideas on jobs and economic growth, noting that his rival had "presented some ideas during the course of the campaign that I actually agree with."
Administration officials said there was no formal agenda for today's lunch or a "specific ask" or assignment for the governor.
Romney, who has kept a relatively low profile since losing the election on Nov. 6, has not publicly addressed Obama's post-election overtures or the prospect of working together. Both men have little personal history and had a chilly relationship during the campaign.
Senior Romney campaign strategist Eric Fehrnstrom called Obama's lunch invitation "gracious" and said that Romney was "glad to accept." The governor also met earlier Thursday in Washington with former running mate Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.
The Obama-Romney detente came as talks between the White House and congressional Republicans to prevent the economy from going over the "fiscal cliff" of mandatory spending cuts and tax increases set for Jan. 1 appeared to hit a snag.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the lead White House negotiator in the talks, and White House legislative chief Rob Nabors held a flurry of meetings today with congressional leaders of both parties in the House and Senate.
But following sessions, top Republicans poured cold water on what had been budding optimism of progress toward a deal.
"No substantive progress has been made over the last two weeks," said House Speaker John Boehner at a press conference.
"We know what the menu is. What we don't know is what the White House is willing to do to get serious about solving our debt crisis," he said, accusing the administration of failing to detail plans for significant spending cuts to correspond with desired tax revenue increases.
Obama and Boehner spoke by phone Wednesday night, sources told ABC News, their second conversation in four days. Boehner described it as "direct and straightforward," but suggested "disappointment" with Obama's reticence to waver on hiking tax rates on the wealthy.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in advance of his meeting with Geithner, said everything the White House has put down on the table so far has been "counterproductive," and he hopes that the Treasury Secretary brings "a specific plan from the president" with him today.

See More Now to the hollywood actress shaking up politics in kentucky. Ashleyng ready to announce a bid for the senate, taking on one of the most powerful republicans in america. Is it a stunt, and if not, what are her chances? Abc's david kerley has the story from washington. Ashley! Right over here! Reporter: She is a movie star, who knows her way around a red carpet, after a string of successful movies. Double jear. Kiss the girls. Somebody help me. Reporter: But ashley judd's new role may be a real-live politician from kentucky. She's seriously considering a race for the united states senate. Reporter: Judd, who does her own fighting stunts in the movies and tv, is preparing to take on the most powerful republican in the who when asked when judd talks only generally about liberals. They love to take out the republican leader of the senate. We expect a spirited race. Reporter: Republicans are already attacking judd. With an ad that points out while judd was rasezed in kentucky and graduated from school there, she now lives in tennessee. Who's right at home here in tennessee. I mean kentucky. Reporter: She certainly has name recognition. A celebrity candidate can occasionally eclipse a accomplished lifetime legislator. Judd has been an anti-aids tivist. If she jumps into the race, she will raise plenty of money, but it will be enough? She would have a very tough road against one of the most powerful senators in the country. So the question is timing. The derby is very important in kentucky politics, first weekend in may. So analysts believe if she's going to get in the race, she'll have to make an announcement sometime early next month. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
