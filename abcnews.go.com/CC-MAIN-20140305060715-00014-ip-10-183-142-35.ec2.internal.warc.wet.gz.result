Laptop Program to Intel: Good Riddance
Jan. 11, 2008 Page 3 of 3
WB: Yep. But I think it's premature to do that. And the reason is quite simple: unless we keep the pressure on, the prices are going to go up, the efficiencies are going to go down, and we're going to be right back to the same "bigger, faster" model. We've got to keep the pressure on and keep the industry honest until we've really proven that this other way is viable. Because otherwise, next year's Intel machine will be more expensive and more power hungry, and that's not going to serve the needs of these kids.
TR: Okay, I have to say, I've played with the laptop, and it seems slow.
