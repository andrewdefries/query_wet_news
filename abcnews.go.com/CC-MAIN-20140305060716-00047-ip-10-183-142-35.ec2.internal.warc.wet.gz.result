Will There Be A Swine Flu Vaccine?
May 27, 2009
Greg Poland, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Director, Mayo Vaccine Research Group, Mayo Clinic Question: Will a vaccine be available for swine flu?
Answer: We will have against swine flu. It's expected to be available about mid to late October. The problem is we probably won't have all the doses we need right away and it will sort of dribble out all the way until February or March of 2010. But yes, we will have a vaccine. It will take two doses to make people immune. So you'll get a dose of vaccine, wait three or more weeks; get a second dose, and then it's about two weeks after that before you're actually immune. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 7677619.

Tonight, the... See More We move on to a major development after that terror threat we reported on last night here. Worries about toothpaste being used to disguise bombs onboard planes to Russia for the olympics. Tonight, the U.S. Is banning all carry-on liquids to Russia. With the athletes there and 65 world leaders arriving, that's a record, nerves could not be higher. Brian Ross tonight. Reporter: American authorities say this is the target, a passenger jet flying in today over the sochi olympic vill only, full of athletes and spectators. And this is the worry. Tubes of toothpaste. That a team of terror operators could use to smuggle explosives onboard. Once onboard an aircraft, they would be able to pass off several containers and put the product together to get more bang for your buck. Reporter: Delta and other airlines announced a ban on liquids, gels, aerosols and powders on coarry-ons into Russia. The U.S. Isn't going to let anything happen to us. We have some pretty good backing everywhere. Reporter: But the concerns goes beyond the airport. And current and former authorities say, they are not that confident that the Russian security ring of steel, with its armed officers, naval ships, surveillance blimps and anti-missile batteries hidden in the mountains will be enough to stop a determined terrorist. The U.S. Says it is ready for anything that could happen in sochi, with small teams of armed personnel guarding American athletes. And two U.S. Navy ships now in international waters somewhere in the black sea off of sochi. Brian, you'll remain on this every step of the way. Thanks to you.

ABC News’ Stu Schutzman reports: No, you’re not seeing things, the headline on today’s blog is indeed –"crap wrap". It’s the brainchild of a British on-line gift catalogue called Firebox.com. "Crap Wrap" is Firebox’ gift to men who don’t want the hassle of wrapping themselves, but do want their wives or significant others to think they did. More on the particulars later but first to the site itself. With less than a week to go before the big day, you will find some, to say the least, interesting last minute "gift" ideas. How about Bloomin Wild Hibiscus Flowers. For $13.95 you get a jar of dormant Hibiscus petals; place them in a glass of champagne and voila — a bloomin flower. Good for weddings, birthdays and christenings, says the site, "we guarantee party-goers will be blown away." There are gift categories labeled games, tots, lifestyle, and technology, to name just a few. Try clicking on "geek" — my personal favorite. "Ever wondered what Plutonium’s atomic number is while lathering up," asks the site? Here’s the perfect gift, the Periodic Table Shower Curtain for only $29.95. Tired of storing your "valuable data and Death Star plans on flimsy CDs"? Worry no more, Star Wars Mimobots are the memory sticks you’ve been looking for–from $69.95. "Who needs time on their side," asks the site, "when you can have it on your front?" It’s about time for Time Tee, the tee shirt with the electro-luminescent digital clock/stopwatch right on your chest–$39.95. And now for the final touch –"Crap Wrap." Firebox will wrap these gems for that special someone as sloppily as you would if you wrapped them yourself. This "uniquely shoddy gift wrapping option" uses offensive brown tape on unevenly cut wrapping paper with rips all over it exposing the box beneath as if you wrapped it yourself wearing boxing gloves. "Cheering news for lazy men," says the Daily Telegraph, "it makes you proud to be British." Email
