See More up the "gma heat index". The latest on the nba cheerleader who took a lot of attention on her weight. She's speaking out to bianna golodryga and has the story. &#9834; Reporter: She's performed in front of thousands but oklahoma city thunder cheerleader kelsey williams was unwittingly thrust into the national spotlight after an online blogger questioned her appearance at an article askings this girl too chunky to be an okc thunder cheerleader?" I got online and reading it my heart sank. Reporter: It went viral and shockingly it came from a woman who has since lost her job but the damage was done. The rockets look terrible but some say they weren't the only bad looking people on the court. What did you think when you read that. I was definitely embarrassed and just -- just devastated. Reporter: If you could say something to her right now, what would that be? Shame on you. I mean you're a woman. You know exactly what we all go through on a daily basis, just being a woman. Shame on you. Reporter: Kelsey says she eats right and works out three to four hours a day to meet the strenuous requirements of being a professional cheerleader but she also embraces her body. I've always had more of an athletic built different than the slender ballerina that some people may think of as a dancer and that's just not me. Reporter: Do you mind what size you are? I wear a size 4. Reporter: You're a size 4. People were constantly saying, wow, if you're chunky, if you're chubby, if you're too fat, then there's no hope for me. I give up. Reporter: Describe that moment when you had to put that uniform back on. My first game back, it was -- I was really scared. I had a feeling that a lot of people would be looking for me just because I'm me now instead of a thunder girl and so I was really nervous and I had a huge knot in my stomach right up until the game started but once I ran out on to the court and the game started, it just -- it felt like normal. It felt good to be back. Kelsey has gotten overwhelming support not only from her family but fans and perfect strangers through social media and she says she wants to find the silver lining in what happened to her. Took to twitter and wrote "to be womanly always, discouraged never." What did you mean by that? I have so much love and me sending hate her way would do nothing. What's done is done and just going to try to keep my chin up. And we couldn't get a comment from the blogger because the radio station the blogger worked for hasn't identified the former employer. Kelsey thinks the blogger shouldn't have been fired. If fact she says she wouldn't have wished that on anyone. She had only been married for a month. I think she looks fantastic. A great spirit. Thanks, bianna. "Dancing with the stars" This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

When Partner Abuse Leads to Pregnancy
Jan. 25, 2010
By KRISTINA FIOREMedPage Today In some abusive relationships, men may use strategies to force women to become pregnant, including sabotaging their birth control, researchers say.
Nearly 20 percent of women at family clinics across northern California reported that their partner tried to coerce them into having a child, sometimes using methods such as poking holes in condoms or flushing birth control pills down the toilet, Dr. Elizabeth Miller of the University of California Davis and colleagues reported online in the journal Contraception.
"It was stunning to have this many women seeking reproductive health services saying, 'this has happened to me,'" lead study author Miller said. She added that the reasons men would want their partners to bear children vary "from things like wanting to leave a legacy, to a straightforward desire for attachment, to having absolute control over her body... There are all of these elements to it."
null
Dr. Aisha Mays, director of the Teen and Young Adult Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, said pregnancy coercion is a growing problem that has been around for "quite some time" but is just now being recognized as a major health issue.
"It's about power and control," said Mays, who was not involved in the study. "It's another way of saying, 'This girl's taken; this girl's mine.'"
Mays said she has seen cases in which a young mother who has a child by another partner has been forced by her new boyfriend to have another baby with him.
It's also a way for males to make their partners more dependent on them, according to Amy Bonomi of Ohio State University.
"Women in abusive relationships are sometimes forced to bear children as a means to keep them dependent on their partner and sometimes as a means to justify additional -- and sometimes more severe -- abuse," Bonomi said.
Miller said pregnancy coercion often consists of verbal threats, demands, and physical violence to pressure women to become pregnant. Alternatively, some men sabotage birth control by flushing pills down the toilet, breaking condoms, or removing contraceptive rings and patches.
Indeed, previous studies have found an association between partner violence and unintended pregnancy, and new research suggests that a man's attempts to control a woman's reproductive choices may play a role in the association.
"We've known for a long time in the domestic violence world that partner violence and unintended pregnancy are connected; we just haven't understood the mechanisms," Miller said.
To investigate, the researchers conducted a survey of women ages 16 to 29 who sought care at family planning clinics in northern California.
More than half of the women surveyed – 53 percent -- reported physical or sexual partner violence. Miller noted that women at family planning clinics tend to have higher rates of abuse than the general population.
Among all the women, 19 percent reported pregnancy coercion, and 15 percent reported birth control sabotage.
More than a third of women – 35 percent -- who reported either form of what researchers call "reproductive control" also reported partner violence.
Altogether, the effect of both partner violence and reproductive control nearly doubled a woman's odds of unintended pregnancy.
Miller said the findings emphasize the need for family planning clinics to provide intervention programs to combat both reproductive control and partner violence.

The Note: Asking Ourselves Questions
October 16, 2006
By MARK HALPERIN, DAVID CHALIAN, TEDDY DAVIS, TAHMAN BRADLEY, SARAH BAKER, and NITYA VENKATARAMAN with KARUNA SESHASAI and ERICA ANDERSON
Tahman Bradley More from Tahman »
Reporter
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12
Post-modern evidence that the House page scandal has not decisively changed the midterm equation:
1. Despite the confluence of the Bush-Hastert event this evening, the Kirk Fordham testimony before the ethics committee, and the Washington Post revealing fissures in the Speaker's office LINK, the Old Media and the New Media are not foaming at the mouth about the story at this hour.
2. Other news -- tin-pot dictators with nukes, Iraqi troop levels, planes into buildings -- can apparently effortlessly knock the pages off the front pages.
3. Nancy Pelosi's dogged opposition to missile defense, Harry Reid's land deals, and Sandy Berger's sticky fingers -- one is sure hearing a lot about those matters these days.
4. Dean David Broder -- all but rooting for a Democratic takeover of the congress -- says the Foley scandal "is shifting few votes." LINK
5. The Note defies you to name a competitive Senate race that has been impacted by the Mark Foley matter, and any formerly competitive Senate races now in play because of it.
6. Despite the New York Times highlighting one of the (at most) dozen or so House races that have been impacted by Foley (probably giving Democrats nearly half the seats they need to take back control -- no small thing), the House playing field has not been dramatically altered. (And Note the AP's masterful Espo reporting that the GOP is putting major coin into the Foley race. LINK
)
6. Dick Morris says so. LINK
7. Here comes the avalanche of candidate, party, and shadowy 527 ads (and other voter communication) that will help Republicans define Democrats. LINK
8. Speaketh the super-sage Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report: "Republicans will have enough time to turn a last minute problem race around. . . . The bulk of the most vulnerable races for Republicans have been engaged for weeks - or in some cases months. As such, there is no the pressure on Republicans to spend the last few weeks framing the debate or defining their opponents. It's already been done." LINK
9. The swagger is back in the POTUS walk and talk.
The two highlights on today's schedule: Kirk Fordham's testimony before the House Ethics Committee, and tonight's 6:35 pm ET Chicago fundraiser with President Bush and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL).
Tonight's Hastert-Bush fundraiser, which will take place at the Chicago Hilton, is designed to benefit House candidates David McSweeney and Peter Roskam as well as the Illinois Congressional Victory Committee 2006.
McSweeney is challenging one-term Democratic incumbent Melissa Bean (D-IL) in Illinois 8th district and Peter Roskam is running against Democratic Iraq war vet Tammy Duckworth to replace retiring Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL).
The Chicago Area chapter of the Code Pink organization holds a protest against Speaker Hastert in front of his office at 10:30 am ET in Batavia, IL. Protesters are calling the event "Housecleaning" and will be using aprons, housecoats, brooms, and sponge as props.
Earlier in the day, President Bush speaks about energy at 1:20 pm ET in St. Louis, MO.
Attempting to keep civility and ethics on the front burner, Democratic Reps. Pelosi, Waxman, and Slaughter plan to hold a conference call with some regional ed boards on the topic today. Minority Leader Pelosi is in Portland, OR this afternoon participating in an event on civility and ethics there.

New Kitchen Gadget Turns Flavor into Vapor

From molecular gastronomy to bacon-flavored anything, the latest culinary craze doesn’t even involve food.
A new kitchen gadget that turns the flavor of food into vapor, Le Whaf brings dessert to your taste buds without the calories.
Once a liquid is added and the carafe is tilted, a cloud of flavor vapor is generated using ultrasound waves. A special straw lets you sip the vapor cloud for a burst of flavor minus most calories or alcohol.
Franco-American scientist David Edwards and designer Marc Bretillot designed the product that has been sweeping Europe and is set to come to the U.S. soon.
“At the base of the Whaf are piezoelectric crystals. These vibrate at an ultrasonic frequency when the liquid in the Whaf is above a certain level. This level is achieved when the Whaf is tipped on its side and with the appropriate level of liquid,” Eric Freedman, senior director of marketing at Aero Designs, told ABC News.
“A normal glass full of the droplets created by the Whaf will hold around 40 microliters (or milligrams) of liquid in the air. If you sip these into your mouth with the Whaf Straw you will taste the liquid — an especially pleasing experience when the liquid has a strong or noticeable taste,” wrote Freedman.
Even chefs like Norman Aitken of Juniper Kitchen Restaurant in Ottawa, Ont., are using the product to revolutionize fine dining. Aitken serves a pepper crusted albacore tuna with a green pea noodle salad with a side of miso and soy Le Whaf. Edwards and Bretillot encourage creativity with the product, suggesting using your own recipes to make soups, juices or even liquid tarts. A digital cookbook for Le Whaf is in the works.
