A middle school student opened fire in his gym with a shotgun today and critically wounded two students in Roswell, N.M., according to authorities.
The injured were a 13-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy who were "simply sitting in their gym waiting to go to class," New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said. The shooting occurred shortly before class was to begin at Berrendo Middle School.
The Eastern New Mexico Medical Center confirmed it treated two patients, who were then air lifted to the University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, located about 175 miles from the middle school.
A spokesperson for UMC said the boy, who the governor said was 12, is out of surgery and is listed in critical condition. The girl, 13, is also being treated at the hospital and is listed in serious condition, according to the spokesperson. A school staff member suffered a minor injury and declined treatment.
The names of the shooting victims have not been released.

Odiee Carranza, an eighth grade student, told the Associated Press a boy bumped into her as he rushed toward the gym and apologized to her. When the boy entered the gym, Carranza said she saw him pull a gun out of a band instrument case and begin shooting.
She said he shot another boy twice in the face and shoot a girl in the arm.
"Then he shot up in the sky, then dropped the gun, and then some teacher grabbed the kid that had the gun," Carranza told the AP.
Authorities said the weapon was a shotgun and the shooter was a 12-year-old seventh grader.
The governor said a school staffer and an off-duty New Mexico State Police lieutenant who was dropping his child off at the school were instrumental in helping to end the active shooter situation before more people were injured.
New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said by the time his deputies arrived around 8: 11 a.m., "the weapon, which we believe is a shot gun, was laid on the ground."
The alleged shooter was taken into custody and the chief said it is believed he acted alone.
Kassetas did not disclose a possible motive, but said investigators are "looking at social media outlets and the different forms of communication these kids use to talk to each other."
After the scene was secure this morning, students were bused from the school to Roswell Mall where police said parents will be allowed to pick up their children. Authorities asked parents to stay away from the school during the investigation.
The Roswell incident is the latest school shooting to rattle the country. It comes one month after a gunman open fire at Arapahoe High School in Colorado.
Police said Karl Pierson, 18, who was armed with a shotgun, machete and had Molotov cocktails in his backpack, was intent on seeking "revenge" on the school's debate team instructor who had dropped him from the team.
Pierson came upon senior Claire Davis, 17, while looking for his intended target. He critically wounded the high school senior before police said he took his own life.
Davis died on Dec. 21 from her injuries.
The Arapahoe shooting took place on the eve of the first anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn., in which 27 people - most of them first graders - were killed.

Bill Clinton: Under GOP Primary System, Hillary Would Be Winning

ABC News’ Eloise Harper reports: Former President Bill Clinton, speaking to reporters after his wife’s event in Pittsburgh, PA Monday, said that under the republican primary system –- his wife would be ahead by hundreds of delegates. "I did not actually get the delegates necessary to have a first power of the nomination under the crazy system the democrats have," Clinton said. "If we were under the republican system which is more like the electoral college, she would have a 300 delegate lead …It’s an eternity ’til the general election, an eternity."
ABC News’ Political Unit did some quick math and added up all the pledged delegate counts for the winner-take-all Democratic contest. As of the most recent count on the eve of the Pennsylvania state primary, Senator Hillary Clinton has won 15 state contests and was awarded 1430 delegates, not including unpledged (a.k.a. "superdelegates"). Barack Obama has won 29, and has 1257 delegates.
According to ABC’s math – Clinton would hold more like a 173 delegate-lead if her and Obama were competing in the Republican primary system given the GOP system doesn’t have superdelegates. President Clinton was correct, but overestimated what his wife’s lead would be by about half. The former president also said that he thinks the people of Pennsylvania think his wife is "their girl."
Clinton said, “I’ve been to 45 communities, 46. In Pennsylvania alone. I think shell bring a change out there, they like her out here they know she’s their girl.” He continued, "They were dancing on her grave in Texas and she won anyway, and they never thought after they outspent her two to one in Ohio that she could still win by ten points. So well see. She’s got a lot of good supporters here. I don’t know what’s going to happen. Depends on a lot of things, who shows up how the undecided breaks. I literally don’t know, I just think they’re going to be with her though."
When asked about Republican publisher Richard Mellon Scaife’s paper, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review’s, surprising endorsement of his wife, Bill Clinton admitted that he was taken aback.
“I’m surprised," he said, "You know I take them at their word. I think they were impressed that she had the guts to go see him."
Clinton raised eyebrows when she met with Scaife, wooing his paper’s endorsement. Scaife helped to fund an effort that ultimately led to the impeachment proceedings of Bill Clinton. When asked what he thought about Carter meeting with Hamas, the former president bit his tongue. "Well look I’m trying to help Hillary, I don’t want to say anything that is going to complicate her life. If you ask her whatever she says is fine with me. You know I don’t want to go there."
