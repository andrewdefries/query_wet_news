By LAUREN COXABC News Medical Unit via World News
Researchers have found short-term memory in fetuses as early as 30 weeks old. /ABC NewsABC News Photo Illustration
Like any prospective mom, as 21-year-old Angela Morton goes through her first pregnancy the family stories of her own baby years begin to emerge -- including her mother's trick of calming her with Aerosmith's 1988 song "Angel" anytime she was a fussing as an infant.

Hotel Booking at the 11th Hour Nov. 9, 2012

Travelers have been told time and time again that the best way to get a deal is to plan ahead. But when it comes to booking hotels, the best way to score a great rate may be to wait until the last minute. The very last minute.
Turns out hotels are now courting mobile hotel bookers by slashing same-day rates. Between 60 and 70 percent of same-day hotel bookings are made on mobile devices, and these bookings have the potential to bring in $15 billion to the travel industry annually. And the savings to travelers? Up to 70 percent off.
Familiar names – such as Travelocity, Orbitz, Priceline and Booking.com now offer same-day hotel booking capability for mobile. I tested these four, plus Hotel Tonight, the app that pioneered the same-day hotel booking trend, to see which one would give me the best deal for a hotel room in one of the world's most expensive cities -- New York. For a hotel room tonight. Here's the scenario. I have an event near the office tonight after work, and I don't really feel like commuting home and then back to the office tomorrow morning. ABC isn't going to pick up the tab for a hotel room, but if I can find a good deal on something in the area, it might be worth it for me to pay out of my own pocket.
I can search by price, star rating, even customer reviews. But for tonight, I'm going to search by location. If I can find a great deal close to the office, I'll take it. If not, I'll just go home.
Booking.com and Priceline It turns out Booking.com is owned by Priceline, and the options and prices are nearly identical. My closest options are the Trump International and Mandarin Oriental. Both five stars, and both cost almost $1,000 a night. No thanks. Both sites offered another five-star option, the JW Marriott Essex House, for a more reasonable $449. Still more than I wanted to spend, though not a bad deal for a five-star hotel in New York City.
Next up, the four-star Hudson, for $246 on both apps. Booking.com offered the four-star 6 Columbus for $290, while Priceline pulled up the three-and-a-half star Moderne for $299. Both apps turned up the Holiday Inn Midtown – three stars – for $305.
Orbitz Orbitz's Hotels app gave me the same options and price for the Mandarin, the Hudson, the Essex House and the Holiday Inn. It also yielded two other options: the Park Central -- four stars -- for a little less than $300, and Le Parker Meridian – also four stars -- for $400 bucks.
Travelocity Travelocity's LastMinute.com Hotel Deals app turned up totally different options, and the prices were quite good, but the options weren't as close to the office as the properties the other three apps gave me. Here, I got the four-star Flatiron hotel for $263 – a good price, but two miles away. Same problem for Affinia Manhattan -- $342 for the four-star hotel, but too faraway.
Getting closer to the office, I got the four-star Millennium Broadway Times Square for $269 and the three star Metro Apartments for $293. Both are about a mile away, The closest option was the Hotel Belleclaire: Three stars, less than a mile, $246 per night.
Hotel Tonight
Hotel Tonight turned up a hotel practically next to my office – the four-star Empire, for $329 per night. It also turned up 6 Columbus, and beat the price offered on Booking.com by $45 for a total of $245.

McCain, Obama, Giuliani — and the Rights of Detainees

After a visit to Guantanamo Bay, on December 12, 2003, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — along with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash – wrote to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asking for information about the disposition of detainees being held at U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay. They wrote of their "serious concern arises over the disposition of the detainees – a considerable number of whom have been held for two years. Given this concern, we respectfully ask that you provide explicit information on two critical issues. First, we ask that you advise us as to when you will make a determination on the final disposition of the detainees’ status. Second, we request that you state specifically when you will begin the process pursuant to the Order of the Military Commissions that the President signed in November 2001, and how it will work in practice. "Mr. Secretary," the senators wrote, "our recent visit to see the detainee situation for ourselves provided an enormously useful opportunity to understand the essential work that has been done there, which we have supported. Yet, we firmly believe it is now time to make a decision on how the United States will move forward regarding the detainees, and to take that important next step. A serious process must be established in the very near term either to formally treat and process the detainees as war criminals or to return them to their countries for appropriate judicial action."
In an interview with the New York Times, McCain said, "They may not have any rights under the Geneva Conventions as far as I’m concerned, but they have rights under various human rights declarations. And one of them is the right not to be detained indefinitely.”
**
This morning, on a conference call arranged by the McCain campaign, I asked former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani how McCain’s desire — as stated in the 2003 letter — to have the detainees receive some sort of judicial process differed from what Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, said to me on Monday about fighting terrorism while not ignoring civil liberties, or his further discussion of the issue yesterday where he said that his point was the need to provide detainees "some modicum of due process, (so) we can have confidence that we’ve got the right people, that we’re not wasting time on the wrong people. We can send a message to the world that we continue to abide by the standards of rule of law, and we can actually be more effective in our pursuit of terrorism." Giuliani said that McCain’s push in 2003 was for there to be a procedure created — and there was. "Congress did create a procedure…so detainees in Guantanamo could have a hearing before a military court…and could appeal" before U.S. District court. There was nothing wrong about "grant(ing) to terrorist and accused terrorists the existing panoply of rights," he said. "But what the Supreme Court did was extend new rights to them" in its decision last week. "Sen. Obama said he’s in favor of that."
McCain, added Randy Scheunemann, the McCain campaign’s director of foreign policy and national security, "has always maintained that there needed to be adjudication and a process for adjudication….and there was a good faith effort to put a process in place" that gave adjudication rights to detainees while also protecting intelligence information. Obama voted against that process, Scheunemann said, and the Supreme Court struck down elements of that military commission law.
**
So it would seem Obama and McCain both think detainees should have the right to adjudication, though they disagree about the extent of those rights, a chasm seen in Obama’s support for, and McCain’s opposition to, the Supreme Court decision of last week.
So what’s this debate about? What did Obama do wrong — in Giuliani’s view — by mentioning the prosecution of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers?
"The real problem is his having said that in essence the 1993 situation was really correctly handled," Giuliani said this morning, "by the criminal prosecution and these people being incapacitated." Au contraire, the former New York Mayor said, "it was a terrible mistake not recognizing the full dimension of what we were involved in."
"He seems to think 1993 — that is the paradigm," Giuliani said, taking some liberties and making some assumptions about Obama’s thinking. "There’s a failure to recognize that you had to go farther than that."
Said Giuliani, in familiar language, "he wants to go back to being on defense." He pointed to comments made by a fellow New Yorker as evidence of this view. "We could point to many, many examples during the debates where the words ‘irresponsible’ and ‘naïve’ were applied to Senator Obama — but not by a Republican but by Hillary Clinton," said Giuliani. "So I know she’s probably in a different position now, but these are issues Hillary Clinton very dramatically pointed out during the Democratic primary." The erstwhile GOP presidential candidate also said "the remarks made yesterday by several people in the Obama camp that If Bin Laden were taken to Guantanamo he would be given Habeas Corpus rights is startling. And again, a reminder of maybe where they are going on the Democratic side and what we would have in store for us if we have a Democratic presidency. The reality is that there seems to be more concern about the rights of terrorists, or alleged terrorists, than for the rights that the American people have to safety and security." - jpt	Email
