Alarm Over Rural Veterinarian Shortage May 12, 2011
Page 2 of 3
Fewer Rural Vets Threatens Animals, Farmers and Food Supply That explains why Furman in Nebraska has a mixed-animal practice, treating both farm animals and house pets.
In all, only about 17 percent of the country's veterinarians work exclusively in food-animal medicine, compared to the more than 70 percent of vets who work with companion animals, such as dogs and cats. And that number is expected to drop. Recent studies indicate the amount of food-supply veterinarians will likely fall by about five percent every year, according to the AVMA.
That news is unsettling to Hilary Maricle, 32, a farmer in Albion, Neb., who said she needs veterinarians to come to her farm most often during emergencies with her livestock.
"And that's always when they're busiest," she said. "It's in middle of the night, it's on the weekend, it's when we need them now."
But that's not always possible when the veterinarians she works with are stretched too thin.
"We start to see the real challenge when vets are already on a call, working with other animals," she said. "They'll say they can meet us as soon as possible, but that might be in four hours. They want to be everywhere, but they just can't."
The shortage has even lead Maricle and her husband to consider treating their farm animals on their own.
"We spend a lot of time worrying about our animals, so the concern for not having a vet when I need one is huge," she said. "We ask ourselves, what are the things we can learn from the vet to do on our own if that shortage is there?"
Explaining the Shortage
A declining rural population, debt of up to $140,000 for veterinarians starting out, and an irregular schedule nursing thousand-pound animals in sometimes grueling conditions are factors that can easily lead a recent graduate of veterinary school to choose against the life of a large-animal vet.
"We still have this rural population farming, yet we don't have the concentration where it's economically viable for a rural veterinarian to set up a practice there," DeHaven said.
In 2010, only 12 percent of new veterinary school graduates sought employment in rural practices, as opposed to the 33 percent who went into companion-animal practices, earning on average almost $10,000 more per year, according to the NIFA. About half of graduates went into areas of advanced study, such as internships and residencies.
For Ellis in Texas, it's no wonder then why many of today's students choose to work with companion animals, instead of being "notoriously underpaid" as a food-animal veterinarian.
"Rural vets are often faced with the dilemma of, 'I can neuter a dog in my clinic for $100, or I can drive a hundred miles to sew up a sheep for $50,'" Ellis said.
Plus, added Ellis, more importance is routinely placed on companion animals.
"Even farmers think, 'I'll pay anything to save my cat, but I'm not necessarily going to pay anything to rescue my goat.'"
Another lure of a companion-animal practice is the standard workday schedule that accompanies it.
"It's 10-hour days as opposed to 12-hour days in a climate-controlled room," said David Kirkpatrick of the AVMA. "That's probably much more practical than working in excessively high or bone-chilling temperatures with animals weighing thousands of pounds."
This shortage of rural vets, in turn, "contributes to a lack of rural vitality because without veterinary support, the needs of animal health operations, ranches and farms oftentimes can't be profitable," Sherman said.

The edge of anti-act ka where 70 people are stranded trapped in heavy ice. Gio benitez on how they plan to get them out. Reporter: The boat is packed with 75 tourists and researchers on an antarctic adventure. They set sail from new zealand december 8th. Here they are a week later, thrilled to finally find sea ice. The australaisan antarctic expedition has finally made it to the ice. Look at that view. Reporter: But as the days wore on, that sea ice became more chilling than thrilling. Slowing the ship to a freezing halt. As you can see where's actually in a blizzard at the moment. Reporter: And now, they're trapped. And we have wind speeds of 50 kph, reaching in excess of 70 kph. The vessel hasn't moved for the last two days and we're surrounded by sea ice. We just can't get through. Reporter: The tourists and researchers were retracing the steps of explorers from 100 years ago, looking at these famous huts built in 1911, studying the local wildlife. Temperatures near zero, with heavy winds, weather that could make the rescue dangerous. But even so, the explorers are in good spirits, passing the time by doing even more research. Ice breaking ships are now rushing to rescue the passengers, like this one sent by the chinese, the snow dragon. But david, it'll be hours before this ship arrives to help. Thank you, gio benitez.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama plans to sit down with the anchors of the five major U.S. news networks and PBS on Monday in separate one-on-one interviews.
The on-air appearances coincide with a heavy fall agenda for the president and Congress. Most lawmakers return to Washington from their summer recess on that day, which also falls on the eve of a nationally televised address Obama plans to make his case for military action on Syria.
Monday’s interviews, which will be taped that afternoon and broadcast on the networks’ nightly news, will serve as a stepping stone for the president to frame his arguments before the American people.
Kerry: ‘Not the Time to Be Silent Spectators to Slaughter’
Although supported by leading lawmakers in both parties, the administration’s push for military intervention in Syria’s civil war has has hit pushback from significant numbers of Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress. Unofficial tallies by ABC News of members of Congress suggest that a resolution to strike against Syria’s Bashar Assad for the use of chemical weapons in that struggle would likely fail in at least the House of Representatives.
The Syria question is also shadowed by a docket of issues for Capitol Hill including showdowns on the national debt, federal budget, healthcare, and a possible curb on the government’s surveillance of millions of its citizens.
The Obama White House has not been shy about giving network interviews during his two terms, with the president and members of his cabinet offering appearances with increasing frequency during times of political expedience. But it has been an extreme rarity to meet with five networks at once. In September 2009, for example, Obama made a similar showing during a push for his signature healthcare legislation, although he avoided Fox in favor of Univision.	SHOWS: World News
