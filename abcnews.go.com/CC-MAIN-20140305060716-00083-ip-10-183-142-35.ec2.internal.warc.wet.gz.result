Exclusive: Bush White House Pushed Grant for Former Staffer
A former top official in the White House's faith-based office was awarded a lucrative Department of Justice grant under pressure from two senior Bush administration appointees, according to current and former DOJ staff members and a review of internal DOJ documents and emails.
The $1.2 million grant was jointly awarded to a consulting firm run by Lisa Trevino Cummins who previously headed Hispanic outreach efforts for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, and a...Full Story

CEO Profile: Starwood, Van Paasschen both on the move
NEW YORK
Page 2 of 3
He regularly studies GDP rates for different countries in the Economist magazine, speaks five languages and is currently learning Czech with his chauffeur each morning, says his wife, Laura di Bonaventura. He learned Italian just four years ago, when — despite the demands of his Nike job — he squeezed in a starter Italian-language course so that he could converse with his Italian colleagues in a less formal way, she says. A paper boy and a ditch digger Van Paasschen and his older sister were raised in Seattle by Dutch immigrants, and they visited the Netherlands each summer. His father was a pediatrician and his mother was a biomedical researcher who specialized in kidney dialysis. The family lived modestly, so he started delivering the Seattle Times at age 12 to pay for his interest in skiing.
"What I learned is to work hard, treat everyone well and listen," he says. "It's more about effort than ability. We all know brilliant people who haven't had a very successful life."
In the fifth grade, he started running regularly to strengthen his soccer game. He wanted to "get faster and better," says di Bonaventura, who likes to tease him about his oddly mature goals as a youth.
"That's been a constant theme in his life," she says. "Clearly he's ambitious, but it's more than a drive to achieve. It's a drive for personal growth."
He dug ditches for landscapers and worked as a janitor in his father's office to put money toward his undergraduate degree at Amherst College in Massachusetts. There, he majored in economics and biology, unsure whether he wanted to attend medical school or become an economist. He chose a different path entirely after reading an article in Harper'sMagazine about the exciting lives of young consultants. It sounded like a good fit for his energy level and analytical skills, and he landed a job at the Boston Consulting Group. He later returned to school, earning his MBA at Harvard Business School. He'd already lined up consulting jobs in Munich and Amsterdam when he met di Bonaventura, a fellow student who had a consulting job offer in Boston. A whirlwind romance ensued, and they arranged to work together at McKinsey Consulting in Los Angeles. "Forty days before the end of school, when all the students have jobs lined up and their lives completely organized, both of us threw caution to the wind," she says. They got married in 1990. Van Paasschen spent six years at McKinsey in Los Angeles and Amsterdam, but decided to leave the hectic lifestyle as they were about to have the first of their three children.
"I wanted a little more balance and to put family first," he says.
Di Bonaventura says her husband still puts family first. He eats breakfast and dinner with them, and if he needs to work, does so near them instead of shutting himself in a home office. He speaks only Dutch to the children — ages 13, 11 and 7 — so they can be bilingual, and engages them "on their own terms," she says. The family recently moved from Denver into a home in Connecticut. After his first child was born in 1995, van Paasschen joined Disney's consumer products division to gain more global experience. He established Disney's retail stores in Japan and crafted a strategy to open new markets in countries such as Poland.

Is the Internet Driving Pornography Addiction Among School-Aged Kids?

Nathan Haug is an upstanding high school student, on his way to becoming an Eagle Scout. He has a high GPA, serves on the student council and swims competitively, but Haug had a secret he kept hidden from his family and friends during his early teen years -- he suffered from an addiction to online pornography.
This 17-year-old from Alpine, Utah, is one of eight children, and one of the oldest still living at home. He said his habit of looking at pornography on the Internet started when he was around 12 or 13 years old.
"It was kind of there, uninterrupted," he said. "I became almost numb to it. It became such a part of, pretty much my daily routine. It was automatic."
And Haug is far from alone. There is still little research on how many U.S. kids are addicted to online pornography, but a University of New Hampshire study reports exposure begins young, for some, as young as 8 years old.
Of course, pornography isn't new. But it's a quantum leap from a world where pornography came in magazines and on tape, to where it's available on our smartphones and tablets -- or at the click of a mouse.
Haug said he would view pornography late at night on his family's computer, when everyone else was asleep; he became good at covering his tracks.
"It got to deleting specific searches and cleaning up my messes afterwards to the point where I timed it masterfully," he said. "I'd give myself time to look at it or watch it and then I'd plan ahead of time the... time it took to completely clean the history. Sometimes I'd even search things afterwards just to make it look like someone didn't just clean it."
His private habit didn't fit into the rest of his lifestyle. Aside from being a lifeguard at the local pool and on the local club team, Haug was also active in the Mormon church, and he said the addiction hurt him.
"I felt like every day I was just incomplete, like there was just a whole chunk of me missing, like a hole in my gut," he said. "It just represented the part-- the things I was going to do and wanted to do that, because of my addiction, I wasn't able to."
Haug said he held himself back -- not fully participating in church activities or getting to know other people honestly -- because he was "trapped" by his addiction and silently suffering alone.
"Instead of lying about the actual act, it was putting on a front, putting on a mask," he said. "I convinced myself that I had to take care of the problem on my own, and I didn't think I could approach someone and get help."
The warning signs for those who become addicted may include depression, poor school performance, self-isolation and lying, which is what Haug's parents noticed, even if they didn't realize why.
"We couldn't quite figure out why because as far as we could see there wasn't anything amiss in his life," Judy Haug said. "It seemed silly to me. I would catch him in a lie. ... It just, it seemed unnecessary, but I could tell it had become a habit."
While the American Psychological Association has not yet classified pornography as a listed addiction, some professionals working in the field are treating it as such. Psychotherapist Matt Bulkley in Saint George, Utah, treats teenagers exclusively, some of whom have committed sexual offenses and some who are just hooked.
"A lot of times the pornography becomes a coping style," Bulkley said. "It becomes a way that they deal with negative emotions in their life, pornography provides a euphoria. It provides a high, of sorts."
