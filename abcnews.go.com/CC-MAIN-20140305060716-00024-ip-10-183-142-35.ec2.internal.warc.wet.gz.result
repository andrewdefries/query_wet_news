The president of Kenya declared victory over terrorists today saying that despite an "immense" loss of life during the attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, defense forces "ashamed and defeated our attackers."
President Uhuru Kenyatta described a scene of bloody carnage following a lengthy siege of the Westgate mall that left at least 72 people dead, including 61 civilians.
The death toll is expected to rise, he said, because in the final hours of fighting, three of the mall's floors collapsed, resulting in "several bodies still trapped in the rubble including the terrorists."
He said 240 people had been injured in the attack since armed members of al-Shabab, an Islamist terror organization linked to al-Qaeda, opened fire on shoppers on Saturday.
PHOTOS: Kenya Mall Attack He described the terrorists as "craven wretches and lowly cowards."
The president said an investigation was ongoing to confirm the identities and nationalities of the victims and the attackers, and he said officials were trying to confirm reports that the attackers included a British woman and two or three Americans.
He declared three days of national mourning.
Just before Kenyatta broadcast his address, President Barack Obama spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, calling the terror attack a "tragedy."
The FBI is preparing to deploy a full team to Nairobi to investigate the attack, officials told ABC News. Agents are coming from a variety of places but the case is being led by the New York field office, which handles crimes against Americans that occur in Africa.
The FBI investigates crimes against Americans and U.S. interests overseas. The United States offered assistance to the Kenyan government soon after the assault began Saturday.
Kenyan authorities have claimed "full control" of the Westgate Mall as they sweep the shopping center for any remaining terrorists, hostages still in hiding and dead bodies.
"The West Gate Mall is under the full control of gov't forces and we are carrying out a sweep to ensure its safe for everyone," Kenyan police tweeted today on their official Twitter account.
Kenya Mall Attack Survivor's Tale: 'I Could Be Dying Today'
Sporadic gunfire and explosions could be heard earlier this morning coming from the mall after Kenyan authorities said Monday they killed three suspected terrorists and arrested at least 10 others.
Kenyan police said the explosions resulted from their "doing clean-up of explosives that had been set up by the terrorists."
"We have taken control of all the floors," Kenyan police said Monday via an official Twitter account. "We're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish.
A Twitter account claiming to be the terrorist group al-Shabab has tweeted that militants are still holding hostages alive inside and that its fighters are "still holding their ground."
Either way, Kenya's Ministry of the Interior tweeted earlier today, "Westgate remains a crime scene, keep off the area. Roads leading to this mall have been cordoned off."
Terror Group That Claimed Kenya Attack Has Recruited Americans Before
Eleven soldiers were injured in the attack and are being treated for injuries, according to authorities.
The attack began Saturday when 12 to 15 al-Shabab militants wielding grenades and guns stormed the upscale mall and began firing on civilians. Eyewitnesses say the militants were shooting anyone who couldn't prove they were Muslim.
Arnold Mwaghacho, who was working at a gourmet burger bar when terrorists began their attack, was wounded in the attack and played dead so the militants would walk by his body.
"I took the blood that I was covered with. I rubbed it on my face so when they came there they think I'm dead," he said.
Among the dead are Australian architect Ross Langdon and his girlfriend, Elif Yavuz, a Harvard graduate who worked for The Clinton Foundation. Yavuz was eight months pregnant and was working with Bill Clinton's foundation to fight the spread of malaria and AIDS in Africa.
At least 18 foreigners were among the dead, including six Britons, as well as citizens from France, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Peru, India, Ghana, South Africa and China.
President Kenyatta's nephew and the man's fiancée were also killed in the siege.
Al-Shabab, which means "The Youth" in Arabic, said the mall attack was in retribution for Kenyan forces' 2011 push into neighboring Somalia. In response, the group has increasingly set its sights on soft targets like the Westgate Mall.

'Dr. Judy' Doubts Casey Anthony's Penchant for Lying Can Be Cured

Casey Anthony Therapy Will Be 'Formidable Challenge' to a Therapist
Wish said the problem generally develops in early childhood and can come from a lack nurturing and stability, especially from parents.
Casey Anthony's murder trial tore apart the Anthony family with lurid accusations that her father and brother molested her and that her father had a mistress. George Anthony denied those accusations. Casey Anthony's relationship with her mother was also portrayed as strained, with several witnesses saying that the two argued a lot and were often at odds.
Psychologists agree that all of this could contribute to Casey Anthony's penchant for lying.
Kuriansky believes that Anthony might be able to benefit from supportive counseling, but this would be a formidable challenge for a counselor or therapist who would need to be on guard about believing anything Anthony said.
"It's really hard to treat," Wish said. "You can't say it's impossible, but it's very difficult."
"These are people that cannot withstand very much self-examination, but you can work on emotional regulation and helping them understand and see [things] differently," Wish said. "It's a very small rope of balancing emotions and thinking."
All three psychologists agree that it mainly comes down to what the person in question wants. If they want help, they can be successful, but if they do not, it is virtually impossible to help them.
Casey Anthony is a free woman and her next step is up to her, and perhaps her lawyers, but Wish believes, "She still needs something. She can't just be tossed out there."

See More The -- county wastewater treatment plant in Bassett is a sprawling complex this morning workers checking out a blockage reported over the weekend. Made the grisly discovery a human torso found floating in a settling tank. At this point in time but we know it's -- female. Possibly Hispanic. We have no idea at this point in time we have no cause -- death. Investigators suspect the parts found today come from the same woman whose pelvis and legs were found over the weekend at a county sewage plant in Carson. Their theory right now the woman's body was washed into the facilities -- a large sewage -- how we got into the system. Still a mystery but the belief is that the heavy machinery in the processing facility. Dismembered the body at this plant here and industry they do not process solids off solids. Get. Sent downstream to Carson who processes solids and that's why the partial torso ended up in bars. Hazmat crews remove the body parts this afternoon investigators say the woman's left arm is still missing. The medical Examiner's office is expected to examine the body parts tomorrow to determine if they are indeed related to the parts found in Carson. Because this is a sewage plant sheriff's officials say the drinking water supply is unaffected. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
