Forget cats - it's escaped pet snakes wreaking havoc in Florida Everglades
Posted Sat, 12 Mar 2011 16:57:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
For the native birds of the Everglades, keeping an eye out for pythons is an increasing preoccupation. The burgeoning population of snakes, descended from pet-escapees, is seen as an increasing threat to some of the endangered species of Florida's National Park, says a study published in this month's BioOne.

Bad news for bees and us
Posted Thu, 10 Mar 2011 22:03:02 GMT by Ruth Hendry
A new report shows multiple threats to the world's bee colonies, leading to worries about global food security. Scientists are warning that we need to rethink the way in which humans manage the planet if we are to feed a growing world population. Bees and other pollinators are hugely important in global food production and integral to healthy ecosystems. Filed under environmental issues: ecosystems/nature. Bad news for bees and us
Shrimp backs scientists vertical migration theory Posted Thu, 10 Mar 2011 21:31:01 GMT by Colin Ricketts
Creatures that currently live in warm, shallow waters, can often survive in much harsher environments a team at Southampton University has found. A team at University of Southampton's School of Ocean and Earth Sciences (SOES) used the aptly-named variable shrimp to test there hypothesis that as deep sea creatures were killed off by climate change their places were taken by their neighbours in the shallow water. Filed under environmental issues: Migration/Nature.Shrimp backs scientists vertical migration theory There is no such thing as a dormant volcano
Posted Wed, 09 Mar 2011 19:50:00 GMT by Michael Evans
New research indicates that volcanoes long thought to be dormant, can revive in a matter of months. It has traditionally been accepted that once a volcano's magma chamber had cooled down this was the sign that it had become dormant and that it was likely to remain so for many centuries. But research published in the latest edition of Nature casts doubt on this hypothesis. Filed under environmental issues: Volcanoes/Nature. There is no such thing as a dormant volcano

Organic burials: corpse to compost in six months
Posted Wed, 09 Mar 2011 15:12:00 GMT by Louise Murray
Transforming corpses into compost is a much more eco-friendly process than traditional burial, or energy-hungry cremation. Environmentalists now have the option of a clean, green method for their last act of recycling. The promession process of organic burial involves first freezing the body to minus 18 degrees C, then freeze drying in liquid nitrogen at almost minus 200 degrees.

Elephants are commonly regarded as being intelligent but the sheer size of these majestic beasts has made proving that tough - until now. New research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences in America aims to prove that Elephants are clued-up enough to know how to work as a team.Trunks a lot pal!

Losing sight of the real causes of mass animal death?
Posted Tue, 08 Mar 2011 16:15:00 GMT by Kieran Ball
Getting past media sensationalism to discover the real causes of mass animal death. Since last December when 83,000 Drum fish were washed up in Arkansas and thousands of blackbirds fell dead just 100km away in the town of Beebe, the world media has been full of reports of mass animal deaths. Journalists have gone as far as to nickname the phenomena 'aflockalypse'. Losing sight of the real causes of mass animal death?

The invasion of the American north-west by the Tamarisk Tree and its natural enemy; the Tamarisk Leaf Beetle. The Tamarisk Leaf Beetle is inadvertently battling one of the greatest threats to the U.S. water reservesÂ… by eating it. The Tamarisk Tree, which survives by absorbing river water in a sponge-like manner, has met its nemesis in the Tamarisk Leaf Beetle, an insect whose favourite food of choice is Tamarisk Tree leaf.

Eye in the sky watching Arctic blooms
Posted Mon, 07 Mar 2011 16:44:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
A reworking of satellite data is helping scientists track the Arctic spring and summer plankton blooms - that color the sea green as the ice retreats. Understanding how these evolve will help to paint the bigger picture of Arctic ecology as its sea-ice continues to disappear. Vast blooms of phytoplankton take advantage of the nutrient-rich sun-lit waters, starting off a cascade of life up the entire length of the Arctic food chain. Eye in the sky watching Arctic blooms
Why biodiversity really does matter
Posted Sun, 06 Mar 2011 12:50:00 GMT by Colin Ricketts
Super study finds that biodiversity really is worth protecting and could, in fact, be crucial for our very survival. Biodiversity is a green buzzword; something that we should work to protect, but, is biodiversity important for human survival? The answer, according to the latest research, is a resounding yes.

Biodiversity be dammed - plans for Mekong River ignore warnings from failed Thai dam Posted Sun, 06 Mar 2011 11:33:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
The lessons of a failed dam project in Thailand are not being heeded, in plans for a dam on the Mekong River in Laos. The WWF is asking for a 10-year halt to dam projects on the lower Mekong, in order to allow a fuller understanding of what sustainable hydropower projects are feasible. Going ahead now is likely to repeat a ''bitter lose-lose situation.''

Bumblebees: Gone with the Wind? A Major Disappearance
Posted Sat, 05 Mar 2011 16:02:00 GMT by Hannah C. Sarco
Bumblebees have been dying out all around the world for over a century. Now, scientists are gathering alarming news that these lovable, fuzzy pollinators may not be around for much longer if current statistics continue. In the past few decades scientific studies have found that increasing numbers of bumblebee colonies are disappearing. Bumblebees: Gone with the Wind? A Major Disappearance

Greening our oceans?
After the World Ocean Summit, the long term future is not assured. We can hope that the more positive nations move on aggressively, to combat those people and industries who would violently continue their unthinking habits. Some fishing and eating habits became obsolete when so many species, great and small, started to disappear Fantastic ancient fauna precedes mammal evolution
Animals of unfamiliar as well as familiar types took up niches in the ancient ecosystems, as birds and mammals developed and, of course, feathered dinosaurs ruled the roost! World Ocean Summit Report 2014
How can we protect our coastal, oceanic and even little seas. As we don't often travel on water nowadays, we need to figure just how 'successful' our various pollutions, fish consumptions and farming and of course the limited conservation efforts have been.
