Al Qaeda cook could leave Guantánamo in 2012 - 02/09/2011 | MiamiHerald.com
Posted on Wed, Feb. 09, 2011	Al Qaeda cook could leave Guantánamo in 2012

ANDRES LEIGHTON	/	ASSOCIATED PRESS
This June 30, 2004 photo, cleared for release by a Pentagon official, shows a cellblock at Camp 5, the steel and cement cell compound where up to 100 war-on-terror detainees live in single occupancy steel and cement cells. Defense lawyers protested that convicted war criminal Ibrahim al Qosi was moved to the austere maximum security prison despite a recommendation that the complaint Sudanese prisoner stay in a communal prison camps. A former al Qaeda cook who pleaded guilty to war crimes at Guantánamo could go home to Sudan in the summer of 2012, under a secret deal just approved by a senior Pentagon official and made public Wednesday by the Defense Department.Ibrahim al Qosi, 50, is the first Guantánamo captive to reach a war court settlement during the Obama administration. A military jury gave him a symbolic 14-year sentence this summer, unaware of the secret plea deal that let the Sudanese man admit to conspiring with al Qaeda and providing material support for the terror group in exchange for a two-year sentence. He has already spent nine years in U.S. military custody, mostly at Guantánamo.Retired Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald, the senior Pentagon overseer of the Military Commissi

OPA-LOCKA EXECUTIVE AIRPORTMiami Lakes Mayor Michael Pizzi sounds alarm over Opa-locka airport tower closure BY ERIN JESTER The Miami Herald Photos
BY ERIN JESTER
ejester@MiamiHerald.com
Residents of Miami Lakes, population roughly 30,000, want to show the federal government they won’t be pushed around. Miami Lakes mayor Michael Pizzi is urging residents to tell legislators that the proposed closure of Opa-locka Executive Airport’s control tower is unacceptable.Pizzi called an emergency town council meeting Friday to discuss the closure of the Opa-locka tower, one of 189 flight towers the Federal Aviation Administration has scheduled for closure on April 1. The tower at Pembroke Pines’ Perry Airport is also slated for closure. Closing the flight tower would force private pilots to navigate landings without the help of air-traffic controllers, which Pizzi says would spell disaster for the densely-populated neighborhoods surrounding the airport. “Opa-locka Airport is not in the middle of the desert, it’s not in the plains of Texas surrounded by nothing,” he said. “There has been no greater concern for the residents, the churches, the families, the schools in Miami Lakes and the surrounding communities, than the impact of aviation so close to these areas.” About 40 locals, including Opa-locka Mayor Myra Taylor and a handful of pilots, turned up at Miami Lakes Town Hall to listen and speak out against the tower closure.Apart from safety concerns, during busy times Opa-locka acts as a relief airport for Miami International Airport, said Jim Marinitti, president of the South Florida chapter of the National Air Traffic Controllers Union. Commercial airlines usually won’t land at an airport with an unmanned tower.MIA is the No. 1 international freight airport in the United States, said Opa-locka air traffic controller Ken Valentine, who received his layoff letter from the FAA a few days ago. “There is going to be a stress on the system that we’ve never seen before, and we have to be active,” he said.Pizzi called the emergency meeting to gather comments to send to the FAA, which set a March 13 deadline for submissions. Pizzi tried to send his own comments before calling the meeting, but was met with an automated email stating officials taking the comments would be out of the office until March 25. “You wanna talk about the federal government being out to lunch?” Pizzi asked Friday. “It would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic.”In response, he called on Miami Lakes and Opa-locka residents to call and write to their representatives in Congress, and urge them to come up with a better plan to save federal dollars. Pizzi said he’d like to take a petition with 50,000 signatures to Washington, D.C. “It is possible to cut the federal budget without putting lives in danger,” he said. Read more Miami-Dade
