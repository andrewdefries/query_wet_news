Spread on both sides of the steak, pressing the spice on. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the steak and saute 5 minutes, watching to make sure the spices do not burn. Turn the steak over and cook another 5 minutes. A meat thermometer should read 125 degrees for medium-rare and 145 degrees for medium.

By Linda Gassenheimer
This quick coffee-crusted steak with sauteed garlic potatoes is simple enough for a midweek dinner and special enough to serve on Valentine’s Day. Chili powder adds a little kick while the paprika gives a smoky flavor. The garlic potatoes are first cooked in the microwave and then sautéed in the same skillet used to cook the steak, saving clean up time. Complete the meal with a washed-ready-to-eat salad and your favorite dressing.Helpful hints • If grass-fed steak is not available, any type can be used. • Be sure the keep the heat on medium to medium-low depending on your burners to keep the spice crust from burning.Countdown• Prepare ingredients. • Microwave potatoes and set aside.• Cook steak.• Remove steak to rest.• Saute potatoes.• Slice steak.This meal contains 544 calories per serving with 28 percent of calories from fat.

“The Cry by Helen FitzGerald, which was published in the U.K. ... It’s a harrowing novel about a couple traveling to Australia, and their young infant son dies en route, and they choose to cover it up. It’s about what happens as a consequence of the coverup. My hat is totally off to this writer.”
